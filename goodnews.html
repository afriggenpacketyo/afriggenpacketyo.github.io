        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump downplayed concerns about the impact of new tariffs on U.S. consumers, suggesting that American children could be content with fewer toys. He stated that a young girl does not need an excessive number of dolls or pencils, sparking criticism from figures like Senator Bernie Sanders, who accused Trump of being out of touch with working-class families. Republican strategist Karl Rove also criticized Trump's remarks, comparing him to "Mr. Scrooge," prompting a rebuttal from the former president on Truth Social. Trump's comments follow earlier acknowledgments that the tariffs could lead to emptier shelves in American stores.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hawaii lawmakers have approved a first-of-its-kind bill that increases the state‚Äôs lodging tax to fund environmental protection and natural disaster defenses. The bill adds a 0.75% levy to existing taxes on short-term accommodations and imposes an 11% tax on cruise ship bills. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually, which will be used for projects such as beach replenishment and wildfire prevention. While Governor Josh Green supports the bill, some worry that the increased costs could deter tourists, impacting the state's tourism industry.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 13:19:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman has rejected the Menendez brothers' request for recusal in their resentencing case, dismissing it as a "drastic and desperate step." Hochman argues that the defense is unhappy with his stance on resentencing and is attempting to sidestep the central issue. The Menendez brothers' attorney, Mark Geragos, cited a conflict of interest, claiming that Hochman holds a different view on resentencing and that a recently hired attorney in Hochman's office is biased against them. A hearing is scheduled to address the recusal request.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 team Alpine is reportedly poised to replace driver Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto after just six races into the season. The decision comes despite Doohan recently out-qualifying his teammate, Pierre Gasly, for the first time. Doohan has faced a series of incidents, including multiple crashes, while Colapinto's entry has been facilitated by funding from Latin American sponsors. Colapinto previously raced for Williams, showing promise but also experiencing crashes. Doohan is expected to remain involved with Alpine in some capacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners seeking to borrow money may find HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) an attractive option, but qualifying can be challenging. Lenders typically require sufficient home equity (at least 15-20%), a strong credit score (620 or higher, preferably 680+), a low debt-to-income ratio (ideally below 36%), and stable income and employment. Improving chances of approval involves checking credit reports, lowering the DTI ratio, shopping around for lenders, and potentially adding a co-applicant. Homeowners should prepare and understand lender criteria before applying.</p>

          <p>Survivors of a Bolivian plane crash recounted their 36-hour ordeal in a swamp infested with alligators and anacondas after their plane crashed into a lagoon. The pilot and four passengers, including a child, clung to the wreckage before being rescued. They survived by eating cassava flour and avoiding the reptiles, which the pilot speculated was due to the stench of jet fuel. The doctor who treated the survivors reported they were in stable condition, with only one requiring further hospitalization for an infected gash.</p>
