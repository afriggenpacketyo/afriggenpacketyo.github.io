          <p>Millions of public sector workers in the UK, including nurses, doctors, and teachers, have been offered pay rises ranging from 3.6% to 4.5% following government acceptance of pay review body recommendations. This decision comes after unions threatened action over the initially budgeted 2.8% increase. While education unions have welcomed the rises, they caution that school budgets will suffer without additional funding. The government plans to cover the costs through savings from existing budgets, including cuts to temporary staff and the abolishment of NHS England, aiming to avoid cuts to frontline services.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally on Thursday, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, coupled with Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have served as key catalysts this month. The price rise occurs despite a drop in U.S. equities, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value.

          <p>Leadership and workplace researcher Zach Mercurio asserts that successful leaders excel at small talk, using it to build trust and rapport with employees. He says that meaningful personal conversations remind employees that they are seen, heard, and needed, fostering a sense of mattering at work. Without such interaction, remote workers and those in underappreciated positions may feel disconnected and insignificant. Mercurio emphasizes that checking in on employees' well-being and resolving conflicts are more effective than transactional updates sent via email or Slack.</p>
