He emphasized that Putin must not be allowed to change borders by force and called for greater solidarity in financing defense. Concurrently, on Germany's Armed Forces Day, current Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that the nation cannot take its security for granted and must increase its defense efforts in light of Russia's war on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Across the globe, Pride Month is being celebrated with parades and festivals that honor the history of the LGBTQ+ rights movement while continuing the fight for equality. The tradition traces its roots to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal clash between police and LGBTQ+ patrons that sparked the modern movement. First federally recognized in 1999, these events now symbolize both a celebration of identity and a powerful protest for inclusion and human rights in numerous countries around the world.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris claimed a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, describing his performance as nearly perfect and a return to his old form. His lap was over half a second faster than his nearest competitor, Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, marking a significant achievement on one of the shortest tracks of the season. The result comes as a boost for Norris, who has been hampered by qualifying mistakes this year, and puts pressure on his championship rivals, including teammate Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.</p>

          <p>The wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has created a stark contrast between celebrity glamour and local discontent. While A-list guests attended the lavish, multi-day affair, some Venetians and activist groups like Extinction Rebellion protested the event, citing concerns over climate change, capitalism, and the negative impacts of over-tourism on the fragile city. In response, Venice's deputy mayor dismissed the activists and praised the event as the kind of "high-quality tourism" the city needs, highlighting a donation from Bezos to local preservation groups.</p>
