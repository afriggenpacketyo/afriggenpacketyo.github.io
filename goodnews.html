          <p>China has initiated a convention in Hong Kong to establish the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed), aiming to create a global dispute resolution body. Over 30 developing countries, including Laos, Cambodia, Serbia, and Venezuela, have backed the convention, signaling growing Chinese influence in the Global South. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that IOMed will promote amicable resolution of international disputes and foster harmonious international relations. The move also seeks to solidify Hong Kong's position as an international legal and dispute resolution hub in Asia amidst the US's diminishing presence in global affairs, and China's increasing involvement in international organizations.</p>

          <p>China's power grid is now equipped with a quantum-powered "diamond ring" to prevent catastrophic blackouts by detecting grid instability in real time. Designed by the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, the toroidal device embeds nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors to act as a high-precision sentinel for power lines. This safeguard addresses the challenge of weather-dependent unpredictability straining traditional monitoring systems, as highlighted by recent outages in Spain, Portugal, and France.</p>

          <p>Google and the Department of Justice have concluded closing arguments in a historic tech monopoly case, with the judge set to decide how the company should be punished for its illegal monopoly in the search engine market. The DOJ has proposed aggressive remedies, including forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser and license its core search technology. Google argues these remedies are too severe and would hurt consumers and innovation, suggesting lighter alternatives such as ending exclusive agreements with device makers. The case also encompasses artificial intelligence, with the DOJ seeking to prevent Google from establishing exclusive distribution agreements for its AI programs.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to increase rice exports to offset an expected decline in domestic consumption. The annual white paper on food and agriculture for fiscal 2024 recommends exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production. China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have been identified as target markets. The government aims to boost rice exports nearly eightfold to 353,000 tons in 2030 from 2024, and is working to reduce production costs to better compete with foreign-grown rice.</p>

          <p>The German central bank, the Bundesbank, expects inflation to stay on target at around 2%. In April, the annual inflation rate fell to 2.1%, the lowest rate since October, largely due to cheap energy compared to the previous year. Since oil prices have remained low, no major change is expected for May's annual inflation rate. The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) is expected to publish its initial date on the May inflation rate at 2 p.m. Berlin time (1200 GMT).</p>
