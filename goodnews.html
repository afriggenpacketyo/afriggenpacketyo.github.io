          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings experienced a nearly 19% surge in its Hong Kong-listed shares following better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results. The company's cloud-computing unit was a significant driver, showing accelerated sales fueled by robust artificial intelligence demand, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit year-over-year growth. While Alibaba increased investments in China's highly competitive instant commerce space, impacting core e-commerce adjusted earnings, overall revenue still rose 2% and net income saw a substantial 78% increase, boosted by equity investment gains and the disposal of a Turkish e-commerce firm. This strategic balancing act between AI innovation and market growth has been well-received by investors, leading to a notable rally in the company's stock this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The gathering, attended by over 20 foreign leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saw China position itself as a global peacemaker amidst ongoing international tensions. Xi highlighted China's $84 billion investment in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education, aiming to foster high-quality development and cooperation. The summit's discussions, including a meeting between Xi and Modi, focused on improving regional stability and economic ties, with analysts suggesting improved India-China relations could bolster Beijing's influence.</p>

          <p>China is expected to showcase a wide array of advanced drone systems and autonomous technologies at its upcoming military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of victory in World War II. Analysts suggest the display will underscore the People's Liberation Army's rapid advancements in integrating AI-enabled, multi-domain operations across air, land, and sea. While new models are anticipated, experts believe these systems will likely be presented in static displays for security reasons rather than in motion. Officials have pledged to unveil 'new-domain forces and new-quality combat capabilities,' emphasizing the PLA's growing strength in safeguarding national interests and contributing to global peace.</p>

          <p>Young people in Wales, aged 16-21, will soon benefit from a new pilot scheme offering £1 single bus tickets and £3 day passes across the country, with the initiative extending to 5-15 year-olds in November. This program, supported by £15 million from the Welsh government, aims to make public transport more accessible and affordable, encouraging young individuals to use buses for education, employment, and leisure. Transport Minister Ken Skates expressed hopes that the scheme would help set positive public transport behaviors for the future. While similar initiatives exist in Scotland, a recent survey indicated lower satisfaction with value for money for young people's transport in Wales compared to other UK nations, making this scheme a crucial step.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to 50.5, surpassing economist estimates and indicating the fastest expansion since March. This improvement was partly driven by a recovery in new export orders, suggesting resilience in external demand despite tariffs. However, the gains in overall output and new orders were more muted for domestic demand, and employment in the manufacturing sector remained bleak for a fifth consecutive month. While overall business confidence improved, experts caution that the durability of this upturn depends on sustained export stability and a pickup in domestic demand, amidst ongoing price wars and efforts to curb excess capacity.

          <h2>Modi and Xi Meeting Highlights India-China Ties Amid Trump Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met, signaling a renewed effort to normalize relations, potentially spurred by the Trump administration's imposition of 50% tariffs on Indian imports for not halting Russian oil purchases. This outreach is part of India's 'strategic autonomy' policy, navigating complex geopolitical dynamics between its allies and rivals. While direct flights are resuming and visa processes are simplifying, significant roadblocks remain, including border disputes with tens of thousands of troops still deployed, and a burgeoning trade deficit favoring China. The meeting's implications for India's ties with the US and forums like the Quad remain a key geopolitical question, as Delhi balances its relationships amidst global shifts.</p>

          <p>The American Volunteer Group (AVG), known as the Flying Tigers, a group of American mercenaries who defended China against Imperial Japan during World War II, remain revered in China despite current US-China tensions. In 1941, these pilots, mechanics, and support personnel were offered lucrative contracts to fly and maintain aircraft, credited with destroying 497 Japanese planes while losing only 73. Their symbolic fierceness, marked by shark-mouthed warplanes, cemented their legend, inspiring movies and logos. The enduring bond is highlighted by the invitation of the Flying Tigers' founder's relatives to China's upcoming military parade, commemorating 80 years since the end of WWII, signifying a shared historical legacy between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott commented on the surprising trade of All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating he 'wasn’t surprised' given the personal nature of negotiations between Parsons and owner Jerry Jones. Parsons subsequently signed a record-breaking four-year, $188 million deal with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. Prescott expressed relief that a solution was found to the tension, avoiding a prolonged distraction for the team. The Cowboys received the Packers’ next two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark in exchange, a move Jones justified as focusing on the team's immediate and future success.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extensively re-decorated the Oval Office, applying what he calls 'Trump touches' that have led to an 'extreme goldening' of the room's decor. Over seven months, gold trimming has been added across the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, including painted cherubim and an increase in gold trophies and vases. A White House spokesperson stated the gold was personally paid for by Trump. This aesthetic shift, reportedly inspired by Versailles and executed with the help of his personal 'gold guy,' has drawn mixed reactions, with some calling it a symbol of a 'golden age' and others criticizing it as 'vulgar' or 'gaudy.' The changes reflect a long tradition of presidents personalizing the office, but Trump's approach is seen as particularly distinctive.</p>
