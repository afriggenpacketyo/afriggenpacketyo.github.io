          <p>China plans to establish an "international operations centre" for the digital yuan to enhance the renminbi's global influence, according to People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng. This measure is part of eight financial policies announced at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai, aiming to boost the yuan's overseas adoption. The move comes amid growing tensions with the United States over trade and technology, accelerating Shanghai's rise as a global financial hub. China has developed a multi-channel cross-border renminbi clearing network and will pilot structural monetary policy tools in Shanghai, including refinancing schemes and expanded green finance programs.</p>

          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in warmer UK waters as species relocate due to rising ocean temperatures. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt. Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, finding that many could find new homes in biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. The analysis aims to guide the government in ensuring Marine Protected Areas continue to protect species as their habitats shift, though the disruption from climate change could have knock-on effects on the marine ecosystem.</p>
