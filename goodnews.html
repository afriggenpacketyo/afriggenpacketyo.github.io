          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that Ukraine can win back all of its territory from Russia, marking a significant shift in his position on the war. He attributed this change to understanding the military and economic situation, noting Russia's economic troubles. Trump suggested Ukraine could even go further, supported by the EU and NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the shift and indicated the U.S. might offer security guarantees after the war. Trump also suggested NATO should shoot down Russian planes violating their airspace, praising the alliance for increasing defense spending. This represents a change from Trump's previous stance, where he implied Ukraine might need to cede territory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A GE Appliances factory in Louisville laid off nearly 150 workers, mostly Cuban immigrants, after the Trump administration revoked their legal immigration status under the CHNV parole program. The program, which temporarily protected Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, and Venezuelans from deportation, was terminated following a Supreme Court decision. The factory is now facing labor shortages and increased overtime for remaining workers. Remaining immigrant employees fear their Temporary Protected Status could also be revoked, creating uncertainty and pressure on the workforce, with some statuses expiring soon. The factory employees emphasize that the laid-off immigrants were vital to American manufacturing. Optimism is mixed due to the uncertainty surrounding immigration policy and its impact on the workforce.</p>

This decision mirrors a similar move by Sinclair Broadcast Group, another major owner of ABC affiliates, following comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Nexstar stated it would monitor the show's content and stands by its decision pending assurance of respectful dialogue. The corporation emphasized its commitment to local news and programming, noting the show is available on Disney-owned streaming services.

          <p>Health experts worldwide are refuting the Trump administration's claims linking acetaminophen use during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children. The European Medicines Agency stated there is no new evidence to change current EU recommendations for acetaminophen use. Agencies in the UK and Australia also affirmed that taking paracetamol during pregnancy remains safe. International studies, including one following nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden, found no increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also stated there's no clear evidence supporting the claimed link.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office has denounced President Trump's remarks about London adopting sharia law as "bigoted." Trump claimed London has "changed" under Khan's leadership and now wants to implement sharia law, echoing far-right conspiracy theories. Khan's spokesperson dismissed the comments, asserting London is the greatest city in the world and safer than major U.S. cities. British politicians have defended Khan, emphasizing his focus on improving London's infrastructure and safety. The remarks revive a long-standing feud between Trump and Khan, dating back to 2015 when Khan criticized Trump's proposed Muslim ban.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension by ABC following controversial comments about President Trump's supporters. Supporters and protesters gathered outside the El Capitan Entertainment Centre in Hollywood before the show's taping. Protesters expressed disapproval of Kimmel's remarks, while supporters defended his right to free speech. The suspension followed statements from the FCC Chair suggesting ABC could face license risks. Local station owners Nexstar and Sinclair planned to preempt the show's return on their affiliated stations. Kimmel's suspension is part of a larger trend of Trump scrutinizing media companies, intensifying during his second term.</p>

          <p>Pop star Lulu has revealed her struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," marking almost 12 years of sobriety. She sought help in 2013 after confiding in her family, leading to a six-week rehab stay and commitment to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu hid her drinking problem for years, even during her participation in "Strictly Come Dancing." She attributes her alcoholism to a difficult childhood with an alcoholic and abusive father, and the pressure to maintain a "squeaky clean" image. Lulu hopes sharing her story will help others struggling with addiction and break the cycle for her family.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that if the malfunction was intentional, those responsible should be fired. The demand follows a report in The Times, where UN staff joked about disabling escalators to inconvenience Trump. A UN official claimed a member of Trump's team inadvertently hit the stop lever. Trump mocked the incident and a faulty teleprompter during his speech, criticizing the UN's construction quality and past rejection of his renovation bid.</p>

Playing as a lone striker, George scored and assisted in a Carabao Cup match against Lincoln City, helping Chelsea avoid an upset. His performance came amid a series of attacking signings by Chelsea, who had initially deemed him surplus to requirements. Despite interest from RB Leipzig and Fulham, George remained at Chelsea and has now impressed manager Enzo Maresca. This display provides Maresca with a welcome option in attack and disrupts the typical Chelsea academy narrative.</p>

          <p>California is considering a bill to lower the volume of commercials on streaming services, driven by complaints about excessively loud ads. The bill, authored by Sen. Tom Umberg, aims to prevent streaming services from playing commercials louder than the shows they accompany. The legislation awaits the governor's signature. The CALM Act already regulates advertising volume on broadcast, satellite, and cable TV, but not streaming services. The streaming industry initially opposed the bill, citing difficulties controlling volume on all devices, but has since become neutral after amendments were made to the bill that won't allow private parties to sue streaming services for violating the law.</p>
