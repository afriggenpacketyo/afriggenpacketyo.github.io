        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. The project involves the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Eneos Corp., and others. Coastal plants like mangroves and kelp absorb more carbon than terrestrial vegetation. The study will assess seaweed behavior at considerable depths and the environmental impact of such projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon initiatives, compared to 34 tons absorbed by coastal plants in fiscal 2023.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut. Investors are betting on the company's ability to capitalize on the booming electric vehicle market. CATL raised $4.6 billion in its IPO, reportedly the largest offering this year globally. The company plans to use 90% of the funds to build its factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company's expansion into Europe comes amid increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed tariffs on EVs made in China. (not investment advice)</p>
