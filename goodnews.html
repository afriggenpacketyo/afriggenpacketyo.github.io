          <p>Teresa Reveles, the longtime housekeeper for the late fitness icon Richard Simmons, has publicly addressed their close relationship and the circumstances surrounding his death. In her first broadcast interview, Reveles denied rumors that she had kept him isolated, stating they were incredibly happy during his final decade away from the public eye. She explained that Simmons chose to retreat from fame because he wanted to be remembered in his prime, not as he aged. Reveles, who found him after his fatal fall, described him as peaceful and consistently happy throughout the 36 years she knew him.</p>

          <p>A message in a bottle, cast into the Atlantic Ocean by a Canadian couple in 2012, has been discovered on a beach in Ireland, roughly 2,000 miles away. Brad and Anita Squires, who were dating at the time, threw the bottle from Bell Island, Newfoundland, and have since married and had three children. The note was found by Kate and Jon Gay, who shared the discovery with a local conservation group, leading to a viral social media post that quickly reconnected the two couples. The find is being celebrated as a symbol of resilience and connection across the ocean.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Government Reports Unexpected Budget Surplus in June Driven by Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States Treasury Department announced an unexpected budget surplus of over $27 billion for June, a significant shift from the previous month's deficit. This positive fiscal result was largely driven by a substantial surge in customs duties, which increased by 301% compared to the same month last year, following new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite the monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest payments on the national debt continue to be a major government expense, totaling $84 billion for the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago federal court. Prosecutors allege Guzman Lopez was a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, overseeing a massive fentanyl trafficking operation. As part of the plea agreement, he must provide "substantial assistance" to the U.S. government, which could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. His father is currently serving a life sentence, while his brother, also arrested, has pleaded not guilty.</p>

He co-founded digital platforms like UndocuMedia and Text4Reform to mobilize community action and inform people about their rights amid increased immigration enforcement under the Trump administration.

          <p>The widely accepted goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called "Manpo-kei," or "10,000 step meter." While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent research has shown that it is a reasonably effective health benchmark. Studies indicate health benefits, like reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower counts like 2,500 steps, with many benefits plateauing around 7,500 steps. Experts agree that while the specific number isn't magical, it serves as a useful and motivating target for encouraging physical activity.</p>

          <p>Two new books explore the history of Latin America, prompting a reconsideration of the concept of American exceptionalism. Julia M. Klein's review of "A Flower Traveled in My Blood" draws parallels between the state-sponsored kidnappings during Argentina's Dirty War and recent legally questionable actions in the U.S., suggesting no nation is immune to authoritarian turns. Conversely, Carolina A. Miranda's article on Greg Grandin's "America, América" argues that the region has been a pioneer of democratic principles like birthright citizenship, offering lessons for the U.S. rather than just cautionary tales.

          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling with debt, several relief options can provide a path to financial stability. Credit counseling offers structured debt management plans, often with negotiated lower interest rates, making payments more manageable. For those already behind, credit card debt forgiveness programs allow for negotiating a lower lump-sum settlement with creditors, though this can impact credit scores. Many lenders also offer temporary hardship programs with reduced payments or fees. In more extreme cases, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can eliminate or restructure overwhelming debt while providing legal protection.</p>
