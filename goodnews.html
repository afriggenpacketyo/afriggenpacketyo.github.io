        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority in imposing reciprocal tariffs, a key element of his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The court ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred future modifications, specifically targeting tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking. Dow futures rose following the announcement, while the Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As immigration enforcement intensifies in the U.S., the Latino community is increasingly pursuing naturalization to gain citizenship. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) reported over 7.9 million naturalizations in the last decade, with 818,500 new citizens in fiscal year 2024. Community organizations and law offices report a surge in applications since the Trump administration took office. Academics note that this trend not only provides protection against deportation but also promotes civic engagement, particularly with upcoming congressional elections, as was similarly observed in 1994 following Proposition 187 in California.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever experienced their worst defeat of the season against the Washington Mystics, losing 83-77 in Caitlin Clark's first missed game due to a quad injury. Despite a promising start, the Fever were outscored significantly after the second quarter. The team's 77 points marked their lowest score of the season, highlighting Clark's importance to the team's offensive performance. Clark is expected to be out for at least two weeks, and her absence was keenly felt as the Fever struggled to maintain their usual scoring pace.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending legal protections for hundreds of thousands of people who entered the U.S. through Biden-era programs. The judge, Indira Talwani, ordered the government to resume processing applications for migrants seeking to renew their status, including Ukrainians, Afghans, and military members and their relatives. Talwani deemed the administration's termination of these pathways unlawful and potentially disruptive, emphasizing that it is not in the public interest to render hundreds of thousands of individuals unlawfully present in the country.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry due to the export ban.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has criticized Nigel Farage's Reform policies as "fantasy" economics, comparing him to former PM Liz Truss. Starmer argues that Reform's unfunded tax cuts could trigger an economic meltdown and increase mortgage costs. Reform made significant gains in recent local elections, positioning itself as a challenger to the main parties. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that Reform's proposed tax policy could cost between ¬£50bn and ¬£80bn annually, with no clear plan for funding it.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to a key part of his economic policies.

The court emphasized that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations.
