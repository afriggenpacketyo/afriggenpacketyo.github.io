While Zelenskyy confirmed readiness for such talks, the Kremlin's official statement was more reserved, mentioning only a discussion to raise the level of representatives in ongoing negotiations between the two nations.</p>

A key point of discussion was security guarantees for Ukraine, with Trump suggesting significant US involvement and Zelenskyy mentioning a potential $90 billion arms deal. European leaders present pushed back against Trump's dismissal of a ceasefire as a prerequisite for talks, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz insisting it is necessary.

As the latest variant in the Type 99 series, it features an improved 125mm smoothbore gun and a larger turret, weighing in at 55 tonnes. The emphasis on such advanced land-based systems highlights their renewed importance in modern warfare, a lesson reinforced by recent conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed unease about the current state of AI investment, acknowledging that the sector is in an overexcited "bubble" phase with "insane" valuations. While he believes AI's long-term value will be tremendous, he warned that some investors are likely to get "very burnt" by the current froth. Despite these concerns, Altman affirmed OpenAI's aggressive spending strategy, suggesting the company could spend trillions on datacenter construction to meet growing demand. Analysts note that unlike the dot-com bubble, today's major tech companies are funding this expansion with strong cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is making a $2 billion investment in Intel, purchasing shares at $23 each and becoming the chipmaker's fifth-largest shareholder. The move is seen as a significant vote of confidence in Intel, which has struggled to capitalize on the AI boom and faces challenges in its manufacturing business. The investment comes as Intel is also reportedly in discussions with the U.S. government for a potential equity stake to bolster domestic semiconductor production. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son stated the investment reflects a belief in the expansion of advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Zelenskyy Adopts New, More Conciliatory Strategy in White House Meeting</h2>

          <p>An analysis of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent White House visit suggests he learned from a previous contentious meeting, adopting a markedly different and more conciliatory approach. Dressed more formally and beginning the meeting by thanking President Trump, Zelenskyy successfully navigated the discussion, a stark contrast to a heated exchange six months prior. He was accompanied by several European leaders who reinforced the need for security guarantees and a ceasefire, managing to steer Trump's focus despite the U.S. President's initial coolness to the idea. The visit highlights the delicate diplomatic maneuvering required by Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Qwen 3 Coder, an artificial intelligence coding model from Alibaba Group, is rapidly gaining global popularity and challenging established competitors like Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4. According to data from the AI marketplace OpenRouter, Qwen 3 Coder's usage share has surged to over 20%, second only to Claude Sonnet 4. Alibaba attributes the model's high performance to extensive training on coding-related data and the use of large-scale reinforcement learning. The tool's launch comes as the AI-assisted coding sector becomes increasingly competitive with other major Chinese tech firms.</p>

          <p>Coastal provinces in China are implementing new economic development plans focused on the marine sector, aligning with a national strategy to bolster the "blue economy." These plans target growth in emerging areas such as digitalized marine governance, offshore energy, and tourism. For instance, Fujian province is building a massive marine data platform to aid in decision-making and is expanding its offshore wind and solar power production. Since the marine economy was integrated into China's 2035 vision, ten provincial-level regions have rolled out similar marine-focused initiatives to leverage their geographic advantages.</p>

          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to fundamentally realign the league geographically, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues. Speaking at the Little League World Series, Manfred suggested creating Eastern and Western conferences to reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason television slots. This would group teams like the Dodgers and Angels with other West Coast franchises. While the move could face pushback from traditionalists, Manfred believes the benefits of reduced travel and new rivalries are significant.</p>

          <p>An international team of scientists is studying long tubes of mud extracted from the Antarctic seabed to understand centuries of climate history and human impact on the Southern Ocean. By drilling cores from depths up to 500 meters, researchers can analyze layers of sediment that act like a historical record. This "environmental DNA" analysis will help reveal the effects of past events, such as industrial whaling, by measuring changes in marine life and carbon levels over time. The research is part of a global effort to better understand the crucial connection between the ocean and the climate.</p>

This complex operation is the most symbolic part of a broader project to relocate the city, which is at risk from ground fissures.

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has enacted an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug often called "designer Xanax." The action makes the substance a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the state, empowering law enforcement to make arrests for its sale or possession. The move came at the request of Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who is also leading a coalition of 21 state attorneys general urging the federal DEA to issue a nationwide emergency ban. The unregulated drug was linked to nearly 50 overdose deaths in Kentucky last year.</p>
