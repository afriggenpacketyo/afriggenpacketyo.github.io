          <h2>Ukrainian President Submits Revised Anti-Corruption Bill Following Public and EU Criticism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 12:57:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a new anti-corruption bill after a previous version faced significant backlash from the public and condemnation from the European Union. The initial bill was criticized for undermining the independence of anti-corruption bodies, sparking the first major protests in Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion. The new legislation aims to strengthen the rule of law and is crucial for Ukraine's ambitions to join the EU and secure ongoing Western financial aid. This move demonstrates responsiveness to both domestic and international pressure for meaningful reform.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" premiered with an episode that sharply satirized both President Donald Trump and its parent company, Paramount, just a day after its creators secured a new $1.5 billion deal. The episode tackles recent controversies, including Trump's lawsuit against Paramount, the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," and the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. This bold critique highlights the show's defiant tone, as it directly lampoons the corporate and political powers it is now more deeply entangled with. The White House responded by calling the show irrelevant and uninspired.</p>

          <p>The 2026 race for North Carolina's open U.S. Senate seat is taking shape, with Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley and former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper both preparing to run. Their expected candidacies set the stage for a major political battle in a key swing state for the seat being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis. Whatley's bid reportedly has the backing of the White House, while Cooper is expected to formally announce his campaign soon. The development follows Lara Trump's announcement that she will not be seeking the Republican nomination for the seat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters surged, marking it as the latest company to be caught up in a meme stock rally driven by individual investors. The stock's high short interest and brand recognition, amplified by a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, attracted attention on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. This phenomenon, which recently affected companies like GoPro and Kohl's, can create artificial buying pressure as short sellers move to cover their positions. The rally provides a temporary boost for the company's stock, which had fallen significantly year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the science and philosophy behind why time seems to accelerate as we age, a concept explored by thinkers like Henri Bergson. Our perception of time is subjective, influenced by age, circadian rhythms, and the novelty of our experiences, with dopamine levels playing a key role. To make life feel subjectively longer, the author suggests pursuing meaningful activities over simple fun, as this creates denser memories. Savoring moments, both positive and negative, and actively avoiding routine are also recommended as strategies to feel more fully alive and expand one's experience of time.</p>

This beverage-focused strategy could help the fast-food giant better compete with rapidly growing drink chains and drive more customer traffic amid recent lackluster sales. The initial test will take place in Wisconsin, Colorado, and surrounding areas to gauge customer preferences and operational feasibility.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has launched a new political party alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. The yet-unnamed party aims to "take on the rich and powerful" and provide a community-based, grassroots alternative to what they describe as the controlling nature of Labour and the divisive politics of Reform UK. The move formalizes a split on the British left, with the new party expected to adopt policies on tax, nationalization, and foreign affairs that are significantly to the left of the current Labour leadership. The launch has been met with a massive initial response from potential supporters.</p>

          <p>Three British citizens arrested for smuggling nearly a kilogram of cocaine into Bali, Indonesia, have avoided a potential death sentence. The defendants were caught with the drugs disguised in packets of Angel Delight dessert mix at the international airport in February. An Indonesian court handed down a 12-month sentence to each of them. Considering time already served, they could be eligible for release by early 2026. This outcome is notably lenient under Indonesia's strict anti-drug laws, which mandate the death penalty for such offenses, although a temporary halt on executions has been in place since 2017.</p>
