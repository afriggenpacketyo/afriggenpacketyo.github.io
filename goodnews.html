          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco has expanded an injunction preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funding to cities and counties with 'sanctuary' policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The ruling protects over 30 jurisdictions, including major cities like Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles, by blocking the administration from conditioning federal grants on immigration-related compliance. The judge deemed the president's executive orders on the matter an unconstitutional and coercive threat, arguing that billions of dollars in funding were at risk for these communities. This decision marks another judicial setback for the administration's efforts to compel local governments to assist in federal immigration crackdowns.</p>

          <p>Malaysia has announced it will ban the export of unprocessed rare earth minerals in a strategic move to develop its domestic downstream industries and attract foreign investment. The policy aims to compel foreign companies to process the minerals within Malaysia, thereby creating jobs and facilitating technology transfer before the valuable materials can be exported. This decision positions Malaysia to become a key player in the global rare earth supply chain, particularly as the United States and other nations seek to reduce their reliance on China, the world's dominant supplier. Analysts believe Malaysia's existing processing capabilities give it a significant advantage in capitalizing on this geopolitical shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has surpassed the United States as the primary destination for initial public offerings (IPOs) by mainland Chinese companies this year, marking a significant shift in global capital markets. So far in 2025, 46 Chinese firms have raised $16.5 billion in Hong Kong, compared to just 16 listings raising $740.9 million in the U.S. This trend is driven by strong post-IPO performance in Hong Kong, where new shares have jumped an average of 19.4% on debut, and heightened geopolitical tensions that create uncertainty for Chinese firms listed in America. The lingering risk of delisting from U.S. exchanges has made Hong Kong a more attractive and stable option for Chinese start-ups seeking capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Private car park operator Excel Parking has paid £10,240 to a charity after losing a court appeal against a woman it had pursued for thousands of pounds in parking charges. The case centered on the company's controversial "five-minute payment rule," which has since been banned by the industry. The woman, Hannah Robinson, was issued numerous fines for taking longer than five minutes to pay, sometimes due to poor phone signal. A judge dismissed Excel's claim, calling its conduct unreasonable, and ordered it to pay legal costs to the Access to Justice Foundation since Robinson had pro bono representation. The company lost its subsequent appeal and has now paid the ordered amount.</p>

          <h2>Ether Reaches First New Price Record Since 2021 After Federal Reserve Chair's Speech</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 19:06:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Ether (ETH) surged to a new record high for the first time since 2021 following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's annual address, where he hinted at potential interest rate cuts. Powell's dovish comments caught many traders by surprise, triggering a panicked repositioning and causing about $120 million in short liquidations for ETH in a single hour, which further fueled the price increase. This rally reinforces Ether's recent emergence as a market leader, driven by institutional interest in stablecoins, the majority of which operate on the Ethereum blockchain. Shares of crypto-related companies also saw significant gains following the speech. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>South Korean Cafes Confront 'Cagongjok' Culture of Patrons Who Study for Hours</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 19:02:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coffee shops in South Korea are grappling with the cultural phenomenon of "Cagongjok"—patrons, mostly students, who occupy seats for entire days to study or work, often with elaborate electronic setups. The issue has become so prevalent that Starbucks Korea recently issued nationwide guidelines to curb extreme cases, such as customers bringing desktop monitors or printers. While some independent cafes have created "No Study Zones" or limited stay times, others cater to the trend. The phenomenon is seen as a product of South Korea's hyper-competitive society, where a lack of affordable public study spaces drives young people to seek refuge in cafes, sparking a debate about the appropriate use of commercial space.</p>
