        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's policy requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement to receive certain FEMA grants is unconstitutional. The decision came in a lawsuit filed by 20 states, which argued that critical emergency preparedness funding was being unlawfully withheld to pressure them into assisting immigration agents. U.S. District Judge William Smith found the policy to be "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," stating that the potential loss of disaster funds would cause irreparable harm. This ruling marks a significant setback for the administration's efforts to penalize so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with ICE.</p>

          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has unveiled the 12 brown bear contenders for its annual Fat Bear Week competition, where the public votes online for the bear that has most successfully bulked up for winter hibernation. The event, which began in 2014, highlights the importance of weight gain for the bears' survival, as they can add up to 700 pounds before entering their dens. Fans can observe the bears on livestreams as they feast on salmon along the Brooks River. The competition is a popular way for the public to engage with the park's wildlife and learn about the bears' life cycle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying leucovorin, a generic drug derived from folic acid and typically used to treat chemotherapy side effects, as a potential treatment for autism. The drug is believed to help bypass a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain in some children, which may contribute to neurological issues like speech delays. While several small, randomized trials have shown positive effects on speech, larger studies are needed for FDA approval, a process complicated by the drug's low cost, which offers little financial incentive for pharmaceutical investment. For some families, the off-label prescription has led to significant breakthroughs, turning previously nonverbal children into talkers.</p>

          <p>Returning to his show after a suspension, Jimmy Kimmel addressed the controversy over his monologue about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the killing or blame any specific group, but he stopped short of a full apology for his remarks. He thanked both supporters and conservative critics who defended his right to free speech against government pressure, specifically from the FCC. Kimmel also criticized President Trump's calls to have him fired, framing the issue as a dangerous threat to American principles of free expression.</p>

          <p>In a historic moment, Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa addressed the U.N. General Assembly, marking the first such speech by a Syrian head of state since 1967. Al-Sharaa declared that Syria is rejoining the international community after decades of dictatorship under the Assad regime, which collapsed in December. He called for the lifting of Western sanctions, discussed ongoing security negotiations with Israel, and promised justice for sectarian violence that has occurred since the regime change. The speech signifies a major diplomatic shift for Syria as it seeks to rebuild its international standing and domestic stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has called for "realism" regarding his team's European prospects following a draw against Red Star Belgrade in their Europa League opener. A year after expressing high hopes for the Champions League, the team's relegation to the second-tier competition reflects a shift in expectations. Rodgers acknowledged the challenges posed by a difficult summer transfer window, which saw key players depart without adequate replacements, leaving him feeling "empty." He framed the away point in Belgrade as a solid foundation for a squad that is still finding its footing in the current European landscape.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" drew an impressive 6.26 million viewers, a significant increase from its season average, according to data from Disney. The episode, Kimmel's first since his suspension, also garnered over 26 million views online for his lengthy opening monologue addressing the controversy. These strong viewership numbers were achieved despite major station owners Nexstar and Sinclair preempting the show on their ABC affiliates, which impacted approximately 23% of U.S. television households. The high ratings suggest that the political firestorm surrounding the host's suspension may have ultimately boosted interest in his program.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald appeared to take a jab at his American counterparts by stating his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy." His comments came during the opening ceremony amid controversy over the American team receiving payments for the first time in the event's history, with each player getting $500,000. Donald emphasized that for Europe, the competition is about pride, legacy, and representing their flag, not prize money. U.S. player Collin Morikawa defended the payments, stating the money allows them to support their teams and give back to their communities.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece outlines China's perspective on the current state of global governance, arguing that the existing system suffers from three major deficits that its Global Governance Initiative seeks to address. The first is the underrepresentation of the Global South, which needs a greater voice to correct historical injustices. Second is the erosion of authority, as unilateral actions and sanctions undermine international law and the UN Charter. Finally, there is a lack of effectiveness in tackling urgent issues like climate change and the digital divide, highlighting the need for reformed and more efficient global mechanisms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An experimental, one-time gene therapy treatment has shown promising preliminary results, reducing the progression of Huntington's disease by 75% over three years in a small trial. The therapy, called AMT-130, uses a harmless virus to deliver genetic instructions to the brain that turn off the toxic protein responsible for brain cell damage. While the findings are yet to be peer-reviewed, researchers are optimistic, noting that the treatment could be the first to slow the disease's course rather than just manage symptoms. The therapy is still years from potential FDA approval, with larger studies needed to confirm its safety and efficacy.</p>
