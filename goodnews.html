          <p>The Langenhop family enrolled in a clinical trial testing an investigational therapy developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals. All nine patients produced healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections, Kohn said, and are continuing to do so. Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are doing well. Ava plays basketball. Olivia, a dancer and cheerleader, just celebrated her seventh birthday. Landon is playing T-ball. All three are enrolled in public school. Since they participated in the trial, none of them have had to go to the hospital, except for their annual follow-ups with Kohn.</p>

          <p>An order confining approximately 160,000 people to their homes in Catalonia, Spain, has been lifted after a fire at an industrial estate caused a toxic cloud of chlorine. Fire services reported no casualties and stabilized the fire in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫. Authorities had previously urged residents in the affected area to remain indoors. The fire service monitored the blaze for its toxic levels, and the emergency measure was lifted once the toxic cloud began to dissipate.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intent of landing on Venus, made its return to Earth after spending 53 years in space due to a failed booster. The spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere and likely landed in the Indian Ocean, serving as a stark reminder of the Cold War era's ambitious space exploration endeavors. This event highlights the Soviet Union's focus on Venus during the space race, with the Venera program achieving significant milestones such as the first landing on another planet and transmission of alien landscape images. While the re-entry is a unique historical event, it also underscores the increasing frequency of space debris returning to Earth due to heightened solar activity and increased launches, posing potential hazards.</p>

          <h2>New Bill Seeks to Facilitate Cannabis Research Amid Increasing Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 07:00:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), has been introduced to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances, allowing for more evidence-based policymaking. The bill aims to repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that hinder federal funding for research on Schedule I substances. While rescheduling cannabis faces political hurdles, the EBDPA is viewed as a modest but meaningful step forward. The bill could lead to increased research on cannabis's medical uses, appropriate dosages, and the long-term impacts of different consumption methods.</p>

Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA) last week, which would radically ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances.</p>

          <p>In-N-Out Burger is expanding its footprint with three new locations in California, specifically in Indio, Modesto, and Monrovia, alongside previously announced locations in Sylmar, Arizona, Colorado, and Washington. The expansion reflects the chain's strategy of targeting areas with high population growth and capitalizing on brand recognition among California expats. The new stores are slated to open in 2025, with the first location in Brighton, Colorado, already open. This expansion aims to optimize the company's footprint and prevent cannibalization of sales in existing stores.</p>
