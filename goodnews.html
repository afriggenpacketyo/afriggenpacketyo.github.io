          <p>PayPal announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates for both earnings and revenue, prompting the company to raise its full-year guidance. Despite the positive report, the company's stock experienced a slight decline in after-hours trading. Key metrics like total payment volume and transaction margin dollars showed healthy growth, with its Venmo platform seeing a significant revenue increase of over 20%. The updated outlook suggests a strong fourth quarter, reflecting CEO Alex Chriss's focus on monetizing key assets and improving profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing reported a significant reduction in its quarterly losses and a 35% jump in revenue, fueled by its highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018. The aerospace giant's adjusted loss per share was narrower than analysts had anticipated, signaling progress in its recovery efforts. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," citing improved production stability and performance across the company. However, Boeing still faces challenges, including delays in the certification of its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After five days of deadly fighting, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an "immediate and unconditional" ceasefire along their disputed border, following mediation by Malaysia. The truce was met with cautious optimism, though the Thai army reported violations by Cambodian forces shortly after it took effect. Analysts suggest both sides had political motivations for the conflict and that US threats to delay trade talks over tariffs may have spurred the agreement. However, the lack of a third-party monitoring mechanism raises concerns about the ceasefire's long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Mobile network operator EE is set to introduce new smartphone plans in the UK specifically designed for users under 18, featuring tiered levels of internet content filtering. The plans aim to provide parents with more control by restricting access to adult content when a teen is using the mobile data network. However, these protections will not apply when the device is connected to a separate Wi-Fi network. The initiative is part of a broader push by tech companies to make it more difficult for children to access harmful online content.</p>

          <p>As the UCLA Bruins football team prepares to open its 2025 training camp, several critical questions must be addressed for a successful season. A primary focus is the integration of new quarterback Nico Iamaleava, who needs to master the offense quickly. The team must also significantly improve its offensive line, which struggled last season, and find replacements for key defensive players lost to the NFL draft. Coach DeShaun Foster has expressed high confidence, even guaranteeing that fan attendance at the Rose Bowl will increase this season.</p>

          <p>US soccer legend Landon Donovan is stressing the massive opportunity the 2026 World Cup presents for growing the sport in America, drawing from his own experience of being inspired by the 1994 tournament. In a recent commentary, he clarified his criticism of current players for skipping the Gold Cup, stating it was about prioritizing the national team to build momentum and not a personal attack. Donovan believes the tournament, hosted in the US, can change lives and solidify a strong soccer culture, provided the opportunity is not wasted.</p>

          <p>Beneath the Merle Hay Mall in Des Moines, Iowa, lies a 30,000-square-foot basement space known as the "Garden Court," which has been closed to the public since 2000. Originally constructed as a Cold War-era bomb shelter, it was later converted into a commercial area with a McDonald's and a bowling alley. Now, the abandoned space serves as storage, filled with eerie remnants of its past and fueling local legends of being haunted. The mall's current owners are in discussions to redevelop the unique location into a new entertainment venue.</p>

The restoration showcases the plane's opulent 1950s interior and serves as a tribute to the innovation and the tragic lessons that paved the way for modern aviation safety.</p>

This process, which involves quickly killing and bleeding fish, is believed to enhance flavor, texture, and shelf life, while also being more humane than letting fish suffocate. By deploying its 'Poseidon' robot on fishing boats, the company aims to make this high-quality, artisanal process scalable and accessible to the broader American market, and it has recently raised $22 million in funding to expand its operations.</p>
