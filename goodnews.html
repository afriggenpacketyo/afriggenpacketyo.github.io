          <h2>US Mortgage Rates Remain Steady Near Yearly Highs</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average U.S. mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed loan remained steady at 6.76%, near its highest levels of the year, influenced by factors like global demand for Treasury bonds and Federal Reserve policies. Despite remaining stable this week, rates are still lower than the 7.09% average from a year ago, while 15-year fixed rates decreased slightly to 5.89%. Recent mortgage rate fluctuations reflect volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, used by lenders to price home loans, with high mortgage rates and rising home prices continuing to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers. The spring home-buying season has had a lackluster start, with sales of previously occupied homes declining in March, marking the largest monthly drop since November 2022.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, totaling $26 billion, attributed to reduced oil prices and production, although this figure slightly surpassed analyst expectations. The company's free cash flow decreased from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, while cash flow from operating activities also saw a reduction, signaling continued financial strain for the Saudi state oil giant. Aramco reduced its performance-linked dividend payout for Q4 2024 to $200 million, maintaining this figure for Q1 2025, while increasing its base dividend by 4.2% year-on-year to $21.1 billion.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva arrived in China for a state visit, with Beijing expressing opposition to ‚Äúbullying‚Äù of Latin America and unilateral sanctions against countries in the region. Lula stated his intention to establish new partnerships and sign cooperation agreements across multiple areas, noting the visit as a step in the friendly and strategically close relationship with China, Brazil's largest trading partner since 2009. The visit includes a gathering of Latin American leaders in Beijing, as China's imports of Brazilian agriculture products, including soybeans, have risen significantly, and the two countries are discussing infrastructure projects like a railway linking Brazil to a megaport in Peru.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent, according to a report by ODI Global. Between 2010 and 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa amounted to US$66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. The surge in exports of Chinese solar and wind technology to Africa, growing by 153% from 2020 to 2024, is driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
