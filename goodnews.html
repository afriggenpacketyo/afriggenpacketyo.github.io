          <p>Iga Swiatek's dominant victory at Wimbledon marks a significant turnaround for the player, who had been in a year-long slump after her 2024 French Open win. Previously known as the "Queen of Clay," her first title on grass was unexpected, even to herself. Analysts attribute her resurgence to a "new freshness," a more patient mindset, and technical improvements to her serve under new coach Wim Fissette. Overcoming off-court challenges, including a brief ban for a contaminated sample, Swiatek's win demonstrates her renewed confidence and cements her status as a versatile, all-surface champion.</p>

          <p>Global superstar Bad Bunny began his three-month residency in his native Puerto Rico with an emotional and ambitious concert in San Juan. The show celebrated Puerto Rican heritage, blending modern club beats with traditional folkloric dance and salsa. The performance featured tracks that highlight social injustices on the U.S. territory but maintained an overall theme of resistance, pride, and joy. After achieving global fame, the artist has returned home, intensifying his focus on creating music that speaks directly to and for the people of Puerto Rico.</p>

The world number two stated he feels he is returning to his best form after a "lull" following his career-defining Masters victory in April.

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has confirmed that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to mitigate extreme heat. This comes after concerns about player welfare were raised during the recent Club World Cup in the U.S., where temperatures exceeded 35°C. The host cities of Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver have indoor venues that will be prioritized for games scheduled during the hottest parts of the day. The measure aims to address the significant issue of heat in the tournament co-hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's renewed threats of significant tariffs on major trading partners, the U.S. stock market has remained largely stable, with major indices near record highs. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiating style, preventing the panic selling seen during previous tariff announcements. The market's resilience is also attributed to strong underlying themes, such as the unfettered growth of the AI sector and a deregulatory environment that encourages mergers and acquisitions. This outlook suggests that corporate earnings potential is currently outweighing concerns over trade policy rhetoric. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Wahlburgers restaurant chain has closed 79 locations this year, but the company's CEO has clarified the context behind the numbers. The closures are primarily due to the end of a franchise agreement with the Hy-Vee grocery store chain, and the shuttered locations were mostly small food court kiosks, not full-service restaurants. CEO Randy Sharpe stated the move is part of a strategy to focus on "quality, not quantity" and ensure every location represents the brand's standards. The chain also recently updated its menu with new summer-themed items.</p>

They have sent a legal letter to the Education Secretary, arguing that the current guidance, which lets headteachers decide on phone use, is unlawful and fails to protect children. Citing risks of cyberbullying and exposure to harmful content, they advocate for a complete ban on smartphones, allowing only basic "brick phones" for communication. The Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to ban phones.</p>
