          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves asserts that the UK's recent trade deals with the US, India, and the EU position it advantageously in global trade, potentially leading to upgraded economic growth forecasts. Reeves highlights that these agreements, particularly the comprehensive EU deal finalized after Brexit, demonstrate Britain's appeal for investment and business. The chancellor indicates that the government is pursuing further trade pacts with Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, while distancing itself from trade negotiations with China. Some opposition parties have criticized concessions made in these trade deals, but Reeves remains optimistic about their economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old Peruvian man residing in Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture, Japan, was arrested after allegedly driving his car the wrong way on the Shin-Meishin Expressway in Kameyama, Mie Prefecture, causing a collision with multiple vehicles. The man is accused of failing to report the accident after hitting two vehicles, though he only admits to one collision. The incident led to a pile-up involving four vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to four women. Police suspect the man may have made an illegal U-turn on the expressway and continued driving in the wrong direction for approximately 10 kilometers.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's Europa League final against Tottenham is being framed as a pivotal moment for the club, with significant financial implications riding on the outcome.

The club is already burdened with over ¬£1 billion in debt due to the Glazer family's leveraged takeover, making Champions League participation crucial for financial stability and compliance with Premier League profit and sustainability rules.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.85%, the lowest in two years, citing receding inflation concerns. This decision aligns with economists' expectations and reflects Australia's recent inflation rate of 2.4%, a four-year low. While the RBA prioritizes returning inflation to its target range, it also acknowledged the uncertain economic outlook, including potential downside risks from global trade tensions. Analysts predict a further dovish pivot from the RBA, forecasting a terminal rate of 3.1% in early 2026. (not investment advice)</p>
