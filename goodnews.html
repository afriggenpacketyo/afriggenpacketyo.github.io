          <p>President Donald Trump and over 20 world leaders gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to sign the first phase of an Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. The summit included notable figures such as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and French President Emmanuel Macron, though representatives from Israel and Hamas were absent. Trump touted the agreement as a historic turning point for the Middle East, formally signing a document intended to establish new rules for the region. Despite the ceremony, many details about the subsequent phases of the peace plan and the rebuilding of Gaza remain unclear, with Trump suggesting reconstruction would be the easiest part.</p>

          <p>The initial phase of the Gaza peace plan has advanced with Hamas releasing 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for Israel freeing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. This development, part of a U.S.-brokered deal, follows a ceasefire and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops, allowing more humanitarian aid into the territory after two years of war. However, significant challenges remain as negotiations move to more contentious issues, including the post-war governance of Gaza and Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm. The plan also proposes an Arab-led international security force, but a clear timeline for implementation and Palestinian statehood remains undefined.</p>

          <p>South Africa's cricket team achieved a dramatic three-wicket victory against Bangladesh in the Women's World Cup, recovering from a significant top-order collapse. Chasing a target of 233, the Proteas were struggling at 78-5 before half-centuries from Chloe Tryon and Marizanne Kapp revived their chances. Nadine de Klerk, who was dropped on a crucial catch in the penultimate over, ultimately sealed the win with a six, finishing unbeaten on 37. The victory marks South Africa's third consecutive win, showcasing their resilience, while Bangladesh was left to regret several critical dropped catches that cost them the match.</p>

          <h2>Gaza Peace Deal Offers Relief but Lacks a Clear Path to Lasting Resolution, Editorial Argues</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An editorial from The Guardian acknowledges the immense relief brought by the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release but expresses skepticism about President Trump's declaration of a "golden age." The article argues that while the U.S.-brokered deal is a positive step, it offers no clear timeline or mechanism for Palestinian statehood and risks freezing the conflict under the guise of peace. The plan's vague references to an international stabilization force and a transitional administration are criticized as insufficient for addressing the region's deep-seated issues. The piece concludes that without genuine Palestinian agency and a concrete political framework, the short-term reprieve is unlikely to evolve into a sustainable resolution.</p>

          <p>Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk stated he is confident that OpenAI can afford its $60 billion annual bill for cloud infrastructure services, citing the AI company's unprecedented growth to nearly 800 million weekly active users. This statement comes after OpenAI signed a five-year deal with Oracle worth over $300 billion to rent Nvidia graphics chips for running its AI models. Oracle has already begun integrating OpenAI's technology into its products, particularly in its electronic health records division acquired from Cerner. The partnership highlights the immense computational and financial resources required to power leading-edge artificial intelligence systems.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has provided a $20 billion currency swap line to Argentina's central bank to address acute liquidity issues and prevent a potential emerging market crisis. This intervention, the first of its kind since the 1995 Mexico rescue, aims to stabilize the volatile peso and support the government of President Javier Milei ahead of key midterm elections. While the move was met with a sharp appreciation of the peso, it has also drawn criticism regarding the risks involved, given Argentina's history of defaults and the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The action underscores the economic and political stakes for the U.S. in maintaining regional stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Explainer: How Long Homeowners Can Remain in Their Homes with a Reverse Mortgage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 13:06:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash and remain in their home for as long as they meet specific obligations. There is no predetermined time limit, but the loan becomes due if the borrower moves out, sells the property, passes away, or fails to pay property taxes and homeowners insurance. For married couples, a surviving co-borrower can continue living in the home without the loan becoming due. Once a maturity event occurs, the borrower's heirs typically have six months, with possible extensions, to repay the loan, often by selling the property.</p>

In an interview, the actors emphasized that the movie is designed to provoke conversation and debate about power, loyalty, and truth, without offering a clear answer as to who is right. Roberts praised Edebiri's critical role in the film, while Edebiri humorously recalled her nervousness about filming a scene where she had to slap the iconic actress.</p>
