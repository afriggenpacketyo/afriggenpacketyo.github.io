        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury and IRS have released proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, clarifying key details for workers and employers. The new rule allows for a deduction of up to $25,000 in tips annually but excludes workers in certain professional fields like healthcare and legal services. Additionally, the guidance specifies that mandatory or automatic gratuities do not qualify for the tax break, as the tips must be given voluntarily by the customer. Officials acknowledged the complexity of the new tax provision and indicated that further guidance will be provided once the regulation is finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is introducing significant changes to its booking system and planning a new pipeline to attract energy trade back to the crucial waterway. After severe droughts caused a major decline in liquified natural gas (LNG) tanker transits, officials aim to reinstate a preferred booking system for LNG carriers next year. The authority is also developing the Interoceanic Energy Corridor, a 76-kilometer pipeline for natural gas liquids, to free up canal slots and offer an alternative transit method. These strategic moves are designed to enhance flexibility and reliability for energy shippers, particularly from the U.S. and Asia.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, is in the process of raising $10 billion, which would place its valuation at an immense $200 billion. This fundraising effort reflects the soaring investor interest in foundational AI models, following similar large-scale investments in competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. However, Musk has publicly denied the report, labeling it as "fake news" on his social media platform X. The potential funding could be used to acquire a massive number of AI chips and build out the necessary computing infrastructure to compete in the rapidly advancing AI industry.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint failed to meet procedural requirements. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday stated the filing violated a rule requiring a "short and plain statement" and was instead a platform to "rage against an adversary." The judge has given Trump's legal team 28 days to submit an amended, compliant version of the lawsuit. The New York Times welcomed the swift ruling, characterizing the original complaint as a political document rather than a serious legal action intended to stifle independent reporting.</p>

In a social media post, Eisner condemned the "out-of-control intimidation" from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, whose threats to ABC preceded the network's decision. Eisner questioned the state of leadership and freedom of speech, suggesting that political and financial self-interest are now taking precedence over constitutional principles. He concluded his statement by praising Kimmel as a talented and funny host, adding a prominent voice to the ongoing debate over media freedom.</p>

          <p>Sable Offshore Corp., a Texas-based oil company, is facing multiple criminal charges in Santa Barbara County for allegedly violating state environmental laws. The company is accused of five felony counts for illegally discharging materials into protected creeks and wetlands during pipeline repair work. These charges create new legal hurdles for Sable as it seeks to restart three offshore oil platforms that were shut down after a major oil spill in 2015 under a previous owner. The company has denied the allegations, calling them "politically motivated," while environmental groups argue the charges demonstrate Sable cannot be trusted to operate safely.</p>

          <p>A Wyandotte County sheriff's deputy, Richard Fatherley, has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of 50-year-old inmate Charles Adair. An autopsy report revealed Adair died from complications of "mechanical asphyxia" after an officer knelt on his back during an altercation, causing broken ribs and a fractured sternum. The district attorney has not confirmed if Fatherley was the officer who knelt on Adair but stated no further charges are expected. Fatherley's attorney claims his client's actions were reasonable, while the victim's family is calling for the release of video footage of the incident.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Western countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and Canada, have announced plans to formally recognize Palestine as a state, signaling a significant shift in international policy. This movement has gained momentum since the start of the war in Gaza, with 147 countries now acknowledging Palestinian statehood. The moves have drawn strong criticism from Israeli officials, who argue it rewards terrorism. While Palestine holds non-member observer status at the United Nations, full membership remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council, highlighting the deep diplomatic divisions on the issue.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year has led to a notable decrease in mortgage rates, providing financial relief for homebuyers. With the average 30-year fixed rate dropping to around 6.13%, the monthly principal and interest payment on a $750,000 mortgage is now approximately $4,560. This represents a savings of over $450 per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of 2025, which were above 7%. The lower rates enhance affordability for new buyers and create attractive refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners looking to reduce their long-term interest costs.

He believes that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will be a temporary, "one-time effect," leaving room for a more accommodative monetary policy. Kashkari's dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite core inflation currently running above the Fed's 2% target. He emphasized that the Fed is not comfortable with 3% inflation but sees justification for easing policy. (not investment advice)</p>
