          <p>President Trump has withdrawn plans to deploy federal forces to San Francisco after phone calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Salesforce's Marc Benioff. The decision is seen as a political victory for Mayor Daniel Lurie, who has engaged with Trump's administration differently than other California Democrats. This reversal occurs as San Francisco experiences significant improvements, with crime rates dropping to historic lows and the city's economy, particularly the AI sector, showing strong signs of recovery and growth.</p>

While revenue slightly missed forecasts, its adjusted earnings per share of $2.62 comfortably beat the consensus, signaling a potential turnaround for the previously underperforming stock. The company highlighted its growing exposure to high-demand sectors like AI data centers, biopharma, and liquified natural gas (LNG) exports, and raised its full-year earnings guidance, boosting investor confidence.

          <p>The Senate has unanimously passed legislation aimed at making IRS notices for simple tax return mistakes easier for taxpayers to understand. The bill, which previously cleared the House, now heads to the president to be signed into law. Currently, the IRS sends "math error" notices for clerical mistakes, but lawmakers and advocates argue these letters are often unclear about the specific error and the consequences of not responding within the 60-day window, creating unnecessary confusion and stress for filers.</p>

          <p>The German government has announced it will step in to pay the October salaries for approximately 11,000 local employees at U.S. military bases within the country. This measure is intended to prevent financial hardship for the workers, who faced not being paid due to the U.S. federal government shutdown. A Finance Ministry spokeswoman described the action as a gesture of solidarity with the U.S. armed forces, adding that Germany anticipates being reimbursed by the U.S. once its funding is restored.</p>

          <p>A new observational study indicates that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy may experience substantially better survival rates if they also get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Researchers from the University of Florida and MD Anderson Cancer Center analyzed over 1,000 patients, finding that those who received the vaccine within 100 days of starting immune checkpoint therapy had nearly double the average survival time. The effect was most pronounced in patients with tumors typically resistant to immunotherapy, suggesting the vaccine may enhance the immune system's ability to fight cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article outlines several methods for individuals to tackle a substantial credit card debt, such as $30,000, within a one-year timeframe, a goal that requires an aggressive financial strategy. Options discussed include debt settlement, where creditors agree to accept less than the full amount owed, though this can severely damage a person's credit score. Other approaches involve using a 0% APR balance transfer card to eliminate interest, consolidating debt with a lower-interest personal loan, or, as a last resort, filing for bankruptcy to completely eliminate the debt.</p>

          <p>Melanie Winter, a dedicated environmental activist who fought for nearly three decades to restore the Los Angeles River to a more natural state, has passed away at age 67.

Winter was a persistent voice for nature-based solutions and was instrumental in the creation of new riverfront parks, leaving a legacy of a reimagined, living river in the heart of the city.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Commerce Department official has refuted a report that the Trump administration is negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing companies in exchange for federal funding. The denial follows a Wall Street Journal story that named firms like IonQ and Rigetti Computing as being in talks with the government. The report had caused a surge in the stock prices of these companies, as it seemed to follow a recent pattern of the administration taking stakes in industries deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed its planned digital ID scheme will not be applied retrospectively, meaning current employees will not need one unless they change jobs after its introduction. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the digital ID will not be compulsory for accessing essential services like healthcare and is intended to streamline processes like renting a house or applying to university. Despite these assurances and a planned 2025 public consultation, the proposal has faced significant public opposition, including a petition with nearly three million signatures.</p>
