          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore that the U.S. is ready to "fight and win" against China if deterrence fails, emphasizing the need for Asian allies to enhance military coordination and boost defense spending. Hegseth criticized China's increasing military pressure in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, urging leaders to take urgent action. He also vowed to eliminate China's influence over the Panama Canal, asserting U.S. control over the key terrain. Hegseth's statements come amidst rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, with U.S. officials expressing concerns about China's intent to alter the regional status quo.

          <p>BBC Three's new drama, What It Feels Like For A Girl, is a coming-of-age story about a gender-questioning teenager growing up in a working class town near Nottingham. The drama is inspired by the autobiography of trans writer, journalist and trans rights campaigner Paris Lees. The series is a raw, hedonistic, brutal - but often hilarious - tale of Byron, a 15-year-old boy who is trying to find his identity and is desperate to escape the small-mindedness of his home town. The drama also doesn't shy away from a serious crime committed by Liam and Byron. </p>
