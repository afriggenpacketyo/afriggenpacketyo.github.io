          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $10,000 certificate of deposit (CD) versus a $10,000 high-yield savings account in June 2025. While both options offer FDIC insurance, CDs generally provide slightly higher and fixed interest rates for a specific term, while high-yield savings accounts offer variable rates that can change over time. The article concludes that a CD can earn slightly more interest in the short term, but a high-yield savings account may be preferable for those needing access to their funds without penalty. Savers should consider exploring both options and potentially splitting their funds to leverage the benefits of each. (not investment advice)</p>

Chick-fil-A offers seven different dipping sauces, including its signature Chick-fil-A sauce, and customers are experiencing issues with the packaging.
