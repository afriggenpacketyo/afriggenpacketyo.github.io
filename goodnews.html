          <p>Hims & Hers Health has announced its acquisition of Zava, a European telehealth platform, marking a significant step in the company's global expansion strategy. The deal, expected to close mid-year, will extend Hims & Hers' services to Ireland, France, and Germany, adding 1.3 million active customers to its existing base. Zava CEO David Meinertz believes the acquisition will alleviate pressure on the European healthcare system by providing more accessible and competitively priced medications. Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum expressed confidence in the company's ability to scale its platform globally, despite macroeconomic uncertainty, citing the favorable pricing of pharmaceuticals in Europe. Zava platforms will maintain their branding for a few quarters before being rebranded as Hims & Hers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit card issuers are lowering credit limits for consumers due to rising credit card debt, delinquencies, and defaults, reflecting increased caution in today's economy. Issuers can reduce credit limits with little or no notice, even for customers with good payment histories, and this can negatively impact credit scores. Common reasons for credit limit reductions include inactivity, a drop in credit score, high balances, missed payments, or changes in income. Consumers affected by this can ask for an explanation, request a credit limit increase, review their credit utilization, monitor their credit reports, or consider switching to another card. Taking proactive steps can mitigate the damage to one's credit score.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has voiced concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on inflation and the labor market. Cook anticipates that President Trump's trade policies could lead to higher inflation and a cooling labor market, complicating the Fed's monetary policy decisions. She noted that while progress has been made on inflation, the broad range of tariffs could make further progress difficult in the near term. Cook's comments come ahead of the Fed's next policy meeting, where interest rates are expected to remain on hold, and she emphasized the importance of remaining a student of economic history during periods of uncertainty.

          <p>World Aquatics has announced a ban on swimmers, coaches, and officials who participate in or support the Enhanced Games, a controversial new event that allows performance-enhancing drugs. The move aims to prevent the legitimization of doping in sports and protect the integrity of elite competition. Anyone who supports or participates in events that embrace prohibited substances will be ineligible for World Aquatics events, including athletes, coaches, administrators, and medical personnel. The Enhanced Games, scheduled for Las Vegas in 2026, has faced criticism from anti-doping bodies and sports federations, who argue that it endangers athletes' health and undermines global sport.</p>

          <p>Former Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer has won a legal victory by default, with a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordering Lindsey Hill, his accuser, to pay over $300,000 for violating the terms of a settlement agreement. The settlement, reached two years prior, resolved dueling lawsuits between Bauer and Hill, with neither party paying the other. Hill violated the agreement by claiming on social media that Bauer indirectly paid her an insurance sum to drop her countersuit. Hill did not contest the suit, leading to the default judgment in Bauer's favor, which included damages for the violations, attorney fees, costs, and interest.</p>

Top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have reportedly encouraged Greenland to break from Denmark and align with the U.S. for security.

Many millennials are reevaluating their careers, relationships, and identities, and seeking fulfillment through fitness, creativity, and community.

          <p>In this "Dear James" column from The Atlantic, a reader laments feeling disconnected from the world due to their punk rock sensibilities clashing with their mundane, middle-aged life. James Parker responds with humor and philosophical insight, suggesting that embracing this world-weary vision can be a stimulant for life rather than a philosophical dead end. He advises the reader to use their cynicism to sharpen their senses and refine their language, finding joy in small pleasures and helping others. Parker recommends the band Godflesh for music and the TV show "Friendship" for entertainment, offering a blend of nihilism and practical advice.</p>

Some field offices were no longer staffed around the clock, and weather balloon launches were reduced, impacting forecasting capabilities. While this is a positive step, the NWS is still short several hundred positions, and it may take months to fill the newly created roles.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Robotaxi Launch in Austin Faces Competition</h2>

          <p>Tesla's planned robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, is set to occur later this month, making it a key battleground for self-driving technology. However, Tesla faces competition from companies like Waymo, Zoox, Volkswagen subsidiary ADMT, and startup Avride, who are also testing and deploying autonomous vehicles in Austin. Tesla's approach relies on camera-based systems, while Waymo uses sophisticated sensors. The Texas government's relaxed regulations and Austin's tech-friendly environment have attracted these companies. The success of these companies will depend on safety, reliability, and regulatory support.</p>

          <h2>Dollar General Forecasts a Better Year Ahead Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 12:31:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dollar General is upgrading its financial forecast, standing apart from many retailers lowering theirs, as shoppers increasingly seek cheaper options amid economic uncertainty. Sales jumped 2.4% from February through April, driven by shoppers trading down from more expensive stores. While the company might raise prices due to tariffs, it is a last resort, as the chain attracts more lower-income and middle-income shoppers looking for deals. Dollar General forecasts net sales to grow between 3.7% and 4.7% in the year ending on Jan. 30, 2026, assuming current tariff rates remain in place.</p>
