          <p>With the deadline approaching for negotiating worldwide trade agreements, the United States is considering introducing region-based tariffs instead of individual country rates, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The Trump administration aims to strike deals with key trading partners using reciprocal tariffs imposed in April. Bessent indicated a focus on regional deals like "this is the rate for Central America, this is the rate for this part of Africa," while emphasizing 18 important trading relationships. The negotiating leverage involves reverting to pre-pause tariff rates if partners do not negotiate in good faith, impacting countries like India, Japan, and South Korea. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A three-day NJ Transit strike has concluded after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a tentative deal, but train service will not resume until Tuesday to allow for inspections. The strike, which impacted over 100,000 daily commuters, prompted the agency to implement a contingency plan and request commuters to work from home on Monday. The agreement is described as fair and fiscally responsible, reflecting concessions made through a work rule. Details of the agreement have not been disclosed, but the strike stemmed from disputes over pay and cost of living adjustments.</p>

This incident follows a previous suspension in March 2023 over impartiality concerns regarding comments on a government asylum policy. Lineker had previously announced his departure from Match of the Day, but was expected to remain with the BBC for FA Cup and World Cup coverage.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are becoming more severe due to climate change, with the risk predicted to more than double by 2100, according to a new report.

The report calls for increased awareness, sustainable forest management, and the restoration of carbon-rich peatlands to mitigate the risk. Solutions include controlled burning, restoring ecosystems, and educating the public about fire risks, emphasizing that preventing fires is as important as fighting them.</p>

This would allow foreigners to better access yuan-denominated stocks and bonds.

          <p>Nicusor Dan, a pro-European Union candidate, has won Romania's presidential election against hard-right nationalist George Simion, signaling a rejection of more skeptical approaches to the EU. A high voter turnout played a key role in the tense election, viewed as a choice between East and West. The election was held months after the previous election was canceled due to electoral violations and Russian interference. Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Dan and emphasized the importance of an open, prosperous Romania in a strong Europe.</p>

          <p>This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Bill Whitaker goes inside Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral. After five years of careful work to clean and restore the damage caused by a fire in 2019 ‚Äî and to wipe away decades of dirt and grime ‚Äî the cathedral opened its doors to the public last December. It has taken hundreds of craftspeople to pull off a restoration so fast, so meticulous, and so true to Notre Dame's past. On √éle de la Cit√©, they are known as compagnons, a shorthand for the Compagnons du Devoir, or the Companions of Duty.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor, won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. Preliminary results indicate that Dan secured 54 percent of the vote. Simion, who had been seen as the front-runner, claimed that the election was rigged and called for national protests. Dan's victory is expected to ease concerns in Europe about Romania aligning with countries like Hungary and Slovakia, while it may fuel accusations of a rigged system from nationalist supporters.</p>
