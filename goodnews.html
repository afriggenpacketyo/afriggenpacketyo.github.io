          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has officially ended its nearly 20-year-old policy requiring most passengers to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the nationwide change, which is expected to streamline the screening process and shorten wait times for travelers. The "shoes-off" rule was implemented in 2006 following a failed shoe-bombing attempt in 2001. While the change is immediate, TSA officers retain the discretion to request shoe removal for additional screening if necessary.</p>

          <p>A provision to renew and expand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) has been included in a major bill, drawing praise from both Republicans and Democrats. Senator Josh Hawley celebrated the measure alongside figures like former Rep. Cori Bush, highlighting the cross-aisle effort to secure compensation for those affected by nuclear testing and waste. The legislation benefits communities in several states, including Missouri, where nuclear waste has created cancer hotspots. While advocates call it a great first step, they note that more work is needed to expand eligibility.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured a place in the Club World Cup final with a victory over Brazilian side Fluminense, driven by two powerful goals from new signing João Pedro.

The match, played in intense heat in New Jersey, saw Chelsea dominate possession and create numerous chances.

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, on the seafloor of the Solomon Islands. The bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the crew heroically kept the ship afloat and sailed it to Australia for repairs. The discovery was made during seafloor mapping operations, and experts used distinctive details to positively identify the wreckage, offering a poignant reminder of the crew's sacrifice.</p>

          <p>An Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years without legal status was released from ICE detention following her sudden arrest in New Orleans. Mandonna Kashanian, 64, was taken into custody by agents in tactical gear, sparking a community-led letter-writing campaign that drew the attention of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Although she had been denied permanent residency decades ago, she had been allowed to stay under court supervision with regular check-ins. Her release comes amid a nationwide crackdown by ICE, and her supporters are now working to help her pursue legal status.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting approaching, savers are advised to strategically manage their certificate of deposit (CD) accounts to capitalize on currently high interest rates. Experts recommend that individuals first calculate how much they can deposit without needing to withdraw early to avoid penalties. They also suggest shopping at online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. Once a high-rate CD is found, savers should lock it in promptly, as potential future rate cuts could diminish earning potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, reboots the iconic hero as an earnest but somewhat overwhelmed and impulsive figure, played by David Corenswet. The movie skips the origin story and instead focuses on Superman's struggle against a tech-zealot Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) in a world of moral complexity. The review notes that while the film is entertaining and filled with Gunn's signature quirky characters and action, it struggles with sincerity, making the Man of Steel feel more obtuse than naive. The film attempts to set a new tone for the DC Universe but is more confident in its chaotic energy than its emotional core.</p>
