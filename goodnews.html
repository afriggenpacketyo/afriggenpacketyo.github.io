          <p>Hims & Hers Health is set to acquire Zava, a European telehealth platform, to accelerate its global expansion. The deal, expected to close by mid-year, will extend Hims & Hers' services to Ireland, France, and Germany, increasing its active customer base by approximately 50%. Zava CEO David Meinertz believes the acquisition will alleviate pressure on the overwhelmed European healthcare system, as the medications are priced more competitively than in the U.S. Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum expressed confidence in the company's growth strategy, emphasizing the advantageous pricing on pharmaceuticals in Europe relative to the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luang Prabang, a city in northern Laos, has experienced significant economic growth through tourism, leading to a substantial reduction in poverty. The city attracted over 2 million visitors last year, generating $560 million in revenue and lifting 98.3% of its population out of poverty. However, Laos as a whole still faces challenges, with nearly 17% of families living in poverty and struggling with inflation and public debt. While tourism offers potential, analysts caution that not all visitors bring economic benefits to the local population, as some tours bypass local businesses, as experts emphasize the importance of improving agriculture and logistics to achieve broader economic development.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mount Etna, located on the island of Sicily, Italy, is Europe's largest and most active volcano, with over 500,000 years of eruptive history. It is a stratovolcano, characterized by steep inclines and multiple vents, and is one of the best-monitored volcanoes globally. While it has been continuously erupting for thousands of years, volcanologists can pinpoint new eruptions multiple times a year, as the volcano is in a state of persistent activity. Mount Etna poses a threat to nearby populations due to debris and dust, with past lava flows reaching the eastern seaboard of Sicily, but the volcanic soil also supports diverse flora and fauna, making it a natural laboratory for ecological studies.</p>

          <p>Meta has entered into a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase approximately 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. The agreement, set to begin in June 2027, supports the continued operation and relicensing of the plant, which was at risk of closing due to the expiration of its zero-emissions credit. The long-term commitment will help Meta achieve its goal of 100% clean electricity, as Constellation's president and CEO, Joe Dominguez, emphasized the importance of supporting existing plants for sustainable energy solutions. This agreement reflects a growing trend of tech giants partnering with the nuclear industry to meet the increasing power demands of data centers.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung of the liberal Democratic Party is projected to win South Korea's presidential election, according to exit polls. The election was held to choose a successor to ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was removed from office following a Constitutional Court ruling. Lee has pledged to revise legislation on martial law and revitalize small and medium-sized businesses, as he also aims to strengthen the South Korea-U.S. alliance and improve ties with China and Russia. The incoming president will face challenges including tariff negotiations with the United States, as the political landscape shifts.</p>

          <p>Millennials are entering midlife facing unique challenges, including economic instability, career reevaluations, and a sense of not having achieved traditional milestones. Unlike previous generations, many millennials cannot afford the typical trappings of a midlife crisis, such as a new sports car or abandoning family life. Instead, they seek opportunities for personal growth, such as fitness journeys, career changes, or self-discovery. Economic factors, such as entering the workforce during financial crises, have contributed to a sense of disorientation, as millennials learn to accept that their lives may not resemble those of their parents.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, leader of South Korea's opposition party, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election. His victory would set him up as the country's next leader after ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol, and determine the trajectory of South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S., and policies on China and North Korea. Lee's eligibility for the presidency was in doubt after he was charged with breaching election laws, but a final ruling on the case was postponed until after the election by South Korea's High Court. Key watchpoints include the size of a second supplementary budget and Lee's approach to U.S. tariff negotiations.</p>

The move is an effort to shift its image away from the buy now, pay later trend and be viewed as more of an all-encompassing banking player.
