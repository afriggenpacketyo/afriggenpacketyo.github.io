          <p>Warren Buffett announced he will ask Berkshire Hathaway's board to appoint Greg Abel as CEO at the end of the year, marking the end of an era for the company. Buffett, 94, made the announcement at the annual shareholder meeting, surprising many, including Abel himself. Buffett will remain involved, but Abel, currently vice chairman of non-insurance operations, will have the final say on operations and capital deployment. Berkshire Hathaway, which Buffett transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate, just reached a new peak in share value.</p>

          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located on a volcano in Hawaii, has captured a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this instrument will improve the prediction of potentially damaging solar storms that can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) described sunspots as areas of intense magnetic activity that can trigger solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The VTF is considered a technological achievement that promises to help mitigate damage from geomagnetic disturbances.</p>

The safety car was prompted by a collision between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, adding to the race's drama. Max Verstappen finished fourth but was penalized for an unsafe pit stop release, ultimately finishing in 17th place.</p>

          <p>As official research positions are lost to budget cuts, the work of citizen scientists to preserve federal forests is becoming more valuable.

With the U.S. Forest Service facing staff reductions and budget constraints, the efforts of these citizen scientists are increasingly vital.
