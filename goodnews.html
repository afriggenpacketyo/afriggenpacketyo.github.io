          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, set to take effect on May 20, to bolster its private economy. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely watching how the law will be implemented, particularly its impact on firms' ability to sue local governments and its protection against arbitrary fines. The law forbids administrative measures that intervene in economic disputes and prevents profit-driven fine collections and asset seizures. Rui Meng, an economics professor, believes the law will empower entrepreneurs in litigation against local governments, hoping courts will adjudicate such cases more fairly.</p>

The article highlights the contributions and sacrifices of these early public servants, including Firefighter Sidney Frelow and Firefighter Charles Cousins. Captain Nathan Biffle, a respected commander, set high standards at the station. The article also acknowledges the racial hurdles these firefighters faced and the price some paid in the line of duty, underscoring the importance of equitable service to the community.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the legal system's foundational principles. Judge Beryl Howell framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an assault on the independence of the legal profession. The order had imposed punitive measures on the firm, including suspending security clearances and barring attorneys from government access. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has clarified that it is not renaming Veterans Day, despite President Trump's earlier announcement that he intended to designate November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I." White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that it will be an additional proclamation, not a full replacement. Trump also intends to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing a federal holiday or national observance requires the passage of a law.</p>

          <p>Former Trump communications director Anthony Scaramucci advised Democrats to focus on their "purpose" to counter Trump's "hostile takeover" of the Republican Party. He suggested Democrats should open the party to a broader coalition and focus on the culture war rather than policy fights. Scaramucci stressed that Trump understands the cultural battlefield better than anyone and urged Democrats to find their "Wellington" before the 2026 midterms. He recommended Democrats realign as a pro-Constitution, pro-democracy party.</p>

          <h2>Rise in Autism Diagnoses: Increased Awareness or Genuine Increase?</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There has been a significant increase in autism diagnoses, leading to questions about whether this reflects a genuine rise in autistic people or changes in diagnostic criteria. Studies show an exponential increase in diagnoses, but this could be due to broader definitions, better recognition of autism in women and girls, and more diagnoses among adults. While some worry about the "glamorization" of autism, others highlight the importance of diagnosis for accessing support and improving mental health. The article explores the complex factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses and the implications for individuals and society.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made significant gains in English local elections, establishing itself as a major challenger to traditional parties. The party won hundreds of seats, seizing control of multiple authorities and winning mayoral contests. Farage stated that Reform has overtaken the Tories as the main opposition to the Labour government. The Conservative Party experienced substantial losses, while Labour's share of the vote was significantly dented by Reform. The results underscore the continuing fragmentation of the British political landscape.</p>
