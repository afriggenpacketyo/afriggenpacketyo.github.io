          <p>The U.S. labor market showed resilience in April, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 177,000, surpassing economists' expectations. While slightly below March's revised figures, the job growth indicates a stable labor market despite concerns over President Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, and sectors like healthcare and transportation saw significant gains. Economists suggest the full impact of tariffs may not be immediately apparent, but this report sets a benchmark for future evaluations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's decision to freeze billions in federal funding, dozens of Harvard University professors have pledged to take a temporary pay cut. Eighty-four senior faculty members are donating 10% of their salaries, totaling an estimated $2.5 million, to support the university's legal challenge against the funding cuts. The faculty members aim to protect the university, staff, and students during this financial crisis, emphasizing the importance of academic freedom.

          <p>The price of gold is currently at $3,249.68 per ounce as of May 2, 2025, and is influenced by several factors including supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, and interest rates. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty and a hedge against inflation. Geopolitical instability, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies also play significant roles in determining gold prices. Investors should monitor these factors to make informed decisions about their gold investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British oil giant Shell reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit and announced another $3.5 billion share buyback program.

          <p>Roche has partnered with Zealand Pharma in a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a "next generation" weight loss candidate. This collaboration aims to compete with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in the expanding obesity drug market. Petrelintide is an amylin analog, mimicking a hormone to increase satiety, differing from prevalent GLP-1 drugs. Early data suggests comparable weight reduction with potentially superior tolerability.

Despite these economic headwinds, the labor market has been a bright spot, with a robust average of 170,000 jobs added monthly this year.

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, despite a decline from the previous year due to falling crude oil prices.

The company's global production business saw increased earnings due to growth in the Permian and Guyana, while its refining business experienced lower profits due to reduced refining margins.</p>
