          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, ending one of its last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. Binance recently forged ties with World Liberty Financial, a project aspiring to be a crypto bank that funnels a significant portion of profits to entities linked to the Trump family. This decision leaves Binance without major regulatory challenges after a previous $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. government. (not investment advice)</p>
