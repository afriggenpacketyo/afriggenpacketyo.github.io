          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining traction as a "sell U.S." narrative emerges, fueled by Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America has touted emerging markets as "the next bull market," citing a weaker U.S. dollar, peak U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan has also upgraded emerging market equities, pointing to easing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. A decline in confidence in U.S. assets has further bolstered the outlook for emerging markets, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index outperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen consumer groups are urging the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, over their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses the airlines of "misleading" passengers and creating "confusion" at check-ins, arguing that these practices breach EU consumer law. The groups are seeking an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, demanding sanctions for the "illegal" practices. They assert that a standard luggage allowance should be included in the ticket price, but airlines maintain their rules comply with EU law and are essential for managing weight and space.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Markey Carney has stated that "high level" talks are taking place with the US regarding joining its proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system, aimed at countering futuristic threats. President Trump announced the plan for the new missile defense system and said Canada was interested in joining the project. Canada's openness to joining the proposed Golden Dome system comes amid ongoing trade and security negotiations between the two countries. Experts have expressed doubts on whether the US would be able to build a similarly comprehensive defense system, given its larger land mass.</p>

          <h2>Southern California Heat Wave Breaks as May Gray Returns</h2>

          <p>Southern California experienced a heat wave this week, but temperatures are expected to decrease with the return of May gray. Inland areas experienced more extreme heat, with Palm Springs hitting 104 degrees. A low-pressure system will bring cooler temperatures and overcast conditions to the region, potentially affecting Memorial Day beach weather. A heightened risk of brush fires remains due to breezy onshore winds, though recent rains have lowered the risk of widespread wildfires. Another round of heat may be on the horizon next week.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Naval Academy has returned most of the nearly 400 books removed from its library for addressing anti-racism and gender issues, following a Pentagon-ordered review. About 20 books are being pulled aside for further review, including some not previously identified. The back-and-forth on book removals reflects challenges in implementing the Trump administration's efforts to purge DEI content from federal agencies. The directive called for removing educational materials "promoting divisive concepts and gender ideology" incompatible with the Defense Department's mission.</p>

          <p>California's e-bike incentive program, which offers vouchers for purchasing electric bikes, experienced technical glitches that prevented applicants from joining the online waitlist. The California Air Resources Board says the website experienced high traffic volume, triggering automatic security measures. To address these issues, the agency has rescheduled the application window for May 29 and hired cybersecurity and cloud computing companies to manage website traffic. The program has $2 million available to fund 1,000 vouchers and interested applicants must enter the online waiting room between 5 and 6 p.m.</p>

          <p>Tech and music industry leaders testified before the Senate, urging lawmakers to pass the No Fakes Act to protect people's voices and likenesses from unauthorized AI deepfakes. Executives from YouTube and the Recording Industry Association of America, along with singer Martina McBride, emphasized the risk of misuse of likenesses and the need for federal protections. The No Fakes Act would hold individuals or companies liable for unauthorized digital replicas in performances, while excluding certain replicas based on First Amendment protections.</p>
