          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch, and possibly his father Rupert Murdoch, are likely to be part of a group involved in a deal to maintain TikTok's operations in the United States. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as other potential American partners. The White House has been negotiating a deal with China's ByteDance that would place the app's U.S. operations under American control, with a U.S.-majority board and Oracle managing data and privacy.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, former director of the National Economic Council, analyzed the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, emphasizing the central bank's demonstrated independence and projections for two more cuts this year. He clarified that the Fed's action directly impacts overnight bank lending rates but does not automatically lower consumer borrowing costs for items like mortgages and auto loans. Cohn also pointed to recent data indicating a significant cooling in the U.S. labor market, as companies reduce their workforce to protect profit margins amid rising input costs.

          <p>To prevent manufacturing errors like those seen in other major aeronautical companies, the assembly line for China's C919 passenger jet employs a futuristic 'smart factory' system. This advanced network integrates 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect every tool, robot, and worker, creating a unified intelligent loop for data, communication, and control. The goal of this sensing-transmission-control integration is to eliminate oversights, such as missing bolts or misplaced tools, that can occur during manual checks, thereby enhancing production quality and safety.</p>

          <p>Passenger rail travel is gaining significant momentum in the United States, with Amtrak leading a notable resurgence. The national railway company recently launched its next-generation Acela train for the Boston to Washington, D.C. corridor, signaling a move towards more modern, European-style train services. This boom is reflected not only in infrastructure upgrades but also in cultural engagement, as Amtrak has developed a surprisingly popular presence on social media platforms like TikTok, capturing the interest of a new generation of travelers.</p>

          <p>For the first time in almost 100 years, hundreds of swimmers took part in an organized event in the Chicago River, a waterway once infamous for its severe pollution. The mile-long swim marks a significant milestone in the river's transformation, made possible by decades of cleanup efforts following the 1972 Clean Water Act. The event symbolizes a dramatic shift in public perception of the river, which has evolved from a toxic industrial dumping ground to a cherished recreational and ecological asset for the city, now home to dozens of fish species.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a Federal Reserve rate cut that pushed stocks to new records, some Wall Street strategists believe the market rally has further to run. They argue that the current S&P 500, dominated by high-growth technology and communication services firms, justifies higher valuations than in previous eras, with the AI boom providing strong earnings prospects. However, other experts express caution, warning that further rate cuts into a healthy economy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can speed up the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress accelerates this decline, which can lead to health issues. Epel suggests that this damage is reversible through daily practices aimed at restoring cellular health. She recommends simple, sustainable lifestyle changes such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, and prioritizing deep rest to create an anti-inflammatory state and slow aging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 families, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model key behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and allowing children to handle minor conflicts on their own to build problem-solving skills. The foundation of strong social skills is not memorizing polite phrases but growing up in an environment where emotional safety, authentic connection, and resilience are consistently fostered through everyday interactions.</p>

Analysts suggest the agreement reflects a strategic move by Gulf Arab states to diversify their security alliances amid concerns about the reliability of the United States as a security guarantor. The pact indicates that Riyadh is seeking to "put its eggs in different baskets" by securing protection from Pakistan, a move that could also create new opportunities for Chinese arms sales in the region.</p>

          <p>As premium travel credit cards increase their annual fees, a credit expert advises consumers on how to maximize their value. Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy, warns against three key mistakes: choosing no-fee cards that offer poor rewards, hoarding points that can be devalued by issuers, and failing to negotiate with the card company for retention offers before downgrading. He emphasizes that even a modest annual fee is often worthwhile for the superior perks and that users should regularly reassess if their card still aligns with their lifestyle and spending habits.</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing DNA from two 7,000-year-old mummies discovered in a Libyan rock shelter have identified a previously unknown North African genetic lineage. The remains belong to female herders from the 'Green Sahara' period, when the region was more humid. Their genetic makeup was distinct from expected Sub-Saharan populations, showing a deep divergence that occurred around the same time modern humans migrated out of Africa. This finding suggests the group remained largely isolated, and that practices like pastoralism likely spread through cultural exchange rather than large-scale migration.</p>
