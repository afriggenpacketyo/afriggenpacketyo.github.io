        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's top leadership, including President Xi Jinping, is now explicitly addressing "disorderly low-price competition" across various industries, a more direct term than previously used vague descriptions. This new focus aims to regulate market behavior where companies aggressively suppress prices to capture market share, which Beijing identifies as detrimental to innovation, efficiency, and product quality. The government views tackling this phenomenon as crucial for the health of the world's second-largest economy, seeking to guide enterprises towards improving product quality and facilitating the orderly exit of outdated production capacity. This directive underscores a concerted effort to foster a more stable and high-quality economic development model within the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a surprising NBA free agency development, Myles Turner is set to join the Milwaukee Bucks on a four-year, $107 million contract, while the Bucks have waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard. This move allows the Bucks to acquire Turner, a longtime Indiana Pacers stalwart, by stretching Lillard's remaining $112.6 million contract over five seasons. Both players' recent Achilles tendon injuries played a role, with Lillard likely missing most of the coming season, giving him time to recover and choose his next team. The first full day of free agency also saw other significant agreements, including Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's record-setting extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder and various other player movements across the league.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "big beautiful bill," recently passed by the Senate, proposes a significant increase in tax credits for semiconductor manufacturers in the U.S., raising them from 25% to 35%. This provision aims to further incentivize domestic chip production for major companies like Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Micron Technology, building upon the existing CHIPS and Science Act. The legislation still requires passage in the House before a July 4 deadline. Experts suggest that the threat of Trump's tariffs has already created urgency for onshoring efforts, and these expanded investment tax credits are expected to accelerate the expansion of U.S. chip manufacturing capacity.

          <p>Copper is rapidly emerging as a crucial element for the global green energy transition, prompting China to strategically enhance its supply security, particularly from Africa. Beijing is making substantial investments in mining and processing facilities across countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and Botswana. This aggressive positioning comes as Western nations, including Canada, implement policies restricting Chinese acquisition of critical mineral assets.
