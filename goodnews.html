          <h2>Experts Discuss Factors That Could Cause Gold Prices to Decrease</h2>

          <p>Gold prices have recently surged, reaching $3,400 per ounce in April, driven by investor confidence amid inflation and global tensions. Experts suggest that several scenarios could lead to a price decline, including investors taking profits, a stronger U.S. dollar, economic recovery reducing safe-haven demand, cooling political tensions, a breakout equity market rally, and deflationary pressure. Despite potential drops, experts advise that investing in gold should be viewed as a long-term strategy for financial protection against debt and currency erosion. The article emphasizes that timing the market is difficult and long-term returns are generally better. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill introduced in Parliament in England and Wales proposes adding up to two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. This measure aims to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions, addressing the pain caused to victims' families when offenders are absent. The bill follows campaigns by families of victims whose killers refused to attend sentencing, and it also grants judges additional powers to punish disruptive offenders. The new measures would apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who attend proceedings but are removed from court for disruptive behaviour.</p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts to NASA by the Trump administration, which prioritize Mars missions over lunar programs, are causing concern for the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher emphasized the importance of cooperation in space activities and said ESA will assess the impact of the proposed NASA budget. The cuts could threaten major science projects and the work of researchers globally, potentially affecting international collaborations where Europe is a key partner. The budget shifts focus toward Mars, potentially favoring SpaceX's Starship program over NASA's Space Launch System.</p>
