          <p>England spinner Tom Hartley is set to return to international cricket in the one-day international series against West Indies, while also managing his family's garden center. Hartley, whose father won a European Championship gold in 1974, balances his cricket career with early morning shifts at Hartley's Nurseries, a sixth-generation family business. He believes his responsibilities at the garden center help him stay grounded and relieve pressure during his cricket career. The garden center is located outside of Liverpool, and Tom is expected to take over the business one day.</p>

          <p>Twenty companies have applied to purchase a total of 110,000 tons of the Japanese government's stockpiled rice following revisions to the scheme aimed at curbing soaring prices. This amount represents over 30% of the 300,000 tons slated for release through direct sales contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi indicated that contracts would be finalized quickly, with deliveries potentially starting soon. The move comes as supermarket rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, despite previous government efforts to lower costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study by Chinese scientists has revived the long-dismissed evolutionary theory of Lamarckism, demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. The research, published in Cell, showed that rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on a tolerance to low temperatures across multiple generations through DNA methylation changes. This challenges the core principles of Darwinism, which emphasize random genetic mutations as the primary driver of evolution. The study suggests that environmentally induced epigenetic variations can contribute to the inheritance of acquired characteristics, positioning Lamarckism as a significant factor in evolution.</p>

          <p>Formula 1's new rule requiring two pit stops at the Monaco Grand Prix aimed to increase strategic options and excitement, but it had limited impact on the race outcome. Teams used strategic maneuvers, like Racing Bulls backing up the pack, to benefit their drivers. Drivers expressed discomfort with these tactics, and the rule change also made exploiting the red-flag tire-change rule easier. The underlying issue remains the difficulty of overtaking at Monaco, leading to questions about the effectiveness of artificial gimmicks to fix the unfixable.</p>
