          <p>AI-powered virtual YouTubers, or VTubers, are rapidly gaining popularity and generating substantial revenue, with virtual personalities like Bloo amassing millions of subscribers and views. While many VTubers are currently "puppeteered" by humans, AI technology from platforms like ElevenLabs and OpenAI handles significant aspects of content creation, with the ultimate aim of full AI automation. This burgeoning trend, driven by advancements in generative AI, is reshaping how content is made and shared online, enabling high-quality video production without traditional cameras or actors. However, this evolution also sparks concerns about the proliferation of low-effort "AI slop" and the increasing difficulty for users to distinguish human-made content from artificial intelligence-generated material.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, which includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports to the U.S. and a 40% tariff on goods transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, specifically targeting circumvention tactics. In return, Vietnam has agreed to grant the United States "TOTAL ACCESS" to its markets, allowing U.S. products to be sold there at zero tariff, a move described as unprecedented for Vietnam. This agreement, unveiled shortly before the expiration of a 90-day pause on many reciprocal tariffs, aims to address trade imbalances and protect American industries. The S&P 500 saw a slight rise following news of the deal, though some apparel companies reliant on Vietnamese manufacturing may face higher import costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are strongly recommending Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts as a strategic savings option for July 2025, especially for individuals with substantial savings like $20,000. Opening a CD now can effectively protect funds against anticipated future interest rate cuts by locking in current high rates, which are typically between 4% and 5%. This allows savers to earn significant and predictable interest over fixed terms, such as six or eighteen months, avoiding the volatility of variable-rate accounts. Moreover, a CD provides a stable environment for money growth, offering individuals valuable time to consider their next financial moves and gain a deeper understanding of the evolving economic landscape without sacrificing earning potential.

          <p>British and Irish Lions full-back Elliot Daly is undergoing an X-ray after sustaining a forearm injury during the team's victory over the Queensland Reds, raising concerns for the upcoming Test series. The versatile 32-year-old, who had been in strong form and made his first Test start at full-back in four years in March, was a late addition to the starting lineup for the Reds game. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed hope for Daly's swift recovery, especially with the first Test match just three and a half weeks away. Despite this setback, Farrell remains confident in the team's full-back depth, noting that other key players like Hugo Keenan and Blair Kinghorn are nearing their return to the field.</p>

The team will focus on a "visual anomaly" identified in satellite and other imagery within a lagoon at Nikumaroro, an island previously known as Gardner Island. This ambitious effort aims to finally resolve the 88-year-old mystery of Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan's disappearance during their attempted circumnavigation of the world. If the "Taraia Object" is confirmed as the aircraft, further excavations are planned for next year with the ultimate goal of returning the remains of the plane to Purdue University, which had helped fund her historic flight.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani proposes building a network of municipally owned, affordable grocery stores across the city's five boroughs. These non-profit stores would aim to combat "price gouging" by selling food at wholesale cost, potentially funded by taxing the wealthy, and would mark a first for a U.S. city of New York's size. While two-thirds of New Yorkers support the idea, critics question its economic feasibility and impact, as limited precedents in smaller rural towns have shown mixed results, struggling with profitability and operational challenges. The proposal is viewed as a $60 million experiment, with uncertain outcomes regarding its ability to truly address food affordability and health disparities in a dense urban environment where cost, not proximity, is the primary barrier to food access.</p>

Skeletal markings strongly suggested his profession as a potter, while genetic ancestry showed a mix of 80% North African and 20% Fertile Crescent origins, highlighting a significant mixing of groups during this time.

          <p>As U.S. auto insurance costs have surged by a staggering 51% over the last three years due to widespread inflation, increased auto repair prices, and other factors, many drivers are actively seeking ways to lower their premiums without compromising security. Experts suggest several effective strategies, including maximizing available discounts for anti-theft devices, paperless policies, or specific professions. Bundling multiple insurance policies with a single provider, such as auto and home insurance, can also lead to substantial savings. Additionally, reviewing and adjusting coverage, like dropping collision and comprehensive on older, significantly depreciated vehicles, or raising deductibles, can reduce costs. Updating mileage with your insurer and improving credit scores are further avenues for potential savings in this competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Australian domestic flight was delayed for two hours after a stowaway snake was discovered in the plane's cargo hold as passengers were boarding, causing a momentary scare. The snake, identified as a harmless 2-foot green tree snake, initially appeared dangerous to the snake catcher called to the scene, who warned airline staff of a potential evacuation if it managed to disappear deeper into the aircraft's panels. The incident occurred on a Virgin Australia flight from Melbourne to Brisbane. Officials suspect the protected species came aboard inside a passenger's luggage during a previous flight. Due to quarantine regulations, the snake cannot be returned to the wild and has since been given to a Melbourne veterinarian to find a suitable home with a licensed snake keeper.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin's Supreme Court, with its liberal majority, has struck down the state's 176-year-old abortion ban, ruling 4-3 that it was superseded by a newer state law criminalizing abortions only after fetal viability. The 1849 ban had been nullified by Roe v. Wade in 1973 and conservatives argued its reactivation after Roe's overturn in 2022. Attorney General Josh Kaul's lawsuit successfully contended that a 1985 law, permitting abortions until viability, took precedence, defining the older ban as outlawing feticide, not consensual abortions. This decision provides greater certainty for abortion providers and patients in Wisconsin, ensuring the procedure remains legal in the state following a period of legal ambiguity.</p>

Taiwan is actively developing its "non-red" supply chain as part of its defense strategy against a potential Chinese invasion, focusing on critical components like motors, chips, and system integration experience. While Germany acknowledges its overall reliance on Chinese drones, it aims to diversify key, high-risk components, making Taiwan's advanced chip manufacturing and IT sector a strategic partner in enhancing supply chain security.</p>

          <p>After record-breaking June temperatures and a scorching start to July, cooler weather conditions have finally set in across the UK, bringing welcome relief from heatwave conditions. While Tuesday marked the hottest day of the year at 34.7C in London, temperatures for the coming week are expected to be significantly lower, ranging from mid-teens to mid-20s, with Friday potentially seeing highs of 27-28C in the far south-east. Some rainfall is anticipated over the next five days, primarily in the north-west of the British Isles, which is welcome given the driest spring on record and ongoing drought conditions in parts of England. Despite the immediate cooling, scientists emphasize that heatwaves are becoming more frequent and hotter due to climate change.</p>
