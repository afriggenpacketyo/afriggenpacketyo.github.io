          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a post-Brexit reset deal, aiming to improve relations after Britain's departure from the bloc in 2020. The agreement, reached during a summit in London, includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. This deal seeks to address trade frictions, potentially involving a role for the European Court of Justice in resolving disputes and increased cooperation on energy policy. The agreement comes amid a shift toward U.S. isolationism, prompting the UK and EU to strengthen their partnership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by ¬£129 annually, a decrease of nearly 7%. This reduction would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to ¬£1,720, down from the current level of ¬£1,849. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, so usage still affects the total bill.</p>

          <p>The liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, has won the Romanian presidency after a tense race against a right-wing nationalist. George Simion, leader of the far-right AUR party, initially won the first round, fueled by anger over the annulled presidential race. Dan secured victory with 53.6% of the vote, emphasizing the need to build Romania together, irrespective of voting preferences. Romanians are broadly dissatisfied with mainstream parties, and this election followed the collapse of the government after its candidate failed to make the second round.</p>
