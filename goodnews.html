        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK government minister is actively pursuing a deal with the EU that would allow British passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queues and improve travel efficiency. This push comes ahead of the first UK-EU summit since Brexit, where trade and security agreements are also on the agenda. However, some Conservative MPs express concerns about the UK becoming a 'rule taker' by aligning with EU standards, particularly regarding food and trade regulations. The minister also addressed ongoing negotiations regarding youth mobility and plans to reduce red tape to lower food prices.</p>

          <p>Two volumes of the 2,300-year-old Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, considered the oldest ancient classics found in China, have been repatriated to Beijing from the United States after 79 years abroad.

The repatriation followed diplomatic efforts by the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China, leveraging the Smithsonian's new ethical returns policy.

          <p>Surgeons in Southern California have successfully performed the first human bladder transplant, offering a potential life-changing treatment for patients with debilitating bladder conditions. The operation, conducted on a 41-year-old man who had lost bladder capacity due to cancer treatments, represents a significant advancement in transplant medicine. The clinical trial aims to assess bladder capacity and graft complications before expanding the procedure's use, potentially benefiting thousands with pelvic pain, inflammation, and recurrent infections. While experts acknowledge the technical achievement, they also caution about the risks of organ rejection and the need for immunosuppression.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay reflects on the career of Desi Arnaz and his impact on Hollywood, emphasizing his efforts to break racial barriers and promote diversity in the entertainment industry. Seventy-five years ago, Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, convinced CBS to cast him as Lucille Ball's husband in 'I Love Lucy,' challenging the network's belief that audiences wouldn't accept a Latino actor in the role. The show's success not only revolutionized television but also paved the way for greater representation of Latino stories and talent in popular culture. Arnaz's story serves as an example of how embracing diversity can lead to innovation and success.</p>

          <p>California is mounting a multi-pronged defense against federal actions that threaten its climate progress, including litigation and legislation. As the federal government initiates policies detrimental to the environment, California is pushing back through lawsuits challenging actions such as the declaration of a national energy emergency and attempts to freeze funding for environmental programs. The state is also leveraging its legislative strength, with laws requiring corporations to disclose their carbon emissions and a bill that would require fossil fuel polluters to pay for climate-related damages. Despite the challenges, California remains committed to its ambitious climate goals and is determined to protect its environmental leadership.</p>
