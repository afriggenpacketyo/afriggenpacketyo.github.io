          <p>Elon Musk has publicly expressed regret for some of his social media posts criticizing President Donald Trump, acknowledging they "went too far." This reconciliation attempt follows an explosive public dispute between the two figures, dissolving a close partnership that had seen Musk spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump's administration. The feud, sparked by Musk's opposition to Trump's tax and spending bill, had fueled market concerns over Tesla and SpaceX, with Tesla shares initially taking a significant hit. Trump had previously warned of consequences if Musk supported Democratic candidates, but later indicated a willingness to speak with him. The reconciliation could ease market anxieties surrounding Musk's ventures. Optimism remains cautious as the potential long-term implications of their renewed relationship are still unknown.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along the border with North Korea, aiming to reduce military confrontation and foster mutual trust. This decision by President Lee Jae Myung's administration seeks to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts had resumed in June of the previous year under Lee's predecessor in response to North Korea's launch of waste-carrying balloons into the South. The Unification Ministry has also urged activists to halt leaflet distribution, citing heightened tensions and risks to residents in border areas. These actions reflect a shift towards a more pragmatic approach in inter-Korean relations.</p>
