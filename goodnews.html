          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills has officially entered the Democratic primary to challenge Republican Senator Susan Collins in an upcoming election. Mills, a two-term governor, is positioning herself as a candidate who can stand up to former President Trump, citing a past confrontation as a key motivator for her run. Her entry sets up a potentially contentious primary against more progressive candidates who are critical of the Democratic establishment. The race is considered a significant challenge for Democrats, as they have not won a Senate seat in Maine since 1988.</p>

          <p>Following claims made by the Trump administration linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) to autism, medical professionals are debunking the assertions as misinformation. This article addresses and refutes three specific claims: that Amish children do not get autism due to avoiding Tylenol, that pregnant women are taking toxic doses in protest, and that young children should not be given the drug. Doctors and researchers clarify that there is no scientific evidence to support these links, emphasizing that Tylenol remains the safest pain and fever reducer for pregnant women when used as directed.</p>

          <p>China's military is training soldiers to use an ancient mental calculation technique, effectively turning them into "human abacuses," to ensure operational capability during high-stakes combat scenarios where advanced technology might fail. A recent state broadcast showcased a drill where a soldier, using only mental math and analog tools, accurately predicted the trajectories of three targets within seconds after a simulated radar failure. This training highlights a strategic focus on developing human-based backup systems to maintain precision and effectiveness in the event of electronic warfare or equipment malfunctions. The promotion of these skills aims to bolster national confidence in military readiness.</p>

The investment, led by Fidelity, will be used to accelerate innovation and expand the company's global presence in the competitive wearables market. Oura has sold over 5.5 million rings since its launch and reported revenue exceeding $500 million in 2024, with projections to reach $1 billion this year.

          <p>California has passed a series of new laws aimed at protecting children online amidst growing concerns over artificial intelligence and social media. One landmark bill requires AI chatbots to disclose they are not human and to prompt minors to take breaks, while also implementing safeguards against harmful behaviors. Other legislation mandates social media platforms to add mental health risk warnings and increases penalties for the distribution of deepfake pornography. The new rules also require device makers like Apple and Google to implement age verification tools in their app stores, reflecting a broader push for greater accountability from Big Tech.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in economics has been co-awarded to economic historian Joel Mokyr for his research explaining the drivers of sustained economic growth. Mokyr's work centers on why the Industrial Revolution began in Britain around 1800, attributing it to the practical application of Enlightenment-era scientific breakthroughs by a skilled class of mechanics and entrepreneurs. He argues that Britain's political institutions were more open to the "creative destruction" unleashed by new technologies. The prize is shared with Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt, who developed mathematical models centered on this concept of new innovations replacing outdated ones.</p>

          <p>A new drug named lenacapavir is being hailed as a potential game-changer for HIV prevention, offering near-100% protection through a simple injection administered just twice a year. This breakthrough could overcome major hurdles associated with daily pills like PrEP, such as adherence issues and stigma. The drug has been approved by the FDA and endorsed by the WHO, and the Trump administration plans to make it a centerpiece of its global health strategy, aiming for a rapid rollout in low-income countries. However, its ultimate impact will depend on overcoming political challenges and ensuring equitable access for all at-risk populations.</p>

The book, recognized as the best German-language novel of the year, follows a theater group's journey into the South American rainforest to investigate the disappearance of two Dutch backpackers.

          <p>A West Palm Beach psychiatrist is emphasizing the strong connection between breast health, hormonal fluctuations, and women's mental well-being. The article explains that hormones like estrogen and progesterone, which influence breast tissue, also significantly impact brain chemistry, affecting mood, focus, and anxiety. Breast cancer treatments, such as tamoxifen, can induce an abrupt, "instant menopause" by shutting down estrogen, leading to side effects like cognitive fog and depression that are often overlooked. The psychiatrist urges women to treat their mental health with the same vigilance as their physical health and to advocate for themselves with doctors.</p>
