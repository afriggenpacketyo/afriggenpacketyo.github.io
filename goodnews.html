Falling prices at the pump could alleviate some of the strain on family budgets, though experts note that prices for other goods haven't decreased significantly.

Gold prices have recently dipped, presenting an accessible entry point for new investors.

It's important to view gold as a long-term hedge rather than a quick gain and to be cautious of scams and high premiums by doing thorough research. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Antonio Villaraigosa has voiced strong criticism of Kamala Harris, suggesting she is out of touch with everyday voters, and has challenged her to a debate. Villaraigosa accuses Harris and Xavier Becerra of covering up President Biden’s cognitive decline. He is positioning himself as the most vocal and assertive of Harris’s potential gubernatorial rivals, criticizing what he perceives as a disconnect from Democratic tradition. </p>

          <p>Southern California Edison will pay $82.5 million to cover costs and damages from the 2020 Bobcat fire, in what officials are calling a record settlement for one of the largest blazes in Los Angeles County. Federal officials allege the fire was caused by trees contacting power lines. The settlement comes as Edison seeks to raise customer rates to pay for wildfire mitigation. The fire destroyed numerous homes and had a harmful impact on habitats and wildlife. </p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Rejects Religious Charter School, but Vouchers May Expand Religious Education</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 14:50:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Supreme Court ruling blocked a religious charter school in Oklahoma, but conservatives may still achieve their goals through a school voucher program passed by the House. The legislation sets aside $5 billion to fund vouchers for private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning, potentially benefiting religious education. The program is structured as a tax credit, offering a significant tax break to wealthy donors. While voucher advocates initially focused on low-income students, they are now pushing for vouchers for most everyone. </p>

          <h2>GOP Tax Bill Could Impact Overtime and Tipped Workers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 14:49:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican-backed budget bill includes new tax rules that could significantly impact workers who earn tips or overtime pay. The bill aims to eliminate taxes on tipped income and provide a tax break for overtime earnings, but restrictions and limitations could affect the financial benefits for some workers. The "No Tax on Tips" provision would create a new tax deduction for eligible tipped workers, but only those earning less than $160,000 would qualify. A separate Senate bill focused solely on tipped workers has bipartisan support and is set to be voted on in the House. (not investment advice)</p>
