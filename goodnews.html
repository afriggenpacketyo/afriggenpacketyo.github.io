          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez recently celebrated their wedding in Venice, Italy, drawing a high-profile guest list that included numerous celebrities and business leaders. The lavish, multi-day festivities were attended by figures such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates, who arrived via water taxis for the various events. While the couple and their guests celebrated, the event also sparked the "No Space for Bezos" campaign, with local residents protesting the influx of extreme wealth and over-tourism. Activists argue such events exacerbate rising costs and overcrowding, but the celebrations proceeded as planned amidst the controversy.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent details a personal journey into phage therapy, a century-old medical concept now being revisited as a weapon against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The process involves finding bacteriophages, viruses that specifically target and kill bacteria, in environments like sewage. In a demonstration at the University of Southampton, a phage collected from the journalist's toilet successfully destroyed a persistent urinary tract infection in a lab setting. Researchers are hopeful this method can be developed into a viable treatment for infections, although it is still in the early stages of regulatory approval and clinical application.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a national parliamentary election, the Japanese government has formally requested that major social media platform operators take action against the spread of harmful online content. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is focused on preventing disinformation and defamatory posts targeting political candidates. This move comes as both ruling and opposition parties acknowledge the need to address the issue, although they have not yet reached a consensus on how to regulate such content. The request aims to protect the integrity of the upcoming election process.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, an 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to overcome her social anxiety and reconnect with her peers. Feeling isolated, she spent approximately 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates whom she had grown distant from over the years. Schafer then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with surprise and appreciation. The project not only helped her bridge social gaps but also prompted her classmates to reflect on their own interactions, fostering a renewed sense of connection within the graduating class.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked a Trump administration executive order that targeted the law firm Susman Godfrey, ruling it unconstitutional. This marks the fourth such legal defeat for the administration's campaign of issuing punitive orders against prominent law firms for representing clients or causes the president opposes. In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan stated the order violates the U.S. Constitution and represents a threat to the rule of law and the right to legal counsel. The decision is a significant victory for firms challenging what they describe as retaliatory actions by the executive branch.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has performed a major U-turn on its plan to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip) after facing a potential mass rebellion from its own MPs. The proposed cuts were intended to generate significant savings but were criticized for targeting vulnerable individuals without a comprehensive long-term reform strategy. The reversal raises questions about the government's fiscal strategy and its ability to manage both its budget and internal party politics. Chancellor Rachel Reeves may now need to find alternative savings or consider tax rises to meet her fiscal targets. (not investment advice)</p>

While songs like "Chocolate" and "Love It If We Made It" were met with enthusiastic singalongs, the overall show was seen as polished but safe. The band also made a point to steer clear of political commentary, stating they want their legacy to be about love and friendship.</p>

The May 16 jailbreak, which went unnoticed for hours, was described by Louisiana's governor as one of the worst in recent state history. Massey was located and arrested at a residence in the city and will be transferred to a secure state facility. The escape has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the jail, while only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large.</p>

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over the West Indies in the first Test in Barbados, driven by a five-wicket haul from bowler Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies' batting lineup collapsed dramatically in the final session of day three, losing all ten of their second-innings wickets as they pursued a target of 301. Despite a promising start, a devastating spell from Hazlewood reduced the hosts to 56-5, a position from which they could not recover. The decisive win gives Australia a strong start to the series, concluding the match with two full days to spare.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million from the current $330 million. The move, advocated by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to reverse the trend of productions leaving California for other locations with more generous financial incentives. Industry unions and advocates applauded the decision as a critical step to support local workers and bring production back to the state. The increase is part of a broader effort to maintain Hollywood's status as the center of the entertainment industry.</p>
