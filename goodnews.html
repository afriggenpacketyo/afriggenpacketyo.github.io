          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) reports that people in Gaza are expressing gratitude to President Donald Trump for the aid they are receiving. Rev. Johnnie Moore, GHF's executive chairman, stated that Gazans attribute the aid to a promise Trump made to address Hamas's treatment of Gazan people regarding humanitarian assistance. The GHF aims to distribute aid without it being diverted by Hamas, a challenge that the United Nations has struggled with. The U.N. has criticized the GHF, but Moore encourages critics to join their efforts to provide food to Gazans.</p>

This discovery reveals an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, showcasing early stages of features like strong jaws.
