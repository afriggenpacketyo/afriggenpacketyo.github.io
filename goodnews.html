          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone call described as "very productive," focusing on establishing peace in Ukraine. Zelenskyy urged Trump to help broker an end to the war with Russia, referencing his role in Middle East agreements. The conversation also covered bolstering Ukraine's air defense following recent Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. This call signals a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who had a contentious public meeting earlier in the year but have since found common ground.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The supplement creatine, widely known for enhancing muscle growth and athletic performance, is gaining attention for a broader range of health benefits, including for the brain and heart. Experts note that it aids in producing ATP, the body's energy currency, which can support cognitive functions, memory, and recovery, particularly in older adults and vegetarians. Some studies also suggest potential benefits for heart health by supplying energy for contractions and improving outcomes after certain surgeries. While considered one of the safest supplements for most healthy individuals, those with pre-existing kidney conditions are advised to exercise caution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States, viewing it as a strategic step to advance their careers and national team ambitions. Players like Patrick Yazbek of Nashville SC highlight the league's quality and increasing global profile, challenging the misconception in Australia that European leagues are the only viable overseas option. The MLS provides not only a high level of competition but also professional opportunities like full-time coaching roles that are less common in Australia's A-League. This trend reflects a shift in MLS's strategy, which now focuses on developing and selling talented young players.</p>

          <p>BlackRock's head of equity ETFs, Jay Jacobs, has identified a significant trend where investors are moving away from traditional, broad technology sector funds into more specialized, thematic ETFs focused on artificial intelligence and blockchain. He notes that AI-specific funds, which include major players like Nvidia and Microsoft, offer more granular exposure to the entire AI ecosystem, from semiconductors to large language models. Similarly, there is strong enthusiasm for blockchain technology, with significant investor interest in products that track cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. This shift indicates a growing investor appetite for targeted exposure to potentially disruptive technological themes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Independent movie theaters are adapting to the challenges of streaming and high ticket prices by transforming into community hubs that offer unique experiences beyond just film screenings. Theaters like Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas in New Jersey and Vidiots in Los Angeles operate as non-profits, hosting film festivals, Q&A sessions, and providing a safe social space for young people. Others, such as New York's Metrograph, have found for-profit success by incorporating bookstores, restaurants, and streaming services. These creative approaches demonstrate a shared belief that the future of cinema lies in cultivating a social, communal experience that audiences crave.</p>

          <p>In observance of the International Day of the Girl on October 11, a collection of photographs by photojournalist Danielle Villasana celebrates the persistence and spirit of girls and young women around the world. The images capture individuals in challenging circumstances, from a young Venezuelan migrant studying at the U.S. border to others who have faced gender-based violence, yet they radiate joy and strength. The series aims to fulfill the U.N.'s mission for the day: to recognize girls' limitless potential and amplify their voices. Villasana's work underscores the message that with adequate support, education, and resources, girls are an unstoppable force for positive change.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has seen the value of its investment in five major Japanese trading houses—Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo—grow to over $30 billion. This represents a nearly 400% increase from the initial $6.3 billion investment made in 2020. Berkshire has been steadily increasing its stakes, with recent disclosures showing its ownership in Mitsui and Mitsubishi has surpassed 10%. Buffett has expressed long-term commitment to these holdings, which he was initially attracted to due to their "ridiculous price" relative to prevailing interest rates at the time.

          <p>The Welsh political party Plaid Cymru has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000 if they commit to working in Wales for five years. The proposal, revealed at the party's annual conference, aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by matching the more competitive incentives offered in England. The policy would prioritize teachers in high-demand subjects like math and science, as well as those who can teach in the Welsh medium. The party estimates the plan would cost £6-7 million, funded from money already earmarked for curriculum support, as part of a broader strategy to raise educational standards.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear corporation, have developed a working prototype of a plasma propulsion engine that could significantly reduce travel time to Mars to as little as 30 days. The engine uses electromagnetism to accelerate a stream of ionized hydrogen plasma, generating a continuous, modest thrust that can achieve extremely high final velocities over time. Lab tests have shown particle speeds 25 times faster than traditional chemical rockets, and the system boasts high fuel efficiency, requiring a nuclear power source. This technology represents a major step toward making long-duration space missions safer by reducing astronauts' exposure to cosmic radiation.</p>

In an interview, she recalled how cruel comments from a few critical people felt "crippling" when she was in her early 20s. However, Roberts chose to view these difficult experiences as a challenge to define the person she wanted to become and as lessons that ultimately proved her own endurance. Career coaches affirm the importance of building resilience, advising young professionals to distance themselves from abrasive feedback and focus on their own value, while also reflecting on any "kernel of truth" that could lead to personal growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collection of articles from The Atlantic examines the nature of regret, framing it as an unavoidable emotional consequence of having free will. Instead of adhering to a "no regrets" philosophy, which can be counterproductive, the pieces suggest there is value in confronting feelings of disappointment or sadness about past decisions. By allowing oneself to experience regret, even for a short time, it is possible to learn more about one's present self and values. This approach transforms regret from a backward-looking refusal to accept the past into a tool for present-day self-discovery and future growth.</p>

          <p>The world is on track for a record grain harvest this year, highlighting a major human achievement: the dramatic reduction of famine caused by crop failure. Advances in agriculture, including improved seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and widespread irrigation, have tripled cereal yields since the 1960s, making food scarcity far rarer. However, hunger persists for billions who cannot afford a healthy diet. Modern famines, such as those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily caused by political failures and conflict that disrupt access to an otherwise abundant global food supply, rather than by natural shortages.</p>
