        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor Technologies have skyrocketed, driven by a surge of interest from retail traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum. The stock, which traded for under $1 for most of the year, saw its value increase by over 500% in July alone amid massive trading volumes and significant short interest. This rally is being compared to the GameStop mania of 2021, fueled by social media hype and heightened options trading, making it a poster child for recent market volatility.

This integration marks the first time a self-custodial wallet has been embedded into a major messaging app in the U.S., a move delayed by previous regulatory uncertainty.</p>
