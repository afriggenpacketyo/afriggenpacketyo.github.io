          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have discovered that a fungus, Aspergillus flavus, historically associated with the "pharaoh's curse," may hold properties to combat cancer. Scientists modified molecules from the fungus to create a compound that shows potent effects against leukemia cells in laboratory tests. While the study is in its very early stages and has not yet been tested on animals or humans, the findings suggest that natural products like fungi remain a promising source for new medicines. The research highlights a potential therapeutic use for a fungus more commonly known for causing respiratory issues in immunocompromised individuals.</p>

          <p>This article details NPR's internal guidelines and ethical considerations for granting anonymity to sources in its reporting. The organization states a strong preference for on-the-record sources but acknowledges that anonymity is sometimes necessary to protect individuals from retaliation or stigma, allowing crucial stories to be told. Before granting anonymity, senior editors vet the source's credibility, the importance of the information, and the potential risks the source faces. NPR commits to transparency by explaining to its audience why a source is unnamed, providing as much descriptive information as possible without compromising their identity.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul secured a unanimous points victory over former middleweight world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. in a cruiserweight bout in California. The fight was largely one-sided, with Paul controlling the pace while Chavez Jr. remained defensive and threw very few punches, drawing boos from the crowd and visible frustration from his father at ringside. After the win, Paul called out top names in the division, expressing his ambition to challenge for a world title. The result continues to fuel debate about Paul's legitimacy in professional boxing and the quality of his opponents.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move is part of a broader push for Europe's technological sovereignty in the space sector, where it currently lags behind the U.S. However, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to match Starlink's scale, as its OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites is much smaller than Starlink's network of over 7,000. While Eutelsat may struggle in the mass-market consumer segment, it is well-positioned to serve European government, security, and enterprise clients. (not investment advice)</p>

It is now being succeeded by the new H3 rocket, which is designed to be more cost-effective and competitive in the global launch market. This final mission represents a significant milestone, closing a chapter on a highly reliable and successful series of rockets for Japan's space exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new smoking ban that prohibits lighting up on all public beaches, in parks, and near schools and swimming pools. The rules, which went into effect Sunday, are part of a national plan to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and protect the public, especially children, from secondhand smoke. While e-cigarettes are not included in the ban, violators of the new law could face fines of up to ‚Ç¨700. The move comes as France continues to battle a high smoking rate, with over 30% of adults still smoking.</p>

This year's events are characterized by a more defiant and political tone, mixing jubilant celebration with protest against a recent wave of policies targeting LGBTQ+ rights, particularly for transgender individuals. Organizers have adopted themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" in response to the political climate and a rollback of corporate sponsorships. The parades continue the tradition that began in 1970, a year after the pivotal Stonewall Inn uprising.</p>
