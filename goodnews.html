          <p>Following the death of her mother, Gayle Noble, Nisse Noble chose to honor her memory with a birthday party celebrating her life rather than a traditional funeral. The event highlighted Gayle's legacy of what her family termed "aggressive kindness," which included regularly delivering homemade treats to local workers and building a large online community. Despite a difficult relationship at times, her daughter found that caring for her mother through an Alzheimer's diagnosis brought them closer, allowing her to appreciate her mother's generous spirit more deeply.</p>

Abbott described the deployment as a natural extension of the guard's experience with civil unrest on the Texas border, emphasizing that their role is to ensure federal officials can perform their duties safely.</p>

Speaking at Oracle's AI World conference, Magouyrk pointed to OpenAI's unprecedented growth to nearly a billion users as evidence of its financial viability, following a five-year deal between the companies worth over $300 billion. His fellow CEO, Mike Sicilia, highlighted that Oracle has already begun integrating OpenAI's AI models into its electronic health records products, underscoring the technology's transformative potential across industries.

          <p>The IRS has confirmed that the October 15 deadline for taxpayers who requested a filing extension remains in effect, even with the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. While about half of the agency's staff is on furlough, essential services like submission processing are still operational. An extension provides more time to file, but not to pay, as taxes owed were still due by the original April 15 deadline. The penalty for missing the October 15 filing deadline is 5% of the amount due per month, although the IRS may waive this for those with a reasonable explanation.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Legacy of Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds" and Its Lessons on Media Literacy</h2>

          <p>This article revisits Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast of "The War of the Worlds," which famously simulated a Martian invasion and has since become a landmark event in media history. While the ensuing panic was reportedly exaggerated by newspapers seeking to discredit the newer medium of radio, the broadcast sparked one of the first major public discussions about media credibility. Welles himself later stated the broadcast was an intentional "assault on the credibility" of radio, aimed at teaching audiences not to blindly trust everything they heard. The event remains a powerful lesson on the importance of media literacy, especially in today's era of AI-generated deepfakes and social media disinformation.</p>

          <p>Millie Bright, a key defender for the England women's national football team, has announced her retirement from international play after a nine-year career with 88 caps. Bright was instrumental in the Lionesses' Euro 2022 victory and captained the team to the World Cup final in 2023. Her decision reflects a changing of the guard within the squad, as younger defenders have emerged and competition for places has increased. Bright will continue her club career as captain of Chelsea, where she is pursuing domestic and Champions League titles.</p>

Nadine de Klerk, the hero of their previous match, guided the team to victory with an unbeaten 37, sealing the win with a six in the final over.

          <p>Broadcom's stock surged after announcing a major partnership with OpenAI to co-design and deploy custom chips optimized for AI inference, with a deployment of 10 gigawatts of capacity set to begin late next year.

OpenAI's president, Greg Brockman, stated this massive undertaking is necessary to get ahead of an "avalanche" of demand for AI services. (not investment advice)</p>
