          <p>Violet Affleck, daughter of actor Ben Affleck, recently addressed the United Nations, advocating passionately for clean air infrastructure, the reinstatement of mask mandates, and the recognition of filtered air as a fundamental human right. The 19-year-old Yale freshman's impactful speech underscored the critical importance of environmental health. An expert, Rocky Rosen, highlighted the personal context that her father, Ben Affleck, reportedly struggles with a decades-long smoking habit, suggesting Violet feels a sense of powerlessness regarding this private health concern. This article draws a poignant parallel between her public activism for global clean air and the ongoing challenges within her own family regarding personal air quality and health choices.</p>

          <p>Matthew McConaughey is starring in "The Lost Bus," a film depicting the harrowing escape from California's deadly 2018 wildfires, where he plays a bus driver evacuating schoolchildren. Notably, his 93-year-old mother, Mary Kathlene 'Kay' McConaughey, and 17-year-old son, Levi, also appear in the film, making it a unique family affair. Director Paul Greengrass, known for his realism, cast McConaughey's family members, with Levi earning his role after persistent requests and a blind audition. The film recreates the inferno using gas lines and visual effects, aiming for a realistic cinematic experience that also speaks to the universal dangers of a world "on fire" due to climate change.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Orange County officials are undertaking an unusual initiative, cross-referencing voter rolls with pet registration data to identify any instances of animals being illegally registered to vote. This effort was prompted by the recent felony charges against a Costa Mesa woman who allegedly registered her dog and cast ballots for it in two elections. Supervisors Dan Wagner and Janet Nguyen championed the measure, aiming to bolster public confidence in election integrity, though some colleagues argued the focus should instead be on increasing legitimate voter participation. The Registrar of Voters has already conducted an initial review of nearly 8,000 unincorporated pet records without detecting any issues and is now expanding this scrutiny to incorporated cities, working to maintain accurate voter rolls.</p>

          <p>Following a temporary suspension, Jimmy Kimmel's return to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on ABC resulted in a significant ratings jump, drawing a broadcast audience about four times larger than its average, with an estimated 6.26 million total viewers. This notable increase occurred despite the show being preempted by approximately a quarter of all ABC affiliate TV stations across the U.S. Kimmel's monologue, which garnered over 26 million views on YouTube and other social platforms, directly addressed the controversy surrounding his suspension after remarks concerning the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. While not issuing a blanket apology, Kimmel stated his intention was never to make light of the murder, contributing to an ongoing national discussion about free speech and media regulation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled it unconstitutional for the Trump administration to require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement as a prerequisite for receiving certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's broader push to revoke funding from "sanctuary" cities and states. Twenty predominantly Democratic states had initiated the lawsuit, contending that the policy violated federal law and the Constitution by effectively holding crucial emergency preparedness and response funding hostage. The judge sided with the plaintiff states, granting summary judgment and deeming the policy "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," underscoring the potential for irreparable harm to disaster response and public safety if such funds were withheld.</p>

          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has unveiled the 12 contenders for its 2025 Fat Bear Week, an annual online competition celebrating brown bears' successful preparation for hibernation. The event, running from September 23-30, allows the public to vote for the fattest bear, highlighting how these animals can gain up to 700 pounds, reaching over 1,400 pounds. Park rangers emphasize that a "fat bear is a healthy bear," as their winter survival depends on these fat stores. The competition, now over a decade old, aims to make the remote park accessible and educate the public about bear ecology, with the ultimate "prize" being survival through winter.</p>

          <p>Parents of Mason Connor report their son, diagnosed with autism, began speaking just three days after starting leucovorin, an inexpensive generic drug typically used to ease chemotherapy side effects. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, is researching leucovorin's potential to help children with autism who have cerebral folate deficiency, a condition where folic acid transport to the brain is blocked. While more research is needed, three randomized controlled trials have shown positive effects on speech. The FDA has begun the process of approving leucovorin for autism, despite the lack of large-scale phase 3 trials, prompting concerns about funding for generic drug development.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck west and north Venezuela on Wednesday, as reported by the US Geological Survey. The tremor's epicenter was located at a shallow depth of 7.8 kilometers, approximately 24 kilometers from Mene Grande, an oil town situated in a sparsely populated area of Zulia state. Although strong earthquakes are not a frequent occurrence in Venezuela, this event caused buildings to shake and generated alarm in major cities such as Caracas and Maracaibo. The quake was also felt in neighboring Colombia and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curacao, and Bonaire. Fortunately, there were no immediate reports of any casualties or serious damage, offering a measure of stability despite the significant seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has called for "realism" regarding the club's European ambitions, following their Europa League opening draw away to Red Star Belgrade. This sentiment marks a notable shift from previous seasons, particularly after Celtic's failure to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in three years, which has led to fan protests over a "scant summer of transfer activity." While the draw was considered a valuable point in a challenging away fixture, the article underscores the contrast with Rodgers' earlier confidence about the team's Champions League readiness. The positive impact of new signing Kelechi Iheanacho, who provided a crucial focal point, is highlighted, yet the club continues to face criticism for not adequately replacing departed star players.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald intensified the competition by stating his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," in what appeared to be a dig at their American rivals. This year, all 12 American players and their captain are receiving $500,000 stipends, with a portion for charity, marking the first time players have been paid in the tournament's 98-year history, unlike the unpaid European team. Donald emphasized pride, national representation, and legacy as Europe's motivators. American player Collin Morikawa dismissed the payment's impact on desire, arguing it allows players to support their teams and communities, amidst criticism from former European players regarding the ethos of the Ryder Cup.</p>

          <p>A senior US State Department official has reaffirmed India's critical strategic importance as a democratic counterweight to China within the Indo-Pacific region, despite existing bilateral trade disputes and Pakistan's concerns. The official dismissed any notion that these tensions under President Trump's administration had fundamentally altered this stance, emphasizing the enduring strength of ties with New Delhi. A leaders' summit for the Quad, a strategic dialogue involving the US, India, Australia, and Japan, is expected to take place in New Delhi this fall, with ongoing speculation about President Trump's attendance. Planning for a potential in-person meeting between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is underway, either later this year or early next, signaling continued high-level diplomatic engagement despite current rifts.</p>
