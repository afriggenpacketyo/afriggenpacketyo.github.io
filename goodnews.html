          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy focused on lowering energy costs for businesses, potentially cutting energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK firms. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms by exempting them from certain green energy levies. The plan also includes measures to expedite connections to the energy grid for new factories and projects, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer touting it as a "turning point for Britain's economy." While manufacturers and trade unions have welcomed the strategy, retail and leisure sectors have expressed disappointment at their exclusion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent poll in Germany reveals that nearly two-thirds of Germans support the establishment of a European nuclear deterrent independent of the United States. The survey, conducted by the Forsa institute, indicates that 64% of respondents favor the idea, with support consistent across demographic and political lines. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has previously signaled his intention to discuss a joint European nuclear strategy with the United Kingdom and France. The goal is to reduce Europe's reliance on the US nuclear umbrella, particularly amid concerns about the unpredictability of President Donald Trump, and this poll suggests Germans generally agree with this goal. </p>

          <p>Following his recent victory at the Travelers Championship, US captain Keegan Bradley is now considering whether to play in September's Ryder Cup. Bradley's win moved him up in both the world rankings and the American Ryder Cup qualification standings, opening the door for him to potentially take on a dual role as both captain and player. He stated that he would need to carefully consider what is best for the team, especially given his strong performance and the support of his vice-captains. Arnold Palmer was the last playing captain for the Ryder Cup in 1963, and Bradley acknowledged that the PGA of America had considered the possibility of him being a playing captain when he was first appointed. </p>

The event, described as a caffeinated wake, offered a range of items from screenplays and director's chairs to espresso machines and woodworking tools. Big-ticket items included Lynch's copies of the Lost Highway screenplay and unfinished screenplays for Ronnie Rocket, while many attendees sought items that represented lesser-known aspects of Lynch's legacy. The auction served as a reflective and celebratory event, with attendees sharing stories of how Lynch's work had influenced their lives and art. </p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has vetoed a bill that would have banned all THC consumables, allowing the state's burgeoning market of THC-infused products to continue operating. The bill would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture, or sell consumable THC products, representing one of the most restrictive bans in the country. Critics of the bill argued that it would prevent people who cannot access marijuana through the state's limited medical program from obtaining similar relief. Retailers across the state also highlighted the thousands of jobs and millions in revenue generated by the THC consumables industry. </p>

          <p>Chinese state media is advocating for Beijing to proactively embrace yuan-backed stablecoins to enhance the yuan's global presence. An article in Securities Times suggests that China should consider legislation regulating stablecoins, recognizing their potential to streamline cross-border transactions. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies or assets, offering efficiency and reliability. While unregulated stablecoins could pose risks to China's financial system, forgoing this technology could hinder the yuan's internationalization efforts. Analysts believe that regulating and promoting yuan-backed stablecoins could be a strategic move for China. (not investment advice)</p>

Efforts include establishing a common standard for electronic prior authorization requests by 2027 and reducing the types of claims subject to prior authorization by 2026. This move aims to ease the workload of doctors and hospitals, many of whom still submit requests manually, and it follows public backlash against the health insurance industry. </p>
