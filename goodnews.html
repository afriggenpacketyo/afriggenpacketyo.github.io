          <p>British bank Barclays has exceeded second-quarter profit expectations, reporting a pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, driven by strong performance in its investment banking division. The bank also announced a new £1 billion share buyback program, signaling confidence in its financial health. These results come as the bank undergoes strategic changes and cost-cutting measures under CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan. The performance of its investment unit is being closely watched amid a shifting British banking landscape and potential changes to U.S. capital rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India has become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., overtaking China for the first time, according to research from Canalys. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year. This shift is largely attributed to major manufacturers like Apple diversifying their supply chains away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. The move reflects a broader trend of global companies increasing their manufacturing capacity in India to serve the American market.</p>

          <p>This article details the challenging journey of Indian cricketer Akash Deep, who recently achieved a five-wicket haul against England. Hailing from a small village in Bihar, Deep overcame significant personal tragedy, including the death of his father and brother, which forced him to pause his cricket aspirations for several years. After relocating to Bengal, his raw talent was recognized, and with mentorship, he honed his skills to earn a place in the Indian Premier League and eventually the national Test squad. His story is one of perseverance against immense personal and financial hardship.</p>

          <p>The European Union is planning to establish large-scale "AI gigafactories" in an effort to catch up with the United States and China in the artificial intelligence sector. These facilities are envisioned as comprehensive ecosystems that combine computing power, data, and talent to develop advanced AI models and applications. The EU has initiated the project with €20 billion in public funding, aiming to attract significant private investment to build the costly infrastructure. The goal is to enhance Europe's technological sovereignty and create a competitive environment for its numerous AI researchers and startups.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on South Korea to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling" from China during his first phone call with his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun. Wang encouraged Seoul to foster a stable and predictable relationship with Beijing and to deepen pragmatic cooperation between the two nations. The call comes as Beijing seeks to reset relations with the new South Korean administration under President Lee Jae-myung. Both ministers reportedly affirmed a commitment to advancing their strategic partnership.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy for parents, offering 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three. The policy is intended to help ease the financial burden of raising children in China, which is considered one of the world's most expensive places to do so. This move follows various local initiatives and comes as the country faces a significant demographic challenge with a shrinking and rapidly aging population, despite abolishing its one-child policy nearly a decade ago.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is coordinating with Jordan's King Abdullah II to establish an airlift for delivering humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. This move comes amid growing international pressure on Israel to alleviate the severe humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory. A recent survey indicates that a vast majority of Germans, around 74%, believe their government should apply more pressure on Israel to address the situation. Jordan has already been acting as a hub for aid, and the joint effort signifies increased European involvement in the relief efforts.</p>

The Japanese star pitched seven innings, allowing only one run on four hits while striking out nine batters. After a shaky period mid-season, Yamamoto has demonstrated a revival, improving his record to 9-7 with a 2.48 ERA, which is among the best in the National League. His dominant outing showcases the kind of elite starting pitching the Dodgers hope will anchor their team for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a peace plan and humanitarian aid for Gaza. The meeting follows discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders from France and Germany, indicating a coordinated European effort to address the crisis. This diplomatic push comes amid growing domestic pressure on the UK government to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, with over half of Labour's backbench MPs signing a letter in support.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with President Donald Trump in Scotland, though unconventional, has provided the British government with invaluable direct access to the U.S. leader. The trip, which included a helicopter tour of Trump's golf course, allowed for extended one-on-one conversations on critical topics like the war in Gaza. While navigating the president's free-wheeling style presents challenges, Downing Street views the engagement as crucial for strengthening the UK-US relationship. The discussions on Gaza are seen as particularly important ahead of an emergency UK cabinet meeting on the crisis.</p>
