          <p>President Trump announced a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first in a series of anticipated agreements during the reciprocal tariff pause. While details are still being finalized with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the deal aims to increase market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and eliminate non-tariff barriers. A 10% baseline U.S. tax on imports from Britain will remain, but the first 100,000 vehicles exported annually from British automakers to the U.S. will be subject to this rate, with additional vehicles facing higher rates. The administration is also monitoring developments between Pakistan and India after recent exchanges of fire.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a plan to modernize the nation's air traffic control system, prompted by a recent communications outage at Newark Liberty International Airport. The proposed overhaul includes replacing technology at over 4,600 air traffic control sites, building six new coordination centers, and upgrading essential equipment, with an estimated cost of billions of dollars. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized the urgency of the upgrades to prevent future disruptions and potential safety risks, citing near-miss incidents and the aging infrastructure. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian voiced support for the modernization efforts, highlighting the necessity of government investment in air traffic control.</p>

Gates criticized cuts to foreign aid by the US, UK, and France, highlighting the urgency of addressing preventable diseases, infectious diseases, and poverty, and also accused Elon Musk of indirectly causing harm through cuts to US aid.

          <p>The US and UK have agreed to a trade deal that reduces tariffs on British cars and allows tariff-free entry for some steel and aluminum. The agreement lowers import taxes on up to 100,000 British cars annually to 10%, and slashes tariffs on steel and aluminum, though a 10% duty remains on most UK goods. The deal also provides reciprocal access for beef exports. While leaders from both countries hailed the deal, some analysts suggest it doesn't significantly alter pre-existing trade terms.
