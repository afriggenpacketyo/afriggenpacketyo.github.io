The tech company's shares rose over 13% after it announced a $100 billion increase to its U.S. investment pledge, a move that successfully secured an exemption from President Trump's newly announced tariffs on semiconductor imports. The article notes this pivotal development occurred amid a complex economic environment that includes new tariff threats against India and the pharmaceutical industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant de-escalatory move, North Korea has reportedly started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the heavily fortified border with South Korea. This action appears to be a reciprocal gesture after South Korea's new government, under President Lee Jae Myung, first halted its own anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and began removing its equipment. For months, the two nations had engaged in a Cold War-style psychological campaign, with the South broadcasting K-pop and news and the North blasting irritating sounds like animal howls.</p>

The $104 million project, named The Hartby, involved a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent St. John the Baptist church and preserved the historic structure's architectural integrity. The transformation has revitalized a neglected asset, creating both market-rate and affordable housing units while providing a new income stream for the church, demonstrating a successful model for urban renewal and historic preservation.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only individual to have served as director of both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Renowned for his integrity and non-partisanship, Webster was appointed to lead the FBI in 1978 and the CIA in 1987, tasked with restoring public trust in both agencies during turbulent periods. His long and distinguished career in public service, which also included time as a federal prosecutor and judge, left a legacy of steady, principled leadership at the helm of America's top law enforcement and intelligence bodies.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial planner who originated the famous "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals three decades ago, is now offering updated advice for today's retirees. His new research suggests that a more diversified portfolio allows for a higher safe withdrawal rate, closer to 4.7%, and potentially even above 5% in current conditions. Bengen argues that many retirees are overly conservative with their spending and can enjoy their accumulated wealth more fully by adopting strategies like annual rebalancing and a rising equity glide path.

          <p>A major new art exhibition is shining a spotlight on the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who, despite being more famous than Rembrandt during her lifetime, has since been largely overlooked. Ruysch was a master of flower still lifes, creating intensely detailed and scientifically precise compositions that combined blooms from different seasons and continents. The exhibition explores how her art reflected the Dutch Golden Age's obsession with botany, global trade, and the delicate balance between life, beauty, and decay.</p>

Known for his combination of pace and physicality, Sesko was one of the top-scoring young players in Europe's major leagues.</p>

          <p>A 3D-printed robot crab, affectionately named "Wavy Dave," met a violent end during a scientific experiment in Portugal when it was attacked and dismembered by actual fiddler crabs. Researchers were using the Bluetooth-controlled bot to study how male crabs alter their mating displays in the presence of rivals. The experiment took an unexpected turn when, after female crabs seemed to lose interest in the robot, a real male crab aggressively tore off its claw, forcing an early end to the trial but providing valuable data on competitive behavior.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of the Bermuda Triangle has a simple explanation, according to Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki: there is no mystery at all. He argues that the number of planes and ships that have disappeared in the area is not disproportionately high when considering the sheer volume of traffic. This rational viewpoint, which has been echoed for years by organizations like NOAA and Lloyd's of London, attributes the incidents to a combination of challenging navigation, volatile weather, and human fallibility, rather than any supernatural or paranormal forces.</p>

Speaking from her own experience, she notes that scolding kids for screen time is ineffective if parents are constantly on their own devices.

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey reveals that Americans believe an average net worth of $2.3 million is needed to be considered wealthy in 2025, a slight decrease from the previous year. This benchmark varies significantly by region, with those in the West setting the bar at $3 million, while those in the South believe $1.8 million is sufficient. The survey also indicates that many people define wealth more broadly, including non-financial aspects like happiness and relationships, and feel financially comfortable with a much lower average net worth of $839,000.

          <p>America's traditional enclosed shopping malls are finding new life by replacing now-vacant anchor stores with a diverse mix of non-traditional tenants like churches, entertainment venues, hotels, and large bookstores. This strategy of subdividing sprawling retail spaces aims to transform malls into multifaceted community hubs, driving foot traffic and encouraging "cross-shopping" between different types of establishments. Recent data suggests the approach is working, with some malls attributing a significant portion of their visits to the draw of tenants like Barnes & Noble.</p>
