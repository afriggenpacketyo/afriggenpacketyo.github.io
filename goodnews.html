        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a significant drop of over 4% following OPEC+'s decision to increase production for the second consecutive month. The group, led by Saudi Arabia, will raise output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling Goldman Sachs' initial forecast. This decision follows a similar production surge in May, bringing over 800,000 bpd of additional supply to the market. Oil prices had already seen their biggest monthly loss since 2021 in April due to concerns about a recession and rising tariffs, leading to reduced investment in exploration and production by oilfield service firms.</p>
