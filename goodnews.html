          <p>President Donald Trump announced a whirlwind trip to Israel and Egypt before returning to the White House to posthumously award Charlie Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Trump plans to address Israel's Knesset and meet recently freed hostages, part of a historic peace deal he secured between Israel and Hamas. Following this, he will visit Cairo for an international summit to finalize the peace agreement, expected to be attended by over 20 world leaders. The trip culminates with a White House ceremony on October 14th, which would have been Kirk's 32nd birthday, honoring the conservative activist assassinated last month.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer David Allen suffered a unanimous points defeat to Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov in a highly anticipated headline show at Sheffield Arena. Despite the loss, the 33-year-old "White Rhino" was deeply moved by the overwhelming support from the 9,000-strong home crowd, describing it as the "best atmosphere" he had ever seen. Allen, who returned to boxing after a five-year hiatus with titles on his mind, showed immense resilience against his formidable opponent. Although it was a setback, Allen expressed determination to continue his career, having rebuilt it multiple times after previous challenges and emerging from retirement.</p>

          <p>The UK will end British Summer Time (BST) on Sunday, October 26, 2025, as clocks go back one hour to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, remembered by the phrase "spring forward, fall back," grants an extra hour of sleep but means an extra hour for night shift workers. While the change brings sunset forward, leading to darker winter mornings, particularly in Scotland, it also reignites debates about year-round BST for economic and safety benefits. The practice, originating in Germany in 1916, aims to maximize daylight and reduce fuel consumption during wartime.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic's participation in Sunday's preseason game against the Golden State Warriors remains "to be determined," despite his full practice attendance. Coach JJ Redick confirmed Austin Reaves and Marcus Smart would play, while Doncic expects to play two preseason games. The Lakers face a significant challenge as LeBron James is sidelined for three to four weeks with a sciatica nerve issue, forcing a "next man up" mentality for the team. Doncic, however, is not viewing his role as carrying a heavier load, focusing on team wins and off-court chemistry discussions with James during this period.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen recounts her initial shock and subsequent understanding after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy Cohen, revealed her decision to donate her body to medical science. Patsy, a bowel cancer survivor, views it as a way to "give back" and help future doctors, having already arranged the donation with Cardiff University. Owen explored the process in a documentary, learning how donated bodies are used for anatomy education and the emotional impact on families. The experience led Owen to decide to donate her own body, honoring her mother's pragmatic and generous spirit and highlighting the profound impact of such altruism.</p>

          <p>Britain is experiencing a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses, including common colds, flu, and Covid-19, this autumn. Experts attribute this to a "perfect breeding ground" as people return to schools and workplaces and spend more time indoors. Data from the UK Health Security Agency shows a rise in Rhinovirus, while new Covid variants and an early uptick in flu cases are also circulating. While current illness levels are not exceptionally high, vulnerable individuals are urged to get vaccinated. General advice includes regular handwashing, staying home when ill, and mask-wearing in public to protect others.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates a growing trend of tourists using AI, like ChatGPT, for holiday planning, from suggesting destinations to crafting itineraries. Alan Smith successfully used AI to discover Castro Urdiales, a Spanish seaside town, for his family trip, praising its "buzzing" atmosphere. However, Hannah Read encountered incorrect information when AI suggested a non-existent ferry route to Norway, highlighting the need for fact-checking. While AI tools can streamline planning, experts advise users to understand their limitations and verify recommendations, especially for critical details like travel routes and opening times, to avoid disappointment. This article demonstrates both the promise and pitfalls of AI in travel.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, observers are analyzing how this blueprint will evolve its infrastructure spending and investment. Historically, such plans have driven massive growth, like the 2009 stimulus package, which used public works to counter global financial crises. While these projects fueled economic expansion, some also burdened local governments with debt. The upcoming plan is expected to shift towards more tech-driven and people-focused infrastructure. Economists remain optimistic about the scale of future investments, anticipating continued development tailored to new economic demands. (not investment advice)</p>

This collaboration, combined with US government investment in semiconductor companies, accelerates data center production, giving the US a competitive edge.
