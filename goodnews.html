          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 09:15:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that wholesale prices unexpectedly declined by 0.1% in August, offering potential relief for the Federal Reserve as it considers an upcoming interest rate cut. The producer price index (PPI), which measures input costs for goods and services, fell short of expectations, leading to gains in stock market futures and slightly negative Treasury yields. Futures market pricing indicates a high probability of an interest rate cut, though the Fed is closely monitoring inflation data. While inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, officials are hopeful that easing housing and wage pressures will gradually lower prices, though concerns remain regarding the potential inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs.

          <p>Analysts expressed astonishment at Oracle's revenue projections, particularly for its cloud infrastructure business, leading to a significant after-hours stock rally. The company anticipates substantial revenue growth in cloud infrastructure, projecting an increase from $10 billion to $18 billion this fiscal year, and further growth to $144 billion in the coming years. Oracle's remaining performance obligations soared, indicating strong contracted revenue, and analysts raised their estimates on the stock, with some calling for substantial upside. While Oracle faces competition from major cloud providers, its unique approach to data center infrastructure and substantial growth projections have generated considerable excitement among investors and analysts. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses current interest rates for HELOCs and home equity loans, noting that they are lower than many alternative borrowing products and are expected to decline further if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. As of September 9, 2025, average rates for 5-year home equity loans are 8.22%, 10-year loans are 8.37%, 15-year loans are 8.24%, and the average HELOC rate is 8.10%. HELOCs offer a revolving line of credit with variable interest rates, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed interest rates, and both may offer tax benefits for IRS-eligible home improvements. Homeowners should carefully consider their needs and shop around to find the best rates and terms, considering that their home will function as collateral for either product.

          <p>Google Cloud's chief, Thomas Kurian, detailed how the company is generating billions in revenue by monetizing its artificial intelligence services. He highlighted three primary methods: consumption-based pricing (paying by token or deflection rates), subscription models (per-user fees for services like Gemini and Workspace), and upselling customers to higher-quality models. Kurian noted that Google Cloud's backlog is growing faster than its revenue, with over 50% expected to convert to revenue within two years. He also mentioned a significant increase in new customer wins and the benefits of selling more services to existing customers. </p>

          <h2>Expert Advice on Investing in Gold Bars and Coins This Fall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 09:02:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that investing in 1-ounce gold bars and coins this fall could be worthwhile, as prices are expected to keep rising due to global instability and potential interest rate changes. The premium on 1-ounce gold products is currently attractive, and gold can diversify and safeguard portfolios during uncertain times. Gold is largely uncorrelated to other asset classes, making it a low-risk investment during volatility, and can be seen as a form of "wealth insurance". Potential risks include limited liquidity, counterfeiting, and the need for secure storage, and consulting a professional is advised before investing. (not investment advice)</p>
