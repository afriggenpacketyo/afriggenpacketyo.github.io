This move signals a deeper integration of sports leagues with event-trading platforms, which are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The deal has drawn criticism from groups like the American Gaming Association, who argue these platforms amount to unregulated gambling, while the NHL views it as an opportunity to engage a new audience.</p>

          <p>Prospective homebuyers are facing a difficult decision regarding whether to lock in current mortgage rates, which are in the low 6% range, or wait for potential further declines. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut rates again, delaying could lead to more savings. However, the article cautions that there are no guarantees, as rates could unexpectedly rise due to economic data, and lenders may charge a fee to unlock a rate if a better one becomes available, creating a significant risk for those who choose to wait.

          <p>After hitting a record high, gold prices have fallen for a second straight day, dropping more than 6% from their peak as investors engage in profit-taking. Gold futures closed at $4,065.40 per ounce following a sharp selloff that analysts at UBS attribute to a technical correction rather than a shift in macroeconomic fundamentals. The bank suggests that the core drivers of gold's rally, including inflation, political instability, and threats to Federal Reserve independence, are likely to persist, making it premature to turn negative on the metal.

          <p>Western Alliance CEO Kenneth Vecchione has reassured investors that an alleged loan fraud issue is a 'one-off' case, helping to calm market fears that had triggered a selloff in regional bank stocks. The bank disclosed it had set aside $30 million in reserves for a $98 million loan to the Cantor Group, whose borrowers it is now suing for fraud. Vecchione stated that the bank has since reverified the collateral for all its other large loans in the portfolio and found no further irregularities, restoring some confidence in the sector.

          <p>This article explains the specifics of how reverse mortgages function for married couples, a topic of growing interest for retirees on fixed incomes. For the most common type of reverse mortgage, both spouses must be at least 62 years old and be listed as co-borrowers to ensure both can remain in the home. A key detail is that the loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which typically results in a smaller amount of accessible equity compared to an older, single borrower.

          <p>After two consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue declines, Tesla is expected to report a return to growth in its third-quarter earnings, with analysts forecasting a 4.7% increase. This outlook comes despite challenges such as the expiration of federal EV tax credits, which pulled some sales forward, and a sales slump in Europe. Investors will be closely watching for CEO Elon Musk's commentary on the progress of the company's Robotaxi service, the rollout of lower-cost models, and the adoption of its driver assistance systems in key overseas markets.
