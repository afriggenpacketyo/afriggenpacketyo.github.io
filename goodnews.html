        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is set to host U.S. President Donald Trump for a state visit, an event Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government hopes will provide a distraction from its domestic challenges. Starmer is facing low approval ratings and internal party dissent, making the pageantry and potential for new trade deals with the U.S. particularly timely. The visit will feature royal ceremonies and bilateral meetings focused on strengthening the "special relationship," particularly concerning technology, energy, and trade tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings data and the government's "triple lock" commitment. This policy ensures the pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. The expected increase would raise the new flat-rate state pension by over £500 a year, though concerns are growing that rising payments combined with frozen tax thresholds will pull more pensioners into paying income tax.

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the "Hillsborough Law," a landmark bill designed to prevent future cover-ups following major disasters. The legislation will create a legal "duty of candour," compelling public officials to cooperate truthfully with investigations or face criminal sanctions. Championed by families of the victims of the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster, the law aims to learn from other scandals like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon case, and will also provide legal funding for those affected.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost a close game to the Philadelphia Phillies 6-5 in extra innings, making their path to securing a first-round playoff bye more difficult. The Dodgers fought back from deficits three times but ultimately fell short when the Phillies scored in the tenth inning. The loss widens the gap between the two teams in the race for the National League's number two seed, putting more pressure on the Dodgers as the regular season nears its conclusion.</p>

          <p>Women's rugby teams are increasingly using technology and personalized nutrition to help players manage their menstrual cycles and maintain peak performance. By tracking cycles through apps and daily questionnaires, teams can adapt training intensity, nutrition, and recovery strategies to mitigate symptoms like fatigue and cramps. This approach treats the menstrual cycle as a "fifth vital sign" of health, allowing for a more informed and tailored approach to athlete well-being and performance in a physically demanding sport.</p>

The bill also proposes raising the jury majority required for a guilty verdict to two-thirds and establishing a specialized court for sexual offenses.</p>
