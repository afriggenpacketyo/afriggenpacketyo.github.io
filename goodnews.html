Starting as a deckhand, he now commands superyachts, earning up to $20,000 monthly, excluding tips. Ortega emphasizes that while the job offers significant financial freedom and extensive global travel, it requires immense dedication, humility, and a strong customer service personality, often involving long periods away from family and personal life commitments. He currently mentors aspiring yachties through his "Superyacht Sunday School," helping others successfully transition into this demanding yet uniquely rewarding career path, sharing all the knowledge he wished he had when he started.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, now targeting Tuesday night, following oxygen leaks and adverse weather conditions. This crucial mission aims to test fixes after three previous catastrophic failures and is vital for future plans, including autonomous propellant transfers for NASA's moon landing by 2027 and eventual Mars flights. Despite Elon Musk acknowledging thousands of engineering challenges, especially with perfecting orbital refueling, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy remains optimistic about SpaceX's ability to overcome these hurdles, citing their history of rapid progress. However, some NASA veterans express skepticism about the ambitious timeline for a crewed moon landing, highlighting the immense technical leap required.</p>

Despite fading in the deciding set due to a lack of recent match practice, Williams' impressive level against a top player silenced doubters and underscored her enduring passion and profound influence on the sport.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced a significant shift in tone, stating the U.S. would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country, more than double the current number. This message came hours after the Chinese embassy advised students to be cautious when entering the U.S. via Houston, citing recent incidents where students were "unjustifiably questioned and harassed." Trump expressed a desire for his administration to "get along good" with China and mentioned an invitation from Xi Jinping to visit, signaling a potential de-escalation of tensions regarding Chinese students. This development marks a notable change in a sensitive area of U.S.-China relations, aiming for improved diplomatic ties.</p>

During his White House meeting with President Trump, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung emphasized mutual economic benefits, stating, "We really sort of need each other." The leaders also discussed strengthening energy cooperation, with Seoul committing to purchase $100 billion of U.S. energy resources. These substantial deals, following a July trade agreement that lowered U.S. tariffs on South Korean exports, underscore a deepening economic partnership and concerted efforts to bolster regional security and stability.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 receptor agonists, known as Wegovy and Zepbound, are transforming health outcomes and are projected to create a $100 billion market by 2030, with broad economic implications. These drugs, initially for diabetes and obesity, show promise for new applications in various conditions, sparking a new era of drug innovation and competition among pharmaceutical giants. Goldman Sachs estimates GLP-1s could boost U.S. GDP by 0.4% through increased productivity and healthcare savings. The widespread adoption is also shifting consumer spending, particularly in food and beverage, and potentially impacting sectors like alcohol, retail, and travel, although concerns remain about accessibility creating a two-tier society.

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, the long-elusive Mexican cartel kingpin, pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to drug trafficking charges, expressing profound remorse for his extensive role in flooding the U.S. with illicit substances and fueling deadly violence. Zambada, 75, acknowledged leading the Sinaloa cartel alongside Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, overseeing operations that generated hundreds of millions annually and involved bribing Mexican officials for operational freedom. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi hailed the plea as a "landmark victory," ensuring Zambada will spend his life in federal prison. His arrest last year and subsequent plea agreement, which does not require his cooperation, mark a significant win in the U.S. anti-cartel crusade.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is expected to continue weakening over the central Atlantic Ocean and poses no threat to land, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Monday evening, Fernand was located east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, moving northeast at 13 mph. Forecasters predict it will become a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating entirely on Wednesday, far from any major landmasses. This marks the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, and aligns with NOAA's forecast for an above-normal season, though Fernand itself is not anticipated to cause significant impact or damage.</p>

This ruling creates uncertainty for the GOP's slim House majority and could influence national redistricting battles, as other states consider similar moves.
