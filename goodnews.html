          <p>Despite a potential U.S. government shutdown, the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits are expected to continue getting their monthly checks without interruption. This is because the program is funded through mandatory spending, which does not require annual congressional approval. However, the Social Security Administration has warned that other services, such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacing Medicare cards, could be disrupted or halted. A prolonged shutdown could also delay the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an inflationary economy, certificates of deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure savings option, with top accounts offering returns that outpace the current inflation rate. This article details the national average CD yields for various terms and contrasts them with the higher rates offered by online banks, which often have lower overhead costs. It notes the current phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs provide higher interest rates than longer-term ones. The article suggests strategies like laddering CDs to maximize returns in this environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While a government shutdown is not expected to significantly impact the broader mortgage market, applicants for government-backed loans could face some delays. Conventional mortgages from private lenders should proceed as usual, but loans insured or issued by the FHA, VA, and USDA may experience processing slowdowns due to furloughed staff. A key concern is the potential disruption to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), administered by FEMA, which could delay closings for homes in high-risk flood zones that require federal flood insurance.</p>

The article provides the current national average interest rates for these products, noting that HELOCs typically have variable rates while home equity loans are fixed. It highlights that rates are poised to decline if the Federal Reserve implements further cuts. Homeowners are advised to shop around, as rates vary by lender, location, and credit profile.

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, where overfishing has devastated coral reefs and the livelihoods of coastal communities, a novel conservation project is underway to restore the marine ecosystem without restricting fishing. The initiative, led by the nonprofit Reef Doctor, involves constructing artificial reefs from limestone and seeding them with coral to create new habitats for fish. This approach aims to address food insecurity for a population heavily dependent on fishing, where traditional conservation methods like protected areas have often failed due to extreme poverty. The project is part of a larger study linking ecosystem restoration directly to human health and nutrition.</p>

          <p>General Motors boosted its full-year financial forecast after reporting third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to soar. The automaker's revenue was $48.59 billion, and it now projects adjusted earnings between $12 billion and $13 billion for 2025. The positive revision is also attributed to a reduced expected impact from tariffs. However, the company's net income fell by 57% compared to the previous year, largely due to a $1.6 billion charge related to its strategic pullback from certain all-electric vehicle initiatives amid a slowing market.

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has made history as Japan's first female prime minister, a significant moment in a nation with a poor record on gender equality in politics. However, her appointment is viewed with caution by some women's rights advocates, who point to her staunchly conservative stance on key issues. Takaichi, a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, opposes same-sex marriage and allowing married women to keep their maiden names. While her rise is seen as a symbolic breakthrough, critics argue that her policies align with the patriarchal status quo and may not advance genuine gender equality in Japanese society.</p>

The announcement comes ahead of next month's Budget and aims to boost growth and make the UK more attractive for global investment.
