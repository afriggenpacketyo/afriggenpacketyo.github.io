          <p>Burberry has announced organizational changes that may lead to a reduction of 1,700 roles globally by 2027, as part of CEO Joshua Schulman's strategy to revive the brand. These measures, including cost-cutting across procurement and real estate, are estimated to save ¬£60 million, adding to the ¬£40 million already announced in November. The company's sales fell less than expected in the fiscal fourth quarter, down 6%, and shares jumped 8.5% following the announcement. Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future despite a difficult macroeconomic backdrop and geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading but ultimately rose after the company announced a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion).

          <p>Since taking office, the Trump administration has tried to stop funding already approved for green energy projects and threatened to repeal parts of the IRA. The article discusses the potential impact of Trump's policies, including tariffs, on the renewable energy sector in the United States, noting that tariffs on Southeast Asia could significantly affect solar energy development. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), hostility towards clean technology from the administration is causing uncertainty and project cancellations. While clean energy is expected to grow, the pace may be slower, and the US risks isolating itself in the global transition to cleaner energy sources.</p>

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they face a significant challenge in finding qualified money managers. Trust is a key criterion for family offices, often prioritized over other qualifications, making the hiring process selective. This talent crunch is exacerbated by competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds. As family offices are often looking to combine roles such as a chief investment officer cum CFO, it can be difficult to find one professional who is both willing and capable to cover all these areas. The wealthy are however stepping up their game to pursue the talent they want and are willing to pay a "trust delta," or salary premium.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program, according to four Iranian officials familiar with the plan. Iran‚Äôs foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, proposed the idea to an American special envoy, Steve Witkoff, when the two men held direct and indirect talks in Oman on Sunday. The proposal entails the establishment of a three-country nuclear consortium in which Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade, beneath that needed for nuclear weapons, and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use. A deal that would allow Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67 percent would bear similarity to the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers.</p>
