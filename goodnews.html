Sentiment improved after earlier global bond sell-offs, with recent U.S. payroll data reinforcing market expectations for a September rate cut, now at a 99% probability. In Europe, U.K. retail sales data will offer insights into the country's economic health ahead of a November budget, while Danish wind farm developer Orsted cut its full-year earnings guidance, citing lower wind speeds and ongoing political obstructions to its U.S. projects.

The ruling, which rejected the most severe penalties proposed by the Department of Justice, came despite Google being found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search last year. During a White House dinner with tech executives, Pichai also praised the administration's AI action plan, while Trump incorrectly claimed the lawsuit was brought by the Biden administration.</p>

As part of his 'Make Argentina Great Again' agenda, Milei's administration has introduced the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), offering generous benefits to large-scale investors. Major mining companies like BHP, Glencore, and Rio Tinto are making significant investments, with analysts estimating potential copper projects could represent a $47 billion opportunity for the economy through 2040. However, policy consistency and social license remain crucial for sustained success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the outgoing head of the British armed forces, asserted that the UK's national security is assured 'for now and for the next few years.' He attributed this optimism to the UK's status as a nuclear power, its membership in NATO—described as 'the biggest and strongest gun club ever'—and its close alliance with the United States. Sir Tony praised former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's robust response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and characterized the war as a 'disaster' for Vladimir Putin. He also urged skepticism regarding the formation of a new non-NATO 'axis' based on military parades.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 00:49:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump reiterated his plan to impose 'fairly substantial' tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not shift production to the U.S., while signaling exemptions for firms like Apple that expand domestic investments. During a White House dinner with tech leaders, Trump indicated these tariffs would be implemented 'very shortly.' This move aligns with the U.S. goal to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, a strategy that has already seen major companies like TSMC and Samsung commit billions to U.S. plants. The specifics of these tariffs and exemptions, however, remain largely unclear. (not investment advice)</p>

This potential deal would represent one of the most significant China unit divestments by a global consumer company in recent years. The offers, which value Starbucks China at approximately 10 times its expected 2025 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, come as the company faces sluggish growth and intense competition from local brands in the market.

Despite the early setback and a 65-minute lightning delay, the defending Super Bowl champions secured the win, with Jalen Hurts accounting for 214 yards.
