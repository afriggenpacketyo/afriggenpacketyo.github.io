          <h2>English Cricket's Professional Association Advocates for Reduced County Championship Schedule</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 19:17:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) is advocating for a reduction in the County Championship schedule from 14 to 12 games per season. Citing significant concerns for players' physical and mental well-being, the PCA argues the change is the "only reasonable option" to improve both welfare and competitive standards. This proposal comes amid a broader review of England's domestic cricket structure, which is also expected to shorten the T20 Blast tournament. The PCA supports a conference-style model or a traditional divisional structure, as long as the number of championship matches is decreased.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings receiver Jordan Addison has pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of reckless driving, avoiding jail time for his 2024 DUI citation. The former USC star was arrested after being found asleep behind the wheel of a Rolls-Royce blocking traffic near Los Angeles International Airport. As part of the plea deal, the original misdemeanor drunk-driving charges were dismissed. Addison was sentenced to 12 months' probation, a $390 fine, and must complete two online courses, allowing him to focus on his NFL career while the matter remains under league review.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has refuted false rumors circulating on social media that claim wildlife is fleeing Yellowstone National Park in large numbers. Viral videos, believed to be AI-generated, depict herds of bison, bears, and other animals supposedly migrating away from the park, fueling speculation about a pending supervolcano eruption. Park officials and wildlife experts have confirmed these claims are baseless, stating that animal movements are normal and that there is no unusual activity. The current volcanic alert level for Yellowstone remains "normal," and the NPS is working to correct the widespread misinformation.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had previously held up the measures due to concerns over a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that Slovakia received necessary guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including further restrictions on the Nord Stream pipelines and cutting more Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noticing mild swelling in his legs. Trump's physician described the condition as "benign" and common in older adults, and a letter from the doctor affirmed the president remains in "excellent health." CVI is a circulatory issue where damaged valves in leg veins have difficulty returning blood to the heart, which can cause swelling and varicose veins. Treatment is typically non-surgical, focusing on compression, exercise, and managing symptoms to prevent complications like skin ulcers.</p>

          <p>Analysts anticipate that the fentanyl crisis will be a key topic in upcoming U.S.-China trade discussions, an issue that has been largely absent from recent talks. The powerful synthetic opioid has become a leading cause of death for young adults in the U.S., elevating it to a major national security and public health concern. Addressing the flow of fentanyl precursors from China could serve as a point of leverage in broader bilateral negotiations. Some experts believe that cooperation on this issue could help ease economic tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Brazil's exports of rare earth minerals to China tripled in the first half of 2025, a surge that coincides with record-high Chinese imports of these strategic materials. This significant increase is viewed by analysts as a consequence of the ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, which may be rerouting global supply chains. As the U.S. and China impose trade barriers on each other, emerging economies like Brazil appear to be absorbing some of the impact. The trend suggests China is actively diversifying its access to critical minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing.</p>

Net income for the quarter reached $3.1 billion, a significant increase from the previous year. However, the company cautioned that its operating margin would likely be lower in the second half of the year due to higher costs associated with a larger slate of upcoming content, causing a slight dip in its stock price.</p>
