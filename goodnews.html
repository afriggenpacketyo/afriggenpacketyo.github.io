          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, setting the fastest lap in Formula 1 history with a time of one minute and 18.792 seconds. He narrowly edged out McLaren's Lando Norris, who had momentarily held the top spot. Verstappen's teammate Oscar Piastri qualified third, followed by the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. However, a five-place grid penalty for Hamilton will promote Mercedes' George Russell to fifth for the start of the race, setting the stage for a competitive Grand Prix.</p>

          <p>For individuals looking to enter the cryptocurrency market with a small amount, such as $100, the article suggests focusing on Bitcoin. It outlines two primary methods: direct purchase of a fraction of a Bitcoin or investing in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The article highlights that ETFs, like the iShares Bitcoin Trust, offer a convenient and low-cost way to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without directly owning the asset. It emphasizes that these funds are designed to track Bitcoin's price on a one-to-one basis, making them a straightforward option for new investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major conservation effort is underway at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a settlement led to the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The deal, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a five-year restoration project aimed at reviving native ecosystems and enhancing biodiversity. The plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to manage invasive plant species. While the transition marks a hopeful new chapter for conservationists, it has also created tension within the local community, which is losing a significant part of its historic agricultural identity and organic dairy supply.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families have participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, marking a significant shift towards greater acceptance within the Catholic Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing that the Jubilee is a time to restore dignity to all, especially those who have been denied it. Participants credited the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming environment, contrasting sharply with the exclusion felt during previous Holy Years. The pilgrimage, officially listed in the Vatican's calendar, is seen as a day of celebration and hope for the community's relationship with the church.</p>

          <p>In response to new state mandates banning cellphones in classrooms, school districts across the U.S. are implementing the use of Yondr pouches, which are locked magnetic cases for students' phones. An estimated 2.5 million students now use the system, where they keep their phones in the locked pouches during the school day, unlocking them with magnets at school exits. While some students and parents welcome the change to reduce distractions, others have expressed frustration and found ways to circumvent the system. Educators hope the pouches will foster a more engaged and focused learning environment for students.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its anti-corruption campaign within the financial sector, a move that analysts believe will enhance long-term confidence among overseas investors by promoting cleaner governance. The initiative, which has expanded from banking into the stock market, recently targeted a high-profile figure in the industry for investigation by the Communist Party's disciplinary unit. While the crackdown may not provide an immediate boost to market sentiment due to existing uncertainties, it is seen as a crucial step toward aligning with the expectations of international institutions for a more transparent and predictable business environment.

          <p>Archaeologists in Camden, South Carolina, have uncovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal conflicts. To identify these long-forgotten individuals, experts are now turning to forensic genealogy, a modern technique combining DNA analysis with family tree research. The project, described as the "ultimate cold case," has already generated genetic profiles for two soldiers, revealing thousands of living genetic matches. Researchers are now appealing to the public, particularly those with specific family names from the era, to submit DNA to help restore the identities of these first American soldiers.</p>

The system is designed to warn the public of life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks by sending a loud, siren-like alert to 4G and 5G mobile phones. This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that experienced technical issues, which the government says have since been addressed.

The proposal urges PepsiCo to refranchise its bottling network, a move that would reverse a costly 2010 decision to vertically integrate these operations. Elliott also recommends optimizing the company's product portfolio by divesting underperforming brands like Quaker and reinvesting in core franchises such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew. The firm believes these changes could unlock substantial value and provide at least 50% upside for shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy advocates for renting over buying a home, even for those who can afford to purchase property outright. After owning four homes, she and her husband sold them all and returned to renting, a decision she says accelerated their wealth-building by freeing up capital for investment and reducing the stress of property management. Joy argues that homeownership comes with significant hidden costs, such as maintenance and renovations, and that being a landlord can be an emotional and financial burden. For her, renting offers greater financial flexibility and a lifestyle more conducive to focusing on her business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book showcases the largely unseen jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese Jewish émigré best known for her street photography. In the early 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document the American jazz scene, capturing the complex emotions of both musicians and audiences. Her work reveals not only moments of joy and rapture but also the wariness and pain of artists like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, who faced racism and persecution despite their fame. The project was ultimately abandoned due to McCarthy-era suspicion of her politics, leaving behind a powerful but incomplete portrait of a pivotal era in music.</p>
