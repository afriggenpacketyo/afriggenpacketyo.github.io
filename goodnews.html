          <p>As the Federal Reserve contemplates future rate cuts, savings experts are advising consumers on the most beneficial certificate of deposit (CD) terms. Short-term CDs are currently offering the highest interest rates, making them ideal for maximizing returns, while long-term CDs provide stability and security for those with a solid emergency fund. A CD ladder, which combines short-term and long-term CDs, offers flexibility and access to cash at regular intervals. Experts emphasize the importance of shopping around and understanding early withdrawal penalties before investing in a CD. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite high hopes for elevating soccer's profile in the United States, recent major soccer events have faced challenges in drawing large crowds. The expanded Club World Cup and Concacaf Gold Cup have seen underwhelming attendance figures, even with price cuts. While the U.S. men's national team secured a 5-0 victory in their Gold Cup opener, the turnout was modest. The article suggests that high ticket prices and a lack of widespread enthusiasm may be contributing to the attendance issues. Despite the challenges, the quality of soccer remains high, providing entertainment for those who do attend.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares have increased following President Trump's approval of its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. The approval is contingent on a national security agreement, which includes a "golden share" for the U.S. government. The golden share gives the U.S. president veto power over key decisions, such as relocating the company's headquarters or transferring production outside the U.S.. Despite Trump's description of the deal as a "partnership," U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America.</p>
