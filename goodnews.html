          <p>Major League Baseball has unveiled a unique new trophy, the "Vedder Cup," a custom Fender Telecaster guitar, to be awarded to the winner of the season series between the Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres. Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, who has ties to both cities, personally played the guitar for an hour to infuse it with "spiritual energy" before its debut. The trophy features Vedder's personal touches and a logo for EB Research Partnership, a nonprofit co-founded by him, aiming to raise awareness for epidermolysis bullosa. This creative initiative seeks to formalize a West Coast rivalry and bring attention to a significant cause, with the Mariners winning the inaugural season series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia announced stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue, with data center revenue surging 56% year-over-year to $41.1 billion, despite falling slightly short of analyst estimates for that segment. The company anticipates continued sales growth above 50% this quarter, signaling sustained demand for AI infrastructure. Net income increased by 59% to $26.42 billion, and the board approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. While gaming revenue also grew, the data center business, fueled by large cloud providers and Blackwell chip sales, remains the primary growth engine, with the company projecting trillions in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end.</p>

          <p>YouTube TV and Fox have reached a last-minute, short-term agreement, preventing a blackout of Fox channels for millions of subscribers just days before the start of the college football and NFL seasons. The dispute centers on programming fees, with YouTube alleging Fox demands payments significantly higher than comparable content providers. This resolution allows ongoing negotiations to secure a long-term deal, avoiding disruption to major sporting events and popular news programs. The incident highlights the growing challenges in distribution fee negotiations as streaming services gain market share and traditional pay-TV models evolve.</p>

          <p>Florida's controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility in the Everglades is expected to be vacated within days, complying with a federal judge's order for its closure. The camp, touted by Donald Trump and criticized for harsh conditions, faced multiple lawsuits from environmental groups and the ACLU, alleging irreparable damage to wetlands and human rights abuses, including lack of access to attorneys and deplorable living conditions. Despite an appeal by Governor Ron DeSantis's administration, a state official confirmed the imminent removal of all detainees. This marks a significant victory for advocates who highlighted issues like worms in food, overflowing toilets, and extreme temperatures at the hastily constructed site.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 16:55:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Edmunds analysis highlights five common and costly mistakes consumers make when purchasing a car, especially as record numbers commit to high monthly payments. These include buying beyond one's financial means, relying solely on dealership financing, trading in a car with negative equity, neglecting internet sales teams, and overlooking used car options. With average new vehicle prices at $49,000 and high interest rates, experts advise securing preapproved loans, considering shorter terms, and exploring certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid significant financial pitfalls. Avoiding these errors can save thousands and ensure long-term financial security, as car buying is a major financial decision.</p>

          <p>Southern California is bracing for potential rainfall, thunderstorms, and dangerous surf as the remnants of Tropical Storm Juliette move north off the coast of Mexico. Forecasters anticipate scattered showers and a slight chance of thunderstorms from Wednesday night into Thursday, with some areas, particularly from San Diego to the Coachella Valley, possibly receiving up to a quarter-inch of rain. While the bulk of the moisture is expected to stay south and east of Los Angeles County, increased rip currents pose a significant hazard along the coast. Juliette is projected to dissipate by Thursday, but its lingering effects will bring unusual weather to the region.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 16:28:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a nearly 90% chance of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, savers holding Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts should act strategically to maximize their earnings. Experts advise shopping online for the highest rates, as online banks often offer better returns due to lower overhead costs. It is crucial to determine the precise amount affordable for deposit to avoid early withdrawal penalties, which can negate earned interest. Additionally, seeking the longest-term CD that fits one's budget is recommended, as this can secure higher returns over time and provide protection against economic volatility.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners seeking additional financing in September may find a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) particularly advantageous due to favorable market conditions. HELOCs currently offer lower interest rates compared to home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards, making them one of the cheapest borrowing options. The variable nature of HELOC rates means they could become even more affordable with an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut this month. Furthermore, rising home equity levels across the country provide homeowners with a substantial funding source. While attractive, borrowers should carefully calculate repayment capacity to avoid over-borrowing, ensuring financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kohl's stock jumped 24% after the retailer surpassed Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations for its fiscal second quarter, despite a continued decline in sales. The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance, reflecting an improved outlook, and revised its earnings per share guidance upward. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed slower sales to lower- and middle-income customers trading down but outlined initiatives like reintroducing petite sections, expanding jewelry, and overhauling discount strategies to regain customers. Despite ongoing leadership turmoil and several years of declining annual revenue, the results indicate progress in inventory reduction and expense management, with sales trends improving throughout the quarter.</p>

          <p>As a Federal Reserve rate cut looms, individuals considering a $40,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account can still find substantial interest-earning potential, despite the common perception that stock market investments yield higher returns. For example, a $40,000 CD can earn between approximately $423 for a 3-month term at 4.30% and $9,018 for a 5-year term at 4.15%. Savers must weigh the guaranteed, predictable returns and principal protection offered by CDs against the volatility of the stock market. Deciding whether a CD is worthwhile depends on individual financial goals, budget, and the ability to commit funds for the full term. (not investment advice)</p>

Cracker Barrel conceded it "could've done a better job" communicating its brand identity, ultimately deciding to retain the original design.
