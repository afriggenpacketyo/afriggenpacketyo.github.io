          <p>Oliver Widger, an Oregon man known as "sailing_with_phoenix," quit his job and used his retirement savings to sail to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix, documenting the journey on social media. He was welcomed by cheering fans and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green at the Waikiki Yacht Club. Widger, who has Klippel-Feil syndrome, said his diagnosis pushed him to pursue a life worth living, inspiring others to break out of their routines. The scariest part of the trip was when a rudder failed, but he also enjoyed seeing dolphins and whales during calm periods at sea.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions and increase salaries for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to attract talent as Japanese cuisine gains global popularity. The annual salary will increase to over 6 million yen ($41,000), and chefs can opt for government-covered rented accommodation. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food. The government aims to fill vacancies at approximately a dozen out of 230 missions and hopes the new system will enable chefs to develop their careers more easily.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, making it the first train company to transfer to public ownership under Labour. The government has hailed the move as a "new dawn for rail" and will integrate SWR trains into Great British Railways (GBR). While the government does not promise lower fares, they assure passengers they will get "great value for money". Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives said Labour must "deliver on their promises".</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has committed to fully reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrapping the two-child benefit cap if elected. This announcement puts pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced calls from Labour MPs to address both policies. Reform UK plans to fund these policies by cutting net zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The move highlights divisions within the Labour party regarding welfare policies, with over 10 million pensioners losing out on winter fuel payments last year.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges have become a significant problem at the World Exposition in Osaka, causing distress to visitors and raising concerns about potential health issues. The small flies are present on walls and pillars, forcing people to avoid swallowing them. While the midges do not bite, their dead bodies can cause asthma and allergic reactions if inhaled. The expo organizer is taking action by spraying insecticide, treating areas with a growth inhibitor, and installing insect repellent lights, while the Osaka governor has sought cooperation from an insecticide maker.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the Canadian parliament, a move seen as a strong affirmation of Canada's sovereignty and independence against US President Donald Trump's suggestions that Canada would be better off as a US state. This marks a shift from previous Liberal governments, with a British monarch not delivering Canada's throne speech since 1977. The invitation comes at a time when Canada faces economic challenges due to tariffs imposed by the US, and serves as a symbolic display of Canada's distinct identity.</p>
