          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton critiques President Trump's second term, describing it as incoherent and driven by retribution. He contrasts Trump's approach with fascism, arguing that Trump lacks a cohesive philosophy and grand strategy.

He expresses concern over constitutional infringements but believes American institutions are strong enough to withstand Trump's actions, predicting that many of his initiatives will ultimately fail in the courts.</p>
