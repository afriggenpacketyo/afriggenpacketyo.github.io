          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom for a series of engagements, beginning his visit by attending the WellChild charity awards in London. Upon his arrival, he visited Windsor to lay a wreath at the chapel where his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, is buried, marking the third anniversary of her death. His visit has prompted speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, whom he has not seen in person since February 2024. Prince Harry's wife, Meghan, and their children have remained in California while he undertakes his week-long schedule of events in the UK.</p>

According to a new filing, the company plans to sell over 34 million shares at a price range of $22 to $25 each. The IPO, which will see the company trade on the NYSE under the symbol "STUB," had been previously postponed due to market volatility. This move comes as the IPO market shows signs of recovery, with several other major companies also preparing for public debuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has been discovered on an exterior wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a wig and robe striking a protester on the ground, and its appearance follows recent mass arrests at a pro-Palestine protest. Banksy authenticated the piece via his Instagram account, a standard practice for the artist. Despite the public interest, court officials have stated that the artwork will be removed because the building is a listed structure, and it has already been covered with plastic sheeting and barriers while police investigate it as criminal damage.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,600 per ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid growing global uncertainty and signs of a weakening U.S. labor market. Despite the record price, some financial analysts believe the rally may continue, with major banks like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan forecasting further increases into 2026. Factors such as potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and gold's role as a hedge against inflation and market volatility are cited as reasons why it may still be a strategic investment for portfolio diversification.

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued an apology after the finisher medals distributed to 60,000 participants mistakenly featured an aerial view of the nearby city of Sunderland and the River Wear. The half marathon route runs through Newcastle, Gateshead, and South Shields along the River Tyne. In a humorous statement, the Great Run Company acknowledged the geographical error, calling the medals and matching T-shirts "the most unique... in Great North Run history." The mistake sparked jokes on social media, particularly given the historic football rivalry between Newcastle and Sunderland, with some noting the medal's ribbon was even in Sunderland's team colors.</p>

Stern, whose current multi-million dollar contract expires at the end of the year, assured his audience that talks with the satellite radio company are ongoing.

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously upheld the $83.3 million judgment awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll in her defamation case against Donald Trump. The court rejected Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he was protected by presidential immunity, ruling that the jury's award was "fair and reasonable" given the facts. This decision affirms the second of two successful lawsuits Carroll brought against Trump, who was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation. Carroll's attorney expressed hope that this ruling would bring an end to the appellate process and deliver final justice.</p>
