        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid uncertainty over US commitments and the ongoing threat from Russia, Germany is deepening its security and defense cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new "E3" alliance. Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, focusing on mutual assistance and arms cooperation. This strategic pivot reflects a European effort to build greater self-reliance in defense, although officials acknowledge that replacing the US security guarantee entirely is currently unrealistic. The move also comes as Germany navigates strained relations with other partners like Poland over border control issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the third round of The Open championship, golfer Rory McIlroy experienced a highly unusual moment on the 11th hole. While hitting his ball from the rough, his swing unearthed a second, previously hidden golf ball that was buried directly underneath his own. The bizarre incident, which McIlroy called the "most weird, ridiculous thing," was caught on camera and left him in disbelief. Despite the strange event and a bogey on that hole, McIlroy had a strong round, finishing 5-under par for the day.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler has established a commanding four-shot lead going into the final day of The Open at Royal Portrush. He finished the third round with a bogey-free 67, positioning himself at 14-under par for the tournament. A victory would mark his first Open Championship and the third leg of a career Grand Slam. While competitors like Rory McIlroy showed moments of brilliance, none could consistently match Scheffler's solid and mistake-free performance, leaving him as the clear favorite.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to securing a move to Barcelona, initially on loan with an option to buy. The 27-year-old has been out of favor at his current club, having not played since being dropped by manager Ruben Amorim in December. Barcelona has expressed long-standing interest in Rashford, viewing him as a way to strengthen their attack after failing to sign other targets. The loan structure is financially advantageous for the Spanish club, which continues to navigate economic constraints.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the Wallabies 27-19 in a physical first-Test match in Brisbane, Australia. The victory was heavily influenced by the "immense" performance of flankers Tadhg Beirne and Tom Curry, who were dominant in defense and at the breakdown. Curry, in particular, delivered a powerful performance, scoring a try and setting an aggressive tone from the start. Despite a late-game lapse in discipline that allowed Australia to narrow the score, the Lions held on for a crucial win to open the series.</p>

          <p>Members of Generation Life, a Pennsylvania-based Catholic activist group, recently visited the Jersey shore to advocate for "chastity before marriage" among their Gen Z peers. The article explores the challenges and strategies of promoting this message in an era of shifting sexual norms and the pervasive influence of social media. The activists attempt to reframe chastity not merely as abstinence, but as a "countercultural" path to deeper, more meaningful relationships, arguing it offers an alternative to the perceived superficiality and pressures of modern dating. Their approach focuses on a broader concept of dignity and self-worth.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than initially anticipated. Muncy, who was injured in a slide on July 2, has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings, reporting that his knee feels great. Doctors informed him that a slight difference in the timing of the impact could have resulted in a season-ending surgery. While no firm timeline is set for his return, the team is optimistic it will be "a lot sooner than anticipated," providing a potential boost for the struggling Dodgers offense.</p>

          <p>The second-quarter earnings season is underway, with early results from major financial and healthcare companies presenting a mixed but generally manageable picture. While some firms like Wells Fargo and Abbott Labs faced stock pullbacks due to conservative outlooks, underlying business metrics showed areas of strength, such as BlackRock's organic growth. The reports indicate that companies are navigating a complex economic environment shaped by inflation and potential tariffs. This article suggests that initial negative market reactions may be short-sighted, as deeper analysis often reveals a more resilient corporate landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
