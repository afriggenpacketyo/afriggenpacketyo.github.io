          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure firm Nebius Group experienced a 40% surge following the announcement of a multi-billion-dollar deal with Microsoft to provide cloud computing power for AI workloads. The deal, valued at up to $19.4 billion, will extend through 2031 and involves Nebius providing GPUs for training AI models. This news also positively impacted shares of rival AI infrastructure firm CoreWeave, suggesting strong demand for powerful computing equipment in the AI sector. The Nebius-Microsoft agreement indicates ongoing growth in the AI infrastructure market, despite recent concerns about a potential bubble, with Nvidia projecting trillions in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. The market seems to be stabilizing.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that Americans are feeling more optimistic about retirement, with fewer believing it will "take a miracle" to achieve a secure retirement. This increased confidence is partly attributed to the S&P 500's strong performance in recent years. However, a majority still worry about instability, with top concerns including living longer than expected, potential cuts to Social Security benefits, and the impact of high inflation. The U.S. ranked 21st in Natixis' ranking of best countries for retirees, and Americans expect to retire at 64 but face a savings gap (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Several Democratic governors are intensifying efforts to combat crime as President Trump considers deploying the National Guard to cities struggling with high crime rates. Governors in Maryland, New Mexico, and California have announced new initiatives to address crime in their states. These actions come after Trump federalized Washington, D.C.'s police department and threatened to send the National Guard to other cities. Despite criticizing Trump's approach as authoritarian, these Democratic governors are implementing their own strategies to reduce crime, and some see this as a positive development in public safety. The crackdown may bring more stability to the cities affected.</p>

          <p>Mitchum has issued an apology and recall for some of its roll-on deodorant products after customers reported experiencing itchy and burning armpits. Consumers took to social media to share their experiences, describing symptoms such as "agonising weeping spots," redness, and irritation. The company attributed the issue to a change in the manufacturing process affecting one of its raw materials, impacting how the roll-on interacts with the skin. Mitchum has since reverted to the original manufacturing process and is working to remove the affected products from stores, advising customers to contact its customer service team. This is not expected to have a long-term effect on the company's performance.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 10:13:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With competitive interest rates currently offered on certificates of deposit (CDs), experts are weighing the options of opening multiple CDs versus a jumbo CD account. As a rate cut from the Federal Reserve is likely, savers with significant cash reserves may consider locking in a high rate now. The decision depends on factors like minimum deposit requirements, interest rates, flexibility, and FDIC insurance limits. While jumbo CDs typically offer higher rates, traditional CDs can match or beat them for shorter terms, and a CD ladder strategy can provide more flexibility (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Subtle Interview Habits That Are Red Flags, According to CEO</h2>

          <p>A CEO shares three subtle habits that can be red flags in job interviews, based on experience interviewing over 500 candidates. These include lateness, answers lacking personal experience, and low energy. The CEO advises candidates to be early, communicate any unavoidable delays, replace buzzwords with proof, and use the STAR method to structure answers. The CEO emphasizes the importance of showing enthusiasm and letting interviewers see the real personality, as energy is a crucial signal. With some effort, these bad habits can be avoided.</p>

          <p>A Philadelphia Phillies fan, Drew Feltwell, caught a home run ball and placed it in his son's glove, but then gave it to a woman who claimed it was hers. Feltwell explained that he wanted to de-escalate the situation and teach his son a lesson about handling conflict. Despite his son's initial disappointment, a Marlins representative gave the family souvenirs, and a Phillies representative arranged for them to meet Harrison Bader, who signed a bat for Lincoln. Feltwell holds no ill will toward the woman and hopes to retrieve the ball for his son, but the incident has been resolved amicably. The incident shows the fan's good character.</p>

          <p>Thailand has lifted a decades-long ban on working rights for long-term refugees from Myanmar due to US aid cuts and an influx of new refugees. The move aims to help refugees support themselves and their families, with the UN Refugee Agency welcoming the decision as a potential regional benchmark. The Thai government's policy shift comes as foreign aid to the camps has dwindled, leading to cancelled rations and rising malnutrition rates. The refugees will now have the opportunity to seek employment outside of the camps, improving their economic prospects. The situation is improving for these refugees.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers are facing an unusual problem with their bullpen, requiring them to rely more on their starting pitching for a chance to win another World Series. Manager Dave Roberts is pushing starters like Tyler Glasnow and Yoshinobu Yamamoto to pitch deeper into games. The Dodgers' bullpen ranks 19th in the majors in ERA, making strong starts crucial for their success. However, pitching deep into postseason games is different, and the team may face tough decisions based on the performance of their starters. The team is making adjustments to their strategy.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in California are working to protect a historic grove of ancient giant sequoia trees in the Sierra National Forest as the Garnet fire spreads. The fire reached McKinley Grove, home to about 170 giant sequoias, but crews have installed a 24-hour sprinkler system and cleared fuel buildup around the trees. Smokejumpers are also climbing trees to extinguish embers, and firefighters are employing aggressive tactics to contain the fire. As of Monday evening, the Garnet fire had burned 54,925 acres and was 14% contained, and the efforts to protect the trees are ongoing. The community is working hard to save the trees.</p>

          <p>Saving money in an inflationary economy can be challenging, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer higher returns than the current inflation rate. CDs provide a safe investment with FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000, and savers can lock in high rates for the term of the CD. Current national average CD yields range from 1.69% to 2.03%, but top CDs offer rates as high as 4.45% APY for shorter terms. Strategies for securing good CD rates include exploring online banks and considering short-term CDs (not investment advice).</p>
