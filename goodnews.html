        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Indianapolis Colts have announced Daniel Jones as their starting quarterback for Week 1, ahead of former No. 4 overall pick Anthony Richardson. Head coach Shane Steichen expressed confidence in Jones's ability, stating he will have a long leash in the role. Jones, who signed a one-year deal with the Colts in the offseason, beat out Richardson after splitting first-team reps during training camp and the first two preseason games. This decision marks a significant moment for the Colts as they aim to improve upon their 8-9 record last season and potentially return to the playoffs.</p>

The market anticipates at least 50 basis points of Federal Reserve rate reductions by year-end, which could stimulate the housing market and boost Home Depot's business.

          <p>A California couple, Anteres Anderson Turner and Louis Turner, have found a 'surrogate grandmother' for their twin boys through a Facebook group called Surrogate Grandparents USA. Janet Firestein Daw, who longed for grandchildren, connected with the Turners online and quickly became an integral part of their family, affectionately known as 'Nana J.' This unconventional arrangement fills a void for both parties, providing the boys with a grandparent figure and Firestein Daw with the joys of grandparenthood. The relationship has brought a sense of completeness to the Turner family, highlighting a growing trend in modern family structures.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's moral dilemma regarding an aging, unpleasant stepfather who lives next door to her sister. The reader, despite her stepfather's past meanness and dislike for her, feels guilty about actively ignoring him as he is now in his 90s with no other family. The columnist advises showing kindness and checking on him, suggesting that acting generously can be a form of 'rebalancing the scales' rather than harboring 'petty grievances.' This perspective emphasizes rising above past animosities to offer compassion to a diminished antagonist.</p>

          <p>Despite past skepticism from figures like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth regarding women's roles in the military, TikTok has emerged as an unexpected and effective recruitment tool for young American female soldiers. The app, which Congress has considered banning on national-security grounds, helps the armed forces attract recruits in a tight labor market. This development highlights a unique intersection of social media trends and military enlistment, underscoring the evolving methods used to appeal to potential service members. The military continues to find diverse ways to fill its ranks, embracing platforms that reach younger demographics.</p>

          <p>The PGA Tour will make its return to Donald Trump’s Blue Monster course at Trump National Doral in Miami in 2026, marking the end of a decade-long absence from Trump-owned venues. The Miami Championship, a $20 million Signature Event, will be held in May 2026, re-establishing Doral as a key PGA calendar site. The Tour's previous departure in 2016 was attributed to sponsorship issues, despite coinciding with Trump's presidential campaign. This return comes at a transitional period for the PGA Tour, expanding its roster of Signature Events and adding to a crowded spring schedule.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly reshaping teaching practices, with educators like Jerome Ong integrating AI tools weekly to enhance learning while also demonstrating its limitations to students. A new initiative, backed by Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic, plans to train hundreds of thousands of American Federation of Teachers members in AI usage. Advocates highlight AI's potential to save teachers nearly six hours a week in preparation, empowering them with more information and streamlined lesson planning. However, critics raise concerns about cheating and potential declines in critical thinking skills if AI is not used responsibly, emphasizing the need for teacher support over tech alliances.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates, emphasizing their role as a secure investment that can outpace inflation. It highlights that while national average rates are lower, top CD rates from online banks are significantly higher, often reaching over 4%. The piece explains that short-term CDs (6 months to 1 year) currently offer the best rates due to an inverted yield curve, suggesting a 'laddering' strategy to leverage these high rates for long-term savings. CDs offer predictability and FDIC/NCUA insurance, making them an attractive option for protecting and growing savings. (not investment advice)</p>
