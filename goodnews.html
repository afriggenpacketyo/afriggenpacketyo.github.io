          <p>Throughout June, communities worldwide have been celebrating Pride Month with parades and festivals, commemorating the LGBTQ community's history and ongoing fight for equality. The tradition, rooted in the 1969 Stonewall Uprising, has grown from a New York City event into a global phenomenon recognized federally in the U.S. since 1999. This article showcases images from various celebrations, from Washington D.C. to Kathmandu, capturing the vibrant and diverse expressions of pride and activism. These events serve as a powerful symbol of both progress and the persistent struggle for rights and inclusion.</p>

          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP) is working to uncover and honor the forgotten history of Black individuals who were lynched in the region. The interracial coalition recently placed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician killed by a mob in 1924, after discovering his story through the Equal Justice Initiative. This effort involves collecting soil from lynching sites and researching other victims whose stories have been lost over time. Despite some local resistance, the group's work is seen by its members as a vital act of remembrance and reconciliation, especially in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>In an unusual retail move, Trader Joe's has opened a new, larger store in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, situated directly across the street from one of its older, smaller locations. The company initially planned to close the original 1973 store but ultimately decided to keep both operating, citing the tremendous business in the area. The new store is about 40% bigger and features a spacious underground parking garage, a major draw for customers who found the old lot cramped. While some shoppers are excited by the upgrade, many loyal customers plan to continue frequenting the cozier, more familiar original store.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy shift driven by the war in Ukraine and a potential new Trump presidency, Germany is planning to build the largest military in Europe. Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that the government will now provide the military with the necessary funding to become the continent's strongest armed force, aiming to spend 3.5% of its GDP on defense. This move involves a constitutional change to suspend Germany's "debt brake," allowing for nearly $400 billion in defense spending through 2029 without cutting social programs. The decision marks a historic reversal of Germany's post-war pacifist stance, reflecting a new sense of urgency in European security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column critiques conservative gay figures like Richard Grenell for attempting to impose "respectability politics" on the LGBTQ+ community by distancing themselves from its more flamboyant and gender-nonconforming members. The author argues that the spirit of Pride and the history of the gay rights movement are rooted in diversity and progress, not in appealing to the mainstream for acceptance. Citing the foundational role of drag queens and trans individuals at Stonewall, the piece asserts that the movement's strength comes from its inclusivity. It concludes that attempts to create a "normal gay" narrative are disingenuous and betray the community's core values.</p>

          <p>Voters in Huntington Beach, California, delivered a significant rebuke to the city's MAGA-aligned city council by passing two ballot measures to protect their public libraries. The measures successfully dismantled a controversial parent review board that would have censored children's books and blocked the potential privatization of the library system. The victory was driven by Protect HB, a nonpartisan coalition of residents who felt the conservative council had overreached with its agenda. The outcome in the traditionally conservative Orange County city is being seen by some as a hopeful example of how grassroots organizing can effectively push back against extremist politics.</p>

A 24-year-old female, Rauhin, and her three offspring left for the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding as their lease agreement was set to expire. Their departure leaves just two pandas remaining in Japan, who are also scheduled to return to China by next February.

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on President Trump's recent use of an expletive when expressing frustration over the long-running conflict between two countries. The author suggests that while it breaks presidential norms, the moment came across as authentic and relatable to many who share similar frustrations with intractable problems. The article posits that judicious swearing can make politicians seem more human and trustworthy, cutting through scripted spin. While not advocating for constant profanity, the author argues that in a high-stakes situation, a well-placed curse can be a powerful and effective communication tool, even if it masks a leader's own complicity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Russia intensifies its drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, Ukraine is increasingly turning to interceptor drones as a key defensive strategy. These specialized, high-speed drones are being developed and deployed to counter Russian Shahed drones, which now fly at higher altitudes, making them difficult for mobile ground units to target. Experts argue that mass-producing these interceptor drones is a critical and more cost-effective solution than using expensive anti-aircraft missiles, which can cost up to $1 million per shot compared to around $5,000 for a drone. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has confirmed a focus on developing this technology.</p>
