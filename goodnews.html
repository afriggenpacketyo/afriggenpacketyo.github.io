          <h2>Study Links Dog Owner's Work Stress to Anxiety in Pets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 22:10:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their dogs. The research found a correlation between owners with high job stress and dogs exhibiting more stress-related behaviors such as whining, pacing, and restlessness. This "crossover" of stress is attributed to emotional contagion, where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues like tone of voice and body language. The article suggests that employed dog owners could benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect their pet's well-being.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's crucial two-run double in the fourth inning propelled the New York Mets to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers' overworked pitching staff faced further strain after a 13-inning game the previous night, forcing manager Dave Roberts to rely heavily on starter Tony Gonsolin. Gonsolin struggled with command in the fourth, issuing consecutive walks to load the bases before Soto's decisive hit. Mets starter David Peterson delivered a strong performance, pitching 7 ‚Öî innings and securing seven strikeouts.</p>

          <p>Oliver Widger, an Oregon man who quit his job and liquidated his retirement savings, completed his solo sailing journey to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix, and was met by cheering fans. Widger, who documented his trip on social media, gained a large following and was greeted by Hawaii Gov. Josh Green. Widger, who has Klippel-Feil syndrome, said the scariest part of the trip was when a rudder failed, but highlights included seeing dolphins and whales. He taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and spent months refitting his boat.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is increasing salaries and improving working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions due to growing global popularity of Japanese cuisine and intensifying competition for talent. Annual salaries will rise to over 6 million yen ($41,000), and chefs can opt for government-covered rented accommodation. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasizes the chefs' significant role in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food. The improvements aim to attract and retain skilled chefs, with about a dozen of Japan's 230 missions currently having vacancies.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges have become a significant problem at the World Exposition in Osaka, causing discomfort to visitors and raising concerns about potential health issues. The small flies are prevalent on walls and pillars of the Grand Ring, forcing people to avoid swallowing them. While the midges don't bite, dead ones can cause allergic reactions if inhaled. The expo organizer is spraying insecticide, treating areas with growth inhibitors, and installing insect repellent lights to combat the issue.</p>

          <p>New York City's 14 miles of public beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, fewer than the city needs. The Parks and Recreation Department expects staffing to increase as students finish classes and summer arrives, and there are 374 new lifeguards in training. The city is offering incentives like higher wages and signing bonuses to attract lifeguards and has improved lifeguard stations. Some beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, while others said they have grown accustomed to being more cautious due to the shortage.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to King Charles III to open the Canadian parliament is being interpreted as a strong statement of Canada's sovereignty and independence in the face of perceived threats from US President Donald Trump. This move, contrasting past political debates over the monarchy's role, highlights Canada's distinct identity and traditions. The King's visit underscores Canada's separation from the US and reinforces its parliamentary system modeled after Britain's Westminster system. This comes at a time when Canada is seeking to assert its independence amid trade tensions and political pressure from the United States.</p>
