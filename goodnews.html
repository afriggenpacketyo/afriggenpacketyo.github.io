        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of key European leaders has publicly stated that any peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, including a proposed meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, must involve Ukraine. While welcoming U.S. diplomatic efforts, they stressed that a just and lasting peace cannot be decided without Kyiv's participation and must include robust security guarantees. The statement comes as the White House remains open to inviting Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to the summit, which Russia's Putin initially requested be a bilateral meeting. This diplomatic pressure underscores European concerns about potential agreements made without Ukrainian consent.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose won his first PGA Tour title in over two years, defeating American JJ Spaun in a three-hole sudden-death playoff at the St. Jude Championship in Memphis. Rose, 45, clinched the victory with a birdie on the third playoff hole after both players matched each other with a par and then a birdie on the first two. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with a one-stroke lead but finished one shot back, tied for third. The victory marks a significant return to form for Rose and secures his place in the next stage of the PGA Tour playoffs.</p>

          <p>In University Place, Washington, a botched attempt to tow a broken-down car resulted in significant damage to a local restaurant. Surveillance footage captured the incident, showing a tow strap snapping multiple times, causing the runaway sedan to roll back and crash into the Pho and Teriyaki storefront on three separate occasions. After several failed attempts to secure and remove the vehicle, the driver and a passenger ultimately abandoned the car in the parking lot and fled the scene. The Pierce County Sheriff's office is investigating the event as a hit-and-run, as the restaurant sustained considerable structural damage.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented arrangement, chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have reportedly agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of the revenue from specific AI chips sold to China. In return, the companies will receive export licenses to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export controls. This deal highlights the White House's strategy of using exceptions to its tariff and export policies as a bargaining tool amid ongoing economic tensions with Beijing. The agreement was reported shortly after Nvidia's CEO met with President Trump to discuss the matter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued a public apology following criticism that a slip-on shoe he created with Adidas culturally appropriated traditional Mexican huarache sandals. The controversy, which drew comments from Mexico's president, centered on the fact that the design was produced without consulting or crediting the Indigenous Oaxacan communities who originated it. In his statement, Chavarria expressed deep regret for not partnering with the community. Adidas has also apologized, removed promotional images of the shoe, and stated its commitment to engaging in a respectful dialogue with the community to repair the damage.</p>

          <p>In an interview, leading historian Rana Mitter argues that the significance of World War II in shaping modern China is frequently underestimated in both China and the West. Mitter, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, explains that Japan's invasion shattered much of the country's infrastructure and communications networks that had been built in the preceding decades. This widespread destruction forced China to essentially start over after the war. The article highlights his perspective that understanding this historical context is crucial for comprehending China's subsequent political and societal development in the 20th century.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked a Trump administration directive that would have allowed commercial fishing in the protected Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument. The ruling overturns a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that sought to reverse Obama-era protections, stating the agency violated federal law by bypassing the required public notice and comment process. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, who filed the lawsuit, celebrated the decision as a major victory for the rule of law and the preservation of the monument's unique ecosystems, which are vital for endangered species and Indigenous culture.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Community Shield match against Crystal Palace served as the first major test for the team's revamped lineup, revealing both brilliant potential and areas needing improvement. Four new summer signings started, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz, who was a standout performer, and new goal-scorers Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong. However, the team twice surrendered a lead to draw 2-2 before losing on penalties, highlighting defensive vulnerabilities and a need for more time to adapt. Manager Arne Slot acknowledged that while his team doesn't concede many chances, they concede goals too easily, indicating that work remains to fix the bugs in his new system.</p>
