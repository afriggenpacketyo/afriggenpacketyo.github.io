          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 11:36:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, now an independent MP, has announced the formation of a new political party aimed at providing an alternative to the current UK political system. Co-founded with independent MP Zarah Sultana, the yet-unnamed party will campaign for a mass redistribution of wealth and address issues like child poverty and corporate profits. Corbyn described the new venture as a community-led, grassroots movement, contrasting it with what he called the "top-down" control of the Labour Party. The party's inaugural conference is planned for the autumn to establish its platform and policies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 11:35:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters surged, marking its entry into the recent wave of meme stock rallies. The jump is linked to a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and significant interest from retail investors on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. The stock's high short interest, with over 13% of its shares sold short, makes it a target for a potential short squeeze. This rally offers a temporary reprieve for the company's stock, which had fallen approximately 35% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

While the size of his stake was not disclosed, he is one of the company's top five investors and plans to be an active partner.

          <p>Southern California Edison (SCE) has announced it will establish a compensation fund for victims of the deadly Eaton wildfire from January, even before investigators have officially determined the fire's cause. The utility's aging equipment is a leading theory for the ignition source. The Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program, developed with the creators of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, aims to provide an expedited process for resolving claims without lengthy litigation. This proactive move allows community members to begin rebuilding while the official investigation by the Los Angeles fire department continues.</p>

          <p>The Labubu doll, a creation of Chinese retailer Pop Mart, has become a global phenomenon, marking one of China's first homegrown international toy crazes. Known for their "ugly-cute" aesthetic and sold in "blind boxes," the dolls have sparked collecting mania, long queues, and explosive sales, with 40% of their $423 million in revenue coming from outside China. While China has long been the world's primary toy manufacturer, Labubu represents a significant shift as the country begins to export its own cultural products and intellectual property. The craze has now taken hold in the United States, driven by social media trends on platforms like TikTok.</p>

The two fighters' teams have been given 30 days to reach an agreement before the WBO will call for a purse bid to determine the fight's promotional rights.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced a new draft law to guarantee the independence of the country's key anti-corruption agencies. The move is a reversal, coming just days after his government passed legislation that curbed the bodies' autonomy, sparking the largest nationwide protests since Russia's 2022 invasion and drawing serious concern from Western partners. Zelensky stated the new, "balanced" bill would safeguard the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) from external influence. This reversal appears to be a direct response to both domestic and international pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to hold interest rates at 2%, pausing a year-long cycle of monetary policy easing that had seen eight consecutive cuts. The decision was widely expected as policymakers adopt a "wait and watch" approach amid significant economic uncertainty, particularly concerning future trade relations with the United States under President Trump. With inflation currently at the bank's 2% target, officials see no immediate need for further adjustments. ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized a data-dependent approach, stating the bank will reassess its stance at future meetings. (not investment advice)</p>
