          <p>Crystal Palace has advanced to the league phase of the UEFA Conference League following a 1-0 aggregate victory over Norwegian club Fredrikstad. This achievement marks a significant milestone in the club's first-ever European campaign, coming after a successful year that included winning the FA Cup and Community Shield. Despite being demoted from the Europa League due to multi-club ownership rules, the team is now seen as a potential contender in the third-tier European competition. Manager Oliver Glasner, who previously won the Europa League, has guided the team on a 13-game unbeaten run, though challenges remain regarding squad depth before the transfer deadline.</p>

          <p>ESPN has announced significant changes to its lead NBA broadcast team for the upcoming season, promoting analyst Tim Legler to join Mike Breen, Richard Jefferson, and Lisa Salters. This crew will call the NBA Finals and other major games on ABC and ESPN. Doris Burke, who made history as the first woman to serve as a TV game analyst for a major U.S. men's pro sports championship, has signed a multi-year extension but will move to a different broadcast team alongside announcer Dave Pasch. The network also announced a contract extension for Richard Jefferson, solidifying its on-air talent lineup for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit, allowing families of 9/11 victims to continue their legal action against the kingdom. The lawsuit alleges that the Saudi government provided material support to some of the al Qaeda hijackers involved in the 2001 terrorist attacks. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge George Daniels, stated that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles played by individuals with alleged ties to the Saudi government in assisting two of the hijackers. This decision paves the way for the case to potentially proceed to trial, a significant development enabled by the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.</p>

          <p>As Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto cracks down on illegal palm oil plantations to reclaim millions of hectares of forest, this opinion article argues that global demand, particularly from China, is crucial to the issue. The author asserts that each hectare of forest cleared for palm oil is directly linked to the consumption habits of foreign markets. While Indonesia has begun dismantling illegal operations, such as those in Tesso Nilo National Park, the piece suggests that the future of the nation's forests depends on consumer countries. China, as a major importer, has the potential to help rewrite the future of Indonesian palm oil by promoting sustainable practices.</p>

          <p>In a major NFL trade, the Dallas Cowboys have sent three-time All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. The move comes after a period of growing tension between Parsons and the Cowboys, during which he requested a trade and did not participate in full practices. As part of the deal, Parsons has agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history. The trade significantly alters the competitive landscape of the NFC, providing a major defensive boost to Green Bay while marking a dramatic shift for the Dallas franchise.</p>

          <p>With employee burnout reportedly at its highest level since 2016, a lifestyle expert suggests that workers can reduce stress by strategically managing their energy and daily routines. Author Maisha Wynn advises tackling demanding tasks like meetings and project planning during the first few hours of the day, when energy levels are highest. Simpler activities, such as returning emails, can be reserved for later. She also recommends building "micro routines," like doodling or listening to music, to create small moments of joy, and emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries by learning to say "no" to avoid becoming overwhelmed.</p>

          <p>Best Buy reported stronger-than-expected revenue and earnings for its second quarter, but the company maintained its cautious full-year forecast due to uncertainty surrounding tariffs. The consumer electronics retailer saw a 1.6% rise in comparable sales, its highest growth in three years, driven by mobile phones, gaming, and computing products. However, CEO Corie Barry noted that while the company is trending toward the higher end of its sales range, it is prudent to remain cautious about the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending. The company is navigating a challenging market where shoppers are deal-focused and thoughtful about large purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors facing out-of-pocket medical expenses not covered by Medicare, this article outlines several financial strategies to bridge the gap. One key option is Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, which is specifically designed to cover costs like copays and deductibles. Another tool available to homeowners aged 62 and older is a reverse mortgage, which allows them to access their home equity as a source of funds without requiring monthly repayments. Finally, purchasing an annuity can provide a guaranteed, consistent income stream in the future, offering a reliable way to pay for ongoing healthcare costs and ensuring financial peace of mind.

A White House spokesperson stated that the final details of the agreement are still being finalized by the Department of Commerce. Zinser also indicated that Intel may seek outside investment for its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies, as another way to raise capital to fund its growth in that sector.

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart. The deal, which could be a club-record transfer fee, is seen as a significant move that may impact the future of current striker Alexander Isak, who has been a target for Liverpool. Newcastle had previously indicated they would need to secure two quality strikers before considering an offer for Isak. The acquisition of Woltemade, a prolific scorer who recently starred in the Under-21 Euros, could be the first step in meeting that condition, potentially reopening the door for Liverpool's pursuit of the Swedish forward.</p>

Pure has begun recognizing revenue from the deal and expressed confidence in its continued expansion with Meta and other large-scale "hyperscaler" clients.

The article suggests that now could be a good time to consider a loan, as homeowners can tap into record-high levels of home equity while locking in a fixed interest rate, which protects against future market uncertainty. Additionally, using the funds for eligible home improvements could provide a tax deduction, further enhancing the loan's value for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

The strategy leverages the company's extensive logistics network to offer greater convenience and challenge traditional grocers and delivery services like Instacart.
