          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Will Smith, despite being a three-time All-Star and leading the National League in batting, often remains overlooked among the team's bigger stars like Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman. Now fully healthy after previous seasons were hampered by injuries, Smith is demonstrating elite production at a demanding position, drawing comparisons to legendary catchers. While his quiet, modest personality keeps him out of the national spotlight, his consistent, high-level performance is making it increasingly difficult for the baseball world to ignore his significant contributions to the team's success.</p>

          <p>Electric air taxi manufacturer Joby Aviation has announced a significant expansion of its production capabilities as it aims for a 2026 service launch. The company is starting production at a facility in Dayton, Ohio, and plans to double its capacity at its main manufacturing hub in Marina, California. This move, which caused the company's stock to jump, is part of a broader race among competitors to gain regulatory approval from the FAA and roll out electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles to alleviate urban traffic congestion.

          <p>General Motors announced it will expand its production of popular gasoline-powered vehicles by adding the Cadillac Escalade SUV and more light-duty pickup trucks to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. Production of the Escalade will move from Texas, while the plant will supplement the manufacturing of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks to meet strong consumer demand. This decision represents a continued investment in GM's traditional vehicle lineup, retooling a plant that was previously expected to become an electric vehicle-exclusive facility, reflecting a dual strategy in the evolving auto market.

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified the administration's decision to allow Nvidia to resume selling its H20 AI chips to China, stating the approved technology is significantly less advanced than what is available domestically. Lutnick emphasized that China would be receiving Nvidia's "fourth best" chip, a strategic move designed to keep Chinese developers reliant on the American technology ecosystem without providing them with cutting-edge capabilities. This policy aims to balance trade interests with national security by preventing China from accessing top-tier AI hardware while still profiting from technology sales. (not investment advice)</p>
