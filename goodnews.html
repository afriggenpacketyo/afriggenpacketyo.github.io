          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed that upcoming bilateral tariff talks should be "productive" during a 45-minute phone call.

However, a comprehensive review led to the restoration of training, recognizing its effectiveness. The decision is a reprieve for Emmitsburg, where the academy contributes significantly to the local economy and identity, and training for first-responders will resume.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass‚Äô public safety initiatives to avoid city worker layoffs. The budget reduces funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in fewer officers, and scales back new hires for the Los Angeles Fire Department. The council provided enough money for the LAPD to hire 240 new officers, down from Bass's proposed 480. Despite the cuts, the fire department will see an overall increase in funding, and the council authorized the LAPD to ramp up hiring if more money becomes available.</p>

The Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, the NCL Salten, had 16 people on board and went off course while traveling through the Trondheim Fjord. No injuries were reported, and Norwegian police are investigating the cause of the crash.</p>
