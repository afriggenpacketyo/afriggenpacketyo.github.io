          <p>U.S. Steel shares stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange as Japan's Nippon Steel completed its acquisition of the American company. Despite President Trump's earlier claims of a "partnership" where U.S. Steel would remain American-owned, the company is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. The NYSE has notified the SEC of the delisting, effective June 30, after Nippon completed the acquisition. U.S. Steel will continue to operate under its name but as a subsidiary of Nippon.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits dipped to 245,000 last week, remaining at historically low levels, according to the Labor Department. Despite the overall healthy band of claims, recent weeks have seen claims at the higher end of the range, suggesting a deceleration in the U.S. job market. Economists cite President Trump's aggressive trade policies as a contributing factor, creating uncertainty for businesses and consumers. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged amid concerns that Trump's tariffs could reignite inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores why straight men are often perceived as being bad at gossiping, attributing it to a lack of cultural opportunities to freely engage in social storytelling. Studies suggest that men do gossip but may avoid openly partaking due to social stigmas and fears of appearing "messy." This reticence can contribute to the male loneliness epidemic, as sharing stories and engaging in social conversation is crucial for building intimacy and close friendships. The article suggests that men could benefit from embracing gossip as a social tool to strengthen connections.</p>

Originally storybook characters created by artist Kasing Lung, Labubus gained popularity after Lung partnered with POP MART in 2019. The appeal lies in their unique design, the surprise element of blind boxes, and the chance to obtain rare "secret" dolls. The blind box craze taps into nostalgia and a fascination with mystery and chance, reflecting consumer trends of reconnecting with inner childhood joy.</p>
