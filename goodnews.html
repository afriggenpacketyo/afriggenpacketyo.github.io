        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House has passed changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) as part of President Donald Trump's tax package, raising the cap to $40,000. The provision, effective in 2025, phases out over $500,000 and increases annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket. The House proposal for changes to the SALT deduction could still face pushback in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force conducted a routine, unarmed test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. The LGM-30G Minuteman III missile was launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California and traveled to a test range near the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The Air Force emphasized that the test was routine and not a response to current world events, designed to demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear deterrent.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he is giving "very serious consideration to bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public." These government-sponsored enterprises are key in America's housing financial system. Trump plans to discuss the matter with his economic advisors and make a decision soon. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from lenders and bundle them into mortgage-backed securities, providing liquidity, stability, and affordability to the mortgage market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. The government highlighted a "300,000 drop in net migration since the election" and promised to "further reduce net migration" by implementing its measures set out in the Immigration White Paper last week.</p>

          <p>Japan's National Police Agency will review rules to switch driver's licenses from other countries to Japanese ones following recent accidents by foreign drivers. The agency plans to require those seeking to switch to a Japanese driver's license to submit a copy of their residence certificate in Japan and is considering increasing the number of questions on the knowledge test. The move comes after a series of accidents involving foreign drivers with Japanese licenses converted from foreign licenses.</p>
