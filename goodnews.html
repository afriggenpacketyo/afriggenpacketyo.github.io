          <h2>Hamas Signals Positive Stance on Latest Gaza Ceasefire Proposal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:07:31 EDT</div>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the most recent U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, stating it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework. U.S. President Trump expressed optimism about the development, suggesting a deal could be imminent. However, Israeli officials have indicated that while there is cabinet support for the terms, Israel has not yet formally committed to the agreement. This diplomatic movement occurs amidst the ongoing war, which has led to over 57,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, following the initial Hamas attack on October 7, 2023.</p>

          <p>England and Wales have been drawn into what is considered the most challenging group of the Women's Euro 2025 tournament, alongside top-ranked teams France and the Netherlands. This sets up a highly competitive start for the defending champions, England, and the tournament debutants, Wales. Experts and statistical models agree that Group D is exceptionally difficult, with a high probability that the eventual tournament winner will emerge from this group. While England and the Netherlands have strong tournament histories, France is on an impressive winning streak, and Wales aims to leverage its underdog status to cause an upset in its first major competition.</p>

          <h2>Medical Experts Question Health Benefits of Viral 'Cortisol Cocktail'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A beverage known as the "cortisol cocktail" has gained popularity on social media, with proponents claiming it can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The alcohol-free drink typically contains coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients can significantly reduce cortisol levels, which are naturally regulated by the body. While the drink is generally harmless and can aid hydration, doctors caution that it may not be suitable for individuals with certain conditions like chronic kidney disease or diabetes due to its magnesium, potassium, and sugar content.</p>

          <h2>Rediscovered 1940s Chinese Typewriter Hailed as a Precursor to Modern Computing</h2>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai Chinese typewriter, invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. The machine is considered a pivotal artifact in the history of modern Chinese computing, as it ingeniously solved the challenge of typing a language with thousands of pictographs instead of an alphabet. Its system, which breaks down characters by shape, is a conceptual forerunner to modern input methods for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The typewriter's discovery has excited scholars, who see it as a symbol of preserving cultural identity while embracing technological modernity, reflecting Lin's vision for a globally connected China.</p>

          <p>After a ban of more than 100 years, public swimming has officially returned to the Seine River in Paris. The reopening follows a $1.5 billion cleanup project, initiated in conjunction with last year's Olympics, which has successfully brought the river's water quality up to European standards on most days. On Saturday, Mayor Anne Hidalgo joined eager residents in taking a dip in designated swimming zones near the Eiffel Tower, complete with lifeguards and safety measures. While some onlookers remain skeptical about the water's cleanliness, the event marks the fulfillment of a long-held dream for the city, offering a new recreational space amid rising summer temperatures.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand marine ecosystems and change the public's negative perception of the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the research involves capturing sharks, examining their stomach contents to assess their health and water quality, and then releasing them. Researchers believe that a healthy shark population is indicative of a healthy ocean, but they face challenges in securing funding for their work due to the public's fear of sharks. The lab's efforts aim to highlight the vital role sharks play and encourage greater support for their conservation.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Consensus Affirms Race is a Social Construct, Not a Biological Reality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 10:03:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the scientific community's consensus that race is a social construct rather than a fixed biological reality, a view recently challenged in a political executive order. Historians and scientists note that early 20th-century attempts to classify humans into distinct races based on physical traits were chaotic and inconsistent. The development of population genetics shifted the focus from static racial types to understanding human evolution and variation through dynamic genetic populations. Scientists now argue that while physical differences exist, they are not meaningful enough to create distinct biological racial categories, and that cultural factors are more significant drivers of differences among human groups.</p>

          <h2>Happiness Researcher Advocates '90-Second Rule' for Managing Negative Emotions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for better emotional regulation and a more fulfilled life. The concept, based on neuroscientific findings, suggests that the physiological response to anger or stress, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any prolonged negative feeling is a result of consciously or unconsciously re-running the upsetting thought. Gawdat advises allowing yourself that minute and a half to feel the emotion, and then making a conscious choice to shift your focus, thereby preventing rumination and recovering more quickly from life's daily frustrations.</p>

Despite a high cost of living, the state's appeal lies in its favorable tax policies, including no state income tax on Social Security benefits or retirement account withdrawals, and no estate or inheritance tax. WalletHub also ranked Florida as the best state for retirement in 2025, citing its abundant recreational opportunities and senior-focused programs.

Crews of volunteers spend two weeks at the facility, living in a compact habitat and following strict protocols as if they were on the red planet. Their daily routine includes planning meetings and extravehicular activities (EVAs) in the Mars-like terrain, wearing mock spacesuits. Participants say the experience is invaluable for understanding the rhythm, challenges, and scientific procedures that will be essential for human survival and research during an actual Mars mission.</p>

          <p>Fatalities from heart attacks have plummeted by nearly 90 percent in the U.S. between 1970 and 2022, marking a major public health victory. This dramatic improvement is attributed to a combination of prevention and treatment advancements. The successful public health campaign against smoking, the development of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and widespread CPR training have significantly reduced the risk and incidence of heart attacks. For patients who do suffer a cardiac event, improved emergency response, portable defibrillators, and advanced hospital treatments like angioplasty have drastically increased survival rates, saving tens of millions of lives over the past five decades.</p>

A crucial try from scrum-half Alex Mitchell provided the Lions with a necessary cushion to secure their third win on the Australian tour.

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the enduring commercial and cultural influence of the British monarchy, highlighted by the upcoming granting of Royal Warrants by the Prince and Princess of Wales. These warrants, a seal of approval for goods and services, are powerful marketing tools that signal quality and class, particularly to American consumers. The article notes the irony that, despite the American Revolution's rejection of monarchy, a recent poll suggests a surprising number of Americans, especially young people, would favor replacing the U.S. President with the British monarch. This suggests the potent, and perhaps aspirational, brand of royalty remains strong.</p>
