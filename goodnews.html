          <p>Slate Automotive, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is positioning itself to disrupt the electric vehicle market with a simple, low-cost pickup truck. The company's strategy is to offer a barebones, two-seat base model and allow owners to customize it with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. By minimizing initial manufacturing costs, Slate aims for a price point around $27,000, which it believes will remain competitive even without federal EV tax credits that are being rolled back. The company has already received over 100,000 reservations, though it faces competition from other affordable models like the Ford Maverick.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to scale back the federal takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the new pact, control of the police force will return to its chief, Pamela Smith, reversing a previous order that placed a DEA administrator in charge. The agreement follows a lawsuit filed by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move a "hostile takeover." While the city regains primary control, the federal government will retain the ability to use MPD officers for federal purposes during emergencies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to President Trump's move to federalize the Washington D.C. police force, Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution to end the action. Citing the D.C. Home Rule Act, legislators argue that the president has not demonstrated the emergency conditions required to justify such a takeover. The resolution, sponsored by Representative Jamie Raskin and others, contends that Trump's justification based on crime rates is misleading, as local crime has actually declined. This legislative effort represents a formal challenge to what they describe as an unprecedented and unlawful abuse of executive power over the district's local affairs.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is reportedly negotiating a secondary stock sale of around $6 billion, which would place the company's valuation at approximately $500 billion. The transaction would allow current and former employees to sell shares to investors, including existing backers like SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, and Thrive Capital. This potential valuation marks a significant increase from its $300 billion valuation earlier in the year, reflecting sustained investor confidence following the launch of ChatGPT and the recent announcement of its more advanced GPT-5 model. The discussions are still in the early stages and details may change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group surged 12% on Friday, marking their most successful trading day since March 2020, after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. The investment provided a significant vote of confidence for the insurer, which had seen its stock fall by nearly 50% in 2025 amid a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook. The news also prompted a broader rally in the managed care sector and contributed to the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a new intraday high, signaling renewed investor optimism.

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the Middle East, particularly in de-escalating conflicts like the one in Gaza. With its expanding economic and defense relationships across the region, China possesses significant leverage that Western powers may lack. The author suggests that as the world's second-largest power and a top trading partner for many Middle Eastern nations, Beijing could use its influence to broker constructive solutions and prevent widespread humanitarian crises. This contrasts with the West, which the article claims has often failed to prevent or has even started conflicts in the region.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remarked that she would nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully ends the war in Ukraine without conceding any Ukrainian territory to Russia. Speaking on a podcast, Clinton emphasized that a successful outcome must involve a complete Russian withdrawal and a firm stance against Vladimir Putin's aggression, rather than validating his territorial ambitions. She expressed a cautious hope that Trump, for various reasons, might stand up to Putin, a move she believes would serve U.S. security interests. Trump responded to the comments, calling them "very nice."</p>

          <p>At just 21 years old, all-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to ever captain the England international cricket team. He will lead an understrength T20 squad during their upcoming tour of Ireland in September, as many of the team's regular all-format players are being rested. The appointment is a significant show of faith in Bethell's leadership qualities, which have been recognized since his time with the England Under-19s. This historic selection surpasses the previous record held by Monty Bowden, who captained a Test match in 1889 at the age of 23.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of online real estate company Opendoor, following a campaign from investors who were dissatisfied with the company's turnaround efforts. The resignation comes after the company's stock, which had been at risk of delisting, saw a recent surge driven by retail investor interest. Wheeler stated her departure was intended to allow the company to focus on its future without external distractions. Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois were among the vocal critics calling for new leadership. The company has named its technology chief as interim leader while it searches for a permanent CEO.</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, with CEO Ben Kohn citing California's "anti-business" environment and high operational costs as key factors. The move is part of a broader trend of companies leaving California for states perceived as more business-friendly, such as Florida and Texas. Playboy plans to establish a new office, a Playboy Club, and multimedia studios in Miami Beach, a city officials have welcomed for its pro-business stance. The relocation marks a strategic return to South Florida, where the brand previously had a significant presence with a club and hotel.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a major resurgence after a nearly three-year downturn caused by inflation and high interest rates. Recent successful debuts, such as those by Figma, Circle, and Bullish, have seen stock prices soar on their first day of trading, signaling renewed investor appetite. This revival is encouraging a backlog of high-value startups to prepare for public offerings, with Wall Street analysts suggesting the "IPO window is open." The trend is further supported by a more stable market and calls from the new SEC head to make going public more attractive for companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a government stake in Intel, a D.A. Davidson tech analyst has described the potential intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. The analyst, Gil Luria, argued that despite free-market principles, government involvement is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. The move would aim to bolster domestic high-end technology production, a key priority for the administration. This discussion comes after Intel's CEO met with President Trump regarding the company's performance and alleged ties to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A copy of the 1940s parenting book "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" was recently returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was due. The book was checked out in July 1943 and was discovered among the possessions of a deceased man by his child. A letter accompanying the book explained that the borrower was likely the man's grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for work shortly after checking it out. Fortunately for the family, the library stopped charging late fees in 2021, avoiding what would have been an estimated $900 fine.</p>
