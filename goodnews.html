          <p>Representative Thomas Massie was the only member of the House to vote against the Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act, which aims to crack down on the Chinese Communist Party's alleged practice of forced organ harvesting. Massie, a conservative libertarian, stated that the bill represents unwarranted interference in another country's affairs and is merely a "virtue signal." The bill would authorize the Secretary of State to deny U.S. passports and visas to individuals involved in organ trafficking and calls for sanctions against those participating in the illicit industry.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. publicly defended the independence of the judiciary, denouncing attempts to impeach judges over disagreements with their rulings. Speaking before a crowd of lawyers and judges, Roberts emphasized the judiciary's role in checking the excesses of Congress and the executive branch. His remarks followed similar comments by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who criticized attacks on judges and the rule of law. The Chief Justice's comments come amid intense pressure on the justices and scrutiny from the Trump administration over federal judges overseeing high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>In response to Republican-led state bans on flying pride flags on government property in Utah and Idaho, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted new official city flags that incorporate LGBTQ+ symbols. Salt Lake City approved three new flags with the sego lily design over pride, trans, and Juneteenth flags, while Boise retroactively made the pride flag an official city flag. These actions are a direct reaction to state laws restricting flag displays and signal a commitment to diversity and inclusion.</p>
