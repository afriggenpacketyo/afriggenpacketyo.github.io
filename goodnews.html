        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla shares are on track to finish May with a significant increase, despite some challenges in car sales in China and Europe. This positive trend coincides with Elon Musk's planned reduction in his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Trump. Musk indicated he would decrease his time spent on government work but would remain an advisor to the president. This shift is expected to allow him to focus more on Tesla and his other business ventures, potentially boosting investor confidence. The article also mentions that while Tesla is having a good month, its shares are still down for the year. Optimism around Musk's renewed focus seems to be driving the stock's recent performance.</p>

          <p>A $200,000 annuity may not cover all retirement expenses, but it can provide a steady income stream to supplement Social Security or other sources. Monthly payouts vary based on age, gender, annuity structure, and interest rates, with potential payments ranging from $1,100 to $2,100. The worth of an annuity depends on individual financial goals, offering peace of mind with predictable income and protection against longevity risk. However, annuities may not be ideal for those needing liquidity or seeking to leave an inheritance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, former president of Sinn Fein, has won his libel case against the BBC over a documentary that claimed he sanctioned the 2006 murder of a British spy. The jury awarded Adams damages of 100,000 euros ($113,000). Adams has always denied being a member of the IRA militant group. The jury rejected the BBC's defense that its journalism was fair, responsible and in the public interest. Adams said the BBC "upholds the ethos of the British state in Ireland" and that it "was out of sync" with the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
