          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 05:29:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen has urged the House of Lords to support the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill has already passed in the House of Commons, but faces opposition in the Lords, with critics raising concerns about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the bill includes rigorous safeguards to protect against abuse and ensures that only those with six months or less to live and who are mentally competent can access assisted dying. The bill requires two declarations, assessments by independent doctors, and approval from a multi-disciplinary panel, but its future remains uncertain as it moves to the House of Lords.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kris Jenner's recent appearance has sparked speculation about potential plastic surgery, with experts suggesting she may have undergone a deep plane facelift. Dr. Patrick Davis notes that Jenner's appearance is "youthful and natural," indicative of a well-performed procedure that likely involved lifting the structural elements of her face. Dr. Jonathan Kaplan agrees, adding that a deep plane facelift can provide an "incredible result" by resetting a greater proportion of facial tissues, but carries risks such as nerve damage. Recovery from such a procedure can take several months, with experts emphasizing the importance of choosing a qualified surgeon and discussing medical history and aesthetic goals before undergoing surgery.</p>

          <p>Prince William celebrated his 43rd birthday with a photo shared on social media by Kensington Palace, showing him with the family's Cocker spaniel, Orla, and her puppies. The photograph, taken by the Princess of Wales, was accompanied by a message signed "with love" from Catherine, their children, and "the puppies." The Royal Family's official account also posted a birthday message for Prince William with a picture of him visiting farmers on the Duchy of Cornwall in May, highlighting his ongoing engagement with the land he now owns. The image captures a relaxed and informal moment for the prince, contrasting with recent formal occasions such as Trooping the Colour.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactive in building supply chain resilience, particularly in response to China's dominance in rare earth minerals. After experiencing a rare earth export ban from China in 2010, Japan has diversified its supply sources by investing in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas. This has reduced Japan's reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60% from over 90% previously. The country is reportedly planning to further decrease its dependence on Chinese rare earth imports to below 50% this year, with a focus on stockpiling, recycling, and promoting alternative technologies.

Alaina Beresford, then 12, sent the message as part of a school project, and it was discovered by a volunteer cleaning up a Norwegian island. The volunteer, Pia Brodtmann, sent a postcard to Alaina, who was surprised to receive a reply after so many years. Alaina's handwritten letter, sent in an empty bottle of Moray Cup, requested information about the finder's name, hobbies, and location, which Pia happily provided.</p>

          <p>An article examines the current trend of online criticism directed towards female celebrities, questioning whether it constitutes genuine feminist critique or merely judgmental remarks. Recent instances of celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae facing backlash for their choices raise concerns about the direction of online discourse. The author argues that meaningful critique should involve a nuanced understanding of history, economics, and the complexities of female sexuality, rather than resorting to puritanical chastisement. By drawing on the history of the "sex wars" and the work of feminist thinkers like Angela Carter, the article calls for a more thoughtful and informed approach to discussing women in popular culture.</p>

Despite his release, the administration is seeking to deport Khalil over his role in the protests, which they consider antisemitic.

          <p>Clayton Kershaw continued his pursuit of 3,000 strikeouts, reaching 2,992 after striking out four batters in the Dodgers' 6-5 win against the Nationals. Despite not feeling his sharpest, Kershaw pitched five innings and contributed to the team's victory. Miguel Rojas extended the Dodgers' lead with a two-run home run, and Michael Conforto made a key defensive play to secure the win. The milestone of 3,000 strikeouts is within reach for Kershaw, who is expected to make his next start soon.</p>
