        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow thunderstorm warning for parts of northern England, the Scottish Borders, and Wales. The warning is in effect from Saturday afternoon into Sunday, with potential for localized flash flooding, large hail, and frequent lightning due to the humid weather conditions. An amber heat-health alert is also in place until Monday, raising concerns about pressures on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. Firefighters have responded to a significant surge in wildfires, and scientists emphasize that climate change is making heatwaves hotter and longer. Optimism remains moderate as authorities take precautions and cooler air is anticipated to bring relief soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is advocating for the House of Lords to pass the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would grant terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill, already approved by MPs, faces scrutiny in the Lords, with some peers raising concerns about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasizes the bill's rigorous safeguards, including multiple declarations and assessments by independent doctors and a multi-disciplinary panel. Critics, like Lord Shinkwin, fear the bill could pressure disabled and older individuals to end their lives, despite assurances that disability or mental disorder will not qualify anyone for assisted dying. Despite her support, Rantzen acknowledges the bill is unlikely to become law in her lifetime.</p>

          <p>Kris Jenner's recent youthful appearance has sparked speculation about a possible deep plane facelift, with experts weighing in on the potential procedures involved. While a representative for Jenner confirmed that Dr. Steven Levine performed the work, the specific type of procedure was not disclosed. Experts suggest that the structural elements of her face were lifted, possibly with a fat transfer, to achieve a natural and youthful look. They also discussed the differences between traditional and deep plane facelifts, as well as the risks and recovery associated with each procedure. Experts emphasize the importance of choosing a board-certified facial plastic surgeon and discussing medical history, lifestyle, and aesthetic goals before undergoing surgery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactively addressing supply chain resilience, particularly in response to China's dominance in rare earth minerals. Following a 2010 export ban by China, Japan invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects, reducing its dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. The country has focused on stockpiling, recycling, and promoting alternative technologies. Despite these efforts, Japan still faces challenges in cutting its dependency on China, especially for heavy rare earth elements. As Western nations seek to diversify their critical mineral supply chains, Japan's experience serves as both a template and a reminder of the difficulties involved. (not investment advice)</p>
