          <h2>Hong Kong and Mainland Consumers Adapt to Soaring Gold Prices for Wedding Jewellery</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 22:30:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices have surged globally, reaching a record high of US$3,883 per ounce, with parallel increases observed in Hong Kong, yet consumers are adapting to these elevated costs, particularly for wedding jewelry. Despite significant price hikes, including a 48% increase this year, demand for traditional items like gold dragon and phoenix bracelets remains robust as wedding dates approach. Retailers, such as Chow Tai Fook, note that consumers have gradually accepted this new price level, indicating that the cultural importance of gold in wedding traditions appears to outweigh price sensitivity for many couples in the region. This trend underscores a unique aspect of consumer behavior in the market.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged over 3% to hit an all-time high, primarily driven by significant gains in Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix shares following their announced partnership with OpenAI. Both chipmakers saw substantial increases, with SK Hynix soaring over 11%, as the collaboration aims to supply advanced memory chips crucial for next-generation AI development. This robust market rally occurred despite a higher-than-expected consumer price index in September and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, underscoring strong investor confidence in the burgeoning AI sector and the strategic importance of South Korean chip manufacturers in the global technology landscape.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role in "Breaking Bad," will not face criminal charges following a parking dispute where three women accused him of intentionally spraying them with water. The Los Angeles city attorney’s office declined to file charges, without specifying a reason for their decision. Cruz's agent previously stated that the actor was washing his car when the women parked too close, and any water splash was incidental as he asked them to move and stop recording. This development resolves the legal aspect of the confrontation, which had led to Cruz being held in police custody for several hours.</p>

          <p>Maxwell House coffee launched a viral marketing campaign, rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to humorously address the severe housing affordability crisis in the U.S. The 133-year-old brand's ad campaign, with the slogan "Maxwell House? In this economy?", highlights the record-high median age of first-time homebuyers and the lowest proportion of homes sold to them. This "tongue-in-cheek" effort aims to connect with coffee-loving renters, a growing demographic across the country. The campaign cleverly uses a prevalent societal issue to reinforce the brand's affordability and relevance in contemporary American life.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit against Nirvana, filed by Spencer Elden who appeared as a naked four-month-old on their iconic "Nevermind" album cover, has been dismissed for a second time. Judge Fernando Olguin ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the image child pornography, likening it to a "family photo of a nude child bathing." Elden had accused the band of sexual exploitation and sought damages for ongoing personal harm, but the judge also dismissed his claim that his injuries extended into adulthood, which would have allowed him to bypass the statute of limitations. This decision brings the protracted legal battle over the album art to a close.</p>

          <p>Tesla boss Elon Musk has made history by becoming the first individual ever to achieve a net worth exceeding $500 billion, driven by the surging valuations of his companies, including Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX. His fortune briefly touched $500.1 billion before a slight dip, firmly establishing him as the world's wealthiest person, significantly ahead of rivals. This monumental financial milestone is closely tied to Tesla's sharply rising share prices, which investors attribute to Musk's increased focus on his business ventures rather than political engagements. The company's board has also outlined an ambitious pay package that could further boost his wealth if specific targets are met over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump signed an executive order pledging to use all lawful measures, including military action, to defend Qatar, treating any armed attack on its territory as a threat to U.S. security. This order, which followed an Israeli strike on Doha targeting Hamas leaders, appears to reassure Qatar of U.S. support. Qatar's foreign ministry hailed it as an important step in strengthening defense ties, though the legal weight of such a pledge without Senate approval remains debated. The move underscores Qatar's strategic importance as a U.S. military partner and mediator in the Israel-Gaza conflict, as well as its recent geopolitical vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has temporarily blocked the federal government from diverting $34 million in funding intended to protect New York City's transportation system from terrorist attacks. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ruled that the state of New York would likely prove the Trump administration improperly withdrew the money to punish the state for not cooperating with its deportation program. These cuts, which also affected the NYPD's counterterrorism funding, were deemed a "profound mistake" by Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who warned of increased risk to lives.

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders adopted a unique and silent form of protest by literally muting himself when questioned by reporters about remaining the team's No. 3 quarterback. This unusual response occurred after fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel was promoted to the starting position over veteran Joe Flacco. Sanders, a former college star who played for his father Deion Sanders, was considered by some to be a first-round draft pick but fell to the fifth round. His voiceless answers, characterized by a broad smile and pantomimed gestures, are widely interpreted as a reaction to recent critical remarks from an analyst regarding his previous comments on being a backup quarterback.</p>
