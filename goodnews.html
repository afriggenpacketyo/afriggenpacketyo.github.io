          <p>This article previews Donald Trump's upcoming state visit to the UK, which includes royal ceremonies and business meetings. Trump and First Lady Melania will be greeted by King Charles and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, followed by a carriage procession and a state banquet, and the President will also lay a wreath on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II. Trump will meet with Keir Starmer to discuss potential UK investment commitments from Nvidia and OpenAI to support data center development. The visit's timing is awkward due to recent diplomatic issues, including the firing of the UK's US ambassador, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will address the future of TikTok. The article shows the importance of the visit and its potential to shape future relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reports on a new study indicating that cannabis use, particularly THC, can negatively impact female fertility and artificial insemination. The research found that THC disrupts egg development and genetic stability, leading to a lower rate of euploid embryos. The study analyzed IVF outcomes of women with detectable THC in their follicular fluid and examined the effects of THC on isolated human eggs. While THC may speed up egg maturation, it also increases errors in chromosome distribution and defects in egg cell structure. Further research is needed to examine the effects of THC on different age groups and consumption habits, according to German experts.</p>
