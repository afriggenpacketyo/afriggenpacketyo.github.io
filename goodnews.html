          <p>European leaders are increasingly advocating for the European Union to become more self-reliant, seeking to reduce dependencies on the United States for defense and technology, China for raw materials and cleantech goods, and Russia for energy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized the need for Europe to shape the emerging international order to avoid simply accepting its consequences. French President Emmanuel Macron is a major proponent of this strategic autonomy, pushing for Europe to assert itself as a more independent force in global affairs. The EU seeks to strike a balance between engaging with global powers while safeguarding its own interests and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to begin paying athletes, marking a major shift in college sports. The settlement, stemming from the House v. NCAA case, will allow schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provide $2.7 billion to former players who were previously barred from revenue. The agreement is expected to lead to increased professionalization of college athletics, with potential impacts on recruitment, program offerings, and the role of the NCAA. The settlement does not resolve the threat of further litigation, as states still have separate laws regarding NIL deals.</p>

          <p>Facing public concern over rising rice prices, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is considering an overhaul of Japan's rice policy. The government seeks to boost rice production, but challenges remain, including the risk of a price plunge due to oversupply. Ishiba is pursuing a consumer-focused approach by releasing reserve rice under direct contracts with retailers to lower prices. The move comes as opposition parties urge the government to cut the consumption tax to prop up household spending, but Ishiba has opposed the tax change, expressing concern that it could hamper the government's efforts to secure sufficient funding for social security.</p>
