          <p>President Trump underwent a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, six months after his annual physical. His physician, Captain Sean Barbabella, stated that Trump "successfully completed a scheduled follow-up evaluation" which included advanced imaging and laboratory testing, all yielding "exceptional" results. The article notes Trump also received his annual flu and an updated COVID-19 booster vaccination, with his cardiac age assessed as 14 years younger than his chronological age of 79. This check-up, described by Trump as a "semi-annual physical," precedes his upcoming travel to the Middle East following a peace deal.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the months-long efforts to broker the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which represents the first phase of President Trump's comprehensive peace plan. Key moments include Hamas accepting a new ceasefire proposal in August 2025, followed by intensive "wordsmithing" of the 20-point plan by US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner with Qatari officials. A significant breakthrough involved Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's apology to Qatar for an airstrike that killed Hamas officials in Doha, easing regional tensions. Negotiations culminated in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, where the deal was refined into two phases: an initial hostage and prisoner release, and a subsequent "almost permanent ceasefire." This intricate diplomatic process underscores the complex international cooperation and trust-building required to achieve the agreement.</p>

          <p>Maria Corina Machado, leader of Venezuela's pro-democracy movement, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which she views as a powerful message to her fellow Venezuelans that "we are not alone." Machado, known as Venezuela's "Iron Lady," has challenged authoritarian leaders for over two decades and has been living in hiding due to threats from President Nicolas Maduro's regime. She expressed profound gratitude, stating the award is a recognition for an entire society's "huge, epic fight." Machado believes the Nobel Prize offers significant protection and highlights the global importance of Venezuela's struggle for freedom, having also spoken with President Trump to thank him for his administration's pressure on Maduro's regime.</p>

As mainland China pivots towards tech self-sufficiency and advanced manufacturing development, Hong Kong must design specialized financial frameworks to support global companies in these burgeoning sectors. The article emphasizes that Hong Kong's historical success has always been intrinsically tied to meeting the mainland's financing demands, a time-tested formula that remains crucial in this new economic era.

Coach Brendan King reviewed the game tape and realized his team had actually lost the title game 43-42 to Apache High School, despite the scoreboard showing a 44-43 victory. Although league rules stated the score was final and unchangeable, the Academy team unanimously agreed it would be wrong to keep the trophy. They subsequently appealed their own crowning victory, leading the league to award the championship to Apache High School, an act praised by Apache's coach as a profound testament to good sportsmanship and integrity.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, has officially retired to the countryside after sustaining injuries during a dramatic runaway incident in central London. Quaker was one of five horses spooked by construction work in Belgravia, causing them to bolt through the city, throwing their riders and colliding with vehicles, including a double-decker bus. The horse suffered bleeding and a small break, requiring surgery, while his rider broke his back but has since recovered and returned to duty. Quaker was the only horse from the incident unable to resume service, and will now enjoy a peaceful retirement at The Horse Trust sanctuary, which specializes in caring for former military and police horses.</p>

          <p>An international anti-drug operation involving China, the United States, and Thailand has resulted in a record seizure of nearly 5,000 kg of methamphetamine near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. The Chinese anti-drug agency and Coast Guard, acting on intelligence from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Royal Thai Police, intercepted the vessel Ji Sheng in February, leading to the arrest of seven suspects. This significant operation marks the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years, demonstrating strengthened cooperation among the three nations in combating transnational crime. Representatives have since met in Guangzhou to further reinforce their collaboration and deepen efforts to dismantle behind-the-scenes drug trafficking syndicates.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a deal with AstraZeneca, securing "most-favored-nation" drug pricing for Medicaid patients and listing some medications on the government's "TrumpRx" website. This agreement, similar to a recent pact with Pfizer, aims to make prescription drugs more affordable while offering AstraZeneca relief from threatened tariffs. President Trump, who had pressed drugmakers to lower prices or face stiff tariffs, also made "wildly false" claims about potential 1,000% price reductions, according to economists. Experts caution that while the deal benefits the companies and offers some Medicaid savings, its impact on broader US health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs for average Americans remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>New UK passports issued from December will feature King Charles III's coat of arms on the cover, marking the first full redesign in five years since the post-Brexit shift to dark blue. The updated documents will also showcase natural landscapes from all four UK nations internally, including Ben Nevis, the Lake District, Three Cliffs Bay, and the Giant's Causeway. Passports bearing Queen Elizabeth II's coat of arms will remain valid until their expiry date, ensuring a smooth transition. This change is part of a gradual introduction of royal insignia across national items like stamps, coins, and banknotes, with an effort to use up existing stocks rather than an abrupt change. The new passports will also incorporate updated anti-forgery security features, making them more secure.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced an agreement to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, a move aimed at strengthening US-Qatar defense ties. This facility will enable Qatari F-15 pilots to train alongside American military personnel, enhancing combined training, lethality, and interoperability, further cementing Qatar as a key US ally in the Middle East. The announcement, however, drew criticism from some right-wing activists, who questioned the decision given past accusations of Qatar financing terrorism, a claim Qatar denies. This initiative marks a deepening relationship between the Trump administration and Qatar, following security guarantees to Qatar and other diplomatic gestures, despite previous presidential remarks about Qatar's historical role in funding terrorism.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article delves into the profound psychological appeal of the hit TV show "The Traitors," which centers on lying and deception, particularly highlighted by its celebrity edition. Experts suggest the show resonates because it mirrors everyday life, where individuals constantly try to discern truth from falsehood among friends, partners, and colleagues. Psychologist Richard Wiseman notes that deception is inherent in human nature, often serving to maintain social cohesion, yet can also be used in an exploitative way. The celebrity version adds an extra layer of intrigue, as viewers project pre-existing beliefs onto stars, blurring the lines between their public personas and genuine behavior. The show effectively exposes the "illusion of co-operation," demonstrating how loyalty can quickly collapse under pressure, revealing underlying self-interest.</p>

          <p>The article offers an in-depth look at how the Trump administration, through emissaries like Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, brokered the first phase of the Israel-Hamas peace deal. It highlights Trump's unconventional diplomatic approach, leveraging strong ties with Israel and Arab nations, and applying pressure to achieve a breakthrough where previous efforts failed. The 20-point plan, drafted with figures like Tony Blair, combined a ceasefire with a vision for postwar Gaza. Despite initial resistance from Israeli hardliners and an Israeli airstrike in Qatar that angered Trump, a combination of exhaustion from conflict, US pressure, and Qatari security guarantees ultimately led to the agreement, with Trump now planning a victory tour.</p>
