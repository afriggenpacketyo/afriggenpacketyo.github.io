          <p>Meta Platforms is enhancing its digital advertising dominance by integrating AI-driven insights from user interactions with its generative AI tools. Starting December 16th, conversations with Meta AI across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp will inform ad personalization, excluding sensitive topics like health and politics. D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria believes this update will allow Meta to capture an even larger share of the advertising market by leveraging data beyond traditional likes and follows. This strategic move aims to improve ad relevance and advertiser returns, further solidifying Meta's position as a leader in digital advertising. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to convene his cabinet to discuss the proposed Gaza Strip ceasefire deal, which is based on a 20-point proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump. The deal's first phase involves the release of all remaining hostages from Gaza in exchange for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons, with nearly 2,000 prisoners under discussion for release. The Israel Defense Forces will also pull back to the "yellow line" in Gaza, as outlined in a proposed ceasefire map released by the White House.

          <p>Israel and Hamas have signed off on the first phase of a wider agreement, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, aimed at ending the two-year-long war. The agreement entails a ceasefire followed by the release of remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The Israeli military will withdraw from its current positions, leaving it in control of 53% of Gaza, and will lift restrictions on humanitarian aid to allow 400 lorry loads a day. This breakthrough comes after a failed Israeli attempt to kill Hamas leadership in Doha and pressure from the US, marking a potential turning point in the conflict.</p>

          <p>California is set to become the first state in the U.S. to phase out ultra-processed foods from school meals over the next decade. A new law requires the state's Department of Public Health to define "ultra-processed foods of concern" and "restricted school foods" by mid-2028, with schools phasing them out by July 2029. The goal is to provide students with healthier, more nutritious meals and combat the surge of chronic conditions in children fueled by poor nutrition. Some critics worry the ban is too broad and could limit access to nutritious foods.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is sending out notices to student loan borrowers informing them of their eligibility for debt cancellation under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan, despite the ongoing government shutdown. Borrowers have until October 21 to opt out of the relief. The department had temporarily paused forgiving debt under IBR, sparking concern among borrowers who have been repaying loans for decades. This action addresses a central issue in the American Federation of Teacher's legal battle with the Education Department, which accused the Trump administration of depriving borrowers of their rights.

While AI can be a cost-effective tool for staging homes and showcasing their potential, transparency is crucial to avoid deceiving potential buyers. The rules from the MLS require disclosure of virtual changes to a photo and do not allow alterations that change the dimensions of other physical characteristics of a property or room.</p>
