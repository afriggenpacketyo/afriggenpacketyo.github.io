          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in funds from a FEMA disaster mitigation program. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The program was designed to fund projects like stormwater management and building elevation in flood-prone areas. The judge stated that redirecting the funds could cause "irreparable harm" and that the court was not convinced Congress had authorized the reallocation, thereby pausing the move while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Rory McIlroy has elected to skip the St. Jude Championship, the first event of the PGA Tour's postseason playoffs, prompting concern from tour organizers. His absence, along with that of top-seeded Scottie Scheffler, is possible because their high point totals effectively guarantee them spots in the later stages of the playoffs. A player director on the PGA Tour Policy Board expressed he was "very concerned" by the decision, hinting that a rule change may be considered to prevent top players from skipping key playoff tournaments in the future. Fellow golfer Jordan Spieth, however, downplayed the issue, suggesting it is unlikely to become a widespread trend.</p>

          <p>A major China-backed copper mining project in Afghanistan is reportedly making significant progress toward beginning extraction this year after being stalled for 17 years. The Mes Aynak mine, holding one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, was awarded to a state-owned Chinese corporation in 2008 but faced numerous delays due to security issues and the presence of ancient archaeological sites. The Taliban government has since announced a shift to underground mining, a more expensive method intended to better protect the historical relics. The project's advancement signals a deepening of economic ties between Beijing and Kabul's current administration.</p>

The group's performance celebrated their longevity and reunion following an extended break for South Korea's mandatory military service, a period that often challenges the continuity of K-pop bands. Their return highlights a trend of artists enduring beyond this traditional career interruption, supported by a devoted global fanbase. The group is also preparing to release a new album, titled "X," further cementing their status as influential figures in the global music scene.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased across every major category in 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the pandemic. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime, including a significant 14.9% decrease in murders. Property crimes also fell, with motor vehicle thefts experiencing a record 18.6% one-year decline. While experts note that aggravated assaults remain relatively high, the overall statistics point to a broad improvement in public safety, with trends suggesting the decline has continued into the first half of 2025.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The ordinance, which aims to protect vulnerable tenants from the growing danger of extreme heat waves, will take effect next month with enforcement beginning in 2027. The law encourages landlords to use passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains, rather than relying solely on air conditioning. This measure places Los Angeles among other municipalities in the Southwest that have enacted similar regulations to address the public health risks of rising temperatures.</p>

          <p>Schools are increasingly replacing heat-absorbing asphalt playgrounds with grass and other greenery to create cooler, safer environments for children. A Los Angeles charter school, in partnership with the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, transformed its blacktop into a green space, reducing surface temperatures by as much as 40 degrees. Experts note that such projects not only combat the urban heat island effect but also help mitigate air pollution and provide developmental benefits for students by encouraging imaginative outdoor play. This initiative addresses a critical need, as an estimated 28 million children in the U.S. lack easy access to parks or green spaces.</p>

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is returning to the Los Angeles Chargers, agreeing to a one-year contract worth a reported $8.52 million. Allen, one of the most productive receivers in franchise history, was traded to the Chicago Bears last year in a salary-cap-related move. His return provides a significant boost to the Chargers' offense, especially following the recent retirement of fellow receiver Mike Williams. The six-time Pro Bowl selection joins a receiving corps that includes promising younger players and will be tasked with re-establishing his on-field chemistry with quarterback Justin Herbert.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a landmark $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliates, Chemours and Corteva, to resolve claims related to 'forever chemical' pollution. State officials called it the largest environmental settlement ever achieved by a single state. The agreement holds the companies responsible for decades of contamination from Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and other pollutants originating from four industrial sites. The funds will be used for natural resource damages and to create a substantial remediation fund for cleanup efforts, ensuring that taxpayers are not left with the financial burden of the environmental damage.</p>

Unlike its flagship proprietary models, these are designed to be lower-cost options that developers, researchers, and companies can more easily run and customize for their own purposes. An AI model is considered open-weight when its parameters are publicly available, offering greater transparency and control. This move positions OpenAI to compete with other tech giants like Meta and Mistral AI in the growing open-source AI ecosystem, potentially accelerating innovation across the industry.</p>

          <p>New research from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park indicates that the social bonds between female mountain gorillas are more crucial than previously thought. A 20-year study of their behavior revealed that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she actively seeks out and joins other females she already knows, even if they have been separated for many years. This behavior suggests that these pre-existing relationships provide significant social benefits, such as helping a newcomer navigate the group's hierarchy and avoid aggression from resident females. The findings offer new insights into the evolutionary drivers of social structures in great apes.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advancements, public perception of weather forecasting accuracy remains mixed, a phenomenon explored in this feature article by a veteran meteorologist. The article explains that the atmosphere is a "chaotic system," where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, making precise, localized predictions difficult. It also discusses the challenge of condensing vast amounts of complex data into a simple, understandable forecast for television or an app. The future of forecasting will likely involve artificial intelligence and a greater focus on communicating the real-world impact of weather events, rather than just the raw data.</p>

According to a Realtor.com report, metro areas like Austin and Miami have seen notable price declines from their 2022 peaks due to rising housing inventory. In contrast, markets such as New York and Milwaukee are seeing prices rise because of a persistent shortage of homes for sale. This divergence illustrates a supply and demand story, where a boom in pandemic-era building has created a more balanced market in some regions. (not investment advice)</p>
