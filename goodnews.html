          <p>In an opinion piece for The New York Times, Ezra Klein discusses the contrasting reactions to his book ‚ÄúAbundance,‚Äù which he co-authored with Derek Thompson, within the Democratic Party. The book critiques how Democrats have governed in areas where they hold power, advocating for a focus on increasing the availability of resources and opportunities. While some Democrats embrace the ‚Äúabundance agenda,‚Äù anti-corporate populists view it as a threat to their rising influence. The debate centers on whether the primary focus should be on addressing bottlenecks in production or tackling concentrated corporate power.</p>

          <p>Kyodo News reports that Japan recorded a current account surplus of 2.26 trillion yen in April. This figure reflects the difference between Japan's income from abroad and its payments to other countries. The current account is a key indicator of a country's economic health, encompassing trade in goods and services, as well as income flows. The surplus suggests that Japan's international transactions resulted in more money flowing into the country than out during the reported period. (not investment advice)</p>
