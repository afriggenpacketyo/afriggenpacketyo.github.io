          <p>During a game against the Las Vegas Raiders, Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn was inadvertently run over by his own quarterback, Marcus Mariota, who was pushed out of bounds. The collision left Quinn with a bloody nose, but he confirmed to the broadcast team that he was okay and able to continue coaching. The incident occurred in a game the Commanders went on to win decisively, 41-24, with Mariota starting in place of the injured Jayden Daniels and delivering a strong performance with both a passing and rushing touchdown.</p>

This development comes as the White House pushes for a deal to divest the popular social media app from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, due to national security concerns. The proposed arrangement would see U.S. interests control the app's data, privacy, and algorithm, though China has maintained that any deal must comply with its own laws and regulations.</p>

          <p>Nationals outfielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were crucial in his team's 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young prevented an extra-base hit with a juggling, 'hacky-sack' style catch, kicking the ball back into the air with his foot after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss was a significant blow to the Mets' playoff hopes in a tight NL wildcard race.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated that he would accept an interim deal between the U.S. and North Korea that freezes Pyongyang's nuclear weapons production. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described the proposal as a 'feasible, realistic alternative' to the stalled, long-term goal of complete denuclearization, noting that North Korea is currently producing numerous additional weapons annually. He expressed hope that former President Trump could resume talks with Kim Jong Un, believing their 'degree of mutual trust' could lead to a breakthrough that enhances regional and global security.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a West Virginia high school captured the surprising moment the school's principal, James Marsh, opened a dumpster only to be greeted by a black bear. The footage shows Marsh quickly retreating as the bear climbs out and runs off in the opposite direction. No one was harmed in the incident, which serves as a vivid reminder of the dangers of human-wildlife encounters when animals are attracted to unsecured food and trash sources. Experts emphasize the importance of proper waste management to prevent luring wildlife into populated areas.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris finished seventh in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, gaining only a few points on his championship rival and teammate, Oscar Piastri, who had an uncharacteristically poor weekend. Norris attributed his result to a difficult qualifying session where he started seventh on a track where overtaking proved nearly impossible. While he felt he maximized his race performance from that starting position, team principal Andrea Stella suggested Norris made a 'little misjudgment' in qualifying that cost him a better grid spot, highlighting the fine margins in the competitive F1 championship battle.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has initiated a one-day trial banning traffic from a half-mile stretch of the iconic Oxford Street, calling it the day 'the fight back began to rescue this street.' The event is a glimpse into the mayor's broader plan to permanently pedestrianize the area between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. However, the proposal has raised concerns from some local groups about the potential for traffic congestion on smaller side streets and reduced accessibility for individuals with mobility issues.</p>
