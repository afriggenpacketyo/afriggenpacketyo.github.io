          <p>The US National Guard, a component of the US Armed Forces Reserve, comprises the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, and it was formally established in 1903. Typically, the National Guard is deployed for disaster relief efforts, such as the recent California wildfires, but it also serves in internal security roles, exemplified by deployments following the January 6th Capitol riot. The command structure varies, with state governors assuming command during in-state deployments, while the US president serves as commander-in-chief during nationwide deployments. President Trump controversially overrode California's governor to deploy the National Guard during protests against ICE immigration raids, citing national security concerns.</p>

This initiative aims to address challenges banks face in deploying AI tools due to concerns about privacy and fraud. The FCA hopes this collaboration will help firms harness AI to benefit markets and consumers while supporting economic growth.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to extend the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, across English waters to protect marine life and the seabed. The proposal would expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas, covering 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The announcement comes as a UN Ocean Conference begins in France, with Sir David Attenborough warning about the destructive impacts of bottom trawling.

Before fully committing to cricket, Webster considered various career paths, including building, journalism, business, and mortgage broking.

This adds to the already rich collection of archeological sites in Idlib, which holds a third of Syria's monuments.
