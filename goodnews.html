          <h2>Trade War Strained Global Supply Chains Before Recent Truce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 08:23:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that the U.S.-China trade war significantly disrupted global supply chains, pushing them to near breaking point just before the recent trade truce. President Trump's tariffs led to a sharp decline in manufacturing activity in North America and Asia as companies aggressively stockpiled inventory to buffer against potential tariffs. While the pause in tariffs offers temporary relief, concerns remain about long-term risks associated with reliance on China. The article suggests that manufacturers are actively seeking to diversify their supply chains to mitigate these risks, with Southeast Asia and Europe emerging as alternative sources.</p>
