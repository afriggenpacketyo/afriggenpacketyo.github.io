          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home alternative to the Pap smear in the U.S., offering a more convenient and potentially less anxiety-inducing option for cervical cancer screening. The Teal Wand, developed by Teal Health, allows women to collect a vaginal sample at home using a swab, which is then mailed to a lab for HPV testing. This approval follows a study indicating that at-home screening is as effective as in-office procedures and preferred by many women, potentially increasing screening rates and reducing racial disparities in cervical cancer deaths.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years and crashed into the Indian Ocean. The mission failed due to a rocket booster malfunction, leaving the probe stranded in Earth's orbit. This event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus. While the U.S. focused on Mars, the Soviets achieved several milestones in Venus exploration, including the first successful landing and transmission of data from the planet's surface.</p>

Diller argues that data can be harmful to instinct and that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea. He uses examples from his career at ABC, including the success of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," to illustrate the power of trusting one's gut feeling. He also criticizes the over-reliance on data by MBA students, highlighting the need for simple human instinct in business decisions.</p>
