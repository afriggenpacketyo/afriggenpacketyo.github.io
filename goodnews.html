          <h2>Senate Advances GENIUS Act to Regulate Cryptocurrency Amidst Debate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 15:40:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has moved forward with the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. The measure seeks to establish industry standards and protect consumers by mandating stablecoin issuers to hold asset reserves and prioritize repayment in case of bankruptcy. While supporters claim it will formalize the crypto industry and foster competition, critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren argue it provides weak regulations and fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns, particularly those involving President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures. The bill prohibits members of Congress from issuing stablecoins during their public service, but some critics argue it doesn't adequately prevent rewarding Trump coin buyers with favors. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warby Parker's shares experienced a significant surge of over 15% after announcing a partnership with Google to develop smart glasses. Google is investing up to $150 million in the project, with $75 million allocated for product development and an additional $75 million contingent on Warby Parker meeting collaboration milestones. The first line of smart glasses, built on Google's Android XR operating system, is expected to launch after 2025 and will feature Google's Gemini AI assistant. This collaboration positions Warby Parker as a competitor to the Meta-EssilorLuxottica alliance in the smart glasses market. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google is introducing a new A.I. Mode in its search engine, marking a significant shift towards artificial intelligence. The feature functions like a chatbot, allowing users to ask follow-up questions and receive comprehensive A.I.-generated answers. This move is seen as an attempt to disrupt its traditional search business before competitors can, especially after the rise of chatbots like ChatGPT. While A.I. systems are prone to inaccuracies, Google aims to preserve traditional search while bringing new A.I. abilities to the experience with its A.I. summaries, A.I. Mode chatbot, and Gemini assistant. </p>

          <p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes jokingly told Ruben Amorim he was under pressure heading into the Europa League final, though Amorim doesn't feel that pressure. Amorim believes his team may be looked at "in a different way" if they can beat Tottenham. While many believe Ange Postecoglou will likely lose his job even if Spurs end their 17-year wait for a trophy, faith in Amorim remains high. United may have only beaten Fulham of the non-relegated clubs in the Premier League since December, but the club hierarchy believe Amorim is effecting change behind the scenes. </p>

          <p>Following President Biden's announcement of an aggressive form of prostate cancer, experts in prostate cancer discussed the diagnosis, screening guidelines, and treatment options. While Biden's cancer is metastatic, doctors noted that such cases are not extraordinary in elderly men and that modern treatments can effectively stall the cancer's growth for years. Doctors said that given Biden's age, it would be within the standard of care for him to have forgone testing in recent years. They also expressed optimism about Biden's prognosis due to hormone-sensitive cancer, which allows for effective management. </p>

          <p>This article discusses three critical long-term care insurance questions seniors should be asking themselves right now. First, have my retirement savings changed? Second, have my retirement plans changed? Third, should I delay securing a long-term care insurance plan? The article concludes that seniors and older adults often have a limited budget and what can appear to be an unlimited number of items to spend it on, so it's worth researching plans, prices and companies to determine if it makes sense for you.

          <p>A team of nearly 100 neurology experts has collaborated to create a new method of evaluating patients with traumatic brain injuries, aiming to improve assessment and treatment. The current Glasgow Coma Scale is deemed insufficient, as it can lead to misdiagnosis and inadequate care. The proposed system incorporates blood biomarkers, scans, and consideration of the patient‚Äôs social environment for a more comprehensive assessment. This new classification system will help researchers develop drug treatments and better procedures. </p>

The show features a mix of stand-up, sketches, and unconventional segments, such as Mulaney hosting blindfolded and offbeat interviews. Initially, the show faced some criticism for being aimless, but it has evolved, becoming tighter, funnier, and more meta. With bookings that are savvier and more experimental, 'Everybody's Live' is making a case for risk-taking and novel comedy in the late-night talk show genre. </p>
