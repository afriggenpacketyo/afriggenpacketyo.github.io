        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Malaysia is seeking to increase its halal product exports to Gulf nations, driven by the growing Muslim population's demand for a wider range of halal-certified goods, including pet food and cosmetics. Malaysian businesses are looking for deeper market access to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries as the United States restricts access to its consumer base. Negotiations between ASEAN and the GCC are expected to reduce red tape at Gulf ports, streamlining the export process. Sales of Malaysian cosmetics to the Middle East have also increased due to boycotts of Western brands over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. </p>
