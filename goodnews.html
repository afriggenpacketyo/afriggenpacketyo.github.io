          <p>President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have presented a new proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. During a White House press conference, Netanyahu endorsed the plan, stating it represents a critical step toward resolving the conflict and securing the release of all hostages within 72 hours. Trump affirmed his administration's full support for Israel, warning that if Hamas rejects the deal, Israel would have the United States' complete backing to take necessary actions to eliminate the threat. Both leaders concluded their remarks without taking questions from the press, emphasizing the need to finalize the agreement first.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched "Instant Checkout," a new feature enabling ChatGPT users in the U.S. to purchase items directly through the chatbot, starting with Etsy sellers. The announcement caused Etsy's stock to jump over 15% and Shopify's to rise more than 6%, as Shopify merchants are expected to be integrated soon. This move creates a new revenue stream for OpenAI, which will take a transaction fee, and aims to streamline the user experience by allowing purchases without leaving the platform. The underlying technology, developed with Stripe, will be open-sourced to encourage broader adoption and diverse applications beyond e-commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 15:15:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to stress physiologist Dr. Rebecca Heiss, a highly effective but often overlooked method for managing stress is to channel its energy outward by helping others. Her research indicates that traditional self-care methods can sometimes increase stress, while activities like volunteering have shown proven benefits for well-being. This approach, which she calls "stress springboarding," leverages the hormone oxytocin, which is released during stress and motivates social connection. By focusing on contributing to one's community or supporting colleagues and friends, individuals can activate reward centers in the brain and rewire their stress response, turning a negative feeling into positive, meaningful action.</p>

          <p>During an interview for the television program "60 Minutes," UFC President Dana White engaged in a high-stakes baccarat session at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. Accompanied by reporter Jon Wertheim, White was initially down $1.24 million while betting $400,000 per hand at a private table. However, in a remarkable reversal of fortune, he managed to end the session with a profit of $700,000. The segment also touched on White's management of the UFC, including his defense of fighter pay and his strong stance on protecting free speech, even when he finds the content disagreeable.</p>

          <p>Following Europe's victory at the Ryder Cup, golfer Rory McIlroy strongly condemned the verbal abuse and inappropriate conduct from some American fans at Bethpage Black. He asserted that golf should be held to a higher standard and that the behavior, which included insults and a beer cup thrown near his wife, was unacceptable. McIlroy, who directly confronted some fans during the event, emphasized that while it was a minority of the crowd, he hopes for more respectful conduct at future tournaments. He also noted that he and his team tried to handle the situation with class and let their performance silence the hecklers.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its popular Monopoly Game promotion for the first time in nearly ten years, now featuring both physical and digital components. Running from October 6 to November 2, the sweepstakes allows customers to collect game pieces from select purchases to win prizes ranging from free food to $1 million cash and a new vehicle. To participate, customers must use the McDonald's app, where they can scan physical pieces or earn digital ones. The promotion was previously halted following a major fraud scandal in the 1990s, which was later detailed in the HBO docuseries "McMillion$."</p>

          <p>After leading Team Europe to a second consecutive Ryder Cup victory, Captain Luke Donald has not ruled out serving for a third term in 2027. Donald became the first European captain since 1987 to win back-to-back titles, successfully defending the trophy on U.S. soil in a tense contest. He acknowledged the different challenges of home and away victories and stated he would take time to consider the possibility of leading the team again in Ireland. The article also touches on the unruly behavior of some American fans, which Donald addressed, noting that U.S. players attempted to quiet the crowd.</p>

          <p>Scientists are increasingly using a suite of modern technologies, including drones, AI, and rapid DNA sequencing, to catalog life on Earth at an unprecedented scale. These tools allow researchers to identify countless species, many previously unknown to science, by collecting environmental DNA from the air or analyzing thousands of images and sounds automatically. This technological revolution is crucial for understanding ecosystems and addressing the biodiversity crisis, as an estimated 8 million species exist but only about 2.3 million have been formally described. These methods are helping to illuminate the vast "dark taxa" of unstudied organisms, particularly insects, before they potentially vanish due to climate change.</p>

According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm is currently affecting the northwestern Bahamas with heavy rain and tropical storm conditions. The forecast track shows Imelda moving away from the southeastern U.S. and turning toward Bermuda later in the week, though dangerous swells will still affect the U.S. East Coast. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for parts of the Bahamas, but the watch previously issued for Florida's coast has been canceled as the storm moves farther out to sea.</p>

The company is expected to use proceeds from other asset sales to pursue further acquisitions in its faster-growing healthcare and water sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While annuities are often associated with retirees, it is both possible and potentially advantageous for a 55-year-old to purchase one as part of their retirement planning. At this age, individuals can typically opt for a deferred annuity, which allows the investment to grow tax-deferred for years before income payments begin. This can lead to more favorable terms from insurers and provides a way to secure a guaranteed income stream, which can be valuable in the absence of traditional pensions. However, the decision requires careful consideration of the illiquid nature of annuities and one's overall financial flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates in October sitting at a three-year low, prospective homebuyers face a compelling but complex market. The primary advantage is the increased affordability compared to the higher rates seen earlier in the year, presenting a window of opportunity for buyers. However, this is countered by the inherent volatility of the market, which could cause rates to rise again, and the logistical challenges of homebuying in the fall season. While another Federal Reserve rate cut is anticipated at the end of October, which could further lower rates, buyers must weigh this against the risk of waiting too long. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is also introducing parental controls that allow for account linking, chat history management, and setting usage time limits.
