          <p>President Trump stated that the U.S. does not need to sign trade deals, asserting that other countries must sign deals with the U.S. to access its market. This statement contrasts with previous claims from White House officials that securing trade deals is a top priority for the administration. Trump expressed frustration with the pressure to announce new trade agreements, suggesting that the U.S. could unveil numerous deals in the future.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem assured travelers that those without REAL ID-compliant identification will still be able to fly after the deadline, albeit with additional identity checks. Noem stated that 81% of travelers already possess compliant IDs, and security checkpoints will also accept passports and tribal identification. Travelers without REAL ID may be directed to a separate line for additional scrutiny, but will still be allowed to fly. The REAL ID Act, a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, establishes security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and IDs.</p>

          <p>California Democratic lawmakers have reached a compromise on AB 379, a bill addressing the solicitation of minors, following criticism from Republicans and Governor Newsom. The amended bill allows felony charges against adults who solicit sex from a 16- or 17-year-old if the accused is three years older than the minor, while those within three years of the minor will face misdemeanor charges. The legislation also includes a state grant program to support prosecution in human trafficking and sex trafficking cases, funded by increased fines for businesses that aid in human trafficking. Assemblymember Maggy Krell, the bill's author, expressed support for the changes, emphasizing the bill's strengthening of California law.</p>

The motivations behind these deepfake videos included sexual gratification and the degradation of targets, according to research.
