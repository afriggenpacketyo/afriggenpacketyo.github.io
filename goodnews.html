          <p>Kenan Yildiz scored twice to lead Juventus to a 4-1 victory over Wydad in their Club World Cup Group G match in Philadelphia. Yildiz was instrumental in the opening goal, forcing an own goal from Wydad defender Abdelmounaim Boutouil, and later scored a spectacular goal from the edge of the box. The win eliminates Wydad from the competition, while Juventus will qualify for the last 16 if Al Ain fails to beat Manchester City. The match was played in front of a crowd of 31,975 at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire during a service at a church in Wayne, Michigan, wounding a security guard before being shot and killed. The security guard was shot in the leg, but no one else was injured due to the quick actions of a church member who ran the attacker over with a truck, allowing the security guard to neutralize the threat. The pastor of CrossPointe Community Church stated that the church had a security team in place for about a decade in response to violence at other places of worship. About 150 people, including children, were attending the service at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>Auburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl, who is also the chairman of the U.S. Israel Education Association, has expressed his views on the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Pearl thanked God for protecting U.S. troops and stated that the U.S. is at war with Iran's military nuclear program, not with Iran itself. He expressed support for President Trump's actions and suggested that the world would be safer with a non-nuclear Iran. Pearl has been a vocal supporter of Israel, particularly since the Hamas attacks in October 2023.</p>

          <p>Local Iranians in Los Angeles are finding comfort in Persian restaurants and neighborhoods as the conflict between Israel, Iran, and the United States escalates. Restaurants like Azizam in Silver Lake are offering complimentary tea and backgammon to provide a safe space for the Iranian community to come together. Many Iranian Americans, while critical of the Iranian regime, express fear and anxiety for their families and friends in Iran. Despite divisions within the Persian diaspora, many hope to bridge the divide and advocate for a peaceful resolution, emphasizing the shared aspirations and concerns of Iranians and Americans alike.</p>

          <p>England captain Ben Stokes made a crucial breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test against India at Headingley. India was building their lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2 with a lead of 96 runs at the close of play. Earlier, England was bowled out for 465, trailing by six runs, with Brook missing out on a century after being dropped twice. With the match finely poised, Stokes' late wicket has given England the upper hand.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday, showing resilience after the United States' strike on three key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's intervention might expedite the conflict's resolution. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major regional gainer. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's distancing from the conflict and calls for peaceful resolution have shielded it from significant short-term market impacts, with some anticipating a positive mid-term outlook due to the reduced Iranian threat.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces a delicate diplomatic situation following the US airstrikes on Iran. Starmer's calls for de-escalation have been ignored by the White House, yet he has avoided direct UK involvement in military action. While the UK has not explicitly endorsed the US action, it supports the outcome of delaying Iran's nuclear weapons program. The UK was given advanced warning of the US action but was not asked to participate, possibly due to debates about the legality of any UK involvement. The US could request military support from the UK in the coming weeks, prompting further difficult decisions for the prime minister.</p>

          <p>Spain has reached an agreement with NATO to be excluded from the alliance's defense spending target of 5% of GDP. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that such a level of spending would be disproportionate and unnecessary for Spain. While respecting the desire of other countries to increase their defense investment, Spain plans to meet its NATO commitments by spending only 2.1% of its GDP. Spain had previously raised concerns about the new spending target, which is set to be discussed at an upcoming NATO summit.</p>
