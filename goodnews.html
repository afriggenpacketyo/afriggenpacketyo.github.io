        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has revealed a new plan aimed at stimulating business growth by cutting administrative red tape. The reforms, which include simplifying the company merger process and eliminating certain reporting requirements for small businesses, are projected to save firms nearly £6 billion annually. While business groups like the British Chambers of Commerce have welcomed the move, others, such as the Federation of Small Businesses, remain cautious, warning that the benefits could be undermined by potential tax increases in the upcoming budget. The government has pledged to reduce the administrative cost of regulation by a quarter.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to surge by over 11%. The automaker has raised its full-year financial guidance, signaling confidence despite challenges in the electric vehicle market, where profitability is taking longer than anticipated. CEO Mary Barra credited the strong performance to the company's team and vehicle portfolio, while also noting a reduced financial impact from tariffs. The company's net income was affected by a $1.6 billion charge related to its pullback in all-electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced it is expanding its strategic review and is now open to a sale after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties, causing its shares to jump. This move comes as the company continues with its previously announced plan to separate into two distinct entities. CEO David Zaslav stated the review aims to unlock the full value of the company's assets, which have been under financial pressure due to significant debt from the 2022 merger. Potential suitors reportedly include Netflix and Comcast, who may be interested in WBD's studio and streaming assets.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has advised professionals to give their full attention during meetings, calling the use of phones or tablets "disrespectful." He emphasized that proper meeting etiquette, such as being prepared and actively listening, demonstrates passion and care for one's work. Dimon stated that he gives 100% of his attention in meetings and expects the same from others, suggesting that multitasking with devices wastes time and leaves a bad impression. The article also provides related advice, such as asking follow-up questions and taking notes with a pen and paper to improve focus and comprehension.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, following a period of political uncertainty. Her election was secured after her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) formed a new coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party. Takaichi, a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is expected to pursue a hawkish and nationalistic agenda, including a stronger military and a revision of the pacifist constitution. However, her government faces immediate challenges, including public anger over rising prices and the instability of its new, untested political alliance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial and healthcare experts are advising seniors on how to prepare for significant, often unplanned, medical costs in retirement that are not covered by traditional Medicare. Key recommendations include thoroughly understanding Medicare coverage gaps, such as for dental, vision, and long-term care, and building a dedicated medical emergency fund of $5,000 to $10,000. Additionally, experts suggest reviewing supplemental insurance options like Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans to cover out-of-pocket expenses. Planning for potential long-term care costs through specialized insurance or annuities is also highlighted as a crucial step. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new medical technology combining a tiny implantable chip with specialized glasses is showing significant success in restoring central vision for individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In a multi-country trial, over 80% of patients experienced notable improvement, with some able to read numbers and words again. The system works by using a camera on the glasses to transmit visual data to the chip implanted in the retina, which then converts the images into electrical signals for the brain. This breakthrough offers hope for millions affected by this leading cause of sight loss in older adults.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite bold predictions from tech CEOs that AI will soon write the vast majority of code, many software engineers remain skeptical about its practical impact on productivity. While AI tools are useful for simple, repetitive tasks, engineers report they often create messy, unworkable code for complex projects that requires human intervention to fix. Some studies show mixed results on efficiency gains, and engineers express concern about pressure from management to use AI even when it's not appropriate. The consensus among many developers is that AI is a helpful assistant, but human problem-solving and oversight remain indispensable.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached for two British prisoners, Lindsay Sandiford and Shahab Shahabadi, to be transferred from Indonesia to the UK. Sandiford, 69, has been on death row for over a decade for cocaine trafficking, while Shahabadi, 35, is serving a life sentence. The Indonesian government granted the transfer due to the prisoners' serious health issues, including Sandiford's poor physical health and Shahabadi's mental health disorders. The transfer is expected to occur in approximately two weeks, following the finalization of technical details between the two countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace the inflation rate. Current top CD rates, particularly for short-term accounts of six months to one year, are significantly higher than national averages, with some online banks offering over 4% APY. To secure the best rates, experts advise looking at online banks, which have lower overhead costs, and considering short-term CDs due to the current inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs—investing in multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates—is also recommended as a practical strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, where overfishing has devastated coral reefs and threatened the livelihoods of coastal communities, a novel conservation project is underway. Instead of restricting fishing, a small organization is building new artificial reefs from limestone to create more fish habitats, aiming to boost the local fishery. The project is part of a large-scale study linking ecosystem restoration directly to human health, nutrition, and food security. This people-centric approach challenges traditional conservation models that have often failed in impoverished nations by not addressing the root causes of environmental exploitation, such as extreme poverty.</p>
