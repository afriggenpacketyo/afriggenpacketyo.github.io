          <p>Rick Carlisle, the coach of the Indiana Pacers, expressed surprise at the New York Knicks' decision to dismiss coach Tom Thibodeau, initially thinking it was a hoax. Carlisle praised Thibodeau for the significant changes he brought to the Knicks, who reached the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000. Dan Hurley, the UConn head coach, has been linked to the Knicks' job opening but seems uninterested in making the jump to the NBA. Jordan Ott is reportedly set to become the next head coach of the Phoenix Suns.</p>

          <p>Air quality in the Eastern U.S., from the upper Midwest to New York City, has improved after being affected by smoke from Canadian wildfires.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The order came after the family was taken into custody by ICE agents, and the White House had tweeted about their potential deportation. Judge Gallagher stated that deportation without due process could cause irreparable harm, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. Soliman's family entered the U.S. in August 2022 and were allowed to remain through February 2023, with Soliman applying for asylum in September 2022.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK drugs regulator and medical professionals are concerned about the safe use of GLP-1 medicines, including Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Ozempic. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends that women use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant. Weight-loss injections may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives in overweight or obese women.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to end the TSA's "Quiet Skies" program, a domestic surveillance program for travelers meant to identify terrorist threats. The program has been criticized for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes. The circumstances that place individuals on the Quiet Skies list and the process for removal have been largely concealed from the public. The husband of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was reportedly on the watchlist in 2023 and was removed shortly after she contacted the TSA's then-director.</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan man who was deported to Mexico, despite fearing persecution there, was flown back to the U.S. after a judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. The judge found that the man's deportation likely lacked due process. The man, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the U.S. after being attacked multiple times in homophobic acts of violence in Guatemala. The Trump administration admitted to an "error" in falsely claiming that the man was not afraid of being returned to Mexico.</p>

          <p>Confidence in higher education has declined in the past decade, particularly among Republicans, despite its economic benefits. A recent report shows that only one in four Americans believe a four-year college degree is essential for a well-paying job. Recent graduates face challenges in finding employment, with unemployment rates reaching their highest levels since 2021. The value of college for lower-income students has decreased since the 1960s, and research shows that college-going is still valuable for those students, exceeding tuition costs.</p>
