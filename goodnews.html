          <p>Elon Musk stated that while he is a strong ally of President Trump, he is hesitant to fully endorse all of the administration's policies. Musk, who recently concluded his four-month tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), expressed concerns about the GOP's multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, which he believes undermines DOGE's work. He acknowledged that DOGE became a scapegoat for budget cuts, whether real or perceived, and that he felt stuck between supporting the administration and disagreeing with certain policies. Musk emphasized his disappointment with the massive spending bill, which is projected to increase the U.S. debt. </p>

          <p>Investors are increasingly favoring short-term Treasury bills, mirroring Warren Buffett's strategy, due to concerns about economic volatility. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) have attracted significant investor flows this year. These short-term instruments offer stable yields with less volatility compared to longer-duration bonds. Berkshire Hathaway has also increased its holdings of T-bills, now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries, indicating a broader trend toward shorter-term fixed-income investments.

Sally had suffered decades of coercive control by her husband, which had become "normalised" within the family home. A law passed in 2015, which recognises psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse, helped secure Mrs Challen's release from prison after she had been jailed for life for murder in 2011.
