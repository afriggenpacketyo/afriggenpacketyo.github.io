          <h2>Analysis Explores Reasons for Increased Penalty Misses at Women's Euro 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:11:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the Euro 2025 women's football tournament reveals a historically low penalty conversion rate of just 58.5%. Experts suggest a combination of factors is responsible for this trend, including increased psychological pressure on players due to the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight. Additionally, improved data analysis and scouting allow goalkeepers to be better prepared for penalty takers' habits. The article also notes the significant improvement in the physical and technical abilities of female goalkeepers, making them more effective at saving shots than in previous years.</p>

          <h2>Atlanta Police Foundation Releases 'Cop City' Records After Landmark Court Ruling</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:00:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a first-of-its-kind court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial 'Cop City' training center. A Fulton County judge ordered the release after a lawsuit by a news outlet and a research group, setting a potential precedent for the transparency of private police foundations nationwide. The documents reveal the APF's efforts to lobby city officials against a public referendum on the project, warning it could derail financing and damage the city council's credibility. This outcome provides new insight into how private foundations can influence public policy away from public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A tsunami warning for Russia's Pacific coast and a watch for Hawaii were canceled after a series of powerful earthquakes struck off the Kamchatka Peninsula. The largest quake registered a magnitude of 7.4 at a shallow depth, prompting initial alerts for potentially major waves. Russian authorities had urged coastal residents to move away from the shore, but no significant waves materialized, and there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and Russia's Emergencies Ministry both confirmed that the threat had passed, bringing relief to the region.</p>

          <p>Nathalia Holt's new book, "The Beast in the Clouds," recounts the 1928 expedition of Theodore Roosevelt's sons, Ted and Kermit, into unmapped regions of China. Their secret quest was to find the giant panda, a creature so rare and mysterious at the time that many doubted its existence. The book excerpt describes an era of discovery when explorers sought to fill museums with specimens of the world's large mammals, with the panda being the last elusive prize. It delves into the historical context where the animal was known only through fragmented rumors and mythical descriptions in ancient Chinese literature.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent interview with 'Superman' director James Gunn sparked conservative backlash for describing the character as an immigrant, but a deeper look into the hero's history reveals strong leftist roots. Created in 1938 by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original Superman was a 'Champion of the Oppressed,' fighting corrupt bosses and tearing down slums. Comic book author Grant Morrison notes that this socialist figure evolved over time, becoming a patriotic symbol during WWII and a suburban father figure in the 1950s. The analysis suggests that Superman's enduring power lies in his allegorical nature, representing a timeless fight for the downtrodden.</p>

          <p>To counteract the United States' 'small yard, high fence' strategy on technology, China could pivot to fostering AI innovation and cooperation with nations in the Global South. According to Jiang Yuhao, a researcher at the Institute of Public Policy, this approach would move beyond the direct rivalry with the U.S. By promoting collaborative development, equitable technology sharing, and fair data access, China could build a more inclusive technological ecosystem. This strategy would also involve co-developing ethical AI frameworks that respect the diverse concerns and values of its partner countries in the developing world.</p>

          <p>Following the unexpected retirement of veteran receiver Mike Williams, the Los Angeles Chargers are looking to second-year player Quentin Johnston to step into a larger role. Johnston, who showed significant improvement last season after a difficult rookie year, states his confidence is at an all-time high as he prepares to become a more prominent target for quarterback Justin Herbert. While the departure of Williams leaves a gap in veteran leadership and big-play ability, the team is relying on a 'next man up' mentality. The performance of Johnston, alongside star Ladd McConkey and promising rookies, will be critical for the Chargers' passing offense.</p>

          <p>A recent poll by Elon Musk highlighted that a majority of Americans desire an alternative to the current two-party system, which many feel has become divisive and unrepresentative. Political analyst Lee Drutman argues that the single-winner electoral system is the primary obstacle, as it makes voting for a third party feel like a wasted vote or a spoiler. He proposes a shift to proportional representation with multi-member districts, a system common in other democracies. This change would allow parties to gain seats proportional to their vote share, making elections more competitive and potentially breaking the political 'doom loop.'</p>

          <p>Writers from The Atlantic have compiled a list of film adaptations that they argue are superior to the books they are based on. Steven Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' is praised for tightening the story and creating more compelling characters and dialogue than Michael Crichton's novel. Other selections include 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' for its heightened suspense; 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,' for its transcendent performances; and 'The Devil Wears Prada,' for elevating its source material into a sharp workplace comedy. The list also features 'The Social Network' and 'Clear and Present Danger' as examples of films improving upon their literary origins.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to conduct their first-ever joint army training exercise, a move that signals deepening military and practical cooperation between the two nations. The drill, themed around 'joint border patrol training,' will take place in China's Guangxi region, which shares a border with Vietnam. This development occurs as the countries mark 75 years of diplomatic ties and comes on the heels of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Vietnam. The closer relationship is seen partly as a response to the ongoing U.S. tariff war, encouraging the neighboring countries to strengthen their economic and defense partnerships.</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in the Italian Alps last year, has been successfully moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany. The bear's relocation follows a lengthy legal battle and protests from animal rights groups, which prevented an initial order for her to be euthanized. The incident had sparked a heated debate in Italy over managing the growing bear population and human-wildlife conflicts. JJ4 arrived safely at the Alternative Wolf and Bear Park in the Black Forest, where she will live in a secure, specially designed enclosure.</p>

          <p>A rare pterosaur fossil discovered in northeastern China contains the first-ever evidence of stomach contents for this type of flying reptile, challenging long-held beliefs about their diet. The fossil of a Sinopterus atavismus was found with phytoliths, microscopic plant minerals, and quartz crystals in its stomach. The presence of quartz suggests the creature may have used gastroliths, or stomach stones, to grind tough plant matter, similar to some modern birds. This finding provides direct evidence of herbivory in this species, renewing a contentious debate among paleontologists about what these ancient creatures actually ate.</p>
