          <p>Dallas Cowboys kicker Brandon Aubrey has made NFL history by becoming the first player to successfully convert five field goals from 60 yards or more. He achieved this milestone with a 61-yard kick during the team's victory against the Washington Commanders. Aubrey, who is perfect on his 15 field goal attempts this season, has become one of the league's most reliable kickers. His journey to the NFL is unconventional, as he was a professional soccer player before transitioning to football and finding success in the USFL, which ultimately led to his contract with the Cowboys.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 12:09:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that cannabis is more effective than opioids for treating chronic low back pain, a leading cause of global disability. One study showed a proprietary cannabis oil blend provided better pain relief than a placebo, while the other found it offered superior relief and fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to opioids over a six-month period. These findings are considered groundbreaking by some U.S. researchers, as large-scale cannabis trials are difficult to conduct in the United States due to its Schedule 1 drug classification. While the specific cannabis tincture is not yet available in the U.S., the research provides strong evidence for patients considering alternatives to opioids.</p>

          <p>Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs saw a significant increase after the company announced it is exploring the possibility of mining rare earth minerals at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated that geological surveys indicate potential for commercially viable deposits, aligning with the U.S. administration's strategy for critical mineral independence from China. Rare earths are essential for manufacturing magnets used in electric vehicles, weapons systems, and other high-tech applications. The move comes as the U.S. seeks to bolster its domestic supply chain for these critical materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges from tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical uncertainty, the U.S. auto industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025. While automakers like Ford, GM, and Tesla are expected to report earnings declines, overall industry sales and production have held up better than anticipated, leading some firms to upgrade their sector outlooks. However, persistent headwinds remain, including slowing consumer income growth, stress in the subprime auto lending market, and ongoing supply chain disruptions. The industry is navigating a complex balancing act, with executives expressing cautious optimism as they manage costs and adapt to market shifts, including changes in electric vehicle adoption.

Cramer also commented on Boeing, noting that the company's recently approved production increase for the 737 MAX is a positive step toward stronger free cash flow. He views Boeing as a cash flow story and believes the company is now in a position to play offense after years of financial losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party is convening to finalize its next five-year plan, facing the critical challenge of balancing industrial policy with the need to stimulate domestic consumption. For decades, China's economy has relied on exports and infrastructure, but with those sectors slowing, boosting consumer spending has become urgent amid a gloomy public mood. However, geopolitical pressures, particularly from U.S. restrictions on semiconductor technology, are pushing Beijing to prioritize government investment in high-tech industries to achieve economic sovereignty. Analysts believe that while some measures will be taken to support households, developing technological self-reliance will remain the primary focus, limiting resources available for a major consumption stimulus.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Medicare open enrollment period, running from October 15 to December 7, allows beneficiaries to make crucial changes to their health coverage for the upcoming year. Experts advise all beneficiaries to review their current plans, as coverage for doctors and prescription drugs can change, potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs. During this window, individuals can switch between Original Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans, or select a new Part D prescription drug plan. Although the current government shutdown may cause minor delays in accessing information, essential services like the Medicare Plan Finder remain operational, and all plan changes will take effect on January 1.</p>

Rohl, who has previous coaching experience with RB Leipzig, Southampton, and Bayern Munich, is tasked with restoring momentum and achieving success for the club, which currently sits sixth in the league.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry has approved the over-the-counter sale of an emergency contraceptive pill for the first time, a significant step for reproductive health access in the country. The manufacturer, ASKA Pharmaceutical, announced that its "Norlevo" pill will be available without a prescription, though it must be taken in the presence of a pharmacist. This change aligns Japan with over 90 other countries where the "morning-after" pill is already accessible without a doctor's visit. Campaigners have long argued that the prescription requirement created barriers for women, particularly young people and victims of sexual assault, from obtaining timely contraception.</p>

          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett stated that he believes the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude this week. Speaking on CNBC, Hassett suggested that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown persists due to a partisan stalemate over federal funding, with Democrats demanding that any short-term spending bill include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. Hassett claimed moderate Democrats might soon break the impasse, allowing the government to reopen and policy negotiations to resume through the regular process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Working with a controlling manager can be exhausting, but an executive coach and author offers several strategies to navigate the situation effectively. Instead of perfecting work, present rough drafts to invite early input, which satisfies the boss's need for involvement while conserving your energy. It is also helpful to reinforce their authority with phrases that acknowledge their final say and to proactively overshare information to preempt their need for oversight. Additionally, getting ahead of criticism by asking for initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." technique can help validate their feedback while still asserting your own ideas, making the dynamic more manageable.</p>
