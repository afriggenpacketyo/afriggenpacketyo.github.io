          <p>A federal judge has overturned a Trump administration order that halted construction on the Revolution Wind project off the New England coast. Danish company Orsted announced it will resume work as soon as possible on the nearly completed wind farm, which is expected to power over 350,000 homes. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry, which it has criticized as being too expensive and unreliable. The Interior Department had previously ordered the work to stop, a move the plaintiffs called arbitrary and unlawful.</p>

Under the plan, the new entity would have a majority of U.S. investors and board members, with software company Oracle serving as the security provider to monitor the app's algorithm and data. A senior official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, although Beijing has not publicly confirmed the agreement.

          <p>The final of 47 individuals involved in two major drug trafficking networks in New York's Finger Lakes region has been sentenced, concluding a lengthy investigation. Michael Danzey of Sodus received a 25-year prison sentence for his leadership role in the operation, which distributed millions of dollars worth of fentanyl and cocaine across seven counties. The multi-agency investigation, led by the state's Organized Crime Task Force, resulted in 177 convictions and the seizure of over 20 kilograms of narcotics, 19 firearms, and more than $440,000 in cash. Officials praised the collaborative effort for dismantling the dangerous networks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing through a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable. A $100,000 loan with a 10-year repayment term now has an average monthly payment of around $1,236, while a 15-year term costs about $974 per month. These figures are marginally lower than they were earlier in the year and one year ago, reflecting the central bank's policy shift. The article notes that with home equity at record highs, such loans are an accessible option for many homeowners, though costs have not yet dropped dramatically. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. skyrocketed after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, known for his influential call on Opendoor, recommended the stock. Jackson called the company "the Shopify of mortgages" and suggested it could be a "350-bagger in 2 years," causing the stock to jump as much as 176% in a single session. He argued that the company, which he says is leveraging artificial intelligence to rebuild the mortgage industry, is significantly undervalued compared to newly public competitors.

          <p>Southern California is expected to remain unusually muggy for a second consecutive week, with forecasts indicating a continued chance for showers and isolated storms. The weather pattern is caused by tropical moisture being drawn into the region from the Pacific Ocean.

The chance of precipitation is highest mid-week, primarily affecting areas north and east of L.A. County, with meteorologists also monitoring Tropical Storm Narda for potential impacts over the coming weekend.</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, leaf-peepers can consult various predictive maps to estimate when fall foliage will reach its peak, though experts caution that timing is not an exact science. Factors like temperature, rainfall, and elevation affect when leaves change color, with the process generally starting in northern states in September and moving south through October and November. Climate change is reportedly causing fall colors to appear about a week later than they did historically. For the best viewing experience, experts recommend monitoring local conditions and exploring different elevations or areas.</p>

          <p>The monthly premiums for Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, can vary significantly in 2025, ranging from as low as $32 for high-deductible plans to over $550 for the most comprehensive coverage. On average, most beneficiaries can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month for popular mid-level plans. Costs are influenced by factors such as the specific plan chosen, location, age, and tobacco use. To lower costs, consumers are advised to enroll when first eligible, compare plans carefully, and consider options with higher cost-sharing for lower premiums. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has become the top-selling beer in the U.S., overtaking Modelo Especial, according to new sales data. This marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot to Modelo two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's parent company, Constellation Brands, has faced challenges, including tariffs and reportedly weaker demand from its core Hispanic consumer base. The shift in market leadership is reflected in the companies' stock performance, with AB InBev's shares climbing this year while Constellation's have fallen significantly.</p>
