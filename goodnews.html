          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 01:20:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, known as the Rhisotope Project, is underway to combat the illegal rhino horn trade by making the horns radioactive. Scientists from the University of the Witwatersrand are injecting small, harmless amounts of radioactive material into rhino horns, which can be detected by radiation sensors at international borders and airports. This innovative method aims to disrupt trafficking networks by making the horns easier to trace and riskier to smuggle. The project hopes to protect the country's large but dwindling rhino population, which is heavily targeted by poachers for the black market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global space industry is increasingly viewing the Moon as a "stepping stone" to the more ambitious goal of reaching Mars, shifting the focus of the new space race. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar exploration with planned human habitats and commercial payload deliveries, the long-term vision articulated by figures like Elon Musk and President Trump is centered on Mars. Nations like China and the European Space Agency are also developing plans for Martian missions, suggesting a future where national agencies target Mars while private companies dominate lunar activities. This pivot reflects a broader trend of aiming for more distant and complex celestial destinations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait are deepening their military relationship, highlighted by the imminent opening of a joint ammunition factory in the Gulf state. At an event marking the founding of China's People's Liberation Army, Kuwait's deputy defense minister called the project a "milestone" in their cooperation. The two nations also plan to expand the joint military training programs that began in 2019. This collaboration is part of Beijing's broader strategy to increase its engagement and influence in the Middle East, building on a military cooperation agreement with Kuwait that was first signed in 1995.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's management of a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, he attributed the increase to presidents using executive orders to bypass congressional inaction, which naturally leads to more legal challenges requiring the court's intervention. Kavanaugh noted that the court has increased its transparency by writing more in these cases and has implemented internal process changes to "get the right answer." He also emphasized the strong collegiality among the justices, stating that despite disagreements, they view each other as patriots operating in good faith.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for these individuals, who were facing the loss of their legal status and work authorization in the coming weeks. In her order, Judge Trina L. Thompson stated that the administration's decision appeared to be motivated by racial animus and did not properly consider the current unsafe conditions in the immigrants' home countries. The protections will remain in place at least until a November hearing on the case.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion and slightly surpassing analysts' expectations. While AWS remains the market leader in cloud infrastructure, it faces growing competition from Microsoft and Google, both of which reported higher growth rates in their recent earnings. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized AWS's larger business scale and highlighted the company's focus on security as a key differentiator. The cloud division continues to be a major profit driver for Amazon, although it is still navigating supply constraints to meet the surging demand for AI services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House is set to begin construction on a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has labeled "his gift to the country." The new building, which will replace the current East Wing, is designed to host large-scale events for up to 650 guests, addressing the capacity limitations of the existing East Room. According to the White House, the project will be funded by President Trump and other "patriot donors." This marks the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948 and is a significant part of the president's ongoing redecoration efforts.</p>
