          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, 'Mark Twain,' revisits the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, the setting that defined his youth and literary career. Traveling incognito, Twain sought to gather material for his book 'Life on the Mississippi' and reconnect with his past as a steamboat pilot. The passage details his bittersweet observations of a changed landscape and his profound sense of belonging when briefly taking the wheel of a steamer again. It highlights how Twain's early life remained a powerful, idealized touchstone throughout his years.</p>

          <p>As per his own instructions, Mark Twain's full autobiography is being published 100 years after his death, offering an unfiltered look at the iconic American author's thoughts. The work was dictated over several years and intentionally left unpublished to allow him to speak freely about his contemporaries, politics, and personal tragedies without immediate consequence. Editors at UC Berkeley have worked to assemble the massive, non-linear text, which functions like a modern blog. The publication is a major literary event, revealing the candid final words of a cultural superstar.</p>

          <p>A highly competitive qualifying session for the British Grand Prix suggests a thrilling race, with McLaren's Lando Norris predicting a potential six-car fight for the win. Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured pole position, but less than a quarter of a second separated the top six drivers from McLaren, Mercedes, and Ferrari. Teams have opted for different car setups, with Red Bull favoring straight-line speed while others focus on cornering performance. This strategic diversity promises an unpredictable and exciting race at Silverstone.</p>

          <p>An inquiry posed to ChatGPT about taxing billionaires at middle-class rates revealed that the core issue is not the tax rate itself, but how different types of income are treated. The AI explained that while the wealthiest Americans pay an average federal income tax rate of 16%, the system heavily favors wealth over work. Billionaires primarily generate wealth through investments, and the gains are not taxed until assets are sold, allowing them to use strategies like 'buy-borrow-die,' a benefit unavailable to wage earners.

          <p>The rise of digital payment systems has led to 'tipflation,' where customers are prompted to tip in more situations and at higher, pre-calculated rates, causing confusion and social pressure. While tipping was once confined to specific service roles, payment screens now frequently request gratuities at fast-food counters and self-service kiosks. Experts note that this trend, accelerated by the pandemic, benefits both employees and the tech companies that process the payments. This shift has left many consumers unsure of proper etiquette and feeling pressured to tip.</p>
