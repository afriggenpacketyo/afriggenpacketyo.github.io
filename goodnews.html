          <h2>Campbell's Reports Increase in Home Cooking Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 14:42:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Campbell's CEO Mick Beekhuizen has noted a significant rise in consumers cooking at home, reaching levels not seen since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend, observed across all income brackets in the meals and beverages category, suggests that people are tightening their budgets due to economic uncertainties. The increase in home cooking is reminiscent of the period when the pandemic caused widespread economic disruption and altered spending habits. This shift in consumer behavior comes as economists and Wall Street analysts are closely monitoring the U.S. economy amidst concerns about recession risks stemming from tariff policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mount Etna, located on the Italian island of Sicily, has erupted, releasing hot ash and lava, though officials report no immediate danger to local residents or air travel. The volcano department of Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology noted increasing intensity in the explosions before reporting a lava fountain emerging from the southeast crater. The eruption was triggered by the collapse of part of Etna's southeast crater, leading to lava flows, but tour groups were restricted from the summit area as a precaution. Mount Etna is considered Europe's most active volcano, experiencing frequent eruptions that typically cause minor disruptions such as volcanic dust covering nearby towns.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that President Donald Trump is expected to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week. This conversation follows accusations from Trump that China violated a previous trade agreement negotiated in Geneva last month, which aimed to roll back high tariff rates for 90 days. China has countered these claims, asserting that the U.S. is instigating new economic and trade tensions. The potential dialogue between the two leaders offers a glimmer of hope for resolving ongoing trade disputes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Harvard University study, tracking nearly 50,000 women over 30 years, indicates that daily coffee consumption may contribute to healthy aging, particularly in maintaining mental sharpness and physical strength. The study, presented at NUTRITION 2025, found that middle-aged women who consumed caffeinated coffee experienced these benefits, while decaf coffee and tea did not show the same effects. Researchers noted that each additional cup of coffee was linked to a 2% to 5% greater chance of healthier aging, emphasizing that the health benefits appeared specific to coffee's unique combination of bioactive compounds. While acknowledging the study's limitations, researchers suggest moderate coffee intake can be part of a healthy lifestyle when combined with other positive behaviors.</p>

While the review welcomes the government's aim to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2034, it suggests that a faster pace may be necessary given the turbulent global landscape. The review highlights the war in Ukraine as evidence of rising threats and emphasizes the need for Britain to undergo a military revolution to adapt to new ways of fighting.</p>

          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles continues as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists that standards were lowered to accommodate women, a claim disputed by women who have served. Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School, emphasizes that she met the same standards as men. While acknowledging the importance of physical fitness, she argues that lethality extends beyond physical capabilities, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership. The Army is set to implement gender-neutral basic fitness standards for most combat specialties, a move that could further fuel the debate.</p>
