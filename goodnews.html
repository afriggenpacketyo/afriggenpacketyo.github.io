          <p>Amazon has significantly expanded its same-day grocery delivery service, now offering fresh items like produce, meat, and dairy in over 1,000 U.S. cities. The move intensifies competition with rivals such as Instacart and Walmart+. The service allows customers, including non-Prime members for a fee, to order perishable groceries alongside other items like electronics and household goods in a single cart. Amazon reports that in test markets, the convenience of adding fresh food has led to customers shopping twice as often. The company plans to extend this service to more than 2,300 locations by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris has participated in drills for the first time since suffering a superficial eye injury during a Fourth of July fireworks accident. While he was working with a trainer on the side, his return to the field is a positive step in his recovery. Head coach Jim Harbaugh has expressed some uncertainty about whether Harris will be ready for the season opener in September. Harris, a former first-round pick by the Steelers, signed a one-year deal with the Chargers during the offseason and is a key component of their backfield.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining elevated, financial experts suggest that now may be an opportune time for individuals to consider investing in annuities for a stable retirement income. This article explores how to determine the appropriate amount to allocate, suggesting a range of 20% to 50% of a portfolio depending on personal factors. Key considerations include one's age, existing income sources, risk tolerance, and health. As the Federal Reserve may cut rates in the near future, locking in current annuity payouts could be advantageous for securing a reliable, lifelong income stream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investment club has issued a double upgrade for Eli Lilly's stock, moving it to a 'buy' rating after several company insiders made significant share purchases. The obesity drugmaker's CEO, David Ricks, and four other executives and directors bought over $3.5 million worth of stock collectively. This action is seen as a strong vote of confidence, suggesting that leadership believes the company's stock is undervalued following a recent slump. The article highlights that insider buying is a powerful bullish signal, as it typically reflects a belief that the stock price will increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The implementation of new age verification rules under the UK's Online Safety Act has caused a sharp decline in visitor numbers for major adult websites. Data from analytics firm Similarweb shows that traffic to Pornhub and XVideos fell by 47% in the two weeks after the rules took effect on July 25. The law requires sites with explicit material to use robust methods, such as ID matching or credit card checks, to prevent access by minors. While the new measures appear effective on mainstream sites, there are concerns that users may be shifting to less-regulated platforms or using VPNs to bypass the checks.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the current value of gold and the various economic forces that influence its price fluctuations. As of August 11, 2025, gold was priced at over $3,350 per ounce, reinforcing its status as a valuable commodity and safe-haven asset during times of uncertainty. Key factors affecting its price include supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar and the policies of central banks, which hold significant gold reserves, play a crucial role in its market valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. This article explains that the U.S. military installation was chosen for its ability to meet security requirements for such a high-stakes summit. The location is also historically resonant, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. The meeting's primary focus is the ongoing war in Ukraine, with Trump aiming to press Putin for a resolution, though White House officials have framed it as a 'listening exercise' rather than expecting an immediate breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Amazon's announcement of its expanded same-day fresh grocery delivery service has negatively impacted the stock prices of its major competitors. Following the news, shares for grocery delivery company Instacart dropped over 11%, while supermarket chains Kroger and Albertsons saw their stocks fall by 4% and 3%, respectively. This move is viewed by analysts as a direct escalation of competition with Walmart, which has also been heavily investing in its own grocery delivery services. The expansion is part of Amazon's broader strategy to overhaul its grocery business and better integrate its Whole Foods Market subsidiary.</p>

          <p>The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET), a critical tool for predicting and preventing global food crises, is being brought back online after its operations were abruptly stopped by the Trump administration in January. Established in 1985, the USAID-funded system uses data analysis to forecast hunger hotspots, allowing governments and aid organizations to preemptively position resources. Humanitarian experts have welcomed its return but express caution, questioning if the revived system will have the same rigor and if the U.S. government will act on its warnings, especially amid recent cuts to humanitarian aid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup survey reveals that alcohol consumption among U.S. adults has fallen to its lowest level on record, with only 54% reporting that they drink. For the first time, a majority of Americans (53%) now believe that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health, a significant increase from 45% last year. The decline is also reflected in drinking frequency, with the average weekly intake dropping to 2.8 drinks, the lowest since 1996. Researchers suggest this trend is driven by growing health awareness and is not linked to a shift toward alternatives like recreational cannabis.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, mandating improved conditions at an ICE holding facility in downtown Manhattan. The order requires ICE to provide detainees with sleeping mats, hygiene products, access to medication, and regular legal calls. It also places limits on the number of people who can be held at the site. The ruling follows a lawsuit from the ACLU and other advocates, who decried conditions as inhumane, citing video evidence of detainees sleeping on bare floors and a government admission that they received only two meals per day.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's new professional women's soccer league, the Northern Super League (NSL), is being highlighted as a potential blueprint for European leagues to follow. German player Lara Schenk, who plays for the Montreal Roses, praises the NSL for its professional structures and robust player protections, such as extended maternity leave and a ban on non-consensual transfers. The league, driven by former Canadian national team player Diana Matheson, was built with a long-term vision focused on creating stable, professional conditions. Schenk argues that smaller European leagues could learn from the NSL's commitment to standard contracts and minimum wages.</p>
