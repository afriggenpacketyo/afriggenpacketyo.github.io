        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leading U.S. health insurers, including CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna, have agreed to streamline prior authorizations, a process criticized for causing delays and physician burnout. The insurers aim to expedite care access and reduce administrative burdens on providers, implementing changes across commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid plans. These voluntary actions, benefiting 257 million Americans, involve standardized online submissions and real-time responses, potentially impacting insurer profits by increasing care utilization. The industry hopes to modernize the system and improve the patient experience through these changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump posted on social media demanding that "everyone" keep oil prices down, warning that high prices play "into the hands of the enemy." This message followed the U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites, raising concerns about potential disruptions to Middle East energy supplies. Trump also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling. In response to the president's comments, U.S. crude oil prices experienced a slight decrease, reflecting market sensitivity to geopolitical events and presidential influence.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As home equity loan interest rates settle around 8.23% in 2025, experts caution homeowners against taking on excessive debt. While tapping into home equity may seem tempting, especially compared to higher credit card or personal loan rates, it's crucial to assess your debt-to-income ratio, credit score, and home equity. A high DTI ratio, low credit score, limited home equity, unstable income, or lack of an emergency fund are red flags. Before borrowing, experts advise improving your financial position by paying down high-interest debt and building an emergency fund, ensuring you don't put your home at risk.

          <p>Following U.S. air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, analysts believe China is unlikely to directly intervene in the escalating conflict. Instead, Beijing is expected to provide diplomatic support to Tehran as the U.S. becomes more involved in the Israel-Iran conflict. While Iran's military has threatened consequences for the U.S., China's focus remains on maintaining regional stability and protecting its economic interests.

          <p>Experts weigh in on the topic of inheriting credit card debt, clarifying that you typically won't inherit debt from a loved one unless you're a co-signer or it's a joint debt. The deceased person's estate is generally responsible for paying off any credit card debt. There are two main exceptions, including joint account holders or co-signers and spouses in community property states. The experts emphasize that you should consult an estate attorney before responding to any debt collectors. (not investment advice)</p>
