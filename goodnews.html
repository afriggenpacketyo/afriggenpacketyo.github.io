          <p>The UK government has decided to delay changes to cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), forgoing an expected reduction of the £20,000 tax-free allowance for now. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was anticipated to announce the move to encourage more investment in stocks and shares, but will instead continue consultations with financial institutions. The Treasury affirmed its ambition to ensure savings deliver better returns and drive investment into the UK economy, but will not make immediate alterations to the popular tax-sheltered savings products.

          <p>Boxing champions Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano are set to face each other for a third and likely final time, headlining an all-female card at Madison Square Garden. The bout, for Taylor's undisputed junior welterweight titles, is being billed as the concluding chapter of a transformative rivalry in women's boxing. Taylor holds a 2-0 record against Serrano, though both previous victories came via disputed decisions, adding tension to this historic event. The fight will be globally streamed on Netflix, showcasing the significant growth and appeal of women's boxing.</p>

          <p>Chinese company Envision Energy has launched the first phase of the world's largest green hydrogen and ammonia facility in Chifeng, Inner Mongolia. The plant is currently capable of producing 320,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually, a key step in Beijing's strategy to decarbonize heavy industries and lead the clean-fuel market. The project, which is set to begin exports later this year, represents a significant technological milestone for scalable green energy solutions.

          <p>The United Kingdom and France have established a new migrant returns deal, which will operate initially as a pilot program. Under the "one in, one out" scheme, for every migrant the UK returns to France after an illegal Channel crossing, it will accept one person who has made a legal asylum claim in France. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the agreement is designed to be robust against legal challenges and act as a deterrent. The plan has drawn criticism from the opposition, who labeled it a "gimmick."</p>

          <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held its international seminar at Vienna's Hofburg palace, bringing together energy ministers and top CEOs to discuss the oil market, investment, and the green transition.

The gathering also drew protests outside the palace, with demonstrators calling for an oil embargo in response to the conflict in Gaza.

          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's application to replace the roof on his £2 million historic mansion in Scotland has been rejected by the local council. Architects for the actor argued the current lead roof was "beyond repair" and vulnerable to theft, proposing a modern single-ply membrane as a replacement. However, Perth and Kinross Council denied the request, stating the proposed non-traditional materials would not preserve the character and architectural interest of the C-listed building. McGregor purchased the 18th-century, ten-bedroom villa near his birthplace in 2023.</p>

This trend persists despite surveys showing that CEO Elon Musk's political activities have made some Norwegian consumers hesitant to buy a Tesla.

Driven by government subsidies and a rapidly expanding charging network, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have risen 175% in the first half of the year. This boom, primarily in short-haul sectors like ports and mines, has led analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts. The trend follows the rise of electric cars and LNG-powered trucks, accelerating the timeline for China's peak oil consumption. (not investment advice)</p>
