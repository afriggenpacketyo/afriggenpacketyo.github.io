          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert who has appeared on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, pleaded guilty to failing to report a series of high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, who is suspected of financing Hezbollah. Ojiri, owner of the Ramp Gallery in London, sold artwork worth ¬£140,000 to Ahmad between October 2020 and June 2022. The court heard that Ojiri was aware of Ahmad's sanctions by US authorities and discussed this with others, but did not notify police as required by the Terrorism Act 2000. He is not a member of BBC staff, works as a freelance presenter and has not worked on BBC programmes since 2023.</p>

          <p>The UK and US have reached a tariff deal that reduces or removes tariffs on some goods traded between the two countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum.

Pharmaceuticals remain a big unknown, and there is no change to the UK's digital services tax. This agreement is not a full trade deal, and further negotiations are expected to follow.</p>

          <p>Shoji Nishida, a lawmaker from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, apologized and retracted his controversial remarks concerning exhibits at the Himeyuri Peace Museum in Okinawa. Nishida had claimed that the museum's exhibits rewrote the history of the Battle of Okinawa, implying that Japanese soldiers caused the deaths of the Himeyuri student corps. The museum refuted these claims, stating that there were no such descriptions on its premises. Nishida's initial resistance to retracting the remarks prompted calls from people in Okinawa and fellow lawmakers, leading to his eventual apology.</p>

          <p>Dr. Casey Means, President Trump's nominee for U.S. Surgeon General, advocates for addressing metabolic dysfunction, which occurs when the body cannot properly process food. She often cites metabolic dysfunction as a key reason for chronic diseases, warning about the impact of processed foods and chemicals. While experts agree on the importance of metabolic health, they express concern over funding cuts to CDC prevention programs. The administration claims to want to prevent chronic diseases while at the same time eliminating the CDC's chronic disease prevention programs.</p>

          <p>In this article, the contributor argues that while the White House explores policies like a baby bonus to boost the U.S. birth rate, more comprehensive investments in mothers are needed. Policies such as paid parental leave and expanded public child care have proven to be more effective in increasing birth rates and improving maternal health. The author suggests that a renewed expansion of the child tax credit would be a simple first step, as it helps reduce child poverty. A one-time bonus is not enough, as it would not address the systemic neglect that is the status quo for child care, maternity leave and child poverty.</p>
