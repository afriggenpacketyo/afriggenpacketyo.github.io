        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California State Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin have introduced legislation, SB 627, to prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings while interacting with the public. Dubbed the "No Secret Police Act," the bill also mandates officers to wear identifying information to promote transparency and accountability. Exemptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers wearing medical masks during natural disasters, and clear riot gear would be permitted. The proposal follows protests in Los Angeles against the Trump administration's immigration policies, during which National Guard troops were deployed without the California Governor's consent, with Wiener citing concerns about "secret police" behavior. Optimism surrounding the implications of this bill is moderate, as it aims to strike a balance between ensuring public safety and safeguarding individual rights.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee is working on President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," addressing contentious issues such as Medicaid cuts and the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. Senator Mike Crapo, chair of the committee, emphasized that the bill makes the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, cuts "Green New Deal" spending, and targets wasteful spending while protecting vulnerable populations. While House Speaker Mike Johnson urged minimal changes to the bill, the Senate intends to make its mark, especially on Medicaid and the SALT cap, where compromises are proving difficult to navigate.</p>

The Neighborhood Kids, a hip-hop group from San Diego, will also perform, highlighting the realities of communities affected by immigration raids. This follows recent anti-ICE marches in Los Angeles, where protest signs echoed the band's lyrics, and the Trump administration's efforts to expand immigration raids in sanctuary cities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge extended a temporary restraining order on President Trump's proclamation barring foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. until next Monday. Harvard's lawyers argued that the proclamation violates its First Amendment rights and is outside the authority of the executive branch, claiming it is retaliation against the institution. The government argued that it does not "trust" Harvard to monitor foreign students and raised concerns about Harvard's "foreign entanglements" with the Chinese government. The judge questioned the government's arguments, asking why the concerns appeared to apply only to Harvard.</p>
