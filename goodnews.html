          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid tribute to former astronaut Jim Lovell, who passed away at age 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," celebrated him as a courageous leader who inspired others to venture into the unknown. The film depicted the perilous 1970 Apollo 13 mission, which became known as a "successful failure" after an oxygen tank explosion forced the crew to abort their moon landing and execute a daring return to Earth. Hanks remembered Lovell for undertaking his voyages not for fame, but for the challenge of exploration.</p>

          <p>A woman's attempt to scare away magpies using a handmade paper-mache owl resulted in an unexpected and humorous outcome. Instead of being deterred, a group of local magpies gathered around the owl figure, appearing to engage in a form of worship or reverence toward it. The amusing scene, captured on TikTok, shows the birds in what looks like a ceremonial gathering around the decoy. While fake owls are a common deterrent, experts note that intelligent birds like magpies can quickly realize they are not a real threat if they remain stationary.</p>

          <p>A TikTok video showing a conflict over a window shade on a flight to North Carolina has gone viral, sparking a debate on airplane etiquette. The video, filmed by passenger Tori Wils, shows a hand from the seat behind her repeatedly reaching forward to pull down her window shade. Wils, who had purchased the window seat specifically for the view, eventually asked the woman to stop, and they reportedly laughed about the incident. The video amassed over 3 million views, with many commenters affirming that control of the window belongs to the person in that seat.</p>

          <p>In a proactive measure to protect its marine environment, New Zealand has banned large ships from using a dangerous shortcut near Astrolabe Reef. This is the same location where the container ship Rena ran aground in 2011, causing the country's worst-ever maritime oil spill. The Bay of Plenty Regional Harbourmaster issued the formal ban for ships over 500 gross tons, creating an exclusion zone to prevent potential collisions or groundings in the narrow passage. The move has been praised by locals and officials as a crucial step to avoid repeating the past environmental disaster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a humorous essay, author David Sedaris reflects on the complexities and pressures of modern tipping, particularly with the rise of digital payment screens. He recounts an experience at an airport breakfast spot where he was prompted to tip 15%, 20%, or 22% for a transaction where he did most of the work himself. Sedaris humorously dissects the feeling of being a cheapskate for not selecting the highest option, even for minimal service. The commentary touches on the evolving social norms and personal guilt associated with gratuities in an increasingly automated service environment.</p>

          <p>Goldie Chan, a branding expert and self-described introvert, argues that building a personal brand is a crucial tool for career success, especially for those who are less outspoken. She suggests that a personal brand is simply what people know you for professionally and that it allows introverts to shape their own narrative and showcase their talents. Chan recommends starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month, to overcome the fear of putting oneself out there. She emphasizes that a brand is built through both online presence and offline engagement.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark," prompts a re-examination of the celebrated 20th-century novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic writer obscures her depth as a major religious author. The article posits that Spark, a Roman Catholic convert, used narrative devices like omniscience and irony to explore the relationship between God and humanity, often drawing from the Book of Job. Her novels frequently feature an all-knowing narrator who reveals characters' fates early on, forcing the reader to focus on themes of free will, predestination, and divine judgment.</p>

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a 34-year-old couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 over five years to take a 13-month career break and move to Taiwan with their young son.

The couple meticulously planned their finances, covering their U.S. mortgage by renting out their home, and timed the sabbatical for their son's kindergarten year. The experience proved transformative, allowing them to focus on health, family, and re-evaluating their career priorities away from corporate pressures.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is examined as a modern entry into the long literary tradition of stories about strange and mystical sisters. The article reviews the book, which is about five sisters in the 18th century who are accused of turning into dogs, and places it in a lineage with the weird sisters of "Macbeth." It argues that such stories use a group of enigmatic sisters to test other characters and explore societal fears surrounding femininity, conformity, and the unknown. The novel directly engages with these tropes, questioning why female power is often perceived as monstrous.</p>

          <p>According to an expert who helps Americans move abroad, Albania is an increasingly popular yet often overlooked destination for those seeking to relocate to Europe. The country's appeal lies in its significant affordability, with comfortable apartments available for under $500 a month, and its stunning natural scenery. A major advantage for Americans is the ability to stay for up to one year without a visa, allowing for a "test drive" of expat life. The combination of a low cost of living, welcoming locals, and a growing expat community makes it an attractive option.</p>
