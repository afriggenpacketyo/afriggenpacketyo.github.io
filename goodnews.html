        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the concept of U.S. secondary sanctions, a tool used to influence third-party countries and entities by restricting their access to the American market if they do business with a primarily sanctioned nation. Leveraging the global dominance of the U.S. dollar, these sanctions pressure compliance from those not directly subject to U.S. law, as seen in policies toward Russia, Iran, and North Korea. While they can be effective in compelling negotiations, experts note they are difficult to enforce, risk alienating allies, and can push targeted nations to find economic workarounds, making them a complex instrument of foreign policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter's 0.7% growth but better than the 0.1% forecast. According to the Office for National Statistics, the services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this modest expansion. While the government hailed the figures as positive, opposition parties criticized the slow pace of growth, and economists expressed doubt that this momentum could be maintained. Factors such as a weak global economy and the impact of tax rises are expected to present ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>A recent episode of the "Throughline" podcast revisits the history of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarifies the procedures for presidential succession and disability. The story focuses on the efforts of lawyer John Feerick, who recognized a critical gap in the Constitution's framework for what should happen if a president becomes unable to serve. His advocacy, particularly in the years before President John F. Kennedy's assassination, was instrumental in the creation and ratification of this crucial amendment, which outlines the transfer of power.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn reported a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, significantly beating analyst expectations. The surge is largely attributed to the booming demand for its artificial intelligence servers, as the company is a key manufacturing partner for Nvidia. Foxconn, best known as the primary assembler of Apple's iPhones, has been strategically expanding into the AI sector and electric vehicles. The company forecasts its AI server business revenue will grow over 170% in the next quarter, though it remains cautious about evolving global conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court of South Korea has rejected a copyright infringement claim against The Pinkfong Company, the creator of the viral children's song "Baby Shark." U.S. composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that Pinkfong's 2015 hit copied his 2011 version of the song. However, the court upheld lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection. The court concluded that both versions are based on a traditional American summer camp melody that is in the public domain, ending the long-running legal dispute over the global sensation.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, an American fugitive who faked his own death and fled to Scotland, has been found guilty of sexual assault by a court in Salt Lake County, Utah. Rossi, who used the alias Arthur Knight while in the UK, fought a lengthy extradition battle before being returned to the U.S. to face charges. The jury convicted him for an attack on a woman he dated in 2008, who testified that he became controlling before he sexually assaulted her. Rossi still faces a separate trial for another alleged sexual assault in Utah County, scheduled for September.</p>

The guide notes that these qualifications are a popular route to university or direct employment, particularly in fields like health and social care.

          <p>Startup company Voltify is pursuing a plan to decarbonize the $80-billion U.S. railroad industry by replacing diesel locomotives with battery-powered "VoltCars." The company argues that switching to its rechargeable sodium-ion battery systems could save freight rail companies $94 billion over 20 years and help meet climate goals. To overcome industry skepticism about reliability and charging times, Voltify is developing an energy-demand forecasting algorithm and building solar-powered microgrids for charging. The company is currently in active talks with major railroad operators and plans a pilot project in early 2026.</p>

For many, this practice is a way to reclaim personal time, reduce loneliness, and create budget-friendly vacations by leveraging company-paid flights and accommodation. While the practice is common, many employees remain discreet about it, concerned about appearing unprofessional or navigating corporate policies. Employers are increasingly accepting of the trend, provided that work objectives are met and personal expenses are separate.</p>

Some Alaskans, who see Russia as a close and sometimes hostile neighbor, express dark humor about the state's history, joking "please don't sell us back." The city has hosted high-level diplomacy before, but the presence of the two controversial leaders has sparked both pessimism and a flurry of local satire.

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the proportion of American adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline coincides with a growing belief, especially among young people, that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. Only 50% of adults aged 18 to 34 reported drinking, and this demographic is more likely to view alcohol consumption as unhealthy. Experts suggest that increased health awareness, changing social norms, and the rise of non-alcoholic alternatives are contributing to this shift.</p>
