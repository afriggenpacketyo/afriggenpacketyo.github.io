        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims from the Trump Organization that its newly announced T1 smartphone will be "built in the United States," experts suggest it will likely be manufactured in China. Analysts point to the lack of domestic manufacturing capabilities and the common practice of using Chinese original device manufacturers (ODMs) for smartphone production. The phone, which will run Google's Android operating system and retail for $499, has raised questions about the feasibility of completely manufacturing smartphones from scratch in the U.S. Experts also note that establishing large-scale manufacturing in the U.S. would take several years.</p>

          <p>Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff described Red Bull's protest against George Russell as "petty" and "embarrassing" after Russell's victory at the Canadian Grand Prix. Red Bull protested Russell's driving behind the safety car, but the stewards rejected the protest. Wolff emphasized that the victory was fair and criticized Red Bull for raising trivial issues, while Red Bull boss Christian Horner defended the team's right to protest if they see something amiss. This incident follows a previous clash between Red Bull and Mercedes at the Spanish Grand Prix, highlighting the ongoing rivalry between the two teams.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will eliminate FD&C artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027 and will not launch any new products in the U.S. containing these ingredients. This decision affects about 10% of its U.S. items, including brands like Crystal Light, Kool-Aid, and Jell-O. The move follows pressure from the FDA and Department of Health and Human Services for the food industry to reduce artificial dyes. The FDA plans to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes and replace them with natural alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pharmaceutical companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing heavily in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), targeted medicines designed to deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells. While traditional chemotherapy affects both types of cells, ADCs aim for precision. Although ADCs have made significant progress, some experts believe it will take years before they can fully replace chemotherapy. Challenges remain, including ensuring the toxic payload is released at the right time and identifying the correct cancer-causing proteins to target. </p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates National Guard rescued the crew of an oil tanker after two such vessels collided near the Strait of Hormuz. The crude oil tanker, Adalynn, collided with the Front Eagle oil tanker, resulting in a fire. British maritime security firm Ambrey reported that the incident was not security-related, and Frontline confirmed the collision was a navigational incident. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital maritime entry point for oil, and concerns have grown about potential disruptions due to regional tensions.</p>
