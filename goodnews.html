          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge granted bail, superseding an immigration judge's order to keep him detained. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, had been in custody for over three months following his arrest in New York City. The judge criticized the Trump administration's handling of the case, stating there was no evidence Khalil posed a flight risk or danger to the community. Khalil's attorney asserted he was being punished for exercising his First Amendment rights, while the Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's decision, claiming it undermined national security.</p>

          <p>MLB suspended Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and San Diego Padres manager Mike Shildt for one game each following a chaotic incident during Thursday night's game. The tension escalated after Dodgers pitcher Jack Little hit Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr., leading to Shildt's ejection and a confrontation with Roberts. Padres reliever Robert Su√°rez was also suspended three games for intentionally hitting Shohei Ohtani with a pitch later in the game, further inflaming the situation. Despite the Padres winning the game, concern centered on Tatis' injury and the results of his X-ray and CT scan.</p>

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, the appropriateness of wearing shorts in the office remains a debated topic, with many companies adopting more casual dress codes post-pandemic. Stylists suggest that context is key, with tailored shorts being more acceptable than beach or sports shorts, especially in non-client-facing roles. Some companies have embraced the casual trend, while others maintain expectations of professional attire. Men and women may perceive shorts differently, with some men feeling less comfortable wearing them outside of vacation settings, while others embrace the opportunity to stay cool and comfortable.</p>

The article humorously suggests that ICE agents are free to express themselves through their clothing, as long as they avoid looking like they are acting in any official capacity. It mocks the idea that agents should avoid anything that might indicate they are officers of the law, encouraging them to dress in a way that is confusing and unaccountable.</p>

          <p>A panel of federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The ruling supports civil liberties groups' claims that the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. The mandate was signed into law by Republican Governor Jeff Landry, with backers arguing the Ten Commandments are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law. The ruling is expected to be appealed, potentially reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
