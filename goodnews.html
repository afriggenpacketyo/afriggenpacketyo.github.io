          <p>Jim Cramer analyzes the stock market's recent surge following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal of potential rate cuts, driven by concerns over decelerating hiring. Cramer criticizes "lazy thinking" regarding the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, emphasizing their individual issues and advocating for a focus on housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs as bullish sectors. He suggests industrials like Nucor and Whirlpool, and certain retailers, while cautioning against healthcare and enterprise software due to AI disruption. Cramer anticipates September will bring both rising prices and increased joblessness, advising investors to watch specific catch-up plays and avoid overthinking market rotations.

The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed their recovery on Sunday, subsequently canceling the Amber Alert that had been issued for the children. Authorities had previously expressed concerns for their safety, believing they were taken by their biological mother, Jackeline Hernandez-Torres.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened Monday with notable gains, mirroring Wall Street's positive close, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's indication of potential monetary policy easing as early as next month. Major indices across the region, including Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200, all experienced significant rises. This market optimism is largely fueled by expectations that a more accommodative Fed stance will provide crucial economic stimulus. Additionally, investors are keenly awaiting the upcoming earnings report from artificial intelligence darling Nvidia, which is expected to offer further insights into the tech sector's performance and broader market sentiment.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a prolific Broadway stage manager, producer, and director for decades before embarking on a successful acting career in his 60s, has died at 96. Adler was widely recognized for his roles as Tony Soprano's adviser Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." Hailing from a prominent entertainment family, he contributed to 53 Broadway productions, including the original "My Fair Lady." His unexpected pivot to acting in his later years led to consistent work in film and television, defying his earlier perception of a "mediocre career" and proving his enduring talent.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France has been associated with over 70 medically recognized miracles in the past 163 years, attracting millions of pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, conducts rigorous, decade-long investigations into thousands of reported cures. Their criteria demand a severe disease with a dire prognosis, an instantaneous, complete, and lasting cure, and no possible medical explanation. Despite skepticism about historical rigor, analyses affirm the credibility of their conclusions, with four living individuals, including Vittorio Micheli and Sister Bernadette Moriau, having confirmed their continued healing from previously incurable conditions.</p>
