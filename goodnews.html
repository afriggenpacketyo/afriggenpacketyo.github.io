          <p>Following high-level meetings, Ukraine and its allies are developing "security guarantees" to prevent future Russian aggression after a peace agreement. The options being considered range from policing Ukraine's airspace and the Black Sea to providing ongoing military training, intelligence, and weapons, as a full NATO membership is currently off the table. A key challenge is creating a framework robust enough to deter Russia without being so provocative that Moscow rejects it entirely. The involvement and commitment of the United States are seen as crucial for any guarantee to be effective, though President Trump's stance remains a point of uncertainty for European allies.</p>

          <p>The Chinese city of Suzhou is making a concerted push to establish itself as a world-class biopharmaceutical hub, with ambitions to rival Boston. Currently home to 3,800 biotech companies, the city plans to host over 10,000 firms and generate over 1 trillion yuan in output value by 2030. To achieve this, Suzhou is offering substantial subsidies of up to 60 million yuan to attract top international and domestic pharmaceutical companies to set up regional headquarters. This strategic initiative includes academic partnerships, such as the Academy of Pharmacy co-founded by Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University, to cultivate future leaders in drug innovation.</p>

          <p>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has forcefully rejected threats from the Trump administration regarding the city's sanctuary immigration policies, stating, "Boston will not back down." Her response follows a Department of Justice letter sent to Boston and other jurisdictions, threatening legal action and loss of federal funds if they do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. Wu criticized the administration's actions as unlawful coercion and an attack on cities to distract from its own failures. She asserted that Boston follows the law and will continue to be a welcoming city for everyone, refusing to bow to what she termed unconstitutional pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to issue an executive order to end mail-in voting, which he has repeatedly and baselessly claimed is corrupt and favors Democrats. However, legal experts assert that the president lacks the constitutional authority to dictate how states conduct their elections. The U.S. Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine the "times, places and manner" of holding elections, with Congress having a secondary role to alter such regulations, but it specifies no role for the president. Therefore, any executive order attempting to ban mail-in ballots would face immediate and significant legal challenges, as it oversteps presidential power.</p>

          <p>A new, tiny moon has been discovered orbiting the ice giant Uranus, bringing the planet's total known moon count to 29. The satellite, designated S/2025 U1, was identified by the James Webb Space Telescope and measures approximately six miles in diameter. Its small size is likely why it eluded previous detection, even by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its 1986 flyby. Researchers believe the discovery could hint at the existence of more small moons around the planet. The new moon will be officially named after a character from the works of Shakespeare or Alexander Pope, following tradition for Uranian satellites.</p>

          <p>As China marks the 80th anniversary of its victory in the war against Japanese aggression, a wave of commemorative films and documentaries is sweeping the nation. This opinion article argues that these remembrances are not about inciting hatred but about reflecting on historical truths and the immense sacrifices made for peace. The author notes that this historical consciousness can exist alongside a genuine appreciation for modern Japanese culture, citing the popularity of Japanese anime and manga among generations of Chinese youth. The piece concludes that condemning past military aggression while embracing contemporary cultural exchange are not mutually exclusive actions.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Oregon are engaged in a delicate operation to save the Doerner Fir, one of the world's tallest non-redwood trees, after it caught fire. The 450-year-old, 325-foot-tall Douglas fir ignited last week, and crews are working to extinguish a hot spot burning high up in its trunk. Helicopter crews have doused the canopy, but the tree's height and potential for falling debris make it too dangerous for climbing crews to engage directly. Firefighters have established a containment line and sprinklers on the ground to prevent the fire's spread while they continue to monitor the situation from a distance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are being sued in proposed class-action lawsuits for allegedly deceiving passengers by selling "window" seats that are next to a blank wall. The complaints argue that the airlines fail to disclose when these seats lack a window, unlike competitors such as American and Alaska Airlines, even while charging extra for them. Passengers claim they purchase window seats for various reasons, including to alleviate fear of flying or for the view, and would not have paid more had they known the seats were windowless. The lawsuits seek millions in damages for over a million passengers at each airline.</p>

          <p>An Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, is facing federal charges for allegedly creating and operating the "Rapper Bot" botnet, a powerful network used for large-scale cyberattacks. Prosecutors claim the botnet, which infected tens of thousands of devices like DVRs and routers, was one of the most sophisticated DDoS-for-hire services available, targeting victims in over 80 countries since 2021. Law enforcement officials dismantled the network after executing a search warrant at Foltz's home. Foltz is charged with aiding and abetting computer intrusions and could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>In the revamped US Open mixed doubles competition, the top-seeded team of Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula defeated the highly anticipated duo of Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu in straight sets, 4-2, 4-2. Despite the crowd's support for Alcaraz and Raducanu, the more experienced doubles play of Pegula combined with Draper's aggressive net game proved too formidable. The match, part of a new format designed to attract top singles stars, highlighted Draper's return to form after a recent injury. Draper and Pegula later advanced to the semi-finals, establishing themselves as strong contenders for the title.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock saw a 3% rise after the company maintained its full-year financial outlook, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates. The home improvement retailer expects total sales to grow by 2.8% for the year, signaling stability even as it navigates a "deferral mindset" from homeowners due to economic uncertainty. The company noted encouraging signs, including a 2.6% increase in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. Home Depot's forecast does not currently factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate home improvement spending. (not investment advice)</p>

The filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina SAU to not only import and sell cars but also to manufacture vehicles, batteries, and auto parts. While no official plans have been announced, this move aligns with the company's regional expansion strategy in Latin America, which already includes a major production facility in Brazil. If realized, a factory in Argentina would further solidify BYD's growing presence in the South American auto market.</p>

This trend reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where beverages are often the primary reason for a visit rather than an add-on to a meal.
