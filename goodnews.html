          <p>As China imposes export restrictions on rare earth minerals, the US and Brazil are attempting to establish independent supply chains for these critical materials. Rare earths are essential for various industries, including automotive, electronics, and defense. USA Rare Earth is developing a magnet-making plant in Oklahoma and separation technology in Texas to serve American clients seeking alternatives to Chinese suppliers. The company anticipates significant annual revenue from clients eager for components used in electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and robotics, contributing to a more diversified and secure supply chain. The effort to reduce reliance on China signals a strategic shift in global resource management. </p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman has publicly denounced the Los Angeles riots as "anarchy and true chaos," contrasting with some Democratic colleagues' characterization of the anti-ICE protests. Fetterman's message, posted on X, criticized the violence and destruction, asserting that his party loses moral ground by failing to condemn such actions. Conservatives have praised Fetterman for his stance, viewing him as a voice of reason within the Democratic Party. This is not the first time Fetterman has broken ranks with his party, as he has also denounced anti-Israel protests and praised some of Trump's Middle East policies. </p>

          <p>Khaby Lame, the popular TikTok personality, has left the United States after being detained by immigration agents in Las Vegas for allegedly overstaying his visa. Lame, a Senegalese-Italian influencer, was detained at Harry Reid International Airport but allowed to leave without a deportation order. His departure comes amid President Trump's crackdown on immigration. A voluntary departure allows individuals to avoid a deportation order on their record, potentially allowing them to return to the US in the future. </p>

          <p>Recent federal data indicates that drug-related deaths among young people in the United States are declining at an unprecedented rate, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. Over the past decade, fentanyl and other street drugs have claimed the lives of more than 230,000 individuals under the age of 35. The NPR article explores the factors driving this decrease and examines whether the trend can continue in light of potential federal funding cuts.

However, some government departments are likely to face real-terms cuts, as the chancellor prioritizes health and defence budgets.
