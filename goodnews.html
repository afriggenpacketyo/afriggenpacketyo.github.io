          <h2>McDonald's to Pilot Ten New Beverages Inspired by Failed CosMc's Spinoff</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 17:56:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of ten beverages in hundreds of its U.S. restaurants, aiming to attract Gen Z customers with bold and flavorful drink options. The new drinks are inspired by the company's recently shuttered spinoff chain, CosMc's, and include items like the Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew and Popping Tropic Refresher. This move represents a strategic pivot, integrating the beverage-focused concept directly into existing McDonald's locations rather than operating separate stores. The test, starting in select markets, is part of a broader global strategy to capitalize on the growing demand for specialty drinks and afternoon snacks.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 17:50:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Job postings that mention artificial intelligence have seen a dramatic increase, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the past 15 years, according to a Brookings Institution report. This surge reflects the growing integration of AI into various industries, with companies increasingly seeking workers with AI-related expertise. While still a small portion of the overall labor market, these roles often command higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar positions without an AI requirement. The growth is expanding beyond traditional tech hubs and into non-tech fields like marketing, finance, and human resources.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Temporarily Preserves Individual Right to Sue Under Voting Rights Act</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 17:49:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has issued an order that, for now, preserves the ability of individuals and groups to file lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The decision temporarily blocks a ruling from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals which had uniquely held that only the U.S. Attorney General could bring such cases. The case originated from a challenge by two Native American tribes in North Dakota who argued that a new redistricting map diluted their voting strength in violation of Section 2 of the Act. While a temporary victory for voting rights advocates, the long-term status of this right remains uncertain as the court is set to rehear a similar case from Louisiana.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at empowering cities and states to remove homeless individuals from public streets and place them in treatment centers. The order directs the Attorney General to work on reversing legal precedents that limit such actions and redirects federal funds to support rehabilitation and other facilities. It also prioritizes federal grants for cities that enforce prohibitions on urban camping, open drug use, and loitering. The administration framed the move as a necessary step to restore public order and safety in American cities, where people should not be "mugged, shot, or sexually assaulted."</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has announced the launch of a new political party aimed at challenging the political establishment and advocating for the redistribution of wealth. Now an independent MP, Corbyn, along with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, described the new venture as a grassroots, community-led alternative to what they call Labour's "control freaks" and Reform UK's divisive politics. The yet-to-be-named party intends to fight injustices like child poverty and corporate profiteering. The move signals a formal split on the British left and could potentially draw votes away from the Labour Party in future elections.</p>

          <p>Alice Bag and Kid Congo Powers, influential figures from the early Los Angeles punk scene, are collaborating as the duo Juanita y Juan, blending their Chicano heritage with punk rock. Both artists were central to a scene that included many Latino musicians whose contributions were often overlooked in mainstream histories of punk. Through memoirs and their new musical project, they are sharing their unique perspectives as Mexican Americans who broke cultural and musical molds in the 1970s. Their work continues to inspire young Latinos, demonstrating the power of living authentically and creating new forms of cultural expression.</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster delivered a confident and well-prepared address at the Big Ten media days, a stark contrast to his widely criticized, uneasy performance a year ago. Foster humorously acknowledged his previous stumbles while projecting a new sense of purpose for his program, which is entering its second season under his leadership. After a difficult start last season, the team showed significant improvement, and Foster has since overhauled his staff and boosted recruiting, notably landing quarterback Nico Iamaleava from the transfer portal. His transformation reflects a growing optimism and a clear vision for making UCLA football competitive in its new conference.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley affirmed his commitment to continuing the university's historic rivalry with Notre Dame, stating, "Hell, yeah, I want to play the game." However, he noted that negotiations are complicated by uncertainty surrounding the future format of the College Football Playoff. Riley supports a model that would give the Big Ten conference automatic qualifiers, which would preserve the importance of major nonconference games like the one against Notre Dame. With the last scheduled game in the series set for this fall, the future of one of college football's most storied matchups remains in limbo pending an agreement between the two schools.</p>

          <p>Following the recent death of music icon Ozzy Osbourne, this article reflects on the creation and legacy of Ozzfest, the influential touring festival he and his wife Sharon founded in 1996. The idea for the festival was born out of frustration after Lollapalooza rejected Ozzy as being irrelevant. Ozzfest quickly became a juggernaut for heavy metal, providing a crucial platform for established acts like Slayer and Pantera while also breaking new bands such as Disturbed and Kittie. The festival's success cemented the Osbournes' status as powerbrokers in the music industry and created a lasting cultural touchstone for generations of metal fans.</p>

          <p>To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Grateful Dead's formation, San Francisco's public transit agency has wrapped three of its vehicles in psychedelic tie-dye and paisley designs. The themed buses and a train will help transport fans to a three-day Dead & Company concert series in Golden Gate Park. The city, which financed the campaign from its marketing budget, anticipates the concerts will generate a significant economic boost from tourism, similar to a single show in 2023 that brought in $31 million. The initiative aims to celebrate a key part of the city's cultural heritage while also promoting the use of public transportation.</p>
