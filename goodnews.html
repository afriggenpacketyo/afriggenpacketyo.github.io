          <p>Jon Jones has officially retired from UFC, leading to Tom Aspinall being upgraded to undisputed heavyweight champion. Dana White announced the decision after a UFC Fight Night in Azerbaijan, ending months of uncertainty in the heavyweight division. Aspinall, now the third Briton to become a UFC champion, expressed his eagerness to get the heavyweight division moving with an active champion. He is expected to defend his title this summer or early autumn, likely against number-one contender Ciryl Gane, as White has promised to make up for Aspinall's lost time and earnings during the uncertainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of Turkish citizens obtaining German citizenship has doubled in 2024, making Turkey second only to Syria in this regard. This increase is attributed to factors like Germany's attractive living and working conditions, as well as recent citizenship reforms allowing dual citizenship. Many Turks seek German citizenship for practical reasons, such as easier bureaucracy and visa-free travel, while still maintaining ties to their home country. Political repression and economic challenges in Turkey have also contributed to this trend.</p>

Snyder, who volunteered for the Navy during the Vietnam War, had always wanted to graduate from his hometown high school. The veterans were honored as part of Operation Recognition, a program that allows veterans to finally close that chapter of their lives. Snyder shared the honor with friends who did not return from the war, expressing his gratitude and pride.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess the risk for up to seven types of cancer without requiring a blood test. Trials in Hokkaido, Japan, successfully detected changes in pre-malignant cells, leading to early diagnosis and treatment. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, making it a valuable tool in areas with limited medical resources.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have utilized mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized the understanding of yeast metabolism into four interconnected phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state. The phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint found in traditional Chinese medicine, offering new insights into molecular life mechanisms. This study highlights the potential for integrating ancient wisdom with modern scientific research.</p>
