          <p>A new study indicates the United States is approaching herd immunity against the human papillomavirus (HPV), the primary cause of cervical cancer, due to a successful and long-running vaccination program for adolescents. The research found that high vaccination rates among both boys and girls have led to a significant decline in HPV infections, even protecting unvaccinated women. While this progress is promising, experts caution that maintaining high vaccine uptake is crucial to sustain this community-wide protection and prevent a resurgence.</p>

Investor interest is at an all-time high, with 95% of major investors planning to increase their allocations to the sector. However, the immense cost of building these hyperscale facilities, which can run into billions of dollars, is straining traditional funding sources like banks, creating a potential capital gap despite the strong demand.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration abused its power by targeting non-citizens for deportation based on their political speech, violating their First Amendment rights. The 161-page decision highlighted the case of a Tufts University graduate student who was arrested by ICE after co-authoring an op-ed on the war in Gaza. The judge stated that the nation must not imprison or deport people for their viewpoints, a ruling celebrated by advocates as a major vindication of free speech protections.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "hoax" has a fascinating origin, evolving from the magician's incantation "hocus pocus." The phrase was popularized in the 1620s as the stage name of a magician, possibly William Vincent, and may have been a satirical corruption of Latin from the Catholic Mass. Over time, "hocus pocus" became a shorthand for magic and trickery, with the shortened term "hoax" emerging around 1800 to describe a grander, more elaborate deception, distinguishing it from a simple lie or deceit.</p>
