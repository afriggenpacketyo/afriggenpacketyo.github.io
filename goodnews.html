          <p>Emma Raducanu, the British tennis star, was defeated by Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals at Queen's. Raducanu took a medical timeout after the first set due to back spasms, which have been an ongoing issue for her. Despite a strong start in the second set, she was unable to maintain her lead against Zheng. Raducanu mentioned that she had played five matches in a short amount of time and needs to rest her back.

The article highlights a new compilation of boozy tunes from the Lomax Archive, showcasing recordings from the British Isles, the United States, and the Caribbean. Anna Lomax Wood notes that her father and grandfather, both musicologists, enjoyed a tipple but maintained professionalism during their work. The piece connects these traditional songs to contemporary artists like Post Malone and Beyonc√©, suggesting a universal appeal in singing about getting tipsy. Sayre Piotrkowski suggests that the best drinking songs are self-deprecating and self-aware. </p>

          <p>The article discusses the trend of live-action remakes in Hollywood, noting the release of new versions of "Lilo & Stitch" and "How to Train Your Dragon." The author observes that the timeline for nostalgia is shrinking, with studios reviving properties that resonate with younger generations. While the remakes are entertaining, they lack the originality and risk-taking needed to convince audiences of cinema's future. The author expresses disappointment in the lack of significant changes in "How to Train Your Dragon," but acknowledges that "Lilo & Stitch" diverges somewhat from its source material.

          <p>The article provides an overview of debt settlement, a strategy that allows individuals to negotiate with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed. It typically applies to unsecured debts like credit cards and personal loans and is often used as a last resort. The process involves stopping payments to creditors, saving money in a dedicated account, and negotiating with creditors to reduce balances. While debt settlement can offer benefits such as paying less than owed and avoiding bankruptcy, it also comes with risks like credit damage and potential tax consequences. The article advises borrowers to weigh their options carefully and work with a reputable company. (not investment advice) </p>

Following discussions between U.S. and Chinese negotiators, an agreement was reached to resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S. Farley expressed optimism about the developments in trade talks and hopes that supply constraints will ease soon.

          <p>The article compares the costs of borrowing $100,000 using a home equity loan versus a HELOC in the current economic climate. It notes that while HELOC rates are slightly lower, they are variable and can change significantly depending on market conditions. The article provides examples of monthly payments for both options, highlighting that the difference is currently negligible. However, HELOCs could become cheaper if interest rates are cut, and borrowers won't have to refinance to exploit cooler rates.
