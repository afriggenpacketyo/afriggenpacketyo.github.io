          <p>Bath & Body Works has appointed Daniel Heaf as its new CEO, succeeding Gina Boswell, effective immediately. Heaf previously served as Nike's chief strategy and transformation officer and brings experience in digital transformation from his time at Burberry. Boswell, who joined Bath & Body Works in December 2022, is taking a leave of absence for surgery. The company preannounced strong first-quarter results, with revenue up 3% to $1.42 billion and earnings per share exceeding guidance, and is aiming to resonate more with tweens and capture even more men.</p>

          <p>Portugal's center-right Democratic Alliance is poised to govern again in a minority government, but the election saw a surge in support for the hard-right Chega party. Chega, with its anti-immigrant message, secured over 22% of the vote, becoming a significant political force. The ruling Democratic Alliance, led by Prime Minister Lu√≠s Montenegro, has refused to ally with Chega. Analysts attribute Chega's success to capitalizing on anti-immigration sentiment and economic resentments, particularly among disaffected young people, using effective social media strategies.</p>

          <p>Nigerian women are advocating for a 'Reserved Seat for Women bill' to increase their representation in parliament, where they are currently underrepresented. Women constitute nearly half of Nigeria's population but hold few seats in the senate and House of Representatives. Supporters of the bill argue that it could lead to more inclusive governance, smarter policies, and a more stable economy. Nigeria ranks poorly in women's representation in national parliaments globally, despite having prominent women in international roles.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union have struck a deal aimed at boosting security cooperation and reducing trade barriers introduced by Brexit. The agreement includes a new defense partnership and reduced checks on food and drink.

The deal also allows European boats access to U.K. fishing waters until June 30, 2038, and includes plans for a new program to allow young Europeans to travel and work in Britain and vice versa.</p>

          <p>A new UK-EU deal aims to reset the relationship between the UK and the EU, potentially boosting economic growth. The agreement reduces trade barriers, particularly for foodstuffs, by simplifying certification and checks. While the government claims this agreement will be worth ¬£8.9bn to the UK by 2040, it only recoups a small fraction of the GDP lost due to Brexit. The key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years, which has drawn criticism from some fishing communities.</p>
