          <p>China is increasing its strategic focus on Latin America, as highlighted by the recent China-Celac Forum in Beijing. Chinese observers note that solidifying ties between China and Latin America would be inevitable if the United States continues its current policies toward its southern neighbors. Infrastructure development is expected to remain a key area of engagement for Beijing, countering US influence in the region. President Xi Jinping emphasized China's role as a reliable partner, offering a substantial credit line to support development in the face of unilateralism.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five key parenting rules for raising successful kids, emphasizing simplicity and instinct over complicated advice. The rules include trusting parental instincts, following cultural traditions, paying attention to individual children's interests, focusing on enjoyment rather than strict development, and being authentic. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should trust their own judgment and cultural knowledge, rather than relying solely on external advice.

His development of the abortion pill, mifepristone, revolutionized reproductive healthcare and provided women with a safe and effective alternative to surgical abortion.

Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed the spinal tumor through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. The procedure, developed by Dr. Mohamed Labib, involved cutting through the membrane protecting the eye and removing part of the eye socket to reach the tumor. This innovative approach allowed for the complete removal of the tumor without causing external scars.</p>

          <p>Harvard-trained educator Angela Duckworth suggests that students who learn how to effectively use AI can become smarter adults, provided they avoid the mistake of mindlessly copying and pasting AI-generated answers. She advises educators and parents to show children how to use AI by asking follow-up questions to understand how chatbots arrive at their conclusions. Duckworth believes that AI can be a coach rather than a crutch, teaching by example and helping students reach a deeper level of understanding. She also mentions that AI should be used for tasks that do not involve the final product, such as creating a bullet-point outline for a writing project.</p>
