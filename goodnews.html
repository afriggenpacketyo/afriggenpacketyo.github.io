          <p>China has successfully completed the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a critical step toward its lunar ambitions in 2030. The test included a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, where the spacecraft's escape engines ignited while grounded. The return capsule reached its designated altitude within 20 seconds, separated cleanly from the escape tower, and landed safely using parachutes and an airbag cushioning system. This safety test, the first of its kind since 1998, simulates emergency scenarios where astronauts must be rapidly extracted from danger during launch.</p>

          <p>Honda, Japan's second-largest carmaker, has successfully tested an experimental reusable space rocket on the island of Hokkaido. The company aims to achieve suborbital space flight by 2029, utilizing technologies amassed in the development of various products and automated driving systems. Honda says the growing expectations for a "data system in outer space" will likely increase the demand for satellite launch rockets in coming years. While there are no current decisions regarding commercialization, the company believes this technology has the potential to contribute to people's daily lives through satellite launches.</p>

          <p>The Co-op is offering its members a ¬£10 discount on a ¬£40 shop following a recent cyber attack that resulted in customer data being stolen. The grocery chain has not fully recovered from the attack, which occurred last month, and the offer is intended to show commitment to its customers. While the offer appears generous, analysts suggest that the majority of customers do not spend ¬£40 or more per shop, limiting its appeal. The retailer said it is nearing full recovery and its 2,300 stores are returning to normal trading after the incident disrupted deliveries and caused empty shelves.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees by offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million, along with substantial annual compensation packages, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Despite Meta's aggressive efforts to hire talent from OpenAI, Altman stated that none of their top employees have accepted the offers. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is personally working to build a top-tier artificial intelligence team for the company's "superintelligence" AI lab. This comes after Meta delayed the release of its latest AI model due to concerns about its capabilities, with Zuckerberg willing to invest billions in top talent to improve Meta's standing in AI.</p>

          <p>Australia is set to become the first country globally to eliminate all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, effectively lifting the ban on gay and bisexual men. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. While most people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality, those engaging in anal sex with new or multiple partners will need to wait three months to donate blood, though they are still eligible to donate plasma. The plasma donation rules will take effect on July 14, with updated blood donation approaches to be implemented in 2026.</p>

The leaders agreed to enhance cooperation within the group and with like-minded countries to protect economic security against nonmarket practices. The plan includes monitoring for shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, and recycling. The G7 will also develop a roadmap for standards-based markets that reflect the real costs of extraction, processing, and trade, while increasing investment in responsible critical minerals projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paul Taylor argues that European leaders must take advantage of NATO for their own purposes, as the U.S. security focus shifts toward countering China. Taylor suggests that European governments should maximize the use of NATO's command structure and experience in collective defense planning to prepare for a time when they may need to act without U.S. support. This involves building a strong European pillar within NATO, which could include leading a coalition to provide security guarantees for Ukraine. Until then, Taylor advocates for a strategy of "extend and pretend" to maintain transatlantic cooperation.</p>
