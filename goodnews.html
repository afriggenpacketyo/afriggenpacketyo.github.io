          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng conveyed a positive outlook on China's economy as he prepares to lead trade negotiations with US officials in Switzerland. He emphasized the country's economic progress and growing confidence, while also inviting foreign financial institutions to expand their businesses in China. These talks mark the first official trade negotiations between China and the US since President Donald Trump's return to office, raising hopes for de-escalating trade tensions between the two economic superpowers. The meeting is highly anticipated as a potential step toward resolving the ongoing trade war.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are employing powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world‚Äôs largest radio telescope and advanced radar systems, to investigate water ice distribution at the moon‚Äôs south pole. The study estimates that ice constitutes no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil. These findings could help select landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of a China-led research base on the moon. The use of China‚Äôs newly built incoherent scatter radar in Sanya alongside the FAST telescope represents a creative approach to investigating water abundances on the moon.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "major trade deal" to be revealed at a news conference in Washington D.C. The agreement is with "representatives of a big, and highly respected, country," according to a post on Truth Social. While details remain scarce, several US media outlets speculate that the US will strike a trade agreement with the UK. The BBC has reached out to the White House and the UK's Department for Business & Trade for comment on the reports, but it is expected to be a significant step in reshaping international trade relations.</p>

          <p>Joseph Nye, a prominent scholar of international relations known for pioneering the theory of "soft power," has died at the age of 88.

          <p>According to The New York Times, Britain is set to become the first country to sign a trade deal with the U.S. after the US announced tariffs against friends and foes alike in April. It is uncertain if both sides will sign a finalized deal or a framework for an agreement that they would continue negotiating in the coming months. The U.K. was spared the higher "reciprocal" tariffs when Trump announced his "Liberation Day" duties, although it was still hit with the baseline 10% levy. The agreement marks a potentially significant shift in global trade relations.</p>

The ruling ordered Apple to stop imposing commissions on in-app purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps. Apple claims the ruling is punitive and that civil contempt sanctions can only coerce compliance, not punish non-compliance. The company argues that developers are already using the order to reduce consumer choice and damage Apple's business.</p>
