          <p>Shohei Ohtani led the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with one of the greatest postseason performances in baseball history. In the decisive Game 4 of the NLCS against the Milwaukee Brewers, Ohtani hit three home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out 10 batters while allowing only two hits into the seventh inning. His dominant effort secured a 5-1 victory and a series sweep, earning him the NLCS MVP award. The Dodgers will now have a chance to become the first team in 25 years to win back-to-back World Series championships.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are set to hold a new round of trade talks next week, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expected to meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. The negotiations aim to prevent a further escalation of the tariff conflict between the world's two largest economies. In a recent interview, President Donald Trump acknowledged that the current high tariff rates on Chinese goods are 'not sustainable' but defended his actions as necessary. This comes as a temporary tariff truce is set to expire on November 10, and both nations have recently imposed new export controls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test can successfully detect more than 50 different types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis. Results from a trial in North America involving 25,000 adults showed the test identified cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with cancer later confirmed in 62% of those cases. Crucially, over half of the cancers were found at an early, more treatable stage, and three-quarters were types that currently have no screening program. The NHS is conducting its own large-scale trial, with results expected next year to determine its future use.</p>

          <p>Chen Ning Yang, a highly influential physicist and Nobel laureate, has passed away at the age of 103. In 1957, Yang and his colleague Lee Tsung-Dao were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking work on parity laws, which significantly advanced the understanding of elementary particles. Born in China in 1922, Yang later studied and worked in the United States before returning to China, where he was a professor at Tsinghua University. Throughout his distinguished career, he made profound contributions across many areas of physics, particularly in statistical mechanics and symmetry principles.</p>

          <p>English striker Sam Surridge of Nashville SC is currently a top contender for the Major League Soccer (MLS) Golden Boot, competing directly with global superstar Lionel Messi. Surridge has scored 23 league goals this season, placing him third behind Messi's 26, making for an exciting conclusion to the regular season. The 27-year-old, who joined Nashville from Nottingham Forest in 2023, has found remarkable success in the US, crediting his journey through lower English leagues for his grounding. His performance has helped elevate soccer's profile in a city traditionally known for other sports.</p>

          <p>Turkish Cypriots are heading to the polls to elect a new leader in a vote that carries significant implications for the community's identity and the future of the divided island. The election is primarily a contest between the right-wing incumbent, Ersin Tatar, who is backed by Turkey and advocates for a two-state solution, and the left-wing Tufan Erhurman, who supports a UN-backed federal solution. The outcome will not only determine the direction of peace negotiations but is also seen as a referendum on the community's secular identity amid concerns over increasing political and cultural influence from Ankara.</p>

          <p>As the global market for pre-owned luxury goods grows rapidly, robust authentication has become the key factor for building trust and success. The resale market is projected to reach $360 billion by 2030, but the rise of sophisticated 'superfakes' poses a significant threat. To combat this, platforms like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in verification processes, combining expert visual inspections with AI technology and scientific equipment. This focus on guaranteeing authenticity, often backed by money-back guarantees, is proving to be a major driver of business growth and consumer confidence in the booming sector.</p>

          <p>A weekend trip to a Butlin's holiday park unexpectedly saved a Newport woman's life after a minor accident led to the discovery of a large cancerous tumor. Charlotte Morjaria, 31, went to the hospital believing she had a broken rib after a playful mishap during the trip. However, a CT scan to check for internal damage revealed a 7cm tumor on her kidney, which she had been completely unaware of. She was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer and successfully underwent surgery to have her kidney removed, and is now cancer-free.</p>

          <p>A man has uncovered his family's lost history as one of pre-war Germany's wealthiest Jewish families after finding an old suitcase belonging to his late father. The contents revealed that his father, who he knew as Peter Easton, was born Peter Eisner, heir to a vast steel empire, Hahn'sche Werke, worth billions today. The documents and photos led him on a decade-long journey to uncover how the family's assets, including property and valuable artwork, were stolen under Nazi rule through forced sales. While most of the fortune is beyond recovery, his investigation has led to the successful restitution of some artworks from museums.</p>

          <p>Sales of Chinese-made vehicles, particularly SUVs, have surged by 86% in South Africa in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period last year. This rapid growth has increased the market share of Chinese manufacturers to 15%, driven by strong performances from brands like Chery and Haval. While Japanese brands Toyota and Suzuki still hold the largest market volumes, their dominance is being eroded by the increasing popularity and competitiveness of Chinese automakers. The trend highlights a significant shift in consumer preferences within the South African automotive market.</p>
