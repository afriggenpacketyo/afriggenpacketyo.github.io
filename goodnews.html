        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slate Automotive, a company supported by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a new electric pickup truck designed for affordability and customization. The vehicle's base model is intentionally spare to keep the starting price low, with the company planning to sell over 100 accessories and allow for "open source" third-party add-ons. This strategy targets a key barrier to EV adoption, which is high sticker prices, especially as federal incentives are being rolled back. However, analysts question its competitiveness as the price without tax credits nears $30,000, a bracket with many established models.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to curtail the federal government's recent takeover of the city's police force. The deal ensures that the Metropolitan Police Department remains under the command of its current chief, Pamela Smith, rather than a federally appointed administrator. This resolution followed a lawsuit filed by the D.C. attorney general, who called the move a "hostile takeover" and argued it exceeded the president's authority under the Home Rule Act. A federal judge had indicated she would likely grant a restraining order against the administration if no agreement was reached.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI is reportedly in early-stage discussions to sell approximately $6 billion in stock, a move that would value the company at around $500 billion. The secondary sale would allow current and former employees to sell shares to investors, including existing backers like SoftBank and Thrive Capital. This potential valuation marks a significant increase from its $300 billion valuation earlier in the year, reflecting immense investor confidence following the launch of ChatGPT and its new GPT-5 model. The rapid growth underscores the intense demand and high stakes within the generative AI industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their best day since 2020, rising 12% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. The health insurer's stock had been down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and public criticism over rising healthcare costs. The investment from the highly respected Buffett, along with new positions from other notable investors, is being interpreted as a major vote of confidence. Analysts suggest this move could signal a turning point for the company and the managed care sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is uniquely positioned to shape the future of the Middle East and promote stability in the region. With its extensive trade and defense relationships with key nations, China possesses significant economic and political leverage that Western powers may lack. The author suggests that as conflicts persist and humanitarian crises worsen, China's influence could be used constructively to prevent major wars and mitigate suffering. This contrasts with the West, which the article claims has failed to prevent multiple simultaneous conflicts despite advocating for a rules-based international order, creating an opening for a different diplomatic approach.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remarked that she would nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully negotiates an end to the war in Ukraine without conceding territory to Russia. Speaking on a podcast during the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, Clinton emphasized that a successful outcome must not validate Vladimir Putin's aggression or his vision of a "greater Russia." She expressed a hope that Trump, for various reasons including the pursuit of the prestigious award, might stand up to Putin and secure a genuine ceasefire. Trump later responded to the comments, telling Fox News it was "very nice" of her.</p>

          <p>At 21 years old, all-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket. He will lead a T20 squad on a tour of Ireland in September, as many of the team's regular senior players are being rested. This appointment is a significant show of faith in Bethell, who has limited senior captaincy experience but has impressed selectors with his leadership qualities in junior squads. The selection comes as England manages its player workloads, with notable players like Mark Wood still absent due to injury, raising concerns ahead of the winter Ashes series.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of Opendoor, an online real estate company, following a pressure campaign from investors and company co-founders. The move comes after a recent earnings report failed to convince stakeholders of a successful turnaround for the company, which uses technology to buy and sell homes.

In her announcement, Wheeler stated she was accelerating her succession plans to allow new leadership to take over, with the technology chief named as interim leader.</p>

The relocation includes plans for a new Playboy Club and multimedia studios in Miami Beach, a city Kohn praised as "very pro-business." The move represents a strategic return to South Florida for the brand, which previously operated a club and hotel in the area during the 1960s and 70s.</p>

          <p>After a six-month pause and a legal challenge from over a dozen states, the Trump administration is resuming a federal program to fund high-speed electric vehicle chargers along highways. The Department of Transportation has released new guidance to unfreeze the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program funds, which President Trump had previously criticized as wasteful. However, the new rules strip several Biden-era requirements, such as considerations for rural and underserved communities and labor standards. While EV advocates and states welcome the restart, they express frustration over the lengthy and disruptive delay in deploying the congressionally approved funding.</p>

          <p>A book titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" has been returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was checked out in July 1943. The book was discovered by a person in Oregon among their late father's belongings and was likely borrowed by their grandmother before she moved to Mexico for a job at the U.S. Embassy. The returner included a letter hoping there would be no late fee, as the grandmother could no longer pay it. Fortunately for them, the library eliminated late fees in 2021, saving them a potential fine of nearly $900.</p>
