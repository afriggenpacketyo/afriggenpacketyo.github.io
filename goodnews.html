          <p>Senior officials from the United States and China convened in New York, agreeing to increase communication to better manage their strategic differences. During the meeting, China's Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu reiterated Beijing's stance on Taiwan as an internal affair, while the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau pressed for action on the fentanyl crisis and the repatriation of undocumented Chinese nationals. Both sides described the discussions as "candid, in-depth and constructive," signaling a mutual desire to maintain dialogue and explore areas of cooperation ahead of a potential summit between their leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black is poised to be a tight contest, with the US team slightly favored on home soil but Europe aiming for its first away victory since 2012. Key factors that will likely decide the winner include the opening day's foursomes, which have historically set the tone for the entire competition. Europe's team boasts more collective Ryder Cup experience, while the US will rely on home-crowd support and standout players like world number one Scottie Scheffler. Managing the boisterous New York crowd and securing an early lead will be critical for the European team's success.</p>

Both sides echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need to continue fostering trade, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people interactions. The language used recalls a 2023 joint statement where both countries agreed that maritime issues were only one component of their broader bilateral relations. Ambassador Huang expressed hope that Manila would work with Beijing to return their relationship to a stable track.</p>

          <h2>BP's Share Price Rises, Easing Takeover Speculation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 01:09:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy company BP, which was the subject of intense takeover speculation earlier this year, has seen its stock climb over 32% since April, outperforming many of its rivals. This improved market sentiment is attributed to a strategic reset, new leadership, cost-cutting measures, and a series of successful oil discoveries. The company's stronger financial performance, including a second-quarter profit that beat expectations, has quieted rumors of a potential acquisition by competitors like Shell or Exxon Mobil. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized that the company is focused on its own growth to drive shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Pop Mart Welcomes Decline in Resale Prices for Labubu Toys</h2>

          <p>Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the viral Labubu monster toys, has stated it is pleased to see a decline in the toys' inflated resale prices. After a summer where some editions sold for over 2,000% of their retail value, the secondary market is now cooling off as the company has significantly ramped up production to meet demand. Pop Mart claims its goal is to make its art accessible to genuine fans rather than fuel a speculative market for scalpers, which it views as unhealthy long-term. The company is now focusing on sustainable growth through overseas expansion and developing backstories for its characters.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, health officials are warning of a seasonal rise in both influenza and Covid-19 cases, and advise the public on how to differentiate the two illnesses. While both are respiratory infections with overlapping symptoms, the flu often presents suddenly with fever and body aches, whereas Covid-19 symptoms can vary widely and now often include cold-like signs such as a runny nose and sore throat. A hoarse throat has become a hallmark of recent Covid variants. Vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe illness from both viruses, and eligible groups are being urged to get their boosters.</p>

          <p>China has opened an international operations center for its digital yuan in Shanghai, signaling a major push to promote the use of its central bank digital currency in cross-border payments. The People's Bank of China aims to provide an alternative to the current U.S. dollar-dominated global financial system. The initiative includes three new platforms designed to improve the efficiency of international transactions, enable on-chain payments, and help existing financial infrastructure integrate with blockchain technology. This move represents a significant step in China's strategy to accelerate the internationalization of its currency in the digital era. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks secured a 23-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals with a 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired. The Seahawks had built a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, but a late rally by Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, including a game-tying touchdown pass with 33 seconds left, made for a dramatic finish. A penalty on the subsequent kickoff gave Seattle excellent field position, allowing quarterback Sam Darnold to connect on a key pass that set up the winning kick. The victory marks Seattle's eighth consecutive win against their NFC West division rival.</p>

He argues that AI will fundamentally reshape every industry, from drug development to the job market, in a manner similar to previous major technological shifts. While acknowledging that parts of the market may currently be "frothy" or overvalued due to hype, Ganguly sees the long-term impact as profound. He also notes a shift towards "deep tech" and highlights India as a key market for developing AI-native applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to open the world's highest bridge this Sunday in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou. The new bridge crosses the Huajiang Grand Canyon, with its deck soaring 625 meters (2,050 feet) above the river below, a height comparable to China's tallest skyscraper. This engineering feat surpasses the previous record holder, the Duge Bridge, which is also located in the same province. With a total length of 2,890 meters, it is also slated to become the longest mountain bridge globally, further cementing Guizhou's reputation as a hub for record-breaking bridge construction.</p>
