          <h2>Study Suggests Venice's Iconic Winged Lion May Have Originated in Tang Dynasty China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze statue of the winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originally been a tomb guardian from Tang dynasty China. The theory is based on stylistic similarities to mythical Chinese beasts and lead isotope analysis indicating the copper came from China's Lower Yangtze River basin. Researchers speculate the massive statue could have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo, though some scholars in China are contesting this surprising historical claim.</p>
