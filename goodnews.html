          <p>President Donald Trump stated in an interview that he relies on his lawyers to follow the law and doesn't know if he is supposed to uphold the Constitution. He also mentioned that he would not seek a third term as president, despite teasing the possibility in the past, and that he wouldn't fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before his term ends in 2026. These remarks were made during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," where Trump addressed various topics related to his administration and future plans. Trump's comments on the Constitution have sparked controversy, raising questions about his understanding and commitment to the foundational principles of the United States.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist who has promised to ‚ÄúMake Romania Great Again,‚Äù won the first round of his country‚Äôs presidential election on Sunday, bucking the recent trend of voters punishing candidates seen as friendly to President Trump. With more than 98 percent of the votes cast inside Romania counted, Mr. Simion was far ahead of 10 rival candidates, garnering more than 40 percent. A partial count of the votes of Romanians living abroad, who generally tilt hard right, also gave Mr. Simion a big lead. The results, though incomplete, ensured Mr. Simion a slot in a runoff on May 18 against the likely second-place finisher, Nicusor Dan, the centrist mayor of Bucharest, Romania‚Äôs capital.</p>

Simion opposes military aid to Ukraine and is critical of EU leadership, aligning himself with Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" movement. He has stated his desire for a strategic partnership with the US but believes the EU Commission should not interfere with cultural and sexual policies.</p>

Simion is an admirer of US President Donald Trump and believes in a strong NATO. The result is awaited nervously in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv and Moscow. Romania is an important transit route for weapon systems and ammunition to Ukraine.

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming increasingly popular among women who want to preserve their fertility and increase their chances of having a baby later in life. The number of egg freezing procedures has increased significantly, and younger women are beginning to freeze their eggs. Women who have chosen to freeze their eggs say that it means they don't need to rush to find partners, and don't need to obsess over the ticking of their biological clocks. Dr. Tomer Singer believes that, one day, when it's more affordable and covered more frequently by insurance, almost all young women will freeze their eggs as a matter of routine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg freezing is becoming more common as women seek to preserve their fertility, but the process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. A single cycle costs $12,000 to $15,000, with additional annual storage fees and thawing/fertilization costs. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, many women pay out of pocket. Younger women are increasingly choosing egg freezing to avoid compromising on finding the right partner or rushing into parenthood. However, the biological clock remains a factor, as egg quality decreases with age, making the 20s the optimal time to freeze eggs.</p>

This assistance helped young buyers facing high mortgage rates and rising rental costs secure deals at lower mortgage rates. While the proportion of first-time buyers receiving family assistance was slightly lower than the previous year, it remained higher than most years since 2013. The findings highlight the continued impact of higher mortgage rates and tougher lending criteria on first-time buyers.</p>

Later in life, he worked as a clown and wrote essays about his experiences in show business.
