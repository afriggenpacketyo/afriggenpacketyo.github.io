          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has officially won the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, securing a historic 565,639 votes after three rounds of ranked-choice voting. This total surpasses the previous record held by David Dinkins since 1989. Mamdani defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo by nearly 13 percentage points, a result his campaign is calling a mandate for progressive policies like a citywide rent freeze and taxpayer-funded childcare. The victory signals a significant leftward shift in NYC politics, as state and national leaders now prepare to engage with the new nominee ahead of the general election.</p>

          <p>AI server manufacturer Super Micro has announced plans to significantly increase its investment and manufacturing capabilities in Europe to capitalize on surging demand for artificial intelligence technology. CEO Charles Liang confirmed the company, which builds servers using Nvidia chips essential for AI models, will expand beyond its current facilities in the Netherlands. The move aligns with recent calls from Nvidia's CEO for Europe to bolster its computing capacity. Despite recent stock volatility and concerns over financial reporting, Liang dismissed fears of slowing growth, stating the room for expansion remains "very tremendous."</p>

          <p>At 80 years old, John Fogerty delivered an explosive and energetic rock-and-roll performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The setlist was dominated by classics from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), whose song rights he recently reacquired after a long legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's powerful, raspy vocals and guitar skills remained remarkably strong throughout the two-hour show, which he performed without a break. The concert celebrated his enduring legacy and the timelessness of hits like "Bad Moon Rising" and "Fortunate Son."</p>

          <h2>Brazil and India Vow to Triple Trade in Response to Trump's BRICS Tariff Threat</h2>

          <p>In a show of unity against potential U.S. economic pressure, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their trade flows. The move comes after former President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on all member nations of the BRICS economic bloc, which he claimed was established to harm the U.S. and its currency. Trump's continued attacks on the bloc, which unites emerging economies from the Global South, have been met with a defiant stance from its members. The BRICS group, which recently expanded, aims to reform Western-dominated international institutions and has not officially responded to Trump's posture.</p>

          <p>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has once again been named the world's busiest airport, processing over 108 million passengers in 2024, according to a new report from Airports Council International. While Atlanta's traffic remains slightly below pre-pandemic levels, Dubai International Airport ranked second and saw its passenger numbers climb nearly 7% above 2019 figures, also topping the list for international passengers. Global air travel reached a record high of 9.4 billion passengers, with U.S. airports featuring prominently in the top rankings. The data highlights a strong but uneven recovery across the global aviation industry.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a prominent hub for global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. The recent dismantling of USAID as an independent agency and the White House's "America first" mentality are creating a vacuum that China is poised to fill. With the launch of the China-initiated International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong, the city can leverage its cosmopolitan status to advance Beijing's more proactive role in international development. This shift presents a new path for Hong Kong to gain prominence on the world stage.</p>

          <p>An Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years has been released from ICE detention following the intervention of Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Mandonna Kashanian, 64, was detained last month at her New Orleans home despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. After a surge of community support and letters from neighbors, Scalise asked the Department of Homeland Security to review the case, stating she should be judged on her life's work. Her attorney called the intervention "absolutely crucial" in securing her release from custody.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's military intelligence agency, for his role in a scheme that fraudulently places North Korean IT workers in jobs at global companies. The operative, part of the "Andariel" hacking group, allegedly used stolen personal information of U.S. citizens to create aliases for the workers. This vast operation allows North Korea to generate hundreds of millions of dollars to fund its illicit weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. The sanctions also target four entities in a related Russia-based network that funneled money to the regime.</p>

          <p>With forecasters predicting an above-average hurricane season, a growing number of homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are investing in climate-resilient construction. These homes feature designs like aerodynamic round shapes to reduce wind pressure, reinforced roofs, and flood vents to protect foundations against storm surges. Companies like Deltec Homes specialize in building these structures, which are rated to withstand winds up to 190 mph. While costing more upfront, these resilient designs can lead to long-term savings, such as significantly lower insurance premiums, and offer greater peace of mind in storm-prone regions.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The charges are for the crime against humanity of persecution based on gender, specifically targeting girls and women in Afghanistan. The court alleges that since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has systematically deprived females of fundamental rights to education, movement, and expression. The Taliban dismissed the warrants as "nonsense." The ICC, which has no enforcement power, relies on member states to execute its warrants.</p>

          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, known from the "Tiger King" documentary, has been sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison for wildlife trafficking and money laundering. Antle pleaded guilty to illegally buying and selling endangered species, including chimpanzees, lions, and tigers, to supply his South Carolina zoo. Prosecutors stated he laundered over $500,000 to facilitate the black-market animal trade, which fuels poaching. Despite his lawyers arguing for probation to care for his zoo's animals, the judge imposed prison time, though it was less than federal guidelines suggested.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind energy capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A new report from Global Energy Monitor indicates the country is on track to install more than half of the world's projected new offshore wind capacity this year. This push is part of a broader strategy championed by President Xi Jinping to advance the "high-quality development" of China's marine economy. With strong government support and another 22 GW of projects under construction, China is solidifying its position as a global leader in offshore wind technology.</p>

          <p>An Instagram post by British TV personality Gemma Collins advertising a weight-loss program that uses prescription medication has been banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). It is illegal to advertise prescription-only drugs to the public, and the post was one of nine similar ads banned in a recent crackdown. Collins' video promoted the brand Yazen, which offers a doctor-supervised program combining medication with lifestyle coaching. The ASA ruled that although the ad did not name a specific drug, it clearly promoted prescription weight-loss medication, which breaches advertising codes.</p>
