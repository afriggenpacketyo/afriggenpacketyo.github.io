        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.9% increase in June, a rebound attributed to favorable weather conditions. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the warm weather encouraged consumer spending, particularly on fuel and at supermarkets. Supermarkets noted higher sales of beverages as people enjoyed the sunshine, and increased travel boosted fuel purchases. The ONS also revised its previous estimates, indicating that the decline in sales during May was more significant than initially reported, providing additional context for June's recovery.</p>

          <p>Pressure is mounting on India to conclude a trade deal with the United States before an August 1 deadline, after which certain tariffs are set to increase. The urgency has been heightened by a recent U.S.-Japan trade agreement that addressed similar issues, such as market access for American agricultural products, a sensitive topic for India. Analysts suggest that the U.S. is also motivated to finalize a deal, viewing India as a strategic partner and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. India's position within the BRICS bloc and its strategy of multi-alignment through other trade negotiations provide it with additional leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has stepped into a mediation role following recent border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia, urging both nations to exercise restraint and de-escalate the situation. A Chinese official emphasized that both countries are friendly neighbors and important ASEAN members, expressing hope that their tradition of peaceful dispute resolution will prevail. The intervention comes after intense fighting, including artillery and rocket fire, erupted along their shared border on Thursday. The conflict has reportedly resulted in multiple casualties, including civilians, marking a significant escalation of a long-standing territorial dispute.</p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is set to return to the octagon against Reinier de Ridder, nine months after a severe jaw injury forced him to submit in a previous fight. The injury, which saw his bottom teeth caved in, required surgery and the installation of dental implants, a procedure Whittaker says has significantly improved his quality of life. Now 34, the Australian fighter reflects that his motivation has shifted from reclaiming titles to setting an example for his children. He anticipates his opponent will try to take the fight to the ground but is prepared for a lengthy, challenging bout.</p>

          <h2>FA Chief States No Current Need to Expand VAR's Role in Football</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 01:37:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Football Association (FA) chief executive Mark Bullingham has stated that there is no immediate need to expand the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) system in football. Responding to reports that the sport's law-making body, IFAB, might consider widening VAR's powers to include corner kicks and second yellow cards, Bullingham expressed concerns about increasing game interruptions. He asserted that the FA's position is that the current application of VAR is in a "good place." Any changes to VAR's scope would require a three-quarters majority vote from the IFAB board, which includes the four British associations and FIFA.</p>

          <p>During his visit to his Scottish golf resorts, U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to refine the recent bilateral trade deal. While a baseline agreement is in place, key issues remain unresolved, including the removal of 25% U.S. tariffs on British steel and aluminum and disagreements over the U.K.'s digital services tax. Economists suggest a potential trade-off could see the U.S. reduce metal tariffs in exchange for the U.K. dropping the tech tax. The meeting is seen as an opportunity for the U.K. to solidify its trade position amid wider global economic tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a UK-first initiative, individuals in Wales with conditions like coeliac disease will receive pre-loaded debit-style cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system offers an alternative to the current prescription model, aiming to give people more freedom and convenience in managing their medical dietary needs. The Welsh government intends for the scheme to be cost-neutral, de-medicalizing the process and reducing administrative burdens on doctors and pharmacies. A pilot participant noted the card was helpful, though the monthly allowance only "scratches the surface" of the higher costs associated with a gluten-free diet, which can be 35% more expensive.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley stated he feels "refreshed and recharged" as he enters his fourth season, despite mounting pressure following a 7-6 record last year. Riley attributes his renewed calm to having a more established program and a strong front office, allowing him to focus on making final adjustments rather than foundational changes. He expressed confidence in the team's progress, particularly on defense, which improved significantly under coordinator D'Anton Lynn. Riley also praised the development of new starting quarterback Jayden Maiava, suggesting the team is poised to take the necessary steps to win close games.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Australia have signed a new treaty formalizing a 50-year commitment to the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine program. This move aims to solidify the trilateral defense pact, which also includes the United States, and support both nations' submarine industries for decades. U.K. officials stated the deal could generate tens of thousands of jobs and deliver up to £20 billion in British exports over 25 years. The agreement reinforces the partnership at a time of uncertainty over the long-term U.S. role and growing concerns about China's military expansion in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to directly observe and measure quantum friction between two solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, the scientists discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds exhibited less resistance. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, restricting the conversion of motion into heat. The breakthrough provides the first experimental evidence of this phenomenon and could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale machines and devices.</p>
