          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed a fall in the energy price cap, resulting in a typical household saving ¬£11 a month starting in July. Ofgem is encouraging consumers to explore fixed-rate energy deals, potentially saving up to ¬£200 annually. While the price cap is decreasing, fixed deals could offer better value, providing certainty in monthly payments. The article notes that despite the decrease, energy prices remain high, and many households are struggling with debt to suppliers, emphasizing the need for targeted government support and energy efficiency measures.</p>

          <p>Local governments in China will now be required to justify any significant increases in fines imposed on private companies, specifically if the total rises by more than 20% year-on-year. This directive from Beijing aims to curb arbitrary fines and inspections targeting private enterprises. The initiative is part of the central government's broader efforts to bolster economic recovery, focusing on issues such as unlawful enforcement, inconsistent standards, and abuse of power. The Justice Ministry's initiative will involve real-time nationwide statistical analysis of enforcement activity to detect unusual increases in punitive fees.</p>
