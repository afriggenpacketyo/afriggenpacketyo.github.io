        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores how much monthly income a $500,000 annuity could generate for a 65-year-old, noting several influencing factors. Payments vary based on gender, with men receiving around $3,269 and women around $3,151 per month for life, while a joint life annuity pays approximately $2,863 per month. The current higher-rate environment is favorable for annuity payouts, but potential Federal Reserve rate cuts could change this. The type of annuity, payout features, and inflation protection also affect monthly income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seven years after the Windrush scandal was exposed, the government has appointed the Reverend Clive Foster as the first Windrush commissioner. Foster, a senior pastor and founder of the Nottingham Windrush Support Forum, will serve a three-year term focused on improving the Windrush Compensation Scheme. The scheme has faced criticism for slow processing, low offers, and unfair rejections, prompting calls for independent management. Foster aims to deliver tangible change for the Windrush generation, ensuring justice and effective compensation.</p>

          <p>Amazon's Zoox robotaxi unit is ramping up vehicle production at its new facility in Hayward, California, in preparation for a commercial ride-hailing service launch later this year. The facility is currently producing one robotaxi per day, with plans to accelerate production to a capacity of 10,000 robotaxis per year. Zoox aims to operate between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in select cities, having already begun testing on public roads in several locations. The company emphasizes that its production needs differ from traditional automakers, as it is not selling the vehicles directly to consumers.</p>

The combined company will become the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, with Nippon Steel bringing advanced technology to U.S. Steel's manufacturing processes.
