          <p>The Women's Super League (WSL) is set to expand from 12 to 14 teams starting in the 2026-27 season, a proposal presented by WSL Football at a shareholders' meeting. The Football Association (FA) is expected to formally approve the changes, which include adjustments to promotion and relegation processes between WSL 2 and the WSL. Initially, the top three teams from WSL 2 will have the opportunity to move up, with a play-off determining the final spot; however, the future structure will involve one automatic promotion and a play-off between the second-lowest WSL team and the WSL 2 runner-up. These changes aim to foster growth and competitiveness within women's football, requiring all participating clubs to meet specific licensing criteria.</p>

          <p>Savings experts are weighing in on the most beneficial certificate of deposit (CD) terms to consider ahead of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Short-term CDs are currently offering the highest interest rates, making them ideal for those seeking to maximize returns quickly, while long-term CDs provide stability and predictability for savers with a solid emergency fund. A CD ladder, combining various CD term lengths, offers a balance between high rates and flexibility. Regardless of the chosen term, experts recommend researching and comparing rates from different banks and credit unions to secure the best possible return. (not investment advice)</p>

While dramatic swings are unlikely, rates could remain stable, rise, or decline depending on economic triggers; experts suggest that rates will hover around 6.875% to 7.125% unless there is a clear break in labor or inflation unexpectedly cools. If rates remain the same, experts recommend negotiating rate buydowns or exploring different loan programs, while a cooling economy could prompt the Fed to cut rates. (not investment advice)</p>
