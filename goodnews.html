          <p>Macy's stock surged by 20% after the retailer announced second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street's forecasts and subsequently raised its full-year financial outlook. The company credited this strong performance to successful strategies in its revamped stores and robust sales in key apparel categories. CEO Tony Spring expressed cautious optimism, noting that while tariff impacts are a consideration, the company is well-positioned to navigate the economic environment and benefit from resilient consumer spending habits.

          <p>With gold prices surging to a record high of nearly $3,550 per ounce, the value of physical gold purchased by consumers has increased significantly. An ounce of gold bought from Costco a year ago for around $2,679 has seen a substantial unrealized gain, reflecting a broader trend of investors turning to gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation. However, selling the gold for a profit involves complexities, as sellers must account for dealer fees and taxes on collectibles, which can reduce the final return. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have uncovered more complete remains of Spicomellus, an armored dinosaur from over 165 million years ago, revealing a creature with an extraordinary defense system. The herbivore, about the size of a small car, was covered in a diverse array of plates and spikes, including three-foot-long spikes on its neck and ribs fused with projecting barbs—a feature never seen before in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting that these dinosaurs developed highly elaborate and potentially ornamental armor much earlier than previously believed.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision for New York state, a judge has ruled that advanced whole genome sequencing can be used as evidence in the trial of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer. This cutting-edge forensic technique allowed investigators to link DNA from degraded, rootless hair strands found on victims to Heuermann and his family members. While prosecutors hailed the ruling as a major victory for forensic science, the defense immediately challenged it, arguing the testing lab is not licensed in New York.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot swells to an estimated $1.4 billion, the take-home amount for a potential winner varies significantly depending on their state of residence. After a mandatory 37% federal tax, winners in states with no state income tax on lottery prizes, such as Florida and Texas, would receive the largest payout. Conversely, winners in states with high income taxes, like New York, would see their prize money reduced by millions more, highlighting the major financial impact of local tax laws on massive lottery winnings.</p>
