          <p>President Trump announced a forthcoming trade deal with a "big, and highly respected, country" but did not disclose the country's name. Reports from the New York Times and Politico suggested the agreement may be with the UK. The announcement is scheduled to take place at 10:00 AM in Washington DC. The deal would be the first of its kind since Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, so the nature of the deal may be something of a framework rather than a detailed and comprehensive agreement.</p>

          <p>Public transportation services in Japan are implementing AI to improve lost-and-found operations. Find Inc.'s AI-based platform is being used by around 30 organizations at approximately 2,300 stations, including Haneda airport and the Tokyo police force. Keio Corp., a railway operator, has seen its return rate of lost possessions increase from less than 10% to 30% since adopting the system. The AI system analyzes photos of lost items and matches them with inquiries made through messaging apps in multiple languages, significantly reducing search times and improving the recovery rate of lost items.</p>
