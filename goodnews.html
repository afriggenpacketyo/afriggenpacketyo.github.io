The report highlighted a 15% increase in monthly active platform consumers, reaching 180 million.

Authorities established a wide exclusion zone around the site to allow explosive ordnance disposal teams to safely defuse the munition.

          <p>Disney's fiscal third-quarter earnings surpassed analyst predictions, bolstered by strong performance in its theme parks and direct-to-consumer streaming services. The company's experiences segment, which includes parks and cruises, saw revenue increase by 8%, while the Disney+ streaming service added 1.8 million subscribers. These positive results helped offset continued headwinds in the traditional linear TV business and a weaker theatrical box office performance compared to the same period last year, leading the company to raise its full-year earnings guidance.

          <p>A new annual report from the FBI indicates a significant nationwide decrease in crime for 2024, challenging political assertions of an out-of-control crime wave. The data reveals a 4.5% drop in all violent crime, with murders and non-negligent manslaughter falling by 14.5% from the previous year. While the report also notes a concerning increase in assaults against law enforcement officers, the overall trend shows that both violent and property crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1960s. Reported incidents of sexual assault were also down 5.2%.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk is intensifying its direct-to-consumer sales strategy for its highly popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy. This move is a response to dual pressures: demands from the Trump administration for lower U.S. drug prices and increased competition from cheaper, compounded versions of the medication. Although Wegovy sales surged 67% year-over-year, the company revised its sales forecast downward, attributing the adjustment to the market impact of what it calls "unsafe and unlawful mass compounding" of its product.

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has affirmed that financially distressed English football clubs like Sheffield Wednesday and Morecambe can "absolutely" be saved from the brink of collapse. She emphasized that a new independent football regulator, set to be established later this year, will be granted significant powers to ensure financial stability in the sport. These powers will include stronger tests for owners and directors and the ability to force the sale of a club in dire circumstances, aiming to prevent repeats of past club collapses.</p>

          <p>In a significant move to address its plummeting birth rate and aging population, China has announced it will waive tuition fees for the final year of public kindergarten, starting this autumn. The policy, which also includes subsidies for children attending approved private kindergartens, is part of a broader plan to make preschool education free. By reducing the financial burden of raising children, Beijing hopes to lower education costs and incentivize families to have more children amid a slowing economy and a deepening demographic crisis.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by what they see as the city's slow response to traffic safety concerns, some Los Angeles residents are taking matters into their own hands by painting their own crosswalks at dangerous intersections. One such DIY project in the Sawtelle neighborhood was initially removed by the city but is now slated to be made permanent following community outcry. This trend of citizen-led infrastructure improvements highlights a broader dissatisfaction with bureaucratic delays and has spawned groups like the Crosswalk Collective LA, which engage in civil disobedience to protect pedestrians.</p>

          <p>In a significant victory for immigrant rights advocates, a California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California must reconsider its policy that prohibits undocumented students from holding on-campus jobs. The court determined that the UC's primary justification—fear of potential federal litigation under a 1986 immigration law—was not sufficient grounds to maintain its "facially discriminatory" policy. While the ruling does not force an immediate reversal, it requires the university system to re-evaluate the ban based on proper legal criteria, potentially opening up crucial opportunities for students.</p>

          <p>HBO's "The Penguin," a spinoff from the 2022 film "The Batman," has earned an impressive 24 Emmy nominations for its deep and nuanced origin story of the classic villain. Creator Lauren LeFranc and stars Colin Farrell, Cristin Milioti, and Deirdre O’Connell discuss how they approached the project as an intimate character drama rather than a "giant franchise." The series explores new backstories, focusing on the complex relationships between Oswald "Oz" Cobb, his dementia-afflicted mother, and a rival mob daughter, allowing the actors significant freedom to explore their characters' depths.</p>
