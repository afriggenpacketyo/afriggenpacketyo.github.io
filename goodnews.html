          <p>A trade loophole that allowed low-value packages, especially from retailers like Shein and Temu, to enter the U.S. duty-free expired on May 2nd, potentially raising prices for American consumers. This de minimis exemption, initially designed to ease trade, has seen a surge in e-commerce exports from China, now facing new tariffs of up to 145%. Experts predict that the end of this exemption will not only increase costs but also cause delays due to increased inspections, potentially diminishing the market and affecting smaller retailers disproportionately. Some believe domestic companies may benefit from the new landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Early results from recent elections in the UK indicate that the Reform party is posing a significant challenge to the Conservative and Labour parties. The Reform party has gained seats primarily at the expense of the Conservatives, who have suffered a substantial decline in their vote share. While Labour has also experienced a decrease in support, they managed to hold onto key mayoral positions. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens are expected to maintain a similar level of support as in previous elections, but narrow wins and losses suggest a fragmented political landscape.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has enlisted a team of prominent conservative lawyers, including former clerks to Supreme Court justices and advisors to the Trump Organization, to defend itself against a lawsuit from the Trump administration. This strategic move is seen as a departure from Harvard's previous legal approaches, aiming to appeal to the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. The university argues that the administration's demands, including the elimination of certain professors and the banning of international students with dissenting views, violate the First Amendment. The case could have significant financial implications for Harvard, with billions of dollars in federal funds at stake.</p>

          <p>London's FTSE 100 index has broken its record for the longest winning streak, gaining more than 5% since the beginning of the year. The UK's neutral trade status and robust corporate results have shielded it from punitive tariffs faced by other regions. Defensive giants in healthcare, energy, and consumer staples have drawn investors seeking refuge from volatility. Analysts suggest the FTSE 100 has the potential to extend its record run, but uncertainty over U.S. trade policy could limit further gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix stock is trading at all-time high levels, marking its longest positive run ever with 11 straight days of gains. The streaming giant's success follows a strong earnings report, with revenue growing 13% due to higher subscription and advertising dollars. Netflix has been largely unaffected by Trump's tariffs and trade war with China, and analysts see more upside for shares. The company has stopped sharing details on its membership numbers, instead focusing on revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers diving in a submersible in the eastern Pacific witnessed a submarine volcanic eruption along the mid-ocean ridge. The eruption entombed a thriving ecosystem under fresh lava rock, marking the first time scientists have observed a clearly active eruption along the mid-ocean ridge. The event offers a unique opportunity to study the birth of new seafloor and its effects on ocean chemistry and marine life. The team is continuing to study the volcanic activity remotely from the Atlantis.</p>
