        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Marine Corps member stationed in Okinawa Prefecture was sentenced to seven years in prison by a Japanese district court for an alleged sexual assault case that occurred in May of the previous year. Jamel Clayton, 22, pleaded not guilty, denying any sexual intention and the use of physical force against the woman, who was in her 20s. The Naha District Court found the victim's testimonies highly credible, stating that Clayton choked her from behind and attempted sexual intercourse, resulting in injuries requiring two weeks of treatment. The southern prefecture of Okinawa hosts the majority of U.S. military installations in Japan, which has led to anti-base sentiment due to aircraft noise, pollution, and crimes committed by American service members. The court's ruling emphasized the credibility of the victim's account. The optimism score is based on the perpetrator being brought to justice. </p>

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, specifically the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill. The MPs have signed an amendment that would allow them to vote on a proposal to reject the welfare reform bill in its entirety. Concerns are centered around plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save ¬£5 billion a year by 2030. The amendment cites the number of people expected to be pushed into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the job market and people's health as reasons to reject the bill. The optimism score reflects the effort to protect vulnerable populations. </p>
