          <h2>American Eagle Outfitters Becomes Latest 'Meme Stock' Following Sydney Sweeney Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 10:42:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant stock surge, positioning it as a new meme stock. The rally is linked to high short interest and a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, which has generated buzz among retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. This trend follows similar volatile trading for other brands like GoPro and Kohl's, as investors target heavily shorted stocks. The company hopes the campaign, focused on its denim line, will reverse a recent 35% decline in its stock value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank has maintained its key interest rates, pausing a series of cuts amidst significant economic uncertainty, particularly regarding trade relations with the United States. While euro area inflation has reached the ECB's 2% target, the potential for new U.S. tariffs on EU goods has prompted a "wait and watch" approach from policymakers. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that risks to economic growth are "tilted to the downside," but a quick resolution could boost growth. The central bank is keeping all options open, with future decisions heavily dependent on the outcome of trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 10:26:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the potential loss of assets when filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, a consideration for many Americans facing economic pressure from inflation and high interest rates. Under Chapter 7, or "liquidation" bankruptcy, a trustee may sell non-exempt assets like second homes or valuable collectibles to pay creditors, though many personal items are protected by exemption laws. In contrast, Chapter 13 involves a repayment plan that typically allows individuals to keep their property. The article also suggests exploring alternatives such as debt management plans or consolidation loans before resorting to bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has convicted two militia leaders from the Central African Republic for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. The individuals, a former football official and a militiaman known as "Rambo," were found guilty for their roles in leading attacks against Muslim civilians between 2013 and 2014. This conviction marks a significant step in holding individuals accountable for the atrocities committed during the country's civil conflict. The verdict delivers a measure of justice for the victims of the targeted violence that plagued the nation during that period.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is preparing to run for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina in 2026, a move said to be approved by the White House. On the Democratic side, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also expected to announce his candidacy for the same seat, which is being vacated by retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis. The developments come as Lara Trump, daughter-in-law of the President, announced she would not be seeking the seat. This sets the stage for a high-profile battleground contest in a key 2026 race.</p>

The operation, involving nearly 3,000 security personnel and 52 raids, resulted in eight key arrests in the State of Mexico. The criminal group allegedly controlled labor unions and extorted businesses and individuals across 14 municipalities in various industries. The crackdown, named "Operation Liberacion," is seen as a significant move to protect the local economy and combat the widespread problem of cartel extortion in the country.</p>

          <p>Ghana's President John Mahama has introduced a major policy initiative to create a "24-hour economy," aiming to transform the nation from an import-based to a self-sufficient model. The plan involves key industries operating in three eight-hour shifts daily, a move projected to create 1.7 million jobs and reduce unemployment. However, economists and observers raise concerns about its feasibility, citing the need for significant funding (estimated at $4 billion) and robust infrastructure, including a stable power supply. The success of the program will depend heavily on collaboration between the government, private sector, and labor unions.</p>

          <p>Researchers from China's Zhejiang University have developed a new preparation technique for creating aerogels with superior mechanical strength and high elasticity. Traditional aerogels are excellent insulators but are often fragile, limiting their use in applications like shielding aircraft. The new method, published in the journal Science, uses nanoscale graphene oxide to create a unique internal dome-like cellular structure, which the lead author compared to making a mille-feuille pastry. This innovative process allows for hundreds of different formulations, producing ultratough materials that can better withstand pressure and impact, opening new possibilities for advanced aerospace and industrial applications.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank's shares gained over 9% after the company reported second-quarter net profits of €1.485 billion, significantly beating analyst expectations and showing a strong recovery from a loss in the same period last year. The positive results were achieved despite mixed performance in its investment banking unit and the impact of a stronger euro. While fixed income and currency trading saw an 11% revenue increase, the advisory division declined due to market uncertainty. The bank affirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, citing good business momentum and cost discipline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has confirmed the launch of a new political party alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. In a joint statement, they called for a "real, democratic alternative" to the current political system, which they labeled as "rigged." The new party is expected to position itself to the left of Labour, advocating for policies like wealth taxes, nationalization of key industries, and an end to arms sales to Israel. The move could potentially draw votes away from Labour in future elections, creating a new dynamic on the British left.</p>

          <p>An arrest has been made in a four-decade-old cold case involving the murder and sexual assault of two teenagers in Northern California, thanks to advances in forensic genetic genealogy. In 1984, 18-year-old Terrance Arndt was shot and killed, and his female companion was sexually assaulted. The case remained unsolved for decades until 2024, when investigators used DNA evidence from the crime scene to identify 64-year-old Roger Neil Schmidt Sr. as a suspect. Schmidt, who lived in the area at the time of the crime, was arrested in Tucson, Arizona, and is being extradited to California to face charges.</p>

          <p>Juliet Schor, a lead researcher on four-day workweek trials, discusses the overwhelmingly positive outcomes for both companies and employees. In studies of over 245 organizations, the shortened week led to increased profits, near-zero turnover, and significant improvements in employee well-being, including less burnout and better health. A surprising finding was that self-reported productivity jumped, and employees felt more in control of their work and personal lives without an increase in work pace. Schor argues that momentum for the four-day week continues to build as a solution to widespread stress and disengagement in the workforce.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SUPPLY Act, has been introduced in the U.S. House to make it easier for homeowners to finance the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), such as backyard cottages or garage apartments. The legislation would authorize government-backed second mortgages specifically for ADU projects, a financing option that is currently rare. By allowing agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase these loans, the bill aims to reduce risk for lenders and expand access to financing for lower- and middle-income households. Proponents argue this could help alleviate the national housing shortage by boosting supply.</p>
