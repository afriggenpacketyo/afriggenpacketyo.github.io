          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter, driven by a 6% increase in U.S. daily package volume. The company announced it achieved its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aims to reduce costs by an additional $1 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. While FedEx's stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance falling slightly below expectations, the company's CEO expressed confidence in its transformation initiatives. FedEx is also planning to spin off its Freight division, and these results come shortly after the death of its founder and executive chairman, Fred Smith (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company, secured a legal victory in a copyright case regarding the use of copyrighted books to train its chatbot, Claude. A judge ruled that using legally purchased books for AI model training was "quintessentially transformative" and did not violate copyright law's "fair use" doctrine. However, Anthropic still faces a separate trial in December concerning the downloading of millions of pirated books, with employees expressing concerns about the legality of using pirate sites. The ruling sets a precedent for similar disputes, while the upcoming trial addresses the ethics of using illegally obtained data for AI training.</p>
