          <p>President Trump falsely claimed gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, despite the national average being around $3.165. This figure is actually an increase of nearly 2 cents from the previous week and $1.18 more than Trump's claim. The increase this week is the first time drivers have paid more at the pump in nearly a month. Trump administration officials pointed to RBOB gasoline futures, which did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, but this contract doesn't reflect what consumers pay at the pump as it excludes taxes, transportation, and other costs.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has announced he will not run for Senate in 2026, disappointing Republicans who viewed him as their strongest candidate to challenge vulnerable Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. Kemp, a popular two-term governor, cited family reasons for his decision. His complicated relationship with Donald Trump, who previously attacked Kemp for not supporting his false election claims, loomed over a potential campaign. Ossoff, who has raised $11 million in the first quarter of 2025, is preparing for a tough race, while several other Georgia Republicans may now consider running.</p>
