          <p>Bill Gates has pledged to give away the majority of his wealth by 2045 through the Gates Foundation to address pressing global issues such as child mortality, disease eradication, and poverty reduction. Gates criticized Elon Musk for leading cuts to USAID, predicting a rise in childhood deaths. The Gates Foundation, the world's largest private foundation, plans to double its giving to $200 billion by 2045 before dissolving. Gates's wealth originates from co-founding Microsoft, and he has diversified his assets through Cascade Investment, with stakes in various businesses including Republic Services and Deere & Co.</p>

          <h2>British Tin Trade Played Key Role in Bronze Age Civilizations, Study Finds</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that tin mined in Cornwall and Devon, England, around 3,300 years ago was traded to ancient kingdoms in the East Mediterranean. This discovery establishes that Britain was a crucial supplier of goods and materials to neighboring nations during the Bronze Age. The research puts to rest centuries of speculation about how tin used in Bronze Age communities found its way into Eurasia. The study analyzed tin ores and artifacts from shipwrecks and across Europe, demonstrating the volume and consistency of the tin trade and transforming our understanding of Britain's social and economic relationships with distant societies.</p>

          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, rattling homes and waking residents as far away as Atlanta and western North Carolina. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, the USGS received over 23,000 reports from the public. Earthquakes are not uncommon in the region, with the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone being one of the most active in the Southeast. The region's geology allows seismic waves to spread more efficiently, causing earthquakes to be felt over a larger distance.</p>

          <p>Google has reached a settlement in principle with the state of Texas, agreeing to pay $1.375 billion over allegations that the company violated users' data privacy.

Google said the settlement addresses claims related to Incognito mode, location history, and biometrics, without admitting any wrongdoing. The settlement does not require product changes, as Google claims to have already updated the relevant policies.</p>
