Later in his career, Garwin worked at IBM, contributing to advancements in MRI technology, laser printers, and touch-screen monitors, and advised presidents on national defense issues.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have advanced President Trump's tax bill, including trillions in tax breaks, through the House Ways and Means Committee. The bill's passage follows overnight debate, with a 26-19 party-line vote in the committee. A key point of contention remains the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), with some lawmakers pushing for a higher limit than the proposed $30,000 cap for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. The full House vote is expected soon, but the legislation may face significant changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address overcrowding in England and Wales prisons, the government will implement limits on how long some offenders can be returned to prison. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that offenders recalled for breaching their licenses will be released after a fixed 28-day period. This measure aims to free up approximately 1,400 prison spaces and provide time to overhaul the system. While the prison population is nearing capacity, the changes will not apply to those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar, who was detained allegedly based on his pro-Palestinian speech. The judge sided with the ACLU's argument that Suri's detention was a violation of his First Amendment rights and that he was unfairly targeted due to his wife's past work with the Gaza foreign ministry and his father-in-law's connection to a deceased Hamas leader. Suri will be released on bail while his removal proceedings continue, as the judge determined he is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community.</p>

          <h2>The Reasons Behind High Prescription Drug Costs in the U.S.</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent executive order to lower prescription drug prices has sparked debate about the high costs paid by U.S. patients. The U.S. consistently pays more for prescription drugs than other high-income countries, primarily due to its complex reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control. Drug prices are typically set by pharmaceutical companies and negotiated by private insurers. While Americans pay more for branded drugs, they often pay less for generic drugs compared to other nations.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving more than three decades for killing their parents. The brothers, who claimed they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse, were previously serving life sentences without the possibility of parole. A resentencing petition was filed in 2023, arguing that new evidence corroborated the abuse allegations. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before potentially reaching the governor's office.</p>

The incident occurred after a 360-mile journey from Italy to France, with the driver alleging he was owed additional cash. The driver reportedly sped off with the couple's luggage, which was later recovered from a police station, but with a sum of money missing from Ms. Green's bag. The FCDO strongly disputes the driver's version of events, stating that the fare was paid in full.</p>
