          <p>The U.S. is deploying 200 troops to Israel to support and monitor the recently approved ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, according to multiple reports. These troops will establish a "civil-military coordination center" to facilitate the flow of crucial humanitarian aid and logistical assistance into Gaza, though they will not be sent into the territory itself. The agreement, announced by Donald Trump, is presented as a significant step towards "Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace" and includes a vital hostage-prisoner exchange. Humanitarian officials are eagerly anticipating permission from Israel to deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza, where millions remain displaced and famine has been declared.</p>

          <p>The "Asean plus three" group of countries, including China, Japan, and South Korea, achieved robust economic growth in the first half of 2025, with a projected 4.1% growth for the year. This upward revision from earlier forecasts still represents a slight decrease from 2024's 4.3% growth, according to the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO). Despite defying expectations, AMRO warns that unpredictable policy shifts in the United States, particularly tariffs ranging from 15% to 40% on several member nations, pose significant and persistent trade war risks. These external pressures could still send tremors through the region, impacting future economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Exploring Four Health Benefits of Spending Time in Nature</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spending just 20 minutes in nature can yield significant health benefits, triggering measurable physiological changes that promote well-being. This article highlights four key advantages: unconscious relaxation that lowers blood pressure and heart rate, a hormonal reboot that reduces stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, the powerful calming effect of natural scents, and the introduction of beneficial bacteria into the gut microbiome. Experts like Professor Kathy Willis emphasize that nature "calms what needs calming and strengthens what needs strengthening," impacting immune function and mood. These findings support "green social prescribing" initiatives, connecting individuals with natural environments for improved physical and mental health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois for 14 days. U.S. District Judge April Perry cited "significant doubt" regarding the Department of Homeland Security's credibility, finding no credible evidence of an organized rebellion to justify military intervention. The ruling prevents National Guard units, including those from Texas already in Chicago, from operating on their mission to protect federal agents and facilities. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson lauded the decision as a crucial victory for states' sovereignty and the rule of law, criticizing the deployment as politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has initiated a task force to address and improve chronic substandard living conditions in military barracks, demanding a comprehensive improvement plan within 30 days. Hegseth emphasized that quality housing is a critical component for "reviving our warrior ethos and rebuilding our military," citing a 2023 Government Accountability Report that revealed "filthy conditions" and systemic neglect. This initiative aims to restore trust among service members, who often express deep dissatisfaction with their housing and the system's responsiveness to their concerns. The effort seeks to overcome long-standing issues and previous administrations' challenges in prioritizing barracks maintenance.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, a prominent election technology company, has been acquired by St. Louis-based Liberty Vote, founded by former Republican elections director Scott Leiendecker. The acquisition aims to restore trust in American elections by focusing on paper-based transparency, security, and simplicity in voting systems. This development follows years of Dominion combating false accusations of election rigging after the 2020 presidential election, which resulted in substantial defamation settlements with media outlets like Fox News. Liberty Vote, emphasizing its "100% AMERICAN OWNED" status, plans to provide key infrastructure for voting and voter verification systems across numerous states.</p>

          <p>Ann Walter, a resident of rural West Texas, had a surprising encounter when she observed a car-sized object slowly drifting across the sky, which ultimately landed in her neighbor's wheat field.

The equipment, designed to gather data on stars, galaxies, and black holes, was later successfully recovered by NASA researchers. Walter and her family captured photographs and videos of the surreal experience, marking an unusual and intriguing discovery of space technology in an unexpected location.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a 20-point peace plan, announced by President Trump, following intense indirect negotiations in Egypt. This initial phase entails an immediate ceasefire, a partial Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza, and the release of all 20 remaining living Israeli hostages in exchange for approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees. Crucially, hundreds of lorries carrying humanitarian aid are expected to begin entering Gaza daily to address the dire humanitarian crisis. While this phase is a significant breakthrough, subsequent negotiations on demilitarization, governance, and the full extent of Israeli withdrawal are anticipated to face numerous contentious points.</p>

Comedian Alan Carr struggled visibly after "murdering" his friend Paloma Faith, highlighting the celebrities' genuine nerves and limited acting skills under pressure.

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel's strategy of prioritizing team cohesion over individual star power was resoundingly vindicated in England's dominant 3-0 victory over Wales. Despite Tuchel's public criticism of the "silent" Wembley crowd, his decision to exclude Jude Bellingham proved effective, with Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers excelling in the number 10 role and scoring an early goal. This outstanding performance cements Rogers as a key figure in the new team identity Tuchel aims to cultivate, signaling that no player, regardless of status, is guaranteed a spot. The decisive win, achieved without several injured key players, reinforces Tuchel's conviction in building a strong, unified squad for the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>A news analysis suggests that the recently brokered Gaza ceasefire deal, implementing the first phase of President Trump's peace plan, presents both significant opportunities for praise and potential peril for his legacy. While securing a hostage exchange and ceasefire is a notable diplomatic victory, historical precedents indicate that sustained engagement is critically important for achieving lasting peace in the volatile region. Trump leveraged strong relationships with Arab partners and Israeli leadership to finalize the agreement, with Jared Kushner playing an unofficial yet active role. The deal's long-term success hinges on successfully navigating contentious later phases, and any failure could lead to blame directed at Hamas.</p>
