        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales growth in April slowed to 5.1%, missing analyst expectations, indicating that consumption remains a concern for the Chinese economy. However, industrial output grew by 6.1%, exceeding expectations, suggesting that the impact of U.S. tariffs was not as severe as anticipated. The statistics bureau acknowledged external uncertainties and the need to consolidate the foundation for sustained economic recovery. The real estate sector continues to face challenges, with home prices declining, and overall domestic demand lacking momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in intensive negotiations aimed at securing a landmark reset of relations since Brexit, with discussions focusing on defense, trade, fishing rights, and a potential youth mobility scheme. Despite progress, Conservative and Reform UK leaders have criticized the potential deal as a "surrender," even before the details are fully known. Negotiations are being driven by a focus on jobs, lower household bills, and stronger borders, with potential agreements including British access to an EU defense fund and a post-Brexit deal on fishing rights. A youth mobility scheme is also under consideration, although it has faced mixed reactions from opposition parties.</p>

          <p>Innovent Biologics, a Hong Kong-listed biotech firm, is positioning itself to compete with established pharmaceutical giants like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in the burgeoning global market for diabetes drugs used for weight loss.

Innovent's mazdutide drug is expected to gain approval for weight management and type 2 diabetes this year, potentially offering a domestic alternative to foreign-made medications.

          <p>Japan plans to introduce a pre-arrival screening system for visa-free travelers by fiscal year 2028 to enhance the efficiency of immigration processes and further boost inbound tourism. The system, modeled after the U.S. Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), will require travelers from visa-exempt countries to provide personal and travel information before arrival. This will enable the Immigration Services Agency of Japan to examine travelers' data in advance and deny boarding to those with criminal records or histories of illegal stays in Japan.</p>

The strike, which halted trains across New Jersey for four days, is a relief to commuters who rely on the system to travel to New York City and Philadelphia. NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri said the deal is fair and fiscally responsible, reflecting concessions made by way of a work rule.

Despite Simion's success among diaspora voters, Dan's victory was celebrated by supporters who want to see Romania on a pro-European path.
