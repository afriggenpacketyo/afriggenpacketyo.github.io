          <p>The Supreme Court's 4-to-4 vote prevented the nation‚Äôs first religious charter school from opening in Oklahoma, seemingly halting the conservative movement to expand government funding for religious education. However, this ruling may be a minor setback as conservatives are pushing a school voucher movement, which has gained traction in Republican state legislatures and is nearing nationwide implementation. The House passed legislation that could create a federal school voucher program, setting aside $5 billion to fund private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning for families. This bill, structured as a tax credit, is expected to benefit wealthy taxpayers and could significantly increase the number of students using public funds for religious education, potentially reaching as many as 1 million students nationwide.</p>

The police are investigating the incident, focusing on the officer on watch, who admitted to falling asleep, an explanation that has happened before.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook is once again facing pressure from President Donald Trump regarding the manufacturing location of iPhones. Trump expressed frustration that Apple produces iPhones in Asia, stating that if the company does not manufacture them in the United States, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid. Analysts believe that producing iPhones in the U.S. is not feasible and would significantly increase costs for consumers. Apple has been shifting production to countries like India and Vietnam to avoid tariffs, but Trump's latest remarks underscore the challenges businesses face in navigating the administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>A judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enroll foreign students. This ruling follows a lawsuit filed by Harvard, which claims the administration's decision is a "blatant violation" of the law and free speech rights. The Trump administration argues that Harvard has not done enough to combat antisemitism and change its hiring and admissions practices, allegations the university denies. The order pauses a move to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), a government database that manages foreign students.</p>

          <p>A significant shift in SEC regulations is expected to trigger an unprecedented surge in ETF launches, potentially doubling the existing market. Financial expert Dave Nadig anticipates around 3,000 new ETFs entering the market as mutual fund managers introduce ETF share classes for existing funds. This influx of products will place a considerable burden on investors and advisors to carefully evaluate their options. While many of these new ETFs will offer traditional asset allocation strategies, investors should exercise caution with straight-to-ETF strategies and those involving illiquid assets, as the ETF structure may not always be suitable for such investments.</p>
