          <p>This article discusses how voters in countries allied with the United States are favoring stability over disruption, particularly in light of the unpredictable policies and behavior of figures like Elon Musk and Peter Navarro. The article contrasts Musk's slash-and-burn approach to government efficiency with Navarro's foreign trade policies, highlighting the concerns of shell-shocked voters who are wary of further upheaval. The analysis suggests a preference for a more predictable and reliable international environment among these nations, especially considering recent global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he will be holding a press conference to announce a major trade deal with a 'big, and highly respected, country,' speculated to be the United Kingdom. This announcement comes after Trump imposed tariffs on dozens of trading partners, before announcing a 90-day pause on the levies, prompting nations to scramble for deals with Washington. The specifics of the agreement remain unclear, but it could involve lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products in exchange for lower British taxes on US technology companies.</p>

          <p>An avatar of the late British novelist Agatha Christie is 'teaching' an online writing course, raising ethical questions about using artificial intelligence to resurrect the dead. The course, created with the help of academic researchers and a digital prosthetic, has sparked debate about consent, authenticity, and the boundaries of A.I. in creative fields. While Christie's family supports the project and insists on using only her own words, critics argue that the use of A.I. still constitutes a deepfake and raises concerns about misrepresentation.</p>
