          <p>German special police units conducted raids across several cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, arresting one man suspected of involvement in a planned Islamist terror attack. The 27-year-old Bosnian-Herzegovinian citizen is accused of financing the plot through fraudulent commercial activities. Officials stated the raids were intended to disrupt the attack's planning and execution. The article also touches on separate concerns from the German police union about the strain caused by recently tightened border controls ahead of the summer holidays.</p>

          <p>With all 23 British players eliminated from the singles draws at Wimbledon, this article analyzes the performances of five leading names, including Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu. The author notes the unique pressure British players face at their home Grand Slam, where public attention is highest. The analysis suggests that while some players faced tough draws, others showed significant promise and signs of development. The piece offers a forward-looking perspective on what each player can take from their Wimbledon experience into the rest of the tennis season.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's Labour government is proceeding with its plan to bring passenger train services back into public ownership, effectively reversing a privatization that occurred three decades ago. As franchises are returned to the state, a new entity called Great British Railways will integrate track and train operations. However, a significant debate has emerged over the future of "open access" operators, private companies that compete on state-owned lines and are credited with lowering fares and improving service. The government's perceived hostility towards these operators has raised concerns about reducing competition and increasing costs for taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners has unanimously approved a resolution to ceremonially rename a four-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard as "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." The section of road runs from Palm Beach International Airport to the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. President Trump expressed his gratitude for the "wonderful honor" in a social media post. The renaming is ceremonial, meaning official postal addresses will not change, and the new signs are expected to be installed later this year.</p>

          <p>Researchers have located the sunken bow of the USS New Orleans, a US Navy cruiser heavily damaged during a WWII battle in 1942. The discovery in the Solomon Islands sheds new light on a legendary tale of survival, where the crew performed remarkable makeshift repairs using coconut logs. After a Japanese torpedo severed the front of the ship, the crew sailed the damaged vessel 1,800 miles in reverse to Australia for more substantial repairs. The ship was later fully repaired and went on to earn 17 battle stars, making its story one of the most incredible in naval history.</p>

          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham discusses her new Netflix series, "Too Much," which is loosely inspired by her own experiences moving to London. The show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, aims to subvert romanticized American fantasies of England by presenting a more realistic and confounding version of city life. Dunham explains that the series explores the challenges of navigating a new culture, even one that shares the same language. The show also features an extensive list of celebrity cameos, including Andrew Scott, Stephen Fry, and Jennifer Saunders.</p>

          <p>China has announced the completion of a massive 1,856-kilometer (1,153-mile) green belt aimed at controlling three major deserts in the Inner Mongolia region. The project involved stabilizing shifting sands using techniques like straw checkerboards, followed by planting drought-resistant vegetation. This "green great wall" is a significant part of China's long-term efforts to combat desertification and improve the ecological environment in its northern regions. The initiative is designed to create a more robust ecological barrier against the encroaching sands of the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts.</p>

          <p>An Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years was released from ICE detention this week following an intervention by Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Mandonna Kashanian, 64, was detained last month despite having U.S. citizen family members and a long history of complying with immigration check-ins. After a surge of community support and advocacy from local politicians, Scalise asked the Department of Homeland Security to review the case. Her attorney noted the intervention was crucial, highlighting the impact of political access on such immigration cases.</p>

Song Kum Hyok, a member of the "Andariel" hacking group, is accused of helping North Korean operatives pose as American remote workers to get jobs at foreign companies. The scheme involves stealing the identities of U.S. citizens to create fake profiles for the workers.

          <p>With forecasters predicting an above-average hurricane season, a growing number of homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are investing in climate-resilient home designs. These homes feature aerodynamic shapes, reinforced structures, and flood vents designed to withstand high winds and storm surges. Companies specializing in these designs report high success rates in past hurricanes, and research institutions are testing building materials to improve resilience further. While these homes can be more expensive to build, owners find they can lead to long-term savings, including on insurance costs.</p>
