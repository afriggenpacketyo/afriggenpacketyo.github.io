          <p>The WNBA has officially announced the addition of three new expansion teams, which will be located in Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia. This move will grow the league from its current 13 teams to 18 over the next five years, including previously announced franchises in Toronto and Portland. The new teams will begin play sequentially, with Cleveland starting in 2028, Detroit in 2029, and Philadelphia in 2030. The expansion marks a return of professional women's basketball to Cleveland and Detroit, cities that previously hosted WNBA teams, reflecting the league's significant growth and increasing popularity.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Baidu has announced it is making its Ernie generative AI large language model open source, a significant move in the global AI race. This decision marks a shift for Baidu, which previously advocated for proprietary models, and is seen as a response to the success of open-source competitors like DeepSeek. Experts believe this will increase competition, putting pressure on closed-source providers like OpenAI and Anthropic to lower costs and improve performance. While some analysts note potential security and trust issues associated with a Chinese-developed model, the move is expected to accelerate AI development by making powerful tools more accessible globally.</p>

          <p>Home Depot has announced its acquisition of GMS, a major distributor of building products, in a deal valued at approximately $4.3 billion. The acquisition will be carried out by Home Depot's subsidiary, SRS Distribution, which will purchase all outstanding GMS shares for $110 each. This strategic move is part of Home Depot's broader effort to capture a larger share of the professional contractor market, which provides a steadier and more lucrative revenue stream than typical consumer sales. The deal, expected to close by early 2026, also concludes a potential bidding war for GMS with another distributor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components to reduce its strategic dependence on China, which currently dominates the global market. In the first quarter of 2025, Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones, reflecting a broader European effort to build defense autonomy and avoid cybersecurity risks associated with Chinese technology. Taiwan is actively developing a "non-red" supply chain free of Chinese influence, aiming to provide key components like motors and chips. However, challenges remain for Germany, including cost-focused procurement laws and Taiwan's current production capacity limitations.</p>

Meanwhile, India's assistant coach stated that their star bowler Jasprit Bumrah is available but might be omitted depending on conditions.

These measures aim to build on the existing Online Safety Act to address evolving online harms, such as intimate image abuse and exposure to physical violence on livestreams.

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind its digital services tax (DST) on large technology firms, a move designed to restart trade negotiations with the United States. The decision came just hours before the first tax payments were due and followed President Trump's threat to halt all trade talks over the issue, which he called a "blatant attack." The 3% tax would have affected major U.S. tech companies like Google and Meta and was expected to generate significant revenue for Canada. This reversal is seen as a constructive step to de-escalate a growing trade dispute between the two nations.</p>

The positive results clear a path for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone flu shot and its combination Covid-19 and flu vaccine later this year. The trial, involving over 40,000 adults, found Moderna's vaccine was over 26% more effective overall and demonstrated strong efficacy against major influenza strains. This development positions Moderna as a front-runner in the race to bring a combination respiratory vaccine to market.</p>

Fusion energy, which mimics the process that powers the sun, has the potential to provide a source of abundant, zero-carbon electricity.

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate fell unexpectedly to 2.0% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time this cycle. The figure, down from 2.1% in May, was lower than the 2.2% anticipated by analysts and provides positive news for the euro zone's largest economy. This development adds to evidence that inflation in the region is stabilizing, which could support one final interest rate cut by the ECB in September. However, economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile energy prices remain potential risks to the disinflationary trend. (not investment advice)</p>
