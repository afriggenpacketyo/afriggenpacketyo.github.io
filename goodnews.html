        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters" has achieved massive success on Netflix, becoming its most popular film ever, largely due to its chart-topping soundtrack. The story, which follows a K-pop girl group who secretly fight demons, was initially passed over by Sony's distribution arm before landing on the streaming platform. Analysts attribute its phenomenal success to its authentic celebration of K-pop culture without catering to an "outsider's gaze," immersing audiences directly into its vibrant world.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from sending any National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. The ruling came after California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a lawsuit against the administration over its plan to deploy his state's guard members there. The judge stated there was no evidence to justify the deployment, which followed a presidential declaration that Portland was a "war zone" despite reports of minimal recent protest activity.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a plan to reform the home-buying process in England and Wales, aiming to reduce costs, delays, and the high rate of failed sales. The proposals would legally require sellers and estate agents to provide key property information upfront and introduce the option of binding contracts to prevent last-minute withdrawals. While the government estimates this could save first-time buyers an average of £710, critics raise concerns about increased initial costs for sellers and potential market delays.

          <p>Welsh singer Charlotte Church, who rose to fame as a child, has described the intense media scrutiny she faced as a teenager as "insane" and a "travesty."

Church, who successfully sued a newspaper for phone hacking, stated that her defiance against the press intrusion helped her survive the shame-based coverage and protect her personal well-being.</p>

          <p>The concept of empathy is being re-examined, with some questioning its inherent value while others experience burnout from its demands. According to Stanford psychologist Jamil Zaki, empathy involves emotional, cognitive, and compassionate components that can be both beneficial and draining. While empathy can lead to better health, stronger relationships, and social connection, if unchecked it can cause vicarious trauma; the key is to channel empathetic feelings into positive action to avoid helplessness and burnout.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been jointly awarded to scientists Shimon Sakaguchi, Mary Brunkow, and Fred Ramsdell for their foundational discoveries related to immune system regulation. Their collective research identified a specific type of T-cell, now known as "regulatory T-cells," which act as security guards to prevent the immune system from mistakenly attacking the body's own tissues. This groundbreaking work has opened an entirely new field of immunology and is paving the way for innovative treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.</p>
