          <p>Alibaba's AI coding model, Qwen 3 Coder, has rapidly gained popularity, capturing over 20% of the usage share on the AI marketplace OpenRouter. This places it second only to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, which is widely considered the industry benchmark for AI-assisted coding. The model's strong performance is attributed to extensive training on coding-related data, enhanced data quality, and large-scale reinforcement learning. Alibaba's entry intensifies competition in the growing AI coding sector, where other Chinese tech giants like ByteDance and Tencent are also launching their own tools to capitalize on the trend.</p>

Since last year, ten provincial-level regions have introduced plans focusing on areas like digitalized marine governance, offshore energy, and tourism. For instance, Fujian province is developing a massive marine data platform to aid in decision-making for ecological protection and emergency response. The province also aims to significantly expand its offshore wind and solar power production, building on a decade of development in the sector.</p>

          <p>The Apalachee High School football team in Winder, Georgia, achieved its first win in nearly four years, offering a moment of hope to a community still healing from a tragic school shooting. The team had been on a long losing streak and was also coping with the trauma of an event 11 months prior that killed four people, including their defensive coordinator. New head coach Kevin Saunders, with the help of a mental performance coach, worked to change the team's culture and help players process their grief. The 29-9 victory was a deeply meaningful event, demonstrating how sports can help a community rally and begin to heal.</p>

Trump stated that this bilateral meeting would be followed by a trilateral summit including himself. While Trump presented this as a significant step, the Kremlin's official statement was more reserved, mentioning support for continued negotiations and the possibility of increasing the level of representation, without confirming a direct Putin-Zelenskyy meeting. This development comes after previous attempts to orchestrate such a high-level meeting failed, with Putin declining to attend past talks.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to fundamentally realign the league geographically, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues. Speaking during a broadcast, Manfred suggested that grouping teams into divisions based on location, such as an Eastern and Western Conference, could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason formats. While this could face resistance from traditionalists, the commissioner argued it would create better broadcast opportunities for West Coast audiences. Manfred hopes to have the expansion process approved by 2029, with Nashville and Salt Lake City considered front-runners for new franchises.</p>

          <p>Meal-kit company HelloFresh has agreed to a $7.5 million settlement in a consumer protection lawsuit brought by Santa Clara County and other California prosecutors. The lawsuit alleged that the company misled customers by enrolling them in automatically renewing subscriptions without clear disclosure and made the cancellation process difficult. As part of the settlement, HelloFresh will pay civil penalties, investigative costs, and $1 million in restitution to affected California consumers. While HelloFresh denied any wrongdoing, it agreed to resolve the matter amicably, which prosecutors hailed as a victory against deceptive business practices that trap consumers in unwanted subscriptions.</p>

          <h2>California Passes Bill Granting Homeowners Interest on Insurance Payouts Held by Lenders</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill ensuring that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest earned on insurance payouts for homes damaged or destroyed in natural disasters. Previously, when insurers issued checks, lenders would deposit the funds into an escrow account and could keep the interest accrued while rebuilding was underway. Authored by Assemblymember John Harabedian, the new legislation closes this loophole and guarantees homeowners at least 2% interest on these funds. The bill, which now goes to Governor Gavin Newsom to be signed, aims to provide additional financial support to homeowners during the difficult recovery process.</p>
