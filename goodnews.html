          <p>The Washington Commanders' proposal to build a new stadium at the former RFK Stadium site has cleared a significant hurdle with a 9-3 D.C. Council vote. The plan, which includes a $3.7 billion redevelopment project with housing and retail space, requires one more approval before heading to the mayor's desk. This progress comes as former President Donald Trump has publicly pressured the team to revert to its previous "Redskins" nickname. Team owner Josh Harris has affirmed that the "Commanders" name will remain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an order blocking the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process on migrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb could curtail a controversial practice where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrest migrants at courthouses to place them in expedited removal. The judge noted the plaintiffs had "played by the rules" and that the case raised a "question of fair play." The decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of migrants awaiting their court cases.</p>

          <p>Robert Wilson, a towering figure in avant-garde theater known for epic productions like "Einstein on the Beach," has passed away at the age of 83. His death was attributed to a brief but acute illness. Wilson's six-decade career was marked by collaborations with artists such as Philip Glass, David Byrne, and Lady Gaga, where he blended stunning visuals, slow-motion movement, and unconventional narratives. He also founded the Watermill Center, an interdisciplinary arts laboratory, leaving behind a profound legacy that challenged the boundaries of performance, art, and design.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, savers have an opportunity to lock in high returns with long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). This article suggests three strategic moves for August, including carefully determining the maximum amount you can deposit for the longest possible term without risking early withdrawal penalties. It also advises using the current rate pause to shop around for the best offers, particularly from online banks, which often provide higher rates. Finally, savers should re-evaluate where other funds are held to ensure they are maximizing their interest-earning potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple has welcomed a baby boy who developed from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, setting what is believed to be a new record. The embryo was created and frozen in 1994 and donated to Linda and Tim Pierce through a process known as embryo adoption. The birth highlights the growing practice of donating unused embryos from IVF treatments, which is often supported by Christian-centered groups. The successful birth from a nearly 31-year-old embryo also underscores advancements in fertility technology and raises questions about the long-term storage of an estimated 1.5 million frozen embryos in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma surged over 5% on its second day of trading, building on a colossal debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which priced its IPO at $33 per share, saw its stock close at $115.50 on the first day for a 250% gain. Figma's successful launch marks a bright spot in the tech IPO market, which has seen a recent revival with companies like CoreWeave and Hinge Health going public. The company's strong performance follows a collapsed $20 billion acquisition attempt by Adobe, which was blocked by regulators in 2023.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it has acted illegally to pressure doctors and hospitals to cease providing gender-affirming health care for minors. The lawsuit supports children's hospitals and medical professionals who have been targeted by the administration's policies. The legal challenge contends that these federal actions are an overreach and interfere with the provision of established medical care. This suit represents a significant state-level pushback against the administration's stance on transgender healthcare.</p>

          <p>Although interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) remain high, they have declined compared to the peak levels of last August. A comparison shows that a $10,000 deposit in a 3-year CD opened in 2024 would have earned over $500 more than one opened today. Similarly, a 6-month CD would have yielded $78 more in interest a year ago. Despite the drop, the article notes that CDs still offer significantly better returns than traditional savings accounts and provide a fixed rate, unlike high-yield savings accounts, making them an attractive option in a potentially declining rate environment.

          <p>Indian fast bowler Prasidh Krishna revealed that a heated on-field exchange with England's Joe Root during the fifth Test was a deliberate tactic to disrupt the star batter. While the exact words were not audible, Root's animated reaction was unusual. Krishna, who took four wickets, described the incident as competitive banter between two players who are friends off the field. The tense moment was part of a series marked by several confrontations, reflecting the high stakes as India seeks to level the series, which England currently leads 2-1.</p>

The move comes as ESPN adapts to the decline of traditional cable TV by launching a direct-to-consumer streaming service to better compete in the evolving media landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the Presidential Fitness Test, a standardized physical education assessment that was a staple in American schools for over 50 years until it was phased out in 2013. The order aims to address declining physical fitness and rising obesity rates among children, which it frames as a threat to national vitality. The revived program will also reinstate the Presidential Fitness Award for top-performing students. Educators express cautious optimism, hoping the new test will focus on overall health rather than just athletic performance.</p>

          <p>Joby Aviation is partnering with defense contractor L3Harris to develop a new military aircraft that can be either piloted or operated autonomously. The collaboration will combine Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems and certification. The craft will be based on Joby's S4 design but will use a gas turbine, a departure from Joby's all-electric commercial air taxis. This partnership aims to create a smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable aircraft for military applications like surveillance and logistics in modern conflict zones.</p>
