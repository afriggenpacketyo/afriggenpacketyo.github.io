          <p>The UK government is set to announce a major defense review, including plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines, replacing the current fleet from the late 2030s. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to confirm a ¬£15 billion investment in the nuclear warhead program. The new submarines are intended to keep Britain and NATO safe for decades, alongside the UK's nuclear-armed submarines. The Strategic Defence Review, led by Lord Robertson, will make 62 recommendations aimed at enhancing the UK's armed forces. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Angela Zhang, a law professor at the University of Southern California, new US-China tariff war can affect the Chinese tech sector in two main ways. Tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, and as Chinese companies face more trade barriers from the US, they‚Äôll need to work even harder on cutting costs and scaling up. As an example, many Chinese tech firms started open-sourcing their AI models in response to the chip embargo, which is a more cost-effective and collaborative way to keep developing advanced technologies when resources are tight. Chinese companies are expected to aggressively pursue opportunities in other markets, such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and deepen trade with Europe, potentially offering technology transfers for market access.
