          <p>Australia's Kangaroos secured a commanding 26-6 victory against England in the opening Rugby League Ashes match, resuming their long-standing dominance in the series after a 22-year hiatus. The Kangaroos established an early lead with a contentious try and further extended it post-interval through scores from Reece Walsh and a double from Angus Crichton, ultimately cruising to a comfortable win. Despite England's late consolation, Australia maintained control throughout the game. A notable downside for the visitors was their captain Issah Yeo being forced off due to a head injury, highlighting the match's intense physicality. This article provides a detailed account of the game's key plays and the Kangaroos' commanding performance in the significant return of the Ashes.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent Catherine Connolly is poised to become Ireland's next president after her rival, Heather Humphreys of the center-right Fine Gael party, conceded defeat ahead of the official result. Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and independent lawmaker, secured strong voter support and the backing of several left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin, partly due to her outspoken criticism of Israel over the war in Gaza. While the Irish presidency is a largely ceremonial role, representing the country and fulfilling constitutional duties, this article highlights her significant victory and its potential implications for future political alignments in Ireland.</p>

          <p>The popular passive investing strategy, often referred to as 'VOO and chill' (buying index-tracking ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF), is reportedly losing its appeal among investors, even with stocks at all-time highs. Financial experts observe that clients are actively seeking greater diversification, as the S&P 500's heavy concentration in technology stocks, now over 35%, reduces its benchmark effectiveness. This shift is driving renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 recently hitting an all-time high and significantly outperforming the S&P 500. This article discusses this evolving investment sentiment and market trends. (not investment advice)</p>
