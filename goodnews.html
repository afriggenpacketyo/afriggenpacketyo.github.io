He also strongly rejected what he termed a "Cold War mentality" in international relations, positioning China as a global peacemaker amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions. The summit, attended by over 20 foreign leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, serves as a platform for China to bolster its influence and foster regional stability. Xi highlighted China's significant investments and support for educational programs within SCO countries, emphasizing a new phase of high-quality development and cooperation.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott shared his perspective on teammate Micah Parsons' blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers, stating he "wasn't surprised" by the move. Parsons secured a record-setting four-year, $188 million deal with the Packers after his trade request was granted by Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Prescott acknowledged the personal nature of the negotiations and expressed relief that the tension between Parsons and Jones had found a resolution, calling it a "solution" to a potential "headache and distraction." The Cowboys acquired two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark in the exchange, setting the stage for Parsons to face his former team in Week 4.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading activity as investors evaluated China's August RatingDog manufacturing data, which unexpectedly showed an expansion at 50.5 after a previous contraction. Concurrently, market participants assessed developments from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, where leaders from India and China affirmed their roles as development partners rather than rivals, adding a layer of geopolitical consideration. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index notably rose, driven by significant gains in Alibaba Group, while Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced a decline. The overall market sentiment was also influenced by a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that most of former President Donald Trump's "reciprocal tariffs are illegal." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) reaching 50.5. This figure significantly surpassed Reuters' economist estimates of 49.7, marking the fastest expansion rate since March. The rebound was primarily driven by a recovery in new export orders, suggesting resilience in external demand despite existing tariffs, according to a Capital Economics economist. However, while the private survey indicated growth, China's official manufacturing PMI still showed contraction for the fifth consecutive month at 49.4, highlighting a nuanced and somewhat contradictory economic picture. This mixed data presents challenges for economic interpretation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that Australia's impending social media ban for individuals under 16, set to begin in December, could be "effective" using various technologies, despite inherent risks and shortcomings. The policy aims to mitigate harmful social media impacts, requiring platforms to prevent underage accounts and deactivate existing ones, with fines up to A$50 million for non-compliance. While popular with many parents, experts raise privacy concerns regarding age verification methods, which range from formal government documents to facial assessment technology. The report recommends a layered approach to create the most robust system, acknowledging accuracy issues in age detection around the 16-year-old threshold and the challenge of circumvention via VPNs.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping initiated the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit by advocating for an SCO bank, signaling a move towards greater financial autonomy within the bloc. This aligns with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's call for a non-US dollar payment system among member nations, reflecting a broader effort to counter Western economic influence. The SCO, originally a Eurasian security bloc founded in 2001, has expanded its scope to include trade and economic issues, now comprising 10 member states including Russia, India, Iran, and Pakistan. The summit is expected to yield agreements on strengthening security, economic, and cultural cooperation, underscoring its growing role as an Asian counterweight to the West.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic made history at the US Open by becoming the oldest man to reach the quarter-finals at all four Grand Slams in a single season, despite an early neck injury scare. The 38-year-old tennis star was ahead 4-0 in his match against qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff when he began experiencing neck pain, but quickly regained his dominance, dropping only two games before securing the set. Djokovic ultimately clinched a 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory, extending his all-time record to 64 Grand Slam quarter-finals. This win keeps alive his pursuit of a 25th major title, setting up a clash with the No. 4 seed, Taylor Fritz, in the next round.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holdings surged by almost 19% following better-than-expected net income results for its June quarter. The significant profit increase was primarily fueled by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit, bolstered by robust artificial intelligence demand, and a continued revival in its e-commerce business. Despite missing revenue estimates, Alibaba's net income jumped 78%, partly due to equity investment gains and the disposal of a Turkish e-commerce firm. The company is strategically investing in AI and new "quick commerce" models, with its cloud unit showing triple-digit year-over-year growth in AI-related product revenue, signaling strong performance in key emerging sectors.

Part of NASA's Artemis program, the rover aims to find water and measure radiation levels on the Moon's south polar region, a crucial step for establishing a sustainable human presence. Scheduled for launch in 2029, the mission faces extreme challenges, including surviving lunar night temperatures ranging from -200C to 100C and navigating sticky regolith. The project builds on Canada's significant space history, including the Canadarm, and could enable the Moon to become a "petrol station" for future spacecraft, opening up vast possibilities for exploration.</p>

          <p>England has launched the final phase of its largest-ever expansion of publicly funded childcare, providing 30 hours per week of term-time care for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" for working families, aiming to ease financial burdens and "put money back in working parents' pockets." However, parents face long waiting lists, and nurseries report staff shortages limiting availability, despite government recruitment incentives. Confusion persists over what is truly "free," as providers often add charges for meals or nappies to offset funding rates below actual costs, leading to potential regional inequalities and parental work-life challenges, with some parents even altering C-section dates to meet eligibility.</p>

Exports of green tea, particularly powdered matcha, have quadrupled in a decade, with 44% bound for the U.S. This "matcha mania" has led to supply shortages, doubled prices, and shops rationing stock, even in Japan, with online stores selling out months ago. The Japanese government is considering farmer subsidies to boost tencha cultivation, the tea used for matcha, to address labor-intensive production bottlenecks.

Their work, presented at an American Mathematical Society conference, garnered global attention and commendation, challenging perceptions about young, African American women in STEM fields.
