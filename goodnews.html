          <p>In Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, municipal elections show the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) are projected to win. However, the results are also marked by significant gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is expected to place third. The election is widely viewed as the first major electoral test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's national coalition government. The AfD's strong performance, particularly in former industrial areas, could increase pressure on the federal government regarding issues like immigration and internal security.</p>

          <p>An undercover investigation into the illegal sale of nitrous oxide for recreational use has led to the arrest of four smoke shop clerks in Jacksonville. According to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, undercover agents purchased canisters of the gas, commonly known as "whippits," from employees at four different stores. The arrest reports state that the clerks confirmed the substance could be used to get high and, in some cases, explained its effects to the undercover agents before completing the sales. The arrests occurred as part of a targeted operation to crack down on the misuse of the substance.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared that the British flag represents the nation's diversity and will not be surrendered to those who use it as a symbol of division and fear. His comments followed a "Unite the Kingdom" march in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, which drew over 150,000 people and resulted in clashes and injuries to 26 police officers. Starmer affirmed the right to peaceful protest but condemned the violence and intimidation, stating that people should not feel unsafe because of their background. The event also featured a video message from Elon Musk urging protesters to "fight back."</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago offers a fresh perspective on the work of Gustave Caillebotte, often considered one of the lesser-known French Impressionist painters. While his peers focused on landscapes and ballerinas, Caillebotte's canvases often centered on men in modern urban life, a perspective unusual for his time. The exhibition, titled "Painting His World," showcases famous works like "Paris Street; Rainy Day" alongside more controversial pieces, such as "The Floor Scrapers," which was once rejected by the art establishment. The show aims to re-integrate Caillebotte into the broader narrative of Impressionism and invites new interpretations of his art.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents devastated by the recent Eaton fire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support local restaurants struggling with a drop in sales. The club, founded by a resident who lost her own apartment, brings together community members, many of whom were displaced by the fire, for weekly meals at different local eateries. The initiative provides a vital economic boost to family-owned businesses and has also created a support network for residents united by tragedy. For many, sharing a meal has become a way to foster connections, share experiences, and rebuild their sense of community.</p>

          <p>Amazon has introduced a new feature called "Hear the Highlights," which uses artificial intelligence to generate short audio summaries of product information and customer reviews. The AI model synthesizes content from the product catalog, user comments, and other web sources to create the audio clips, which are now available on over a million products in the U.S. mobile app. While the feature aims to make shopping easier and more accessible, it also raises questions about whether AI can capture the nuance and specific details found in human reviews. Critics worry it could flatten context and unintentionally blend marketing language with genuine user feedback.</p>

          <p>In preparation for the hostile environment expected at the upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage, New York, the European team is using a novel training method: virtual reality headsets that shout abuse. According to Rory McIlroy, Captain Luke Donald provided the equipment to help players desensitize themselves to the sights, sounds, and potential name-calling from the American crowd. McIlroy revealed that players could customize the verbal abuse to be as harsh as they wanted, calling it an effort to be as prepared as possible. Europe has not secured a Ryder Cup victory on American soil since 2012.</p>

Led by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier, the Lynx possess the league's top defense and strong veteran leadership. Other top contenders include the Las Vegas Aces, who ended the regular season on a 16-game winning streak, and the defending champion New York Liberty, though their chances may hinge on returning key players from injury.</p>

          <p>Ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom, the Commons Business and Trade Committee is urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government to maximize pressure on the U.S. to finalize a deal on steel tariffs. While a trade agreement signed in June reduced tariffs on some UK goods, it left a 25% tariff on British steel in place. The committee's report emphasizes that the high-profile visit is a critical opportunity to secure a lasting agreement that would end the threat of future tariffs. The visit marks Trump's second state visit to the UK, an unprecedented gesture for a U.S. president.</p>
