          <p>Broadcom reported strong second-quarter earnings, surpassing Wall Street's expectations and providing optimistic guidance for the upcoming period. The chipmaker's revenue rose by 20% annually, driven by robust sales in its semiconductor solutions business, particularly in AI-related products. Broadcom anticipates approximately $15.8 billion in third-quarter revenue, fueled by its partnerships with hyperscale companies investing in AI chips. The company's software business, including VMware, also experienced significant growth, contributing to the overall positive financial results. Those sales are reported in the company's semiconductor solutions business, which had $8.4 billion in revenue during the quarter, a 17% increase from last year, and above $8.34 billion analyst estimate, according to StreetAccount.

          <p>Aaron Rodgers is reportedly ending his time away from football by signing a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 41-year-old Rodgers parted ways with the New York Jets earlier this year, and has been linked for some time with the Steelers, who are without an established starter at quarterback. Though he threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, the Jets finished just 5-12, and Rodgers ranked outside the top 25 in most efficiency metrics. If Rodgers does end up as the Steelers‚Äô starter he will face a familiar foe in Week 1: Pittsburgh are scheduled to play the Jets in their season opener.</p>
