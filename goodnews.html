          <p>HSBC reported a second-quarter profit before tax of $6.3 billion, falling short of analyst expectations due to impairment charges and lost income from divested businesses. Despite the miss, the bank announced a new $3 billion share buyback program. CEO Georges Elhedery highlighted global economic challenges, including tariffs and fiscal vulnerabilities, which are creating market uncertainty. The bank warned that lending demand would likely remain subdued but anticipates growth in its wealth division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's government is set to approve a 2026 draft budget that includes €520.5 billion in spending and new borrowing of approximately €174 billion, signaling a shift towards major investment. The plan earmarks €126.7 billion for modernizing infrastructure and strengthening the military, aiming to stimulate economic recovery after years of stagnation. However, Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has warned that this spending will likely require significant austerity measures beginning in 2027. This news comes as Mercedes-Benz reported a sharp profit decline and a German TV channel launched a show produced entirely by AI.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 02:32:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS reported a second-quarter net profit of $2.395 billion, significantly beating analyst forecasts and doubling its profit from the same period last year. The strong results were driven by a 25% revenue hike in its investment bank's global markets unit, which benefited from high market volatility. The bank's global wealth management division also saw a 12% increase in transaction-based income. CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that while markets are recovering, client activity reflects a cautious wait-and-see attitude amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties.

          <p>China's ruling Communist Party will hold its key annual conclave, the fourth plenary session, in October to deliberate the country's 15th five-year plan. The meeting will bring together over 370 top party officials in Beijing to set economic, political, and social goals for the nation. This gathering will take place amid ongoing tensions with the United States and ahead of the APEC summit in Seoul. The new five-year plan is seen as a critical blueprint for China's development, and its formulation has been underway for months, including a public consultation period.</p>

          <p>Residents along the California coast responded to a tsunami advisory with a blend of caution, curiosity, and nonchalance following a major earthquake in Russia. While the advisory prompted some to reconsider their beach plans, many continued their activities, surprised by the lack of widespread panic. In Crescent City, a town historically vulnerable to tsunamis, locals in a pub remained largely unfazed, accustomed to such alerts. Officials in Los Angeles and other areas warned people to stay away from the water due to potentially strong currents, even though the predicted wave heights for Southern California were modest.</p>

Off the field, he is recognized for his philanthropy, particularly his work supporting education for disadvantaged children in Nigeria. As the Lions prepare for their final match, Itoje aims to secure a 3-0 series whitewash, a historic achievement not seen since 1974.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the FTSE-100 stock index reaching record highs and outperforming many global peers this year, its success is not a direct reflection of the UK's economic health. The index's strength is largely driven by its high concentration of internationally focused companies in defensive and cyclical sectors like finance, energy, and mining, which derive most of their earnings overseas. A weaker pound often boosts the Footsie's value, a dynamic that underscores its detachment from the domestic British economy. This contrasts with its origins in 1984 when it was dominated by UK-focused businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese paleontologists have discovered that an ancient, clam-like marine invertebrate may have practiced a form of social distancing to enhance its survival. A 436-million-year-old fossil of the brachiopod species Nucleospira calypta, found in Guizhou province, revealed hundreds of fine, bristle-like structures. Researchers believe these structures, known as setae, were used to maintain a regular, checkerboard-like spacing between individuals on the sea floor. This arrangement likely optimized their ability to filter feed by ensuring each animal had adequate space, demonstrating a sophisticated behavioral adaptation for resource management.</p>

The most significant price increases were in housing and food, but these were partially offset by a decrease in transport costs.
