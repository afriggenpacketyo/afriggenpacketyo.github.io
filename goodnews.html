          <p>The UK government has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas such as resilience and security. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of economic security as a component of national security. The government anticipates reaching 4.1% of GDP spending on national security by 2027, with the "resilience" element achieved by the following year, and the full 3.5% for core defense by 2035, but the exact funding sources for this goal remain unspecified.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. According to early reports, all Iranian missiles were intercepted, and there were no American casualties or damage. President Trump stated that Iran's response was "very weak" and that he hoped Iran would now pursue peace and harmony in the region. This limited response, coupled with Trump's inclination to hold fire, suggests a potential de-escalation of tensions, reminiscent of the aftermath of the Soleimani killing in 2020.</p>
