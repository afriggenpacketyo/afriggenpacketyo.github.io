        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is a program offered by the IRS allowing eligible taxpayers to settle their tax debt for a reduced amount. This option is available to those who cannot realistically pay their full tax bill without facing financial hardship. The IRS evaluates applicants based on their ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity, requiring thorough documentation and a detailed financial statement. While the IRS has strict criteria and a rigorous evaluation process, an OIC can provide a fresh start for those burdened by overwhelming tax debt (not investment advice).</p>

Interim CEO Ron Sargent noted that shoppers are buying more promotional items, private-label products, and larger pack sizes, while cutting back on discretionary purchases. Kroger is also focusing on simplifying promotions and lowering prices on over 2,000 products to cater to value-conscious customers.

          <p>The Black Conservative Federation is hosting a summit in Washington, D.C., to bring together Black conservatives and develop future leaders. The summit will focus on key issues such as artificial intelligence, criminal justice reform, and Black economic empowerment. This initiative follows modest gains made by President Donald Trump with Black voters in the 2024 election. The goal is to foster long-term talent and leadership development within the conservative movement.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament's vote to approve the Terminally Ill (End of Life) Bill marks a significant step towards legalizing assisted dying in England and Wales. The bill will now go to the House of Lords for scrutiny, with potential implementation taking up to four years. Key aspects of the bill include eligibility criteria, assessment processes, and safeguards for vulnerable individuals. The government will need to establish a new NHS service and provide training for medical professionals.</p>
