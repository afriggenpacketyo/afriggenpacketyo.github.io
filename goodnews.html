          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency has reported observing over 180 earthquakes near the Tokara island chain in southwestern Japan over the weekend, urging residents to remain vigilant for strong tremors. Akuseki Island, part of the island chain in Kagoshima Prefecture, experienced a quake measuring 4 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale on multiple occasions. Seismic activity with epicenters near the island chain has been frequently observed since Saturday, prompting the agency to issue alerts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City will be using ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. This process continues until a candidate receives a majority. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support and prevents candidates with fringe views from winning in a crowded field, but it also makes races less predictable and requires more research from voters.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, showcasing its unprecedented ability to observe the universe. The telescope, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, will conduct a 10-year survey of the southern night sky, mapping the Milky Way and potentially discovering killer asteroids and a ninth planet in our solar system. The observatory's unique design and location in the Chilean Andes allow it to capture extremely detailed images, which will be used to study dark matter and understand the history of the universe. The UK is a key partner in the survey and will host data centers to process the detailed snapshots.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has released its first images, signaling the start of its mission to create a vivid time-lapse video of the night sky over ten years. The observatory, equipped with a large telescope and the world's biggest digital camera, will compile observations on about 40 billion stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects. Its ability to rapidly capture and compare images will allow astronomers to detect changes in the sky, such as exploding stars, asteroids, and potentially even a giant planet beyond Pluto. Scientists are calling it a "discovery machine" that will revolutionize how we explore the universe.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has rebounded above $100,500 as markets shrug off the initial volatility following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While prices briefly dipped below six figures, equity futures are flat and gold is only marginally up, suggesting that traders are not pricing in a broader escalation. Crude oil is holding its gains near $76 per barrel due to fears that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz. The market appears to be treating the U.S.-Iran clash as a geopolitical flashpoint rather than a structural break. (not investment advice)</p>
