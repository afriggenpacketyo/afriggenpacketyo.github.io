          <p>Max Verstappen topped Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix, setting the pace ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Despite his speed, Verstappen expressed dissatisfaction with his race-simulation runs, citing a significant lack of grip and concern for the upcoming race. McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, who are under pressure from Verstappen in the championship, struggled with car balance, with Norris admitting they are "a little bit behind." The practice session indicates a challenging weekend ahead for several teams as they fine-tune their setups for qualifying and the main race.</p>

          <p>Microsoft founder Bill Gates made an unexpected cameo in the popular Indian Hindi TV drama "Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," discussing maternal and child health with actress Smriti Irani. The Gates Foundation collaborates with Indian governments on health initiatives, and experts believe this platform is crucial for messaging in a patriarchal society. Gates greeted Irani in Hindi, participating in a segment where her character, Tulsi, offered health advice to an expectant mother. The appearance has garnered millions of views and sparked widespread surprise and amusement, bringing renewed limelight to the show.</p>

          <p>As clocks go back and winter nights lengthen, particularly in northern Scotland where daylight can be under six hours, over a million people in the UK experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD, a recurring seasonal depression, is linked to reduced daylight and causes symptoms like low mood and anxiety. Researchers are promoting creative and cultural resources, including "Wintering Well" boxes with therapeutic lamps and activity guides, to encourage outdoor life and new "light routines." The initiative aims to shift attitudes towards winter, drawing lessons from Scandinavian nations on creating cozy interior light environments.</p>

          <h2>UK MPs Advise Against Cutting Cash ISA Allowance to Boost Investment Culture</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:09:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget, arguing it's unlikely to foster an investment culture in the UK. While Reeves aims to encourage investment, the proposed reduction from £20,000 to £10,000 for cash ISAs faces opposition from banks and consumer groups. With a £22bn budget shortfall, Reeves is seeking ways to raise taxes or cut spending. The article highlights that cash ISAs are the most widely used, holding £360bn, and cutting the limit could negatively impact savers without achieving the desired investment shift.

          <h2>UK Drivers Face Dilemma: Manual vs. Automatic Driving Lessons Amidst Shifting Car Trends</h2>

          <p>A quiet shift is occurring in UK driving, with one in three cars now automatic and a quarter of driving tests taken in automatics, driven by the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. This presents a dilemma for new drivers: learn manual for broader license freedom or automatic for a potentially quicker test. Many aspiring automatic learners face challenges like a lack of instructors and higher lesson costs. Despite a common misconception, manual tests have a higher pass rate. The article explores individual experiences and the evolving landscape of driving education, noting a lingering stigma around automatic-only licenses.</p>

          <p>Counting is set to begin in the Irish presidential election, which will determine the 10th Irish president to succeed Michael D Higgins. Voters chose between two main contenders, independent Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys, though a third candidate, Jim Gavin, withdrew too late to be removed from the ballot. Early indications suggest a potentially low turnout, possibly struggling to reach the 2018 record low of under 40%. The results are anticipated to be announced at Dublin Castle later this evening, following a months-long campaign.</p>

          <p>Magnesium has become a popular supplement, with its global market projected to nearly double, driven by social media influencers touting its benefits for sleep, digestion, and mental health. While magnesium is vital for over 300 bodily processes, including brain and mood regulation, dietitians caution that supplements are only beneficial if one is deficient, which is difficult to test. The article highlights individual anecdotes of improved sleep but notes conflicting scientific evidence. Experts recommend focusing on diet first and exercising caution with supplements due to potential side effects and interactions, especially for those with kidney disease.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's women's football team suffered a 2-0 defeat to Iceland in the home leg of their Nations League promotion/relegation play-off, marking a challenging start for new manager Tanya Oxtoby.

Oxtoby expressed pride in her team's execution of the game plan but acknowledged the preventable nature of the first goal. She remains optimistic, stating the team is "still in the tie" and has areas for improvement ahead of the return leg.</p>
