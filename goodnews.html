          <p>The public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk is causing concern among some Republicans, who worry it could stoke divisions within the party ahead of the midterm elections. Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies and his suggestion of forming a new political party have created uncertainty. Some Republicans fear that Musk's influence and financial support, which were significant in the last election, may now be directed elsewhere. While some downplay the impact of the feud, others acknowledge that it could complicate efforts to pass key legislation and undermine Trump's agenda.</p>
