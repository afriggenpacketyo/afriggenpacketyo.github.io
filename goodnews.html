        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of retirees are claiming Social Security benefits earlier than planned, driven by anxieties about the economy and potential changes to the Social Security Administration under the Trump administration. According to the Urban Institute, claims have risen by 13% this fiscal year, with agency officials acknowledging that fear-mongering has influenced this decision. While claiming early may provide immediate relief, it results in a substantially lower lifetime payment compared to waiting until full retirement age or later. Financial planners advise viewing Social Security as longevity insurance, as delaying benefits can provide a better return than private annuities, especially for those who anticipate a longer lifespan.</p>

          <p>A $50,000 annuity can provide a supplementary income stream during retirement, offering predictable monthly payouts.

While this amount may not cover all expenses, it can supplement Social Security or other retirement funds, offering peace of mind and protection against longevity risk. However, annuities lack flexibility, as funds are mostly locked in, making it crucial to consider individual financial circumstances before investing. (not investment advice)</p>
