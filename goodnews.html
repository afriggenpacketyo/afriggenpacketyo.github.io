          <h2>Understanding Debt Settlement: A Comprehensive Overview</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 15:32:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a detailed explanation of debt settlement, a strategy that allows individuals to negotiate with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed, typically for unsecured debts like credit cards and medical bills. Unlike debt consolidation, debt settlement focuses on reducing balances outright, often involving a debt relief company. The process usually takes 24 to 48 months, during which the borrower stops making payments to creditors and saves money in a dedicated account. While it can offer relief and potentially avoid bankruptcy, debt settlement also comes with risks such as credit damage, fees, and potential tax consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu lost to Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals of the Queen's Club tennis tournament, despite a promising start.

While Raducanu showed moments of brilliance, Zheng's consistency and intensity ultimately secured her victory. Despite the loss, Raducanu can remain confident in her performance on the grass, but must address the gap between herself and the top players.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley stated that a shortage of rare earth minerals forced the automaker to temporarily shut down a factory last month. Rare earth minerals are critical for automobile production, enabling functions like windshield wipers and speakers. China, which controls approximately 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth mineral supply, has implemented export controls, creating challenges for U.S. automakers. While the U.S. and China have reached an agreement to resume regular exports, Ford is still awaiting approval of its applications with China's Ministry of Commerce.</p>

          <p>This article compares the costs of borrowing $100,000 using a home equity loan versus a HELOC (home equity line of credit) in the current economic climate. While rates are nearly identical, the inherent differences of these borrowing products and repayment systems all but ensure that they won't remain that way long term. Borrowers need to consider the pros and cons of each, match them against their own financial needs and calculate the short- and long-term costs to determine affordability. Borrowing money, no matter the funding source, should always be done strategically, particularly when the funding source is your own home. (not investment advice)</p>
