        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced a slowdown in growth between April and June, expanding by 0.3%, a decrease from the previous quarter's 0.7%, but still surpassed forecasts of 0.1% expansion. This unexpected resilience, largely driven by the services sector and construction, might influence the Bank of England's reluctance to cut interest rates, as inflation is projected to peak at 4% later this year. However, experts express doubt about the country's ability to maintain this pace due to a weak global economy, the full impact of recent tax rises, and ongoing speculation about further fiscal changes.

          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has reaffirmed the insurer's unwavering commitment to its climate goals despite growing pushback against net-zero ambitions in the US and UK financial sectors. Her steadfastness comes as several major banks have withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, signaling a notable schism in the industry. Blanc emphasized that climate transition plans are crucial for Aviva's core insurance business, directly addressing the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that significantly impact property insurability and necessitate proactive measures. The company also reported a substantial 22% jump in operating profit, indicating strong financial performance alongside its environmental stance. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been observed with unusual horn-like growths, leading to nicknames like "Frankenstein bunnies," but scientists reassure the public there's no cause for alarm. This phenomenon is caused by the Shope papillomavirus, a mostly harmless and relatively common affliction that induces wart-like protrusions. The virus is not transmissible to humans or pets and typically does not harm the rabbits unless it grows on their eyes or mouths, impeding their ability to eat. This condition has historical significance, possibly inspiring the jackalope myth, and has contributed to scientific understanding of viruses and cancer.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that for the Democratic Party to secure future electoral victories, particularly in 2028, it must prioritize supporting working-class, progressive primary challenges against corporate-backed incumbents in the upcoming 2026 cycle. The author contends that voters are disillusioned with the current party leadership, perceiving them as unwilling to fight for universal healthcare, affordable housing, and other key issues due to corporate influence and fear of lobbies. The piece advocates for a new generation of "unbossed and unbought" leaders who demonstrate moral courage and solidarity to inspire and unite a fractured electorate and achieve meaningful change.</p>

          <p>Following the devastating Eaton fire that destroyed her family home and studio, Tami Outterbridge, daughter of acclaimed artist-activist John Outterbridge, is leading a unique project to salvage and reimagine art from the Altadena ruins. Collaborating with her father's friends and fellow artists, the "Diggin' Bridge" initiative involves excavating the site for remnants, which will then be incorporated into new artworks and a community-sourced archive. This effort transforms a personal tragedy into a collective act of remembrance and artistic creation, embodying Outterbridge's own practice of finding value and possibility in "throwaway" materials and disaster.</p>

          <p>A new documentary series, "Rebel Architects: From Venice to the World Stage," revisits the influential 1980s Venice Beach art and architecture scene through the eyes of its surviving "rebel architects," including Frank Gehry and Thom Mayne. The series uses a seminal 1980 photograph as a starting point for the architects to reflect on their early careers, characterized by a brash, creative freedom and collaboration with unheralded artists in a scrappy, forgotten environment. They discuss the challenges and joys of maintaining originality, the crucial role of journalists, and the bittersweet loss of that era's creative freedom and affordable Venice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 160 workers at Blizzard Entertainment's Irvine campus, primarily involved in cinematic and narrative content, have voted to unionize, joining Communications Workers of America Local 9510. This move reflects a broader and expanding trend in the video game industry, driven by concerns over frequent layoffs, intense "crunch-time" hours before product releases, and workplace harassment. Microsoft, Blizzard's parent company, adopted a neutral stance towards unionization, which significantly facilitated this process. This marks another significant step in the growing labor movement within the gaming sector, following earlier unionizations at other studios and highlighting increasing worker advocacy.</p>

          <p>The FBI has successfully returned a 500-year-old manuscript page signed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés to Mexico, part of a collection stolen from Mexico's national archives between 1985 and 1993. The document, penned in 1527, details payments for expeditions to "spice lands" and offers valuable insights into the planning of New Spain's colonization. While no prosecutions will occur as the page had "changed hands several times," the repatriation underscores the U.S.'s commitment to countering artifact trafficking and preserving valuable cultural heritage. The FBI remains determined to locate and repatriate the other missing pages from this significant historical collection.</p>

          <p>Sezzle, a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) fintech company, has seen its stock surge over 2,200% since its 2023 Nasdaq listing, despite a recent 30% pullback after its Q2 earnings report. The company reported robust revenue growth of 76% and a stellar 28% net margin, with management still expecting 60-65% year-over-year revenue growth. Sezzle operates in a rapidly expanding BNPL market, currently holding only 1.4% market share, indicating substantial growth potential. Its excellent profitability allows for capital return to shareholders, but its volatility means investors should proceed with caution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Western instructors are successfully training Ukrainian troops for the brutal conflict against Russia, despite many trainers lacking direct experience in large-scale, industrialized warfare. Under the UK-led Operation Interflex, over 56,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained since June 2022. The program effectively combines NATO doctrine with the Ukrainians' fresh front-line experience, incorporating insights on trench warfare and drone threats. This mutual learning benefits both sides, providing Ukraine with essential skills and feeding valuable lessons back into Western military planning for potential future conflicts with Russia, proving a win-win scenario for both sides' military readiness.</p>
