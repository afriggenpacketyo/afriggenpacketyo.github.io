          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in artificial intelligence, following a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI and plans to hire key figures from other AI companies. This push aims to bolster Meta's AI capabilities across its platforms, from advertising to the metaverse, as the company faces increasing competition from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. While Meta's open-source approach with Llama models hasn't fully satisfied developers, Zuckerberg is determined to build a leading AI team. Meta is also reportedly offering substantial signing bonuses to attract talent from OpenAI, underscoring the intense competition in the AI sector.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers initially faced criticism for their silence regarding immigration raids in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about the Dodger Stadium parking lot being used as a staging area. After pressure from fans and community leaders, the team announced they would assist immigrant communities impacted by the raids, committing $1 million in financial assistance. While some praise this move, others view it as insufficient, given the team's history and connection with the Latino community. The Dodgers' actions are being compared to their past stances on social justice issues, highlighting the need for continued support and advocacy.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England plans to offer DNA testing to all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative aims to revolutionize prevention by using genomics and AI to provide faster diagnoses and early warnings for diseases. The screening will involve sequencing complete DNA from umbilical cord blood samples to identify single-gene disorders. While the initiative has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes, concerns have been raised about the need for qualified professionals to interpret the data and provide appropriate counseling to affected individuals.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactive in building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth minerals. Following China's 2010 export ban targeting Tokyo, Japan invested in non-China rare-earth projects and promoted alternative technologies. As a result, Japan's dependence on Chinese rare earths has decreased significantly. This approach serves as a potential template for Western nations seeking to reduce reliance on China's critical mineral dominance.</p>

          <p>The article examines the nature of feminist critique of celebrities, arguing that it has become overly critical and puritanical. It questions the recent chastisement of celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae for their choices regarding their image and sexuality. The author suggests that the current discourse is often dictated by sexist algorithms and lacks the nuanced arguments of past feminist debates. The piece advocates for a more thoughtful and historically informed approach to critiquing women in the public eye.</p>
