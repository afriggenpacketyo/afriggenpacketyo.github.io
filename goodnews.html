          <p>The European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane, has declared that the recent cycle of monetary policy interventions is "done," having successfully brought inflation down from its peak. While the primary goal of taming the 2021-2022 price shocks is considered complete, Lane cautioned that the ECB must remain prepared for new economic shocks and potential future rate adjustments. Other officials echoed this sentiment, suggesting that any further moves would likely be rate cuts to support a slow-growing Eurozone economy, with risks now tilted to the downside.

          <p>Major financial institutions are expressing support for President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," arguing it could provide a necessary boost to the U.S. economy. Banks like Nomura and Citi suggest the legislation would avert a significant fiscal contraction by renewing expiring tax provisions from 2017 and could stimulate business investment. However, this optimism is tempered by widespread criticism over the bill's projected impact on the national debt, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating it will add over $3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.

          <p>In an effort to resolve a trade dispute, Beijing has reportedly offered a significant tax refund to major French cognac producers, including Hennessy, Martell, and R√©my Martin. This move comes as China's anti-dumping investigation into European brandy approaches a July 5 deadline, after which steep tariffs could become permanent. To qualify for the refund, the French companies must agree to a minimum selling price and commit to fair trade practices, with a leading industry group confirming that a preliminary agreement has been negotiated pending final approval.</p>

          <p>The British government has launched a "landmark" review of its parental leave and pay policies, aiming to modernize a system that campaigners and MPs have criticized as outdated and flawed. The review will examine statutory maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, which have not been significantly reformed in decades. Acknowledging low uptake of shared and paternity leave, often due to affordability issues, the government intends to address the system's complexity and lack of generosity compared to other developed nations, a move praised by advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>Determining how much money is needed for retirement is a complex issue that the UK government must address in its upcoming Pension Review. Analysis from Hargreaves Lansdown explores various adequacy measures, from "pounds and pence" benchmarks like the Living Pension to relative measures like target replacement rates based on pre-retirement earnings. The article notes that setting targets is difficult, as overly high goals can discourage lower earners, while low targets may give higher earners a false sense of security about their financial preparedness for retirement.

          <p>A private survey, the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, with the index rising to 50.4. This result, which primarily reflects export-oriented firms, contrasts with the official government PMI that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The upbeat Caixin reading was supported by an expansion in production, though new export orders continued to decline. Analysts attribute the divergence to different survey timings and company coverage, noting that overall business optimism remains weak amid fierce price competition. (not investment advice)</p>
