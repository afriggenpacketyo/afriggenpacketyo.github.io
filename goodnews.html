          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under Labour, with the first nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. The government is focusing on improving services and investing in infrastructure rather than promising lower fares, and the Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged the taxpayer subsidizes the trains by ¬£2bn a year. Unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing staffing to private companies, while the Conservatives are urging Labour to deliver on their promises. SWR will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), although GBR will not officially exist until MPs vote to create it. </p>

          <p>The American economy has faced significant chaos over the past five years, including a pandemic, recession, inflation, and trade war, leading to what some experts call "the era of thrash." Businesses are grappling with unstable tariff rates, bond-market swings, canceled federal contracts, and rising import costs, creating uncertainty about the economic outlook. Despite these challenges, corporate profits are high, the jobless rate is low, productivity has climbed, and new businesses are flourishing, demonstrating the resilience of the U.S. economy. However, there are concerns that this resilience may be wearing off, and the economy is now more vulnerable due to higher interest rates, personal-debt levels, and political instability.</p>

          <p>King Charles III has been invited to open the Canadian parliament, signaling Canada's sovereignty and independence amid strained relations with the U.S. under President Trump. The move is seen as a statement of Canada's unique identity and traditions, distinguishing it from the U.S., and comes at a time when Trump has undermined Canada's sovereignty and imposed tariffs. The visit also aims to strengthen ties with Europe and improve relations with Trump, who admires the British monarchy. While most Canadians are indifferent to the monarchy, the visit serves as a political message and a way for Prime Minister Carney to assert Canada's independence. </p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still addressing calls for police reform. Police Chief Brian O'Hara is focused on internal changes to improve safety and community relations, though he acknowledges Floyd's death remains an "open wound." Despite shootings trending down, Minneapolis is one of few major cities where violent crime hasn't significantly improved since 2020, exacerbated by officer shortages. O'Hara aims to "restore pride in this profession" through community engagement, officer training, and adjusted arrest tactics, and the Justice Department is ending investigations of police agencies, including Minneapolis, with reform efforts continuing without federal oversight.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic's Serena Dai discusses her enjoyment of Nathan Fielder's series, The Rehearsal, highlighting its unique approach to comedy and self-reflection. Unlike Fielder's previous show, Nathan for You, The Rehearsal uses outrageous conceits to help people prepare for difficult moments, prompting questions about comedy's ability to effect real-life change. Dai appreciates how the show organically critiques the entertainment industry's worst impulses, making it both cringey and insightful. She also expresses excitement for Lena Dunham's upcoming Netflix show, Too Much, praising Dunham's talent for writing sharply drawn characters. </p>
