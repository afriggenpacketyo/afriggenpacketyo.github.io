          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos shared a highly optimistic vision for humanity's future at Italian Tech Week, predicting millions will live in space within two decades and robots will handle commutes by 2045. He dismissed concerns about AI's negative impacts, despite acknowledging job displacement and massive resource consumption by data centers. Bezos's enthusiasm for space colonization is echoed by other billionaires like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Elon Musk, though Bill Gates advocates prioritizing Earth's problems. The article also touches on calls for "AI dividends" from politicians like Pete Buttigieg to ensure AI's wealth creation benefits broader society, rather than concentrating power among the super-wealthy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed Department of Justice superiors that there is insufficient evidence to criminally charge Senator Adam Schiff of California with mortgage fraud. This development comes despite President Trump's repeated calls for Attorney General Pam Bondi to indict his staunch critic. MSNBC reported that Hayes, an experienced prosecutor, conveyed her assessment to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, though a controversial senior DOJ official is reportedly pushing to keep the case alive. Schiff's lawyer stated that career prosecutors found the "politically-motivated allegations" baseless, calling for an end to the "vindictive effort."</p>
