          <p>Shohei Ohtani's significant struggles at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series, where he went one for 18 with nine strikeouts, have raised considerable concerns for the upcoming NL Championship Series. Ohtani attributed some of his difficulty to facing numerous left-handed pitchers, a sentiment partially echoed by manager Dave Roberts regarding the team's overall hitting woes. However, Roberts also urged Ohtani to "do a little self-reflecting" on his aggressive swing decisions outside the strike zone and passive approach within it. The manager explicitly stated that the Dodgers cannot win the World Series with such performance, highlighting the critical need for Ohtani's "recalibration" and improved at-bat quality.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer David Allen suffered a unanimous points defeat to Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov in a headline show at a raucous Sheffield Arena. Despite a 9,000-strong home crowd supporting the "White Rhino" in his first headlining event, judges scored the fight 115-111, 117-109, and 116-10 in Makhmudov's favor. Allen, 33, who had previously retired from boxing and rebuilt his career, expressed emotional gratitude for the electric atmosphere, stating he "nearly cried" and vowed he was "not finished." The article details key moments, including Allen's powerful body shot in the fifth round and Makhmudov's two points deductions for holding, emphasizing the tough challenge posed by his opponent.</p>

          <p>The UK clocks will go back by one hour on the last Sunday of October, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and a return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, occurring at 02:00 BST on October 26, will grant most people an extra hour of sleep or leisure. While it brings sunset forward by an hour, the article notes the nights are already drawing in, with four to five minutes of daylight lost daily. The practice of Daylight Saving Time, initiated by Germany in 1916 to conserve fuel during World War One, has continued with ongoing debates about permanent BST. Concerns about darker winter mornings in Scotland, where sunrise could be as late as 09:45 BST, remain a key argument against year-round summer time.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic's participation in the Lakers' preseason games remains "TBD," despite his full practice involvement, with coach JJ Redick stating he'll likely play two games. This uncertainty comes as teammate LeBron James is sidelined for three to four weeks with a sciatica nerve issue, significantly impacting the team's early season dynamics. Doncic acknowledged James' absence as a "big change" but emphasized a "next man up" mentality, expressing his focus on playing basketball and winning, regardless of his individual load. The article highlights that the team continues to prepare, having known about James' nerve irritation over the summer, and is adapting game plans to function at a high level without their star player for the immediate future.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv, praising Donald Trump ahead of the expected release of hostages by Hamas under a US-brokered ceasefire deal. US special envoy Steve Witkoff affirmed that hostages "are coming home," crediting Trump for making the Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal possible. Simultaneously, Palestinian officials reported 500,000 people returning to northern Gaza after Israeli troop withdrawal, often finding their homes in ruins. Egypt is set to host a summit with over 20 leaders, including Trump, to finalize the peace agreement, marking a critical moment for the region. Many attendees at the rally expressed anger at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, blaming him for the October 7 attack and the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her initial shock and subsequent deep understanding upon learning her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, plans to donate her body to medical science after she dies. Patsy's decision stems from profound gratitude for the medical professionals who treated her bowel cancer, believing it's a "simple way to give back" and aid the education of future doctors. Owen's documentary explored Cardiff University's anatomy center, the recipient of her mother's donation, revealing how students develop connections with their "silent teachers" and the vital role real bodies play in medical education. The article notes a recent decline in body donation inquiries and highlights that families often face a long wait for cremation or burial, with costs covered by the university.</p>

          <p>Britain is currently grappling with a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses, with many people reporting severe colds, flu, and Covid-19 infections, prompting inquiries into the prevalent sickness. Experts attribute the increase to typical autumn factors: children returning to school, adults back at work, and more time spent indoors, creating a "big mixing pot of different viruses." While Rhinovirus (common cold) is currently dominant, Covid-19 variants and early signs of flu are also circulating, though health officials note current illness levels are not exceptionally high. The article advises vaccination for eligible individuals and basic hygiene practices like handwashing and staying home when sick to protect vulnerable populations, emphasizing that for healthy adults, occasional infections build immunity.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, the expansive blueprint is expected to redefine the country's infrastructure playbook, shifting towards more tech-driven and people-focused projects. This plan follows decades of rapid expansion, including a 4-trillion-yuan stimulus package in 2009 that helped navigate the global financial crisis through massive public works. While these past projects significantly spurred economic growth and connected the vast population, some also contributed to local government debt, a persistent source of financial pressure. Despite these concerns, officials and government advisers remain bullish on the scale of infrastructure spending over the next half-decade, indicating continued investment as a key driver for economic development and national priorities.

Downing Street confirmed his attendance, where he will pay "particular tribute" to US President Donald Trump for brokering the initial ceasefire and hostage return deal between Israel and Hamas. The ceasefire took effect Friday, with Hamas given until Monday to release all 48 remaining hostages, including 20 believed to be alive. The summit, led by Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, aims to finalize the agreement and secure swift progress toward phase two, which involves complex negotiations on Gaza's governance and Israeli troop withdrawal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deploy the National Guard in Illinois, partially upholding a lower court's decision. The Chicago-based US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit agreed that the deployment was "likely to lead to civil unrest" and would "only add fuel to the fire," while allowing the Guard to remain under federal control for now. This ruling comes after Trump previously sent the National Guard to other Democratic-led cities like Los Angeles and Portland, arguing they were needed to combat illegal immigration and crime. Local officials, including those in Illinois and Chicago, have sued the administration, accusing it of exceeding its legal authority and intruding on state sovereignty.</p>
