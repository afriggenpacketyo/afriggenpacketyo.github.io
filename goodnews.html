        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five divisions of men's football in England. The legislation, supported by a 415 to 98 vote, aims to protect clubs by ensuring their financial sustainability and giving fans a greater voice in the game. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated the bill puts fans "back on the pitch at the heart of the game." Originally introduced by the Conservative government, the bill was reintroduced by the new Labour government after the general election, though it still faces criticism from the opposition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon has extended its Prime Day sales event to four days, creating a mid-summer shopping surge that tests consumer resilience in the face of potential price hikes from U.S. tariffs. Adobe predicts shoppers will spend a record $23.8 billion, with electronics and back-to-school supplies being top categories, both of which are affected by tariffs on Chinese imports. While the White House has negotiated a temporary reprieve, retailers like Walmart have warned that costs will eventually be passed to consumers. So far, a strong job market and retailers absorbing costs have sustained spending, but this event may offer an early indicator of future trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 14:34:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz has advanced to the Wimbledon semifinals for the first time, defeating Karen Khachanov in a four-set match. Fritz dominated the first two sets before experiencing a significant dip in the third, allowing his opponent back into the contest. The fourth set was tense, featuring a controversial line-calling system error and an early break by Khachanov. However, Fritz regained his composure, broke back, and ultimately clinched the match in a tie-break. He will now face two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz for a place in the final, expressing confidence that the grass court surface can act as an equalizer.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on Germany's historic 7-1 victory over host nation Brazil in the 2014 World Cup semifinal, a match that shattered numerous records and became a defining moment in football history. The game saw Germany score four goals in a stunning six-minute span, leading to a national trauma for Brazil, which was playing without its injured star Neymar and suspended captain Thiago Silva. The piece argues that this dominant performance, more so than the final victory over Argentina, announced Germany's return to the pinnacle of world football. It showcased a ruthless, tactically brilliant team at the peak of its developmental cycle.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a scheme that uses fraudulent IT workers to generate revenue for the regime's weapons programs. According to officials, Song recruited North Korean operatives who used stolen identities of U.S. citizens to secure remote work at companies worldwide. The funds earned from this sprawling operation, which employs thousands of workers in China and Russia, are channeled to Kim Jong Un's government. The sanctions also target four other entities involved in a related Russia-based network, underscoring the U.S. commitment to disrupting these illicit funding streams.</p>

          <h2>TSA Appears to Be Ending Shoe Removal Requirement at U.S. Airports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 14:16:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is reportedly phasing out the long-standing requirement for travelers to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints. While the TSA has not made a formal announcement, observers at several major U.S. airports, including in Washington D.C. and Philadelphia, have noted that passengers are now passing through security with their shoes on. The rule was implemented in 2006 following the failed 2001 "shoe bomber" attempt. A former TSA officer suggests the change is possible due to improved screening technology and will likely speed up security lines, though it remains unclear how this will affect the TSA PreCheck program.</p>

          <p>Three weeks into his tenure as interim manager for the Angels, Ray Montgomery is adopting a different managerial style from his predecessor, Ron Washington. While Washington was known for giving his starting pitchers a longer leash, Montgomery, with his scouting background, appears to favor a more analytical approach, including playing matchups and being cautious about pitchers facing a lineup a third time. The team has an 8-8 record under his leadership, with several narrow one-run losses. Montgomery acknowledges the pressure to win, stating that the team is past its development phase and focused on making a push for the postseason.</p>

          <h2>Four Reasons to Consider Credit Card Debt Forgiveness This July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 14:01:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a case for pursuing credit card debt forgiveness in July, arguing that waiting for external relief may be unwise for those struggling with high-interest debt. It notes that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates this month, and any future cuts are expected to be minimal, offering little help. Meanwhile, interest on existing balances continues to compound, worsening the debt spiral. The piece also highlights how high-rate debt negatively impacts overall financial health, including credit scores, making it harder to secure other forms of credit, thus strengthening the argument for proactive relief.

          <p>During his state visit to the UK, French President Emmanuel Macron stated that France and the UK "will deliver" on stopping small boat crossings in the English Channel. Negotiations between Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to finalize a new border enforcement deal. Key components of the agreement reportedly include new powers for French police to intercept boats in shallow waters and a "one in, one out" migrant returns arrangement. While Macron emphasized the need for a broader European solution, Downing Street is optimistic that months of talks are close to yielding a tangible agreement to deter the dangerous crossings.</p>
