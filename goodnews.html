          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that seeks to defund public broadcasting. The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court in Washington, accuses the administration of unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and violating the First Amendment through viewpoint discrimination and illegal retaliation. The suit alleges the executive order aims to cut off funds to PBS due to the content of its programming, infringing on the network's editorial discretion. If implemented, the order would profoundly impact PBS's ability to provide diverse programming to Americans.</p>

          <p>The remains of 19 Black Americans, which were used in the 19th century as part of now discredited racial science, have been returned to New Orleans after 150 years in Germany.

The skulls will be laid to rest in a traditional jazz funeral, providing a dignified end to a dark chapter in scientific history.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator stated that talks with U.S. Cabinet members indicate progress toward a potential tariff deal as early as next month. Ryosei Akazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington, planning another round of negotiations before the G7 summit in mid-June. Akazawa emphasized Japan's demand for the U.S. to remove all additional tariffs on Japanese imports, highlighting the importance of boosting investment and addressing economic security issues. Both countries aim to achieve a win-win relationship through increased Japanese investment in the United States rather than relying on tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities are expressing anger and disappointment over the sport's 130-year history without a knighthood or damehood for its players. The Rugby Football League and Members of Parliament, including Speaker of the House Sir Lindsay Hoyle, are calling for recognition of the sport's stars, suggesting class prejudice may be a factor in the lack of honors. In contrast, rugby union, often associated with more middle-class roots, has had knighthoods for over a century, sparking debate about fairness in the honors system. Rugby league figures, like Kevin Sinfield, have also raised millions for charity, adding to the argument for recognition.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar, emerged as a central topic at Bitcoin 2025, signaling a shift in financial and political landscapes. Vice President JD Vance endorsed crypto, viewing stablecoins as a "force multiplier" for U.S. economic might. Bo Hines, a White House official, suggested stablecoin integration could unlock trillions in global demand for American debt. The GENIUS Act, a Senate bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, is expected to move to a cloture vote. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce indicated a shift towards a more industry-friendly approach to crypto regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Retired Judges Urge Court to Drop Charges Against Wisconsin Judge Dugan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 19:16:46 EDT</div>

          <p>A bipartisan group of over 130 retired judges filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested by FBI agents for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges contend Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to protections afforded to members of the legislative and executive branches. They call the prosecution an "egregious overreach" that threatens public trust in the judicial system and independent decision-making.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that an immunotherapy drug could significantly extend the lives of individuals with advanced head and neck cancer without the cancer recurring. The international study, involving experts from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, involved over 350 patients receiving pembrolizumab before and after surgery. The new approach doubled the average time patients were cancer-free, from around 2.5 years to five years. Laura Marston, a participant in the trial, shared her positive experience, highlighting the drug's impact on her survival and quality of life.</p>
