          <h2>Japan's Economy Experiences Unexpected Contraction in Early 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 00:53:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports, according to preliminary government data. The contraction exceeded economists' expectations, raising concerns about the impact of global trade uncertainties, particularly those stemming from U.S. trade policies. While domestic demand showed strength, the weakness in exports, potentially influenced by competition from China, is a concern for the Bank of Japan, which recently warned of a potential moderation in the country's economic growth going forward. Despite these concerns, the central bank is expected to maintain its current policy rate, with a possible rate hike later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI has publicly addressed the recent controversy surrounding its Grok chatbot, acknowledging that an 'unauthorized modification' led to the generation of variations of a 'specific response on a political topic' related to 'white genocide' in South Africa. The company stated that this change violated its internal policies and core values and announced measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability. These measures include publishing system prompts on GitHub, implementing additional checks to prevent unapproved modifications, and creating a team for 24/7 monitoring of Grok's responses. The article also mentions the ongoing legal and public relations battle between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba shares experienced a significant drop of over 7% after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations on both revenue and net income. While revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, analysts had anticipated stronger performance, particularly given the company's investments in artificial intelligence and its core e-commerce business. The results reflect challenges stemming from macroeconomic volatility and its effect on consumer sentiment in China, as well as intense competition from rivals. Despite these challenges, Alibaba plans to invest aggressively in its 'instant commerce' model to drive more engagement on the Taobao app. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nissan is considering sharing its factories worldwide with its Chinese state-owned partner, Dongfeng, as part of a business shakeup that includes laying off 11,000 workers and closing seven factories. The struggling company, facing weak sales and recent leadership changes, aims to reduce its global production by a fifth through these measures. Despite these challenges, Nissan's UK plant in Sunderland is expected to launch new car models. The company's battery partner, AESC, has also secured a significant funding package from the UK government for a new plant in Sunderland.</p>

          <p>Green Tea Group experienced a tepid trading debut in Hong Kong, with shares remaining unchanged from the offer price before declining. The muted performance is attributed to traders sidestepping the small stock sale in anticipation of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL)'s upcoming IPO, which is expected to be the world's largest this year. Fifteen companies raised HK$17.7 billion in Hong Kong during the first quarter of the year, helping the city rank third globally in IPO destinations.

          <p>The LA 2028 Olympics plans to introduce an air taxi service for spectators, partnering with Archer Aviation to provide electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs). If certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration in time for the Games, the air taxis would offer short flights between select destinations, including several Olympic venues. Archer Aviation hopes to keep prices comparable to a high-end Uber, allowing spectators to bypass Los Angeles' traffic congestion. The industry faces hurdles, including battery density, and none of the aircraft have yet been approved by the FAA.</p>
