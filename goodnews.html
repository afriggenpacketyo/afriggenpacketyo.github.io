        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, siding with an appeal from the migrants who argued they didn't have enough time to challenge their deportations. The court did not rule on the lawfulness of the AEA itself, but rather sent the matter back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the process necessary to satisfy the Constitution in this case. The court clarified that its decision only pertained to the notice given on April 18, ensuring that detainees receive adequate time to contest their removal.</p>

          <p>Trump administration officials interpreted a seemingly innocuous Instagram post by former F.B.I. Director James Comey as a call for the president's assassination. The post featured shells arranged to spell "86 47," with "47" presumed to refer to President Trump, the 47th president. While the term "86" commonly means to eliminate or throw something out, officials like Tulsi Gabbard and Kristi Noem accused Comey of issuing a hit on the president, leading to investigations by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service.</p>

          <p>Months after the Los Angeles County fires sent tons of toxic material into the ocean, the safety of swimming at L.A.'s beaches remains uncertain. While tests have not found levels of fire-related contamination likely to pose health risks to beachgoers, the ecological damage has overwhelmed existing measurement tools. The seawater safety testing primarily targets hazards from sewage, not fire debris, and there are no clear guidelines for safe exposure levels to heavy metals and chemicals in recreational water. Officials are working to translate findings into public recommendations as the coastal ecosystem undergoes a real-life science experiment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unleashed a series of social media attacks targeting the Supreme Court, fellow Republicans, and celebrities. He criticized Bruce Springsteen for speaking negatively about him abroad, accused the Supreme Court of being "played," and claimed Taylor Swift is "no longer 'HOT'" since he expressed his dislike for her. These posts, sent during his flight back from Abu Dhabi, highlight the domestic political challenges he faces, including setbacks for his tax-cut bill and contentious Supreme Court arguments related to his birthright citizenship order.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that a hidden source of hydrogen could power the planet for 170,000 years. Sources of hydrogen may be hiding amid the Earth's crust, with potential "hydrogen systems" buried beneath continents, including in at least 30 U.S. states. Researchers have developed an "exploration recipe" to assess where hydrogen reservoirs could be and where extraction would be economically feasible. This could provide a sustainable hydrogen source for agriculture and a carbon-neutral future.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are divided over a House amendment that would allow the sale or transfer of approximately 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, a former interior secretary, is leading the opposition, threatening the future of President Trump's budget bill. The amendment reflects the priorities of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who views public lands as assets to be exploited for purposes such as solving the affordable housing crisis.

The event has drawn criticism from Democrats, who view it as a wasteful display of ego.

With a new president, Joseph Aoun, Lebanon hopes to benefit from regional trade, refugee returns, and economic recovery.

          <p>The Illinois House has passed legislation requiring more thorough background checks for police officers before they are hired, less than a year after a Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy shot and killed Sonya Massey. Law enforcement agencies will not be allowed to make a final job offer without inspecting all prior employment records. The bill aims to prevent future tragedies by ensuring that concerns about an officer's conduct are properly shared and addressed during the hiring process. The legislation was passed unanimously by the Illinois Senate and will now go to Gov. JB Pritzker.</p>
