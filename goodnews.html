          <p>China's State Council, chaired by Premier Li Qiang, has announced new measures to support and encourage private investment, aiming to stabilize employment and the broader economy. The government plans to create a more fair and competitive market environment where private enterprises can invest with confidence. Key initiatives include expanding market access, particularly in emerging services and new infrastructure, and increasing financial support through central budget allocations. The measures also involve reserving a portion of government procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises to bolster their participation and growth in the economy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article critiques the recent trend suggesting a comeback for skinny jeans, framing it as part of the relentless and wasteful cycle of the fashion industry. The author expresses a personal disdain for jeans in general, arguing they are uncomfortable and unflattering for many body types. The piece criticizes fashion media for encouraging consumers to constantly buy new versions of old styles, contributing to pollution and exploitative labor practices. Ultimately, the author advocates for developing an individual sense of style rather than succumbing to the pressure of fleeting, industry-driven trends.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI's significant financial commitments are having a major impact on the tech industry, with Oracle being the latest beneficiary of a massive cloud computing contract. The AI startup's spending spree has also been a key driver for companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, contributing to a collective market cap increase of over $4.5 trillion since late 2022. While OpenAI's influence is powering a stock market rally, some analysts express concern over the concentration of this growth, as it relies heavily on a single, cash-burning startup. OpenAI's planned expenditures highlight its central role in the current AI infrastructure boom. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel experts at Google Flights, the single most effective advice for finding affordable airfare is to maintain flexibility with travel plans. This includes being open to flying on different days of the week or traveling during a destination's off-peak or shoulder seasons. Data shows that flying midweek—on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays—is generally cheaper than on weekends, potentially saving travelers around 13-14% on domestic flights. The article also debunks the myth that the day of the week you book your flight matters significantly, emphasizing that the travel dates themselves have the largest impact on price.</p>

          <p>This article explains the current challenges in obtaining a COVID-19 vaccine due to new, narrower FDA guidelines that prioritize individuals 65 and older and those at high risk. Unlike previous years, younger, healthy individuals may not be automatically eligible, requiring them to "self-attest" to risk factors or potentially get a doctor's prescription. The report details the list of qualifying conditions, addresses eligibility for pregnant individuals and children, and provides information on vaccine availability and insurance coverage.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled for an unprecedented second state visit to the UK from September 16-18, where he will be hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. The visit, initiated by an invitation from Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is considered unusual as second-term U.S. presidents are not typically offered a full state visit. The itinerary includes a formal welcome with a royal salute, a state banquet, and a meeting between Trump and Starmer at Chequers. Protests are being planned by the "Stop Trump" coalition, similar to those that occurred during his previous visits.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural and social history of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete slab apartment buildings common in the former East Germany. Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages, these buildings housed a significant portion of the GDR's population and created a shared collective memory. Following German reunification, however, they became symbols of economic decline and social problems, including the rise of far-right extremism. The exhibition uses art to revisit this divisive architectural heritage, prompting reflection on community, memory, and societal transformation.</p>

          <p>The German language is experiencing a growing wave of popularity in Turkey, second only to English, as more young people view it as a gateway to better opportunities. Driven by a challenging economic situation and stressful working conditions in Turkey, many students are learning German with the hope of studying or working in Germany. Elite Turkish high schools report a significant increase in graduates choosing to attend German universities. This rising demand has led to a shortage of German language teachers in Turkey, highlighting a major shift in the future plans of the nation's youth.</p>

          <p>Small colleges across the U.S., like Roanoke College in Virginia, are adding or reviving football programs in an effort to increase overall enrollment, particularly among men, whose college attendance rates have been declining. Administrators hope the sport and its associated activities will foster a sense of belonging and attract more students. While these schools often see an initial spike in male applicants who come to play, research indicates that adding football does not typically produce long-term, sustainable enrollment gains. Despite this, the strategy remains popular as institutions compete for a shrinking pool of potential students.</p>

          <p>With teenagers increasingly using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support, experts are urging parents to engage in open conversations about the technology. They recommend that parents learn about AI themselves and explore its capabilities alongside their children to teach responsible and ethical usage. While AI can be a helpful learning aid, there are significant risks, including the potential for chatbots to provide unsafe responses to mental health crises. Experts advise setting reasonable household rules, prioritizing real-life interaction, and teaching children to critically evaluate AI-generated information.</p>

          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that Meta removed the account "without a clear and transparent justification" and applied its policies on nudity inconsistently compared to other similar accounts. While acknowledging the need for content moderation, the ruling stated that social media posts are constitutionally protected and can only be limited in a proportionate way. The court ordered Meta to review and clarify its terms of use regarding moderation decisions.</p>

          <p>Experts are divided on the outcome of the highly anticipated fight between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford. One perspective argues that Crawford's superior technical skill, adaptability, and ability to switch stances will allow him to outbox Álvarez, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, another view holds that Álvarez's significant size and power advantage will ultimately be decisive, as he is more accustomed to fighting at the 168lb super-middleweight limit. While Crawford is seen as the more complete boxer, Canelo's experience and strength could allow him to wear down his smaller opponent in a tactical matchup.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has appointed its first female prime minister, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki. The "GenZ" protests, sparked by a social media ban and fueled by economic woes, led to the dissolution of parliament. Karki, known for her anti-graft stance, will lead an interim government until new elections are held on March 5. Her appointment was the result of negotiations between the army, the president, and protest representatives, bringing a sense of calm back to the capital.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both its declining birth rate and the need to retain scientific talent, Shanghai has launched a subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to new mothers in science to support their return to work after childbirth. The pilot program, initially covering the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is aimed at women under 40 who hold a doctoral degree. This policy represents a targeted approach to simultaneously tackle two of China's major national priorities: encouraging childbirth and strengthening its research sector.</p>
