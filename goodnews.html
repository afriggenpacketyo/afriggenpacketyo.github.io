        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sanae Takaichi has been elected as Japan's first female prime minister by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, a historic milestone for the nation. A self-declared admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is known for her ultraconservative and hard-line political stances, including a hawkish approach toward China and support for constitutional revision. Her economic platform aligns with the fiscal and monetary stimulus policies of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. While her election is a significant moment for female representation, analysts suggest her rise was driven more by her conservative ideology than by her gender, as she opposes same-sex marriage and separate surnames for married couples.</p>

          <p>Leading U.S. defense and aerospace companies, including GE Aerospace, Northrop Grumman, RTX, and Lockheed Martin, have raised their financial forecasts for 2025. This upward revision is attributed to significantly stronger demand for their products and services, despite broader economic uncertainties and the impact of tariffs. The companies reported beating third-quarter profit estimates, citing increased defense deliveries and a substantial backlog of orders valued in the hundreds of billions. The positive outlooks signal robust health in the defense sector, with executives highlighting unprecedented demand from both domestic and international customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On Maryland Emancipation Day, November 1, Anne Arundel County will become the first local jurisdiction in the state to issue a formal apology for its historical role in perpetuating slavery. The apology, requested by civil rights groups including the NAACP, will be delivered by County Executive Steuart Pittman during a "Day of Acknowledgment" event. Officials stated the goal is to confront the legacy of slavery, acknowledge the intergenerational trauma it caused, and highlight the resilience and triumphs of the county's African American communities. The event will also feature educational panels on topics such as reparations and programs aimed at addressing modern-day disparities.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is set to meet with President Trump at the White House on November 18, marking his first visit to Washington during Trump's second term. The meeting is expected to focus on strengthening military and intelligence cooperation, with Saudi Arabia reportedly seeking a defense pact similar to one the U.S. recently established with Qatar. Discussions will likely also cover economic ties and regional security issues, including the war in Gaza and Iran's nuclear program. This visit underscores the ongoing strategic relationship between the two nations, which President Trump has described as a "bedrock of security and prosperity."</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has announced the formation of Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, currently located in the Caribbean. Forecast models show significant uncertainty regarding its future path, with possibilities including a northward turn over Hispaniola, a westward track toward Central America, or a slower drift affecting Jamaica, Cuba, and the Bahamas. While the storm is not expected to have a major impact on the mainland United States, its development could be a prolonged event lasting well into the next week.

At its peak, skygazers could see around 15 meteors per hour. For the best viewing experience, experts recommend finding a dark location away from city lights after midnight and looking toward the constellation of Orion.

While AI tools are useful for simple, repetitive tasks and creating quick prototypes, developers report they often generate messy, unworkable code for complex projects, sometimes creating more work. Engineers express that their job is primarily about high-level problem-solving, a skill AI cannot replicate, and that every line of AI-generated code still requires human review. This skepticism contrasts with the top-down pressure in some companies to adopt AI, fostering a sense that there is little room for disagreement.</p>
