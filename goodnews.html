          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed leaders from Latin America and the Caribbean, cautioning against tariff wars and advocating for global peace and stability through solidarity and cooperation. In veiled remarks directed at the United States, Xi emphasized that "bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation." His message aligns with China's broader strategy to garner support from the Global South amidst trade tensions with the U.S., as Washington seeks to expand its influence in Latin America, including pressuring Panama regarding Chinese control over the Panama Canal. China's foreign minister will chair a meeting with foreign ministers from the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 22:50:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York revealed a cautious art market, with subdued bidding and many items presold. Experts attributed the tepid sale to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs, which could negatively impact the global art market. Despite a total of $272 million including fees, the sale fell short of pre-sale expectations, and a major Warhol painting was withdrawn mid-auction, signaling weakness in that market. However, paintings by artists like Gerhard Richter and Vincent van Gogh sold above estimates, indicating some demand remains, but overall, the auction highlighted a shift from the frothy art market of 2022.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing cities to implement bans against homeless encampments, releasing a model ordinance and announcing new funding for treatment and housing. Newsom called on cities and counties to act, stating the state is providing resources and that "there's nothing compassionate about letting people die on the streets." The model ordinance emphasizes prioritizing shelter and services while allowing local authority to clear encampments. This effort is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, as Newsom approaches the end of his term amid speculation about his political future.</p>

However, the agriculture sector experienced slow growth due to insecurity and high input costs. President Bola Tinubu's reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, have led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians.

While GLP-1 drugs can help a wide spectrum of people lose weight, their risks are likely justified for only a smaller subset of Americans. To say whether the health benefits a person might gain from taking the drugs are worth the expense and likely gastrointestinal distress, physicians cannot rely on weight alone. The primary metric by which anti-obesity drugs are judged and distributed is weight, however, the primary goal should not be changes in weight alone, but changes in health.</p>
