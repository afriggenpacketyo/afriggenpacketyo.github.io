          <p>The UK is experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach 32C in central England. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of pressures on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. A yellow weather warning for storms has been issued for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales for Saturday. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and scientists attribute the increased chance of extreme heat to climate change. </p>

          <p>Eutelsat shares surged after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35-billion-euro capital raise led by the French state and backed by other investors. The capital increase will support the company's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focused on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. The French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights. Eutelsat, which merged with OneWeb in 2023, is the world's third-largest satellite operator in terms of revenues. </p>

          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully developed and tested artillery-launched drones, overcoming technical hurdles to create drones capable of withstanding the immense forces within a 155mm cannon shell. Live-fire trials confirmed the drones could endure launch forces exceeding 3,000 times their own weight. The advancement centers on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism that separates the drone from its shell mid-flight without electronic controls. The team claims these drones can reach distances exceeding 10 kilometers in seconds, extend flight range, and significantly save power consumption. </p>

          <p>A sheriff in Skamania County, Washington, is considering implementing a new ordinance that would require irresponsible hikers to pay for their rescue if their actions are deemed reckless or negligent. This consideration comes as the number of search-and-rescue missions has soared, with some rescues taking hours to complete. The idea of charging for rescues has been debated before, with some states already having similar policies in place. However, some search-and-rescue organizations oppose the idea, arguing that it could deter people from seeking help when needed. </p>

          <p>An independent commission is urging the California Legislature to establish a new local authority to oversee and coordinate rebuilding efforts following the destructive fires in Los Angeles County. The proposed Resilient Rebuilding Authority would streamline complex recovery efforts, prioritize the return of residents and businesses, and use tax-increment financing to buy fire-razed lots. The authority would also aim to prevent land speculation and ensure that new homes are affordable for displaced people. The commission also proposed a ballot measure to create a new Los Angeles County Fire Control District to focus on wildfire prevention. </p>
