          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in the Hague, Netherlands, shortly after announcing a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, though he later noted violations of the agreement. Trump aims to secure commitments from NATO allies to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte praised Trump's actions in Iran and his success in securing increased defense spending commitments from NATO members. Russia's war on Ukraine remains a key concern for NATO, with ongoing discussions about the alliance's stance toward Russia, with the U.S. urging restraint from both parties. The summit will address defense spending and the conflict in Ukraine. Optimism about allied defense spending efforts exists. The overall sense of stability is present despite ongoing conflicts. The optimism score is the result of a balanced assessment of the situation.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ida Jones, the Morgan State University archivist, explains the significance of Juneteenth, which commemorates the day enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they were free. She said that Juneteenth allowed enslaved people to celebrate their freedom and their identities, being African and American. She encourages everyone to visit a museum to understand the history and the lived experience of freedom. Dr. Jones said learning about the history behind Juneteenth helps us to understand collective ancestry, collective sacrifice, as well as being born in this time.</p>
