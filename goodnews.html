          <h2>Researchers Pioneer Digital Bridge to Restore Bodily Functions After Spinal Cord Injuries</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the groundbreaking work of French neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine and Swiss neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, who have developed a "digital bridge" to help paralyzed individuals regain motor functions. The technology involves wirelessly transmitting signals from the brain to the spinal cord, bypassing the injury site. Early clinical trials have shown promise in restoring not only walking ability but also other critical functions like blood pressure regulation and bladder control. While the therapy is still in its early stages, the researchers hope to expand its accessibility and address a range of issues faced by individuals with spinal cord injuries, such as sexual function and normalizing body temperature.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that a trade deal has been reached with China following two days of negotiations in Switzerland, though details remain scarce and China has only acknowledged a "consensus."

This announcement comes after President Trump hinted at easing tariffs and follows a period of escalating trade tensions between the two countries. China is expected to release a joint statement with the U.S. regarding the agreement.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his plan to sign an executive order that would drastically reduce prescription drug prices in the United States, potentially by 30% to 80%. He criticized the high cost of drugs in America compared to other countries and claimed that pharmaceutical companies have been unfairly burdening American consumers with research and development costs. The order will institute a "Most Favored Nation's Policy," ensuring the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest drug prices worldwide. Trump stated that this measure would bring fairness to America and save trillions of dollars.</p>
