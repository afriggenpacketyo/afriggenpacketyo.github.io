          <p>Actor-turned-professional race car driver Frankie Muniz has announced he will be out of NASCAR competition for several weeks after sustaining a distal radius fracture in a backyard fall. The "Malcolm in the Middle" alum slipped from a ladder, resulting in an injury that requires a six-to-eight-week recovery period. Muniz expressed disappointment at missing races but acknowledged it could have been worse, thanking his team and Ford Performance for their support. This article highlights his commitment to racing, a career he finds more fulfilling than acting due to its objective nature, and recalls a previous multi-truck crash he endured last year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced the first electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for a £3,750 discount under a new grant scheme aimed at accelerating the transition from petrol and diesel cars. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier are among the models receiving the maximum reduction, with 26 others qualifying for a £1,500 discount. This article details the £650 million scheme, which will run for three years, and aims to make EV prices competitive with traditional vehicles. Despite industry support, some drivers and critics highlight ongoing concerns about high upfront costs and the inadequate number of public charging points, which remain significant barriers to wider EV adoption.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the absence of federal regulation, 23 US states have enacted or expanded laws to control the collection and use of biometric data, including facial recognition technology. Recent legislation in Colorado and Texas, for instance, mandates consent before use and prohibits data sale. This article highlights the growing public concern over ubiquitous digital tracking and tech companies' profit motives. While some state laws, like Illinois's, empower individuals to sue, leading to significant settlements, most rely on state attorneys general for enforcement. Challenges remain, particularly in pursuing elusive overseas companies like PimEyes, underscoring the limitations of state-level privacy protections against global digital surveillance.</p>

          <h2>Strategies to Maximize Social Security Retirement Benefits for a More Secure Future</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 13:18:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For millions of Americans, Social Security benefits are a crucial retirement income source, often comprising a significant portion of their earnings. This article outlines three key strategies to maximize these benefits: delaying claims until age 70 for a permanent 24% increase, continuing to work to replace lower-earning years, and strategically coordinating spousal benefits for married couples. It emphasizes that while Social Security is vital, it typically won't cover all expenses. The article also suggests supplementary income options like annuities, reverse mortgages, and maintaining a diverse retirement portfolio, advising individuals to implement these strategies early to secure their financial future.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve continues to implement rate cuts, savers are evaluating whether a Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a money market account offers better interest earnings for a $40,000 deposit. This article provides a comparative analysis over three, six, nine, and twelve-month periods, using current interest rates. While a money market account might slightly outperform in some short-term scenarios, its variable rate is subject to further declines. Conversely, CDs offer a guaranteed fixed rate, which can provide more security for savers in a volatile interest rate environment. The article advises considering the preference for guaranteed returns when making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of the popular weight loss drug Mounjaro, has offered a discounted deal to UK suppliers, aiming to soften a significant price increase for consumers planned for September. Initially, the highest dose was set to jump from £122 to £330 per month, but the new arrangement is expected to cap the supplier price at £247.50. This article notes that while pharmacies will add their markup, the overall price rise for patients will be less severe than first feared. The company had justified the hike by aligning UK prices with those in Europe and the US, a point of contention previously raised by President Trump regarding global drug costs.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang underscored the immense opportunity in China, potentially worth $50 billion, and projected a staggering $3 trillion to $4 trillion in global AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end.

Factors such as surging electricity demand, partly driven by AI development and manufacturing reshoring, are reshaping investment strategies. While the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) has seen outflows, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) has attracted inflows and outperformed, reflecting a changing perception of energy as "power" rather than solely fossil fuels.

The European Commission emphasized that these measures are designed to re-establish stability and predictability in trade and investment relations between the EU and US, benefiting stakeholders on both sides.

          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated stronger-than-anticipated growth in the second quarter, expanding at an annualized rate of 3.3%, an upward revision from initial estimates. This robust performance was primarily driven by increased consumer spending and resilience from businesses, despite tariff volatility. The article highlights that "final sales to private domestic purchasers," a key indicator closely monitored by Federal Reserve officials for demand within US borders, also saw a significant jump. While tariffs led to a tumble in imports and a slight fall in exports, net exports ultimately contributed positively to the GDP.
