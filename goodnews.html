          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who claimed she was denied a promotion and later demoted due to her heterosexual orientation. Ames alleged that the Ohio Department of Youth Services, her employer, selected less qualified gay candidates for the positions, and that her supervisor was also gay. The court found that Ames had been unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group, and that the requirement to show 'background circumstances' to support the suspicion of discrimination against the majority is inconsistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This ruling allows Ames' lawsuit to proceed, but does not guarantee a successful outcome.</p>

          <p>The autopen, a machine used to automate signatures, has become a point of political contention following allegations by President Trump that former President Biden used one to sign pardons. Autopens have been used by presidents throughout U.S. history to sign high volumes of documents, such as letters and legislation. The device automates a person's signature with a pen or other writing instrument, offering a consistent and efficient alternative to manual signing. While Trump has also used an autopen for routine correspondence, he criticizes Biden's alleged use of it for signing pardons, calling it a "political scandal."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of a Wisconsin-based Catholic charity, stating that the state unconstitutionally discriminated against the organization regarding unemployment tax credits. The court found that Wisconsin engaged in an "unnecessary entanglement" by attempting to define whether religious groups should be entitled to a tax exemption based on the state‚Äôs criteria for religious behavior. Justice Sotomayor wrote that the state imposed a denominational preference without the necessary tailoring to survive judicial scrutiny. The Wisconsin Supreme Court had previously ruled that the charity was not "operated primarily for religious purposes" because it serves and employs non-Catholics and does not actively promote the Catholic faith.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that a Catholic charity in Wisconsin does not have to pay unemployment taxes, marking one of several religious-rights cases the court is considering this term. The Catholic Charities Bureau argued that the state violated the First Amendment's religious freedom guarantee by requiring the organization to pay the tax while exempting other faith groups. Wisconsin contended that the organization's daily work does not involve religious teachings, thus not qualifying it for an exemption. The court also deadlocked on public funding for religious schools and is still deliberating a case regarding religious objections to books in schools.</p>

Wealth management firms are increasingly focused on engaging with this next generation, but many admit to finding it challenging to build effective relationships.
