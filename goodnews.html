          <p>President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50% at a U.S. Steel factory outside Pittsburgh, aiming to boost the local steel industry and national supply while decreasing reliance on China. Trump also mentioned a $14 billion investment in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, although he stated that he had yet to see or approve the final deal. The tariff increase is intended to ensure the survival of US Steel, with Trump stating that at 50%, foreign steel producers "can no longer get over the fence." The announcement comes amid ongoing court battles over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, but the tariffs on steel and aluminum were untouched by the lawsuit. (not investment advice)</p>

The probe, launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, targets asteroid 2016 HO3, also known as 469219 Kamo ªoalewa, to bring back samples within two years. This mission is part of a larger 10-year plan to expand China's presence in space, including the Tianwen-3 Mars sampling return mission in 2028 and the Tianwen-4 mission to Jupiter. The asteroids are chosen for their stable orbits and potential to offer clues about Earth's formation, but NASA is restricted from cooperating with CNSA due to the Wolf Amendment.</p>

          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 70,000 pounds of honeybee hives overturned in northwestern Washington state, releasing approximately 250 million bees. Authorities have warned people to avoid the area due to the potential for bee swarming, and roads in the region have been closed. Bee experts and the local community of beekeepers are working to rescue as many bees as possible, with the goal of allowing them to return to their hives and find their queen bee. Honeybees play a crucial role in pollination and food production, and experts have noted the decline of bees due to insecticides, parasites, disease, climate change, and lack of food supply.</p>

          <p>An appeals court denied the Trump administration's request to resume mass firings of federal employees, maintaining a pause on Department of Government Efficiency-led cuts. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Executive Order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. The administration had sought to overturn an injunction issued by a U.S. judge in a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities, questioning the legality of the administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce. The judge's order directs federal agencies to halt actions based on the President's workforce executive order.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing challenges in its tourism sector due to rising prices and heavy traffic. Higher prices have led to a decrease in casual trips, although convention traffic remains steady. The average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip has increased, while hotel occupancy has slightly decreased. The city is also seeing fewer international visitors, who tend to stay longer and spend more, and months of construction and road closures are causing traffic congestion. Despite these challenges, the summer calendar is full of events, and officials remain optimistic about the city's resilience.</p>

          <p>Japan and the U.S. are making progress toward a potential tariff deal as early as next month, according to Japan's chief tariff negotiator. The two countries plan to hold another round of negotiations before a Group of Seven summit in mid-June. Japan is urging the U.S. to remove all additional tariffs on Japanese imports, but the U.S. is emphasizing the importance of boosting investment and addressing economic security issues. Japan has presented proposals including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans, and cooperation in resurrecting U.S. shipbuilding capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron called on Europe and Asia to fortify coalition and avoid being caught in the intensifying rift between the U.S. and China. Addressing the annual defense forum Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Macron urged Indo-Pacific nations to establish a "new coalition" to counter the "constraints and side effects" stemming from the growing U.S.-China rivalry. Macron stated that the "division between the two superpowers" is the main risk confronting the world, and he sought to bolster France's defense cooperation with other nations.</p>

          <p>Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore recounted the tense moments during their Boeing Starliner capsule test flight, which lasted nearly 10 months due to technical issues. When approaching the International Space Station (ISS), failing thrusters prevented them from docking, raising concerns about their return to Earth. The possibility of not seeing Earth again crossed their minds, but they focused on problem-solving. The astronauts eventually docked with assistance from Mission Control and returned to Earth on a SpaceX capsule.</p>
