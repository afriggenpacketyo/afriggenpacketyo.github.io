          <p>For the past decade, Toledo tattoo artist Brian Finn has dedicated his days off to providing free or reduced-cost tattoos for individuals with scars from trauma, including domestic abuse and self-harm. What began as a personal project has inspired a global community of artists to offer similar services after his story gained national attention. Finn reflects on the emotional weight of hearing thousands of stories but remains committed to the work, viewing it as a way to help people reclaim their bodies. He finds deep satisfaction in helping clients either conceal their scars or transform them into meaningful art.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article traces the history of the American state fair, from its 19th-century origins as a showcase for livestock and agriculture to its modern form as a sprawling celebration of culture, crafts, and fried food. Originating in Syracuse, New York, in 1841, fairs served as competitive venues for farmers and have since expanded to include everything from live music to elaborate butter sculptures. While entertainment and novelty foods are now major draws, the fairs' agricultural roots remain a core element, continuing to be a beloved and economically significant American tradition.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team secured the Bledisloe Cup for the 23rd consecutive year with a 33-24 victory over Australia at Auckland's Eden Park. The All Blacks started strong with an early 20-3 lead, but the Wallabies fought back to narrow the deficit to just three points at halftime. Despite a late push from Australia, a decisive try from New Zealand's Cam Roigard in the final minutes sealed the win. The victory also extends the All Blacks' remarkable unbeaten streak at Eden Park to 52 matches and places them at the top of the Rugby Championship standings.</p>

          <h2>King Charles's Architectural Principles Influence a New Generation of English Towns</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The architectural and urban planning philosophies long championed by King Charles are reportedly inspiring the design of 12 new towns soon to be announced by the UK government. These new developments will prioritize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" with traditional housing styles like terraces, avoiding high-rise buildings. This approach aligns with the King's own projects, such as Poundbury in Dorset, which emphasize community-focused design and local materials. The shift marks a move toward mainstream acceptance of ideas for which the King was once criticized by the architectural establishment.</p>

          <p>As Beijing prepares to host a global summit on women's rights in October, the Chinese government is emphasizing its advancements in gender equality. A foreign ministry spokesperson stated that China is an "active actor" in promoting the all-round development of women, citing significant progress in recent decades. The statement follows the recent publication of two books by President Xi Jinping, which include speeches on topics ranging from gender equality to traditional family values. While international officials are expected to attend the summit, domestic grassroots NGOs may not be invited unless sponsored by overseas organizations.</p>

          <p>The remains of two Scottish soldiers, Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan, who were killed in the Battle of Loos during World War I, have been identified over a century later. Their bodies were discovered among more than 100 others at a construction site in northern France in 2021. A specialist Ministry of Defence unit, known as the "war detectives," used historical records, personal artifacts like tramway buttons, and DNA analysis from living relatives to confirm their identities. The soldiers were recently laid to rest with full military honors, bringing long-awaited closure to their families.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused widespread devastation in Western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their critical role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communications down, pilots from commercial companies and civilian networks were among the first to witness the destruction and conduct rescue operations. They flew dozens of missions, rescuing stranded residents and air-dropping essential supplies like medicine and food, often coordinating with groups like the United Cajun Navy. Their efforts provided a vital lifeline to isolated communities before larger-scale relief operations could be established on the ground.</p>

          <p>This article explores the personal and professional challenges startup founders face when their businesses fail and how they manage to recover. Founders share their experiences dealing with the emotional toll of disappointing investors, laying off employees, and losing their sense of identity. The transition back to corporate life can also be difficult, with some recruiters exhibiting an "entrepreneurship penalty" against former business owners. Ultimately, many find that reframing success around a deep sense of purpose, rather than purely financial metrics, is key to building resilience and bouncing back from setbacks.</p>

          <p>To attract more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, China has been progressively relaxing its entry requirements, offering several ways to visit the mainland without a visa. Passport holders from 55 countries can now transit through major Chinese cities for up to 10 days without a visa. Additionally, a growing list of nationalities are permitted to stay for up to 30 days visa-free, with Russia being the latest country added to this list. These policies provide more accessible options for travelers by land, sea, or air, reducing the typically complex and costly visa application process.</p>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada highlights a stark contrast in financial support and its implications for the sport's future. England's team is fully professional, with 32 players on full-time contracts backed by millions in funding from the Rugby Football Union. In contrast, Canada's players are largely amateur, and their World Cup preparations were supplemented by a million-dollar fundraising drive. A victory for the underdog Canadian team could challenge the argument that full-time professionalism is essential for success, potentially influencing how other unions invest in the women's game.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is promoting a comprehensive youth migration deal with the European Union, arguing it would boost economic growth and improve the nation's public finances. The proposed scheme would allow individuals aged 18 to 30 to work in the UK for up to two years, and Reeves is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility to factor its positive economic impact into its forecasts. This move could potentially reduce the need for spending cuts or tax increases to address a fiscal gap. The proposal has drawn criticism from opponents who view it as a partial return to freedom of movement. (not investment advice)</p>
