          <p>New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge recently hit his 350th career home run, achieving the milestone faster than any other player in MLB history. He reached the mark in his 1,088th game, surpassing the previous record holder, Mark McGwire, who did it in 1,280 games. Despite the personal achievement, Judge expressed that a team victory would have made the moment better. The two-time AL MVP continues a dominant season, leading the league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs.</p>

          <p>China's private aerospace industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by technological advancements, reduced costs, and significant state support. The global space economy is projected to reach US$1.8 trillion by 2035, and Chinese companies like i-Space and LandSpace are becoming major players. These firms have achieved significant milestones, such as launching the first private rocket into orbit and developing the first methane-fueled launch vehicle. Hong Kong is positioned to play a crucial role in this expansion, contributing to China's ambitions in the burgeoning space sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision reflects a commitment to providing cultural events and fostering unity during a time of high anxiety for the local immigrant population. Performances are also being live-streamed for those who feel unsafe leaving their homes.</p>

          <p>China's government is strategically promoting the development of what it terms "future industries" to secure its position in the global technology race. These sectors, which include humanoid robots, 6G networks, brain-computer interfaces, and next-generation aircraft, are currently in early stages but are believed to have enormous growth potential. The initiative, first introduced by President Xi Jinping, represents a core part of China's new growth model. It focuses on achieving technological breakthroughs and industrial upgrades to drive the nation's economy forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Examining Why Boeing Discontinued Production of its C-17 Globemaster III Cargo Jet</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent reports of renewed interest, Boeing's iconic C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft was discontinued in 2015 primarily due to a lack of demand and defense budget cuts. The U.S. Air Force had completed its purchase order, and international orders were insufficient to keep the production line open. The C-17 was renowned for its massive cargo capacity and ability to land on short, undeveloped runways, making it a versatile military asset. Resuming production would be a major challenge, as the original Long Beach factory has been closed for years.</p>

          <p>Start-ups like Better Dairy in the UK are developing cheese using precision fermentation, a process that creates milk proteins like casein without involving animals. These companies aim to replicate the taste and texture of traditional dairy cheese, addressing the quality gap often found in plant-based alternatives. However, they face significant hurdles, including regulatory approval, high initial production costs, and a recent decline in the plant-based market. The success of lab-grown cheese will depend on its ability to win over consumers on taste, price, and health perceptions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting immigration officials from indiscriminately detaining people without reasonable suspicion. The ruling also bars officials from denying individuals access to legal counsel. The order stems from a lawsuit filed after several individuals, including U.S. citizens, were arrested at a bus stop. Judge Maame Frimpong stated there was a 'mountain of evidence' that officials were unconstitutionally basing arrests on factors like race or speaking Spanish.</p>

          <p>As China grapples with a declining population, some experts are exploring the role of artificial intelligence in reshaping societal norms around family and aging. With AI increasingly capable of providing emotional companionship and elderly care, it may reduce traditional incentives for marriage and childbearing. While some view this as a factor worsening the demographic decline, others argue it could redefine life and family structures. This technological shift presents a new, complex variable in the ongoing debate over China's population challenges.</p>
