          <p>China is spearheading the International Meridian Circle Programme (IMCP), aiming to construct a comprehensive space weather monitoring and warning network.

          <p>A Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait, following a close encounter between a Chinese fighter jet and a Japanese patrol plane.
