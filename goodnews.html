          <p>Shares of Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, China's largest drugmaker, increased following the announcement of its fifth drug-licensing deal this year, this time with an Indian partner. The agreement grants the Indian firm rights to develop and commercialize trastuzumab rezetecan, a newly approved cancer drug, in various global markets. This move is part of Hengrui's broader strategy to leverage international partnerships to accelerate the global reach of its research and development achievements. The deal includes an upfront payment of $18 million, with potential for over $1 billion more based on performance milestones.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated that he senses both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin are more open to peace negotiations than in previous encounters. Following a meeting at the United Nations, Lula is reviving a Brazil-China peace plan and emphasized that the UN should lead the process to regain its international authority. This diplomatic push follows a rare alignment in March when Brazil and China supported a U.S.-led ceasefire initiative at the Security Council. The original six-point plan focused on humanitarian access, prisoner exchanges, and civilian protection.</p>

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw a modest increase, highlighted by a successful debut for automaker Chery Automobile, whose shares jumped 11% in its IPO. In mainland China, the CSI 300 also advanced, while markets in South Korea and Japan saw slight gains. Investors are now looking ahead to U.S. weekly jobless claims data for further indications of the Federal Reserve's potential monetary policy direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, jumped 11% during their trading debut in Hong Kong after the company raised $1.2 billion in its initial public offering. The successful IPO reflects the automaker's accelerating expansion into key international markets, including Europe and the Middle East. Analysts note that Chery has been building its global presence by manufacturing in multiple countries, which helps mitigate risks from tariffs imposed by the U.S., Canada, and the EU on Chinese-made electric vehicles. This strategy positions Chery favorably compared to competitors focused solely on exporting from China.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the central tropical Atlantic and is expected to strengthen as it moves northwest. Currently, there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect, but the storm could have downstream impacts on the U.S. Southeast coast. The National Hurricane Center is also closely monitoring a second weather system in the northeast Caribbean. This system is likely to become a tropical depression later this week, potentially bringing heavy rains to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic before strengthening near the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot require states to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. The decision sided with 20 states that argued the policy unconstitutionally held critical emergency preparedness funding hostage to advance an anti-immigration agenda. The judge deemed the policy "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," stating that the potential loss of disaster funds would cause irreparable harm. This ruling represents a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to penalize so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's significant investment in OpenAI, potentially reaching $100 billion, will be structured with most of the funds used to lease Nvidia's own graphics processing units (GPUs) rather than for direct equity. This arrangement allows OpenAI to spread the high cost of computing power over time, reducing its upfront financial burden as it builds out massive AI data centers. While the deal provides OpenAI with capital, it also ensures a substantial, recurring revenue stream for Nvidia. The structure has raised some concerns among analysts about the circular nature of capital flow within the AI industry.</p>

          <p>Africa imported a record amount of Chinese-made solar panels in the first seven months of the year, signaling a rapid expansion of the continent's solar capacity. An Oxford Economics study revealed that 9,516 megawatts worth of panels were imported, a significant increase from the previous year, with South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria leading the surge. This growth is largely driven by the development of large-scale energy plants by Chinese firms, such as PowerChina's new facility in South Africa. The trend highlights China's dominant role in global solar technology production and its growing influence on Africa's energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have recalled rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki to their active roster in an effort to find reliable options for their struggling bullpen ahead of the playoffs. The team's relievers have posted a high 5.69 ERA in September, creating uncertainty in high-leverage situations. Sasaki, a 23-year-old Japanese phenom, is returning from a five-month shoulder injury absence after showing renewed velocity and effectiveness in recent minor-league relief appearances. Manager Dave Roberts indicated Sasaki will be thrown into important innings immediately to assess his readiness for a potential postseason role.</p>

          <p>Amid falling cranberry prices and rising operational costs, some Massachusetts farmers are participating in a state-funded program to restore their unproductive cranberry bogs into natural wetlands. The initiative, run by the Division of Ecological Restoration, pays farmers to undertake these projects, which help filter water, store carbon, and provide storm resilience. Over the past 15 years, the state has restored over 500 acres, with another 500 planned. This program offers an alternative for farmers, particularly those nearing retirement, allowing them to preserve their land ecologically while the public gains new areas for recreation.</p>

          <p>A jewelry store in San Ramon, California, which had been robbed previously, utilized advanced security measures to trap a group of armed robbers during a recent heist. As approximately 20-25 masked suspects were fleeing with an estimated $1 million in merchandise, the store's security door automatically closed, temporarily trapping them inside. Although the suspects eventually broke through the door, the delay aided law enforcement. Police, using helicopters and drones to track a getaway vehicle, have since arrested seven individuals. The store had previously used a GPS-tracked Rolex to catch thieves after a 2023 robbery.</p>

          <p>The return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the host's weeklong suspension attracted an estimated 6.26 million broadcast viewers, an audience about four times its season average. The episode, which addressed Kimmel's suspension over comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, also achieved its highest rating in the key 18-49 demographic since 2015. The high viewership came despite the show being preempted by ABC affiliates owned by Nexstar and Sinclair, which cover about 23% of the U.S. market. In his monologue, Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the activist's death.</p>

          <p>A research team has successfully designed and tested an exhaust system that significantly reduces the intense heat inside nuclear fusion reactors, a major obstacle to creating clean, limitless energy. The study, conducted at the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak-Upgrade facility in England, utilized a "Super-X divertor" with an extended design to cool the plasma before it contacts the reactor walls. This advancement in controlling plasma exhaust is a crucial step toward making fusion energy more practical and commercially viable. Nuclear fusion is a promising carbon-free energy source that does not produce long-lasting radioactive waste.</p>

Al-Sharaa declared that Syria is rejoining the international community after the collapse of the Assad family's 54-year dictatorship. He criticized recent Israeli military actions and urged the lifting of Western sanctions imposed during the Assad era to avoid shackling the Syrian people. The speech represents a significant moment for the nation as it navigates a new political landscape following a 14-year civil war and the ousting of Bashar Assad.</p>
