          <p>While China prepares for a massive military parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, some of its most cutting-edge weaponry will not be on display. The article details key assets of the People's Liberation Army, such as its next-generation stealth fighter jets, that will remain hidden from public view. These advanced systems are being kept secret either because they are still under development or are considered too strategically sensitive to be revealed.</p>

This semifinal will be a rematch of last year's US Open final, offering Pegula a chance for redemption on her home court.</p>

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law that would ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The proposed legislation is a response to growing concerns from parents, teachers, and health experts about the negative health impacts of these beverages on young people, which can include headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. The ban would apply to all points of sale, including shops, restaurants, and online retailers, with a 12-week consultation period now underway.</p>

          <p>A profile on Abbe Lowell highlights the career of the veteran Washington D.C. lawyer who is now at the center of the legal battle between Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and President Trump. Known for representing high-profile clients across the political spectrum, including Hunter Biden and Jared Kushner, Lowell has a long history of challenging what he views as government overreach. He is now leading the charge to prevent Cook's termination, which he argues is a politically motivated move by the administration.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Rules Google Can Keep Chrome Browser but Must Share Search Data</h2>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a U.S. District Judge decided against forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser but imposed other significant penalties to curb its monopoly power. The decision, stemming from a Department of Justice lawsuit, requires Google to end exclusive contracts that make it the default search engine on devices and to share some of its valuable search data with competitors. However, the judge stopped short of the DOJ's most severe demands, calling a forced divestiture of Chrome an "incredibly messy and highly risky" proposition for the market.</p>

          <p>Aircraft leasing firm Air Lease Corp. has agreed to a $7.4 billion deal to be taken private by a consortium of investors led by Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital. The acquisition, which values the company at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, marks a significant consolidation within the airplane-renting industry. The sector has been experiencing a boom, with a shortage of new aircraft driving rental rates to record highs for both new and older planes.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin saw a slight price increase on Tuesday, moving counter to a general downturn in the stock market, which was reacting negatively to concerns about the legality of President Trump's global tariffs. While the cryptocurrency reclaimed the $110,000 level, its performance was outshined by gold, which surged to a new all-time high. This divergence suggests that while some investors see crypto as a hedge, traditional safe-haven assets like gold remain dominant during periods of economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Howard Webb, the chief refereeing officer for the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has publicly stated that the decision to disallow a goal for Fulham during their recent match against Chelsea was a "misjudgement." The goal, scored by Josh King, was overturned after a lengthy VAR review identified a foul in the build-up. Webb acknowledged the call was incorrect and did not meet the high threshold required for a VAR intervention to overturn an on-field decision.</p>
