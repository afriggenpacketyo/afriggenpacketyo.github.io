        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant move to enhance its resource security, China announced the discovery of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year. These discoveries, which represent a 31% year-on-year increase, include substantial deposits of rubidium and gold, elements vital for telecommunications, electronics, and aerospace industries. The country has also ramped up investment in mineral exploration by over 50%, focusing on critical elements like tin, bauxite, and copper. This effort aligns with China's strategic goal to strengthen its national energy and mineral resource security amid a global race for these materials.</p>

          <p>In a major rescue operation, the Los Angeles Fire Department saved 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area. The incident occurred within the new Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a massive infrastructure project, when a section caved in several miles from the access point. All of the department's Urban Search and Rescue teams were deployed, and the workers were able to escape by climbing over a large pile of dirt without sustaining any visible injuries. The project is now on hold as Cal/OSHA investigates the cause of the collapse to ensure future safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked an executive order from President Trump that aimed to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The ruling came in a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which argues the order violates the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. This decision was made in accordance with new standards set by the Supreme Court regarding universal injunctions, though the White House has challenged its validity. The administration has seven days to appeal the ruling, which pauses a key part of the president's immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>Kenneth A. Bianchi, one of the two notorious "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by a California board. Now 74, Bianchi was convicted for his role in the murders of 12 women in Los Angeles and Washington state during the 1970s, crimes he committed with his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr. The two men impersonated police officers to lure, sexually assault, torture, and murder their victims before dumping their bodies on hillsides. After hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors, the parole board determined Bianchi remains a risk and will not be eligible for another hearing for 10 years.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Martian meteorite on Earth, with an expected price of up to $4 million. The 54-pound rock, which represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet, was discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023. Scientists believe an asteroid strike dislodged it from Mars, sending it on a 140-million-mile journey through space before it landed on Earth. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, accounting for only 0.6% of all meteorites found, making this a unique opportunity to own a significant piece of the red planet.</p>

          <p>In a stroke of incredible luck, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science discovered a dinosaur fossil while drilling a test bore under its own parking lot. The find, a hockey-puck-shaped vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur, was unearthed from a depth of over 750 feet. Museum officials described the discovery as "super rare," likening the odds to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon, as it's only the third such find in a bore hole sample globally. The fossil is believed to be from the late Cretaceous period, around 67.5 million years ago, making it Denver's deepest and oldest dinosaur discovery to date.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House on the same day his company became the first to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. The meeting's specific agenda was not disclosed, but it comes as Nvidia grapples with U.S. export controls on its advanced artificial intelligence chips, particularly to China. The Trump administration implemented these controls for national security reasons, effectively cutting off Nvidia's sales to the Chinese market and costing the company billions in planned orders. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance, attributing its rise to his tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris are operational again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds. Hundreds of locals and tourists gathered in the Montmartre district to celebrate the restoration, an event marked by a can-can performance from 60 dancers and a fireworks display. The original blades collapsed in April 2024 due to a mechanical failure, and while new aluminum sails were installed before the Olympics, they remained motionless pending a new motor. The return of the turning sails restores a key feature of the world-renowned Parisian landmark.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe suggests there is a formula for creating effective political slogans. After analyzing 20,000 campaign messages, he identified eight key words that resonate with voters across cultures: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. Bruni-Lowe describes these words as "emotional shortcuts" that serve as building blocks for memorable messages, citing examples like Bill Clinton's "Putting People First." While not a guarantee of success, he argues these words tap into universal voter sentiments, in contrast to more "bespoke" slogans like "Get Brexit Done," which are effective only for specific moments.</p>

          <p>Tesla is seeking to expand its Robotaxi service to Phoenix, Arizona, a key market currently dominated by its competitor, Waymo. The company has applied with the Arizona Department of Transportation for approval to test and operate its autonomous vehicles, both with and without human safety drivers. This move follows Tesla's initial Robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas, which has encountered some issues, including a minor accident and traffic violations captured on video. While Tesla was once seen as a self-driving pioneer, it is now playing catch-up to Waymo, which has operated a driverless service in Phoenix since 2020.</p>

          <p>In an interesting paradox, South Korea is experiencing a boom in its fertility clinic industry even as it struggles with the world's lowest birth rate. The number of fertility treatments has risen nearly 50% in recent years, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with their assistance. This trend is attributed to a generational shift where more people are delaying parenthood due to social and financial pressures, and then turning to medical help like IVF when they are ready. While the country's demographic crisis remains severe, the demand for fertility services offers a signal that some people are still trying to start families.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass has stated that the company is well-positioned to handle the impact of new U.S. tariffs due to its strong global presence. In a recent interview, she explained that 60% of the apparel maker's business is now international, and its direct exposure to manufacturing in China is minimal. The company has already factored the tariffs into its financial guidance and is working with its vendors and managing its own costs to avoid passing on price increases to consumers. This strategy appears to be working, as Levi's recently beat Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year guidance. (not investment advice)</p>
