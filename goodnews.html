          <h2>Research Suggests AI Has Changed the Method, Not the Frequency, of Student Cheating</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 06:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An education researcher analyzing student behavior argues that while generative AI has introduced new methods for academic dishonesty, it may not have significantly increased the overall rate of cheating, which was already high. The article cites studies showing that a large percentage of students engaged in cheating behaviors long before tools like ChatGPT became available. While some students use AI to complete entire assignments, many others use it for tasks like generating ideas or improving their writing, blurring the lines of what constitutes cheating. The situation calls for clearer school policies and a re-evaluation of educational methods in the age of AI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into ticket sales for the Oasis reunion tour, Ticketmaster has agreed to enhance its pricing transparency. The company will now provide fans with 24-hour advance notice of tiered pricing systems and more detailed price information while in online queues. The CMA had raised concerns that fans may have been misled by unclear pricing, although it found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing." These changes aim to ensure consumers are better informed about the total cost of tickets before purchasing them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is leveraging a campaign against FIFA's dynamic ticket pricing for the 2026 World Cup to connect with voters on his core platform of affordability. By petitioning for price caps and local ticket allotments, Mamdani is framing the issue as another example of corporate practices making life unaffordable for average New Yorkers. The article suggests this move represents a shrewd effort by the political left to re-engage with sports, a domain often utilized by conservative politicians to connect with the public. This tactic taps into the progressive-leaning soccer fanbase to highlight broader economic issues.</p>

          <h2>Premiership Rugby Explores Hosting a League Match at Chicago's Wrigley Field</h2>

          <p>England's Premiership Rugby is in discussions to stage a regular season league match at Wrigley Field in Chicago, the historic home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. This move would be a significant step in growing rugby union's profile in the United States, which is set to host the Rugby World Cup in 2031. The plan is linked to the league's title sponsor, Gallagher, a Chicago-based company that also has a commercial partnership with the Cubs. If it proceeds, this would be the first time a Premiership match has been played abroad since 2017, reflecting a broader strategy to attract American investment and viewership.</p>

          <h2>Historical 'Lavender Marriages' Reimagined on TikTok as Platonic Partnerships for Financial Stability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 05:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "lavender marriage," which historically referred to marriages of convenience for queer individuals to hide their orientation, is experiencing a resurgence on TikTok. Younger generations are reinterpreting it to describe platonic partnerships aimed at achieving financial stability, such as co-owning a home or sharing benefits, without the pressures of romantic or sexual expectations. While some view this trend as a practical response to modern economic challenges, critics argue it risks erasing the oppressive history behind the original term. The phenomenon reflects a broader cultural conversation about decoupling marriage from traditional romance and redefining partnership.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid thousands of annual traffic-related deaths involving pedestrians and cyclists, safety advocates are promoting the concept of "defensive walking and cycling." Key recommendations include being highly visible, especially at night, and remaining predictable in your movements to help drivers anticipate your actions. Experts advise using designated sidewalks and bike paths whenever possible and avoiding distractions like headphones or phones. It is also crucial to look in all directions, including behind you, before crossing an intersection, as turning vehicles pose a significant hazard. Ultimately, taking personal ownership of safety is vital, even when one has the right of way.</p>

He called for strengthening multilateral cooperation and friendly exchanges at all levels. The comments come as both Beijing and New Delhi are navigating separate and challenging trade negotiations with the United States, suggesting a potential shared interest in stabilizing other key international partnerships amid global economic pressures.</p>

          <p>British boxer Chantelle Cameron has been elevated from 'interim' to full WBC light-welterweight world champion. The move comes after the previous champion, Katie Taylor, informed the sanctioning body that she is taking time away from the sport and was subsequently named "champion in recess." Cameron famously handed Taylor her first professional defeat in 2023 before losing the rematch. The WBC has now ordered Cameron to make a mandatory defense of her new title against fellow British fighter Sandy Ryan, setting the stage for another high-profile domestic clash in the division.</p>
