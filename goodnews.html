          <h2>Germany Debates Economic Impact of Reintroducing Compulsory Military Service</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:46:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is considering the reintroduction of compulsory military service in response to growing security threats in Europe, a proposal championed by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. The plan would initially involve conscripting around 5,000 young adults annually, with the potential for expansion. However, the Confederation of German Employers' Associations has raised concerns that this could harm the economy by delaying young people's entry into the workforce. Economists are divided, with some arguing the impact would be minimal with small numbers, while others suggest it could exacerbate skilled labor shortages, though it might also provide vocational training.</p>

          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, largely due to the strong performance of its gaming division. The success of titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go! drove a 16% increase in revenue for its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming segment. This growth helped to counterbalance a 16% decline in the company's traditional consumer products segment, which has been struggling with softer demand and the impact of tariffs. Despite an overall net loss attributed to a goodwill impairment, the company raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in its gaming-led strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are officially reissuing "Buckingham Nicks," their 1973 duo album released before they joined Fleetwood Mac. After years of speculation and unavailability on modern formats, the album is being remastered from original analog tapes and will be released on vinyl and digital platforms. The announcement followed cryptic social media posts from the former bandmates, sparking excitement among fans. The reissue, handled by Rhino High Fidelity, will include new liner notes with recent interviews, finally making this cult-classic record widely accessible to the public for the first time in decades.</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of this year's Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish during Stage 17. The race concluded as expected with a bunch sprint after the day's breakaway was caught in the final kilometers. A crash in the wet, rainy conditions near the finish line took several of Milan's key rivals out of contention, clearing his path to victory. The win further solidifies Milan's lead in the points classification for the green jersey, while overall race leader Tadej Pogacar finished safely with the peloton, maintaining his significant lead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN's highest court, has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal obligation to protect other nations from the impacts of climate change. This non-binding but influential ruling clears a path for countries to sue one another for climate-related damages, including those from historical emissions. The decision is seen as a major victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly low-lying island states that initiated the case out of frustration with the lack of global action. The court affirmed that existing international laws, including the Paris Agreement, require countries to take ambitious climate action.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Develop Genetic Modification to Block Malaria Transmission in Mosquitoes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:02:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a method to make mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria by making a single, precise change to their genome using CRISPR gene-editing technology. The study, published in Nature, found that altering one amino acid in the FREP1 gene largely prevents the malaria parasite from completing its journey to the mosquito's salivary glands. Scientists believe this genetic tweak could be spread through a wild mosquito population using a gene drive, which forces the trait to be inherited by nearly all offspring. While the approach is still in early stages, it represents a promising new tool in the global fight against malaria.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has joined Spanish club Barcelona on a season-long loan, with an option for a permanent transfer. The 27-year-old England international, who has been with United since his youth, expressed his excitement about the move, calling Barcelona a "club where people's dreams come true." The transfer follows a difficult period for Rashford at his boyhood club, where he fell out of favor with manager Ruben Amorim and spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa. The move is expected to provide significant wage bill savings for Manchester United.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026 and will instead seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler, who was considered a potential challenger to incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul, stated his decision was based on the importance of maintaining the slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives. His competitive district is seen as critical for party control. The decision alters the landscape for the Republican gubernatorial primary, potentially clearing a path for other candidates like Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is also considering a run.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, its fifth-largest trading partner. The agreement sets a 15% tariff on Japanese imports, a lower rate than the 25% that was threatened, and specifically reduces the tariff on Japanese cars from 25% to 15%. In return, Japan has agreed to open its markets to certain U.S. agricultural products and will reportedly invest $550 billion in the United States. The deal was celebrated by leaders in both countries and caused a surge in the stock prices of major Japanese automakers like Toyota and Honda. (not investment advice)</p>
