          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts publicly defended the independence of the judiciary, criticizing attempts to impeach judges due to disagreements with their rulings. Speaking at an event in Buffalo, Roberts emphasized that impeachment is not a suitable response to judicial decisions, echoing his previous statements against political interference in the judiciary. His remarks follow similar comments from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who denounced attacks on judges and harassment that undermine the Constitution. Roberts' defense comes amid intense pressure on the Supreme Court regarding challenges to Trump administration policies and increased scrutiny of federal judges.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins testified that the USDA is actively recruiting to fill key positions after offering 15,000 employees deferred resignations. This program, aimed at downsizing the federal workforce, has faced scrutiny due to the immediate need to fill vacated roles. Rollins acknowledged potential mistakes but insisted that critical positions were not included in the second round of resignations. The agency is even open to rehiring some employees who accepted the offer, if they held key roles, to address staffing gaps.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted official pride flags to circumvent Republican-led state bans on flying unofficial flags on government property. Salt Lake City approved three new city flags featuring the city's sego lily design superimposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag. These measures respond to state laws restricting flag displays to official flags, and demonstrate support for LGBTQ+ rights amid conservative efforts to roll back such protections.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares increased as the Trump administration plans to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," which would have restricted exports of advanced AI chips. The Commerce Department stated that the rule was overly complex and would hinder American innovation. Nvidia welcomed the decision, anticipating an opportunity for the U.S. to lead the next industrial revolution. AMD's CEO also emphasized the need to balance national security with boosting the American chip industry. Nvidia's CEO previously expressed concerns about being locked out of the Chinese AI market.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration released 60,000 more pages of records related to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, following a previous release of 10,000 documents. The documents, digitized by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, include FBI investigation details, recordings of interviews with Sirhan Sirhan, and eyewitness accounts. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. supports the release, but it is unclear if the files contain significant new information. The release is part of a broader effort to declassify documents related to historical assassinations.</p>
