        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been withdrawn from a Republican reconciliation bill following significant bipartisan backlash. Spearheaded by Senator Mike Lee, the measure was intended to address housing affordability but faced opposition from fellow Republican senators and House members, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated he pulled the provision due to an inability to secure safeguards preventing the land from being sold to foreign interests. Conservation advocates celebrated the decision as a victory but remain vigilant against future attempts to privatize public lands.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has secured a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a U.S. ban over national security concerns. In a recent interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, with more details to be revealed in the coming weeks. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely. This development comes after Trump repeatedly delayed the enforcement of a law mandating TikTok's sale, a reversal from his earlier stance on the app.</p>
