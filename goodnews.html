          <p>Following President Trump's visit to the Persian Gulf, Gulf states are deepening ties with the US, signaling a shift in the region's geopolitical landscape. The multi-trillion-dollar deals signed during the visit indicate a deliberate pivot by Gulf states to redirect capital into US markets. This realignment poses risks for China, which has cultivated the Gulf as a critical partner for energy imports and infrastructure projects. Trump's move to lift sanctions on Syria also signals a strategic realignment, with Gulf states advocating for normalization with the Syrian government.</p>
