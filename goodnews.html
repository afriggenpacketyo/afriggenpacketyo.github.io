          <p>Chinese wind-power developer Envision Energy has commissioned the world's largest green hydrogen and ammonia plant in Chifeng, Inner Mongolia, marking a significant step in Beijing's decarbonization efforts. The first phase of the project is capable of producing 320,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually, with exports slated to begin in the fourth quarter of the year. Envision plans to scale up production to 1.5 million tonnes per year by 2028, underscoring China's ambition to dominate the burgeoning clean-fuel market. This initiative is heralded as a crucial blueprint for a clean energy future and achieving net-zero emissions.</p>

          <p>The BBC understands that there will be no immediate changes to Cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), despite widespread expectations that Chancellor Rachel Reeves would announce a reduction to the £20,000 tax-free allowance. The government's stated ambition remains to encourage greater investment in stocks and shares, and the Treasury plans to continue consultations with banks, building societies, and investment firms on future reform options. An ISA functions as a savings or investment product that offers tax-free returns, with the current annual allowance permitting up to £20,000 to be saved across various ISA products.

          <p>US career diplomat Julie Eadeh is reportedly the leading candidate to become the next consul general in Hong Kong, with her name already submitted for approval to Chinese authorities. Eadeh previously served as the political section chief at the US consulate in Hong Kong and Macau during the significant political turmoil and pro-democracy protests of 2019. Her potential appointment comes at a time of continued high tensions between Washington and Beijing over various issues, including trade and human rights. The article suggests this selection could signal a specific diplomatic approach by the United States in the strategically important region.</p>
