          <p>Tesla stock is aiming for a fourth consecutive positive session amid signs of cooling tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Musk announced a tentative launch date of June 22 for Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with the first driverless ride from the factory to a customer's house on June 28. Musk also expressed regret over recent social media posts about Trump, indicating a potential shift in their relationship. Investors are viewing the robotaxi announcement as a positive sign for Tesla's future strategy.</p>

          <p>Following the ousting of the Assad regime in Syria, neighboring states have stepped in to offer aid and assistance, each with their own motivations.

Gulf states aim to strengthen their political, security, and economic ties with Damascus, addressing issues like drug trafficking and counterterrorism, and filling the geopolitical power vacuum. The U.S. may take on a larger role to counter Russian influence and potentially foster Syrian-Israeli detente.</p>

          <p>A LendingTree survey indicates that about one in four parents have authorized children under 18, even toddlers, on their credit or debit cards to help them establish a credit rating early. Financial advisor Winnie Sun notes that many banks allow children to be authorized users with a Social Security number. Parents like Shannon Ho are using this strategy to teach their children the value of money. Experts advise paying bills in full and on time and monitoring for unapproved purchases to ensure a positive credit history.</p>

          <p>With inflation remaining high and credit card interest rates exceeding 20%, many cardholders are exploring debt forgiveness options. To qualify by July, cardholders should understand the eligibility criteria, such as having a balance between $5,000 to $10,000 and demonstrating financial hardship. Shopping around for servicers and gathering necessary documentation in advance are also crucial steps. Credit card debt forgiveness programs can potentially cut balances by 30% to 50%, providing a financial lifeline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an extra ¬£29bn per year for the NHS in England, along with funding increases for defense and housing, in the UK's spending review. The review also includes more money for artificial intelligence and transport projects, with the aim of "renewing Britain." However, some departments, such as the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face day-to-day spending cuts. The government hopes increased spending in health and long-term investments will reassure voters, though many departments will grapple with frugal allocations.</p>

          <p>A review of the live-action remake of "How to Train Your Dragon" finds it lacking some of the original's magic. The film, directed by Dean DeBlois, largely repeats the plot of the animated original, focusing on the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless. While the message of empathy and questioning assumptions remains relevant, the remake is considered longer and less impactful. The reviewer notes that the transformation into a photo-realistic style diminishes the charm of the characters.</p>

          <p>Rachel Reeves's key decision in the UK Spending Review is to prioritize long-term investment over day-to-day spending, directing funds to regions outside London and focusing on health. The strategy aims to address years of under-investment, with the benefits of these investments not expected to materialize immediately. The extra capital spending arises from technical changes made to borrowing rules, enabling longer-term strategic reprioritizations. This approach emphasizes sustainable growth over short-term gains.</p>
