          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, is set to win parliamentary elections, a crucial step for the country's path to the EU. Sandu had previously warned of "massive Russian interference," with bomb scares reported at polling stations and arrests made for plotting unrest. Despite claims of victory by pro-Russian opposition leaders and alleged efforts to spread disinformation and buy votes, PAS is expected to secure a new majority in parliament. This article underscores Moldova's ongoing struggle with regional tensions, economic issues, and corruption in the context of its European aspirations.</p>

          <p>Shaun Murphy secured his first British Open snooker title by defeating Anthony McGill 10-7 in a captivating final match. The 2005 world champion delivered eight breaks of 50-plus, overcoming a determined challenge from Scotland's McGill, who was playing in his first final in eight years. Murphy took the lead in the evening session and, despite McGill's resilient response, won four consecutive frames to clinch his first ranking title in 26 months. Murphy expressed gratitude for the opportunity and a strong desire to regain consistent top-level performance in future tournaments.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw concluded his illustrious 18-year regular-season career with a dominant performance, securing his 3,052nd career strikeout and completing 5 ⅓ scoreless innings. The Dodgers' 6-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners marked a fitting end to a career where he achieved the best ERA among starting pitchers with 1,000 innings in the live ball era. Manager Dave Roberts confirmed Kershaw would not be on the Wild Card series roster, but could potentially return for the National League Division Series if the team advances.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are preparing to host the Cincinnati Reds in the National League Wild Card series, with manager Dave Roberts expressing confidence despite the upcoming challenge. The Reds secured their playoff spot on the final day of the season, fueled by a strong late-season surge under veteran manager Terry Francona. Key concerns for the Dodgers include the Reds' talented young pitching staff, notably Hunter Greene, and the dynamic offensive threat posed by Elly De La Cruz. Additionally, former Dodger Gavin Lux will be playing against his old team in a utility role for Cincinnati during the postseason matchup.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Chinese author Yan Lianke, now 67, expresses indifference to ongoing speculation about his contention for the Nobel Prize in Literature, stating that such accolades no longer exert pressure on his writing. He emphasizes that literature is not a science, allowing for diverse interpretations where "benevolent people see benevolence and wise people perceive wisdom." Lianke advocates for broad literary freedom, asserting that any human experience is valid for artistic exploration and rejecting the notion that some experiences are inherently nobler or more deserving. This article provides a unique insight into his profound philosophy on literature and its societal role.</p>
