          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to buy TikTok, with an announcement possible within two weeks. The statement comes as the deadline for Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations approaches, following a 2024 law passed due to national security concerns. Trump, who previously extended the divestiture deadline, has expressed a desire to keep the popular social media platform operational under new, American ownership. Any potential sale would likely require approval from the Chinese government in Beijing.</p>

          <p>Markus S√∂der, Bavaria‚Äôs state premier and leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), has advocated for a significant enhancement of Germany's defense capabilities. He proposed acquiring 100,000 drones, new missile systems, and creating a German version of Israel's "Iron Dome" defense shield with 2,000 Patriot missiles. S√∂der's call for a major military expansion also includes hundreds of new tanks, fighter jets, and cruise missiles, emphasizing the need for Germany to achieve deterrence capabilities.

          <p>China has reopened its market to most Japanese seafood, lifting a nearly two-year-old ban that was imposed in response to the release of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The prohibition, which was a major blow to Japan's fishing industry, will remain in place for seafood originating from ten prefectures, including Fukushima. Japanese officials have maintained that the discharged water is safe and meets international standards, a position contested by Beijing. Japanese exporters will now need to reapply for registration and meet new certification requirements to access the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large technology companies just one day before the first payments were due. The reversal came after President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade talks with Canada in response to the tax, which would have retroactively applied a 3% levy on firms like Google and Amazon. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the move would support a resumption of negotiations for a new economic and security relationship. The U.S. had argued the tax was discriminatory and "patently unfair." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A revised UK-US trade deal came into effect Monday, reducing a 25% tariff on British cars to 10% and prompting a surge in vehicle shipments from brands like Aston Martin and Range Rover. While the auto industry welcomes the relief, the deal has drawn criticism from British farmers who feel their sector was used as a bargaining chip. Concessions included new tariff-free quotas for beef but also the removal of a UK tariff on American ethanol, which farmers fear could harm the domestic biofuel industry. The deal's fine print, particularly regarding steel tariffs, remains a point of contention. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and new research suggests why. Studies indicate that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, can be a primary cause. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power, results in a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness and discomfort in passengers. Researchers are now exploring solutions, such as emitting specific tones, to counteract the physical sensations that lead to this modern form of travel sickness.</p>

Other highlights included Alanis Morissette's sunset performance, The Prodigy's poignant return, and numerous celebrity sightings.
