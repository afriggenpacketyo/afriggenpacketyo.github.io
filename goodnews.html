          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is requesting an apology from the Football Association after being banned for questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a friendly match. Vaughan raised concerns about fairness and safety with the referee, leading to a six-match ban that sparked protests. An FA appeal board later deemed the initial hearing unfair, quashing the ruling; the case was dropped when the complainant withdrew. Vaughan says the incident has significantly impacted her life, causing stress and disruption, and believes the FA put her through unnecessary turmoil.</p>

          <p>Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google after it changed the label for the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following a U.S. presidential order. President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the lawsuit after previously threatening legal action, arguing that the name change affects Mexico's continental shelf. Google's policy is to follow local official names, but in the U.S., it uses 'Gulf of America.' The Mexican president shared a response from Google's vice president of government affairs and public policy, Cris Turner, who said the company would not change its policy after Trump's order.</p>

In the ninth, a series of hits brought the Dodgers within one run before Ohtani's decisive homer.

Shoppers like Deborah Grushkin rushed to make purchases before the deadline, while others worry about the impact on affordable goods.
