          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its 10th test flight after previous failures and delays, with initial stages appearing to proceed smoothly. The Super Heavy booster performed a controlled splashdown, and the Starship upper stage reached engine cutoff as planned, heading for an Indian Ocean splashdown. This flight aimed to test satellite deployment and engine reignition, crucial for future operational missions to launch Starlink satellites and eventually transport settlers to Mars. Despite this progress, concerns persist among experts regarding the timeline for a modified Starship to serve as NASA's moon lander by 2027, given the complex refueling and landing challenges.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel announced its decision to revert to its classic "Old Timer" logo and traditional aesthetic, abandoning a recent modern redesign that sparked significant public controversy. The company stated it listened to customer feedback, including comments from former President Donald Trump, who publicly urged the change. This reversal comes after new restaurant remodels featuring a simplified, text-only logo were met with swift criticism, with many questioning a departure from the brand's established country store roots. The company's CEO had previously defended the redesign, citing positive internal feedback, but the widespread customer response ultimately led to the change.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship megarocket successfully completed its 10th test flight, lifting off from Texas after two prior scrubs, marking a significant step after a series of explosive failures. This flight focused on gathering performance data for future profiles, with the Super Heavy booster splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico as planned, and the upper stage deploying dummy satellites before its Indian Ocean splashdown. The "fail fast, learn fast" development approach, though capital-intensive, aims to rapidly refine the vehicle for Elon Musk's long-term visions of Mars colonization and NASA's lunar missions. However, challenges like orbital refueling and developing a fully reusable heat shield remain critical hurdles for the program's ambitious timelines.</p>

          <h2>PM Modi Urges "Make and Spend in India" as US Tariffs Take Effect</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 19:37:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is advocating for self-reliance, urging citizens to "make in India and spend in India" as the Trump administration's 50% tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. kick in. Modi's message aims to counter the economic blow to export-driven industries by promoting domestic production and consumption. His government is also planning an overhaul of India's indirect tax system, including a simplification of the Goods & Service Tax (GST), to boost private consumption. These fiscal stimulus measures are expected to provide a meaningful push to the economy, supporting growth and potentially lowering inflation amidst global geopolitical tensions and tariff-related headwinds.
