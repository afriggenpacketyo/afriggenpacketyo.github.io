          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region demonstrated varied results, breaking from the positive momentum seen on Wall Street. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 experienced a decline after data revealed a slower rise in Tokyo's core consumer prices, though the figure still surpassed the Bank of Japan's target. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains, and mainland China's CSI 300 also edged higher. Investors are also anticipating the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, where India's Prime Minister Modi and China's President Xi are scheduled to meet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in seven years, signaling a potential thaw in relations strained since the 2020 border clashes. While deep-seated suspicion remains, shared economic pressures from U.S. tariffs are pushing the two nations toward cautious cooperation. Key issues include India's significant trade deficit with China and its reliance on Chinese supplies for critical industries like pharmaceuticals and electric vehicles. Experts believe the summit is unlikely to resolve major disputes but could establish common ground for future engagement.</p>

Jones explained that the trade, which brought Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two future first-round picks to Dallas, addresses the team's long-standing weakness in stopping the run. He confirmed that contract negotiations with Parsons had stalled after the Cowboys made a significant offer. Jones emphasized that the move was a consensus decision within the organization aimed at building a more balanced and competitive roster.</p>

          <p>Researchers are analyzing the DNA of the Druids Oak, an 800-year-old tree in Buckinghamshire, to understand the genetic basis for its remarkable resilience and longevity. The project, led by The Woodland Trust, aims to identify genes that allow ancient oaks to survive for centuries, enduring climate change, disease, and extreme weather. Scientists hope this knowledge will help in selecting the most robust trees for future planting, aiding in the restoration of Britain's woodlands. Oaks are a keystone species, supporting over 2,300 other forms of life, making their preservation crucial for biodiversity.</p>

          <p>Beginning in January 2026, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine through the National Health Service. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, parents had to pay privately for the vaccine. Health officials hope the program will protect children from the rare but severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact caused by parents taking time off work to care for sick children, which is estimated to cost £24 million annually.</p>
