          <p>The European Parliament, known for its strong stance against China on issues like human rights and trade, is attempting to normalize relations with Beijing after a period of estrangement. President Roberta Metsola has initiated this reset, aiming to re-establish constructive dialogue between the European Parliament and the National People‚Äôs Congress. This shift is evidenced by previously unseen correspondence and conversations with parliament insiders, revealing an unexpected thaw in relations. Metsola expressed optimism about revitalizing legislative discussions, marking a significant step toward improved parliamentary relations despite some internal reservations. The move signals a potential shift in the EU's approach to engaging with China on various global issues. Optimism surrounding this shift will be contingent on China's responsiveness and demonstrated commitment to addressing concerns raised by the European Parliament. The tone of this article is relatively neutral, focusing on the factual aspects of the diplomatic shift. </p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, advocating for international collaboration on trade despite rising tariffs and global barriers. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and urged against politicizing trade or using it for security concerns. Li called for reshaping international rules and order through engagement in the international economy, advocating for countries to keep to the "right" path. Columbia University professor Adam Tooze noted the "interesting" comment on reshaping rules, suggesting a pluralization of the global order. The premier's remarks come at a time of heightened tensions, including those between the U.S. and China, and the Israel-Iran conflict. The general sentiment is that China is trying to assert itself as a global economic leader and advocate for cooperation. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers have reached a tentative agreement on a $321 billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing housing reform proposals. The deal aims to address a $12 billion budget deficit through borrowing, tapping reserves, and shifting funds. The budget reflects resistance to Newsom's proposed cuts, with lawmakers prioritizing compassion and fiscal responsibility amid uncertainty about the state's financial problems. The agreement includes a housing caveat, requiring CEQA exemptions for building projects, and adjustments to Medi-Cal funding, including premium requirements for undocumented immigrants. This budget deal is expected to be a precursor to more challenging financial discussions in the coming months. </p>

This isn't the first time the siblings have been on opposing sides politically; Ms. Bracy Davis endorsed a family friend over her brother in a previous election.

          <p>Michael Conforto had a strong performance in the Dodgers' 9-7 win against the Rockies, going two for five with a double and a three-run home run. This was his first multi-hit game since late May and his first with multiple extra-base hits since mid-May, raising questions about whether this is a turning point for him. Despite his struggles this season, the Dodgers have remained optimistic about Conforto's potential, and this performance could impact the team's roster construction for the second half of the season. Conforto's success against fastballs in this game suggests a possible return to form. This performance is a positive sign for Conforto and the Dodgers, potentially reducing the need to seek a replacement at the trade deadline. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is actively promoting the use of the yuan by foreign institutions, capitalizing on a perceived decline in international confidence in the U.S. dollar. These efforts include establishing a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Beijing is also expanding the range of tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and considering allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan. Despite these efforts, some experts argue that China needs to address concerns about capital controls and geopolitical risks to become a more dependable alternative to the U.S. dollar. While the yuan's global usage remains low, China's ongoing efforts signal a long-term strategy to challenge the dollar's dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing Democrat, has conceded victory to Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant political upset. Cuomo, the former governor, was attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. Mamdani's victory indicates a potential shift in the Democratic Party's direction. The results showed Mamdani with a commanding lead, although he fell short of the 50% threshold needed to win outright, making Cuomo's concession unexpected. The former governor's loss marks the "biggest upset in modern NYC history", demonstrating a desire among New York Democrats for leaders who fight with enthusiasm and courage. </p>

          <p>A US district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The judge granted a partial injunction, ruling that the states‚Äô lawsuit would likely succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration as part of the national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program. The Government Accountability Office previously found that the Trump administration violated the law when it withheld the funding. During his campaign, Donald Trump voiced opposition to electric vehicles. </p>

Bragg defeated Patrick Timmins to advance to November's general election. Bragg's tenure has been marked by high-profile cases and scrutiny over his policies. His campaign emphasized efforts to fight gun violence, help sexual assault survivors, prosecute hate crimes, and go after bad landlords. The office is currently involved in several high-profile cases, including the UnitedHealthcare CEO killing suspect Luigi Mangione and the retrial of Harvey Weinstein on sexual assault charges. </p>
