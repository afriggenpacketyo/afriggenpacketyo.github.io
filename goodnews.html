Commander Dominic Murphy of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command described the investigation as "very complex and fast-moving."

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people in the Americas from modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. Researchers found that early settlers split into distinct groups, isolated by natural barriers like the Amazon rainforest and Andes Mountains. The findings provide insights into the genetic makeup and health vulnerabilities of modern Indigenous groups, emphasizing the importance of preserving their cultural heritage.</p>
