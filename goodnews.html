          <p>Two years after initiating a contentious divorce, former 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' star Kim Zolciak and her estranged husband, Kroy Biermann, are rebuilding their lives separately. Biermann, a former NFL player, has transitioned to a new career in crane and rigging sales. Meanwhile, Zolciak has moved into a new home, launched two new TV shows, and has reportedly reconnected with her parents after years of estrangement. The updates suggest a move towards personal stability for both individuals following a period of public accusations and legal battles.</p>

          <p>China has identified a super-large zirconium deposit, estimated at 2 million tonnes, which quintuples the nation's current reserves of the critical mineral. The discovery, located in a terrestrial basin, is a significant strategic gain, as zirconium alloys are essential for advanced aerospace and military applications. These alloys are prized for their extreme heat and corrosion resistance, making them crucial components in hypersonic technology, including scramjet combustion chambers and vehicle nose cones. This find could resolve a key resource dependency for China's rapidly advancing hypersonics race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern over President Trump's threatened tariffs, U.S. stock markets like the S&P 500 have surged to record highs, creating a puzzling economic picture. This resilience is attributed to a strong labor market, better-than-feared corporate earnings, and a market belief that the administration's final tariff actions will be less severe than initial threats. However, some analysts remain cautious, pointing to the potential for slower growth, the impact on small businesses, and ongoing trade disputes with major partners like China and the EU. The market's optimism is high, but risks of a future downturn persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The selection of Stockholm, Sweden, as the venue for the third round of high-stakes trade talks between the United States and China highlights a strategic shift in their diplomatic approach. Unlike previous negotiations, recent talks have been held in neutral European countries, including Switzerland and the UK, suggesting a move towards a more level playing field. According to a Swedish government official, the choice of Sweden reflects the country's international reputation for fostering dialogue and cooperation. This neutral-ground strategy contrasts with the direct, often bilateral, meetings that characterized negotiations during the first Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering changes to planning and licensing rules in England and Wales to better protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints. The proposed reforms would require developers building new homes near existing venues to include soundproofing and would also fast-track permissions for new businesses and outdoor dining areas. These changes aim to reverse the decline in the pub industry, which has seen hundreds of closures annually due to economic pressures. While Labour supports the move to bring "vibrancy" to towns, the Conservatives argue that tax policies are the primary cause of the industry's struggles.</p>

          <p>Ghana's President John Mahama has introduced a new economic policy aimed at transforming the nation into a self-sufficient, 24-hour economy. The plan involves encouraging key industries like agriculture and manufacturing to operate in three eight-hour shifts daily, keeping the economy running around the clock. The government hopes this initiative will create up to 1.7 million new jobs and reduce unemployment by 5% by the end of the decade. However, economists express concern over the feasibility of the project, citing the need for significant funding, infrastructure improvements like a stable power supply, and buy-in from the private sector.</p>

Nauzhae Drake, 26, welcomed her first child in 2019, followed by subsequent children in 2021, 2022, and most recently, 2025, all on the same day. None of the births were induced, and none were on their original due date, making the event statistically extraordinary.
