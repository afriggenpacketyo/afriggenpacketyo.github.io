        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan, marking a significant step toward ending the two-year conflict. The agreement entails the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, along with the withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed-upon line. In response, the Israel Defense Forces stated they have begun operational preparations to implement the ceasefire and adjust their deployment in Gaza. This development follows days of intense, indirect negotiations held in Egypt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ceasefire and hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas is being viewed as a major diplomatic breakthrough, largely attributed to direct pressure from Donald Trump on both parties. While the deal marks a significant step, this analysis notes that crucial details for a lasting peace, such as the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza, are yet to be resolved. The agreement's first phase focuses on returning hostages and withdrawing troops, but the war is not officially over. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces political hurdles from ultranationalist coalition partners who oppose the deal.</p>

          <p>China has successfully switched on a groundbreaking thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, the first in the world to use a dual-tower design feeding a single turbine. The plant utilizes nearly 27,000 mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two 200-meter towers, heating molten salt to generate steam. This innovative system allows the plant to continue producing electricity even after sunset or on cloudy days. According to state media, the dual-tower configuration is approximately 25% more efficient than conventional single-tower designs.</p>

          <p>Citigroup's venture capital arm, Citi Ventures, has made an investment in BVNK, a company specializing in stablecoin payment infrastructure. This move highlights the increasing interest of major U.S. banks in cryptocurrency and digital assets for facilitating global transactions. Stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currencies, are seen as a key tool for faster and cheaper cross-border payments. The investment comes as the U.S. provides greater regulatory clarity for the stablecoin market through legislation like the GENIUS Act. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The initial phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan between Israel and Hamas focuses on the release of all hostages in exchange for a significant number of Palestinian prisoners. The agreement also requires an Israeli military withdrawal to a pre-determined line, expected to occur within 24 hours of formal approval by Israel's government. While this marks a major step, the article notes that critical long-term issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza, remain unresolved in this first stage.</p>

A U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team was called in, determined the device was safe to transport, and moved it off-site for deactivation, allowing port operations to resume.</p>

By applying intense pressure on both sides and leveraging his relationships with regional leaders in Qatar and Turkey, Trump successfully forced concessions that had eluded previous negotiation efforts. The article suggests that if this high-stakes, personality-driven diplomatic approach ultimately ends the war, it could signal a new and more interventionist strategy for addressing the region's broader conflicts.</p>
