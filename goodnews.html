          <h2>Trump Urges Fed to Lower Rates Following Positive Jobs Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 09:12:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed his call for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates after a strong April jobs report, arguing that there is no inflation and lower rates would benefit consumers. This continues Trump's pattern of attempting to influence the central bank, despite its intended independence. While he has previously criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump has recently scaled back these criticisms, though he still believes he knows more about interest rates. The president's renewed call comes as the Fed navigates economic growth amid trade tensions and global economic uncertainties.</p>

          <h2>April Jobs Report Exceeds Expectations Despite Tariff Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing expectations despite concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on trade. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, indicating a stable labor market, and the labor force participation rate edged higher. Health care and transportation sectors led job creation, while the federal government saw a slight decline in employment. Economists suggest it is too early for the tariff impacts to be fully reflected in the jobs data, but they will be closely monitoring future reports.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's decision to freeze federal funding to Harvard University, dozens of Harvard professors have pledged to take a temporary pay cut. This collective action aims to support the university as it contests the administration's actions, which include rescinding Harvard's tax-exempt status. The professors' donations are intended to help protect the university's financial resources and support staff and students who may be affected by the funding cuts. Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, asserting that the funding freeze is unlawful.</p>

          <p>Apple has approved Spotify's U.S. app update, enabling users to access pricing information, purchase subscriptions, and select payment options within the app, ending a long-standing restriction.

Spotify users can now see pricing details and choose payment methods other than Apple's system, according to a blog post. Apple plans to appeal the court's decision, while Spotify celebrates this milestone for developers seeking a more level playing field.</p>

          <p>Roche has partnered with Zealand Pharma in a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize Zealand's petrelintide amylin analog for obesity treatment.
