        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares experienced a decline of nearly 8% after the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer reported a 30% slump in second-quarter profit due to an aggressive price war within China's EV market. Despite overseas sales growth, BYD's profitability suffered from increased price competition and excessive marketing, as noted in its mid-year earnings filing. Retail car prices in China have decreased by approximately 19% over the past two years. Chinese authorities have warned against unfair competition and BYD's first-half net profit rose by 14%, with revenue climbing 23%. (not investment advice) The company is expanding globally amid domestic competition, opening showrooms in Europe and offering competitive prices. Optimism surrounding the company's future growth and international expansion remains cautiously optimistic.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey indicates that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly grew in August, driven by a recovery in new orders and export business, aided by a trade-war truce with the U.S. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) reached 50.5, exceeding estimates and signaling the fastest expansion since March. This improvement was partially attributed to a recovery in new export orders, suggesting resilience in external demand. However, gains in overall output and new orders were more muted, indicating limited improvement in domestic demand. While overall business confidence improved, employment in the manufacturing sector remained bleak, reflecting caution among business owners.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee, led by the GOP, has withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify before the panel. A committee spokesperson cited Mueller's health issues as the reason, stating that he is unable to testify. Chairman James Comer had subpoenaed Mueller as part of the committee's investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files. Mueller's family revealed that he has been battling Parkinson's disease, preventing him from appearing before Congress. The committee initially sought Mueller's testimony due to his role as FBI director during the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>Gavin Newsom has arranged security for Kamala Harris after Donald Trump revoked her extended Secret Service protection. Trump's decision came shortly before Harris was set to begin a 15-date book tour. Newsom, seen by many as a leader against Trump's policies, has ordered the California Highway Patrol (CHP) to take over Harris's protection. The CHP and LAPD will provide Harris with the level of security typically afforded to dignitaries like the Governor. This move is viewed as an effort by Newsom to diminish Trump's actions and ensure Harris's safety.</p>

Despite no specific threats, the police presence will be the largest of the year, exceeding that of New Year's Eve and July Fourth celebrations. The annual event celebrates Caribbean culture with vibrant costumes, flags, and music, attracting hundreds of thousands of attendees and local politicians.

          <p>The U.S. labor force has seen a decline of over 1.2 million immigrants, including both legal residents and those in the country illegally, according to preliminary Census Bureau data. This decline coincides with the first drop in the overall immigrant population after reaching a high of 14 million in 2023. Experts suggest President Trump's immigration policies may be contributing to the loss of immigrant workers, who comprise almost 20% of the U.S. workforce. The impact is felt across various sectors, including farming, construction, and healthcare, with potential consequences for job growth and service provision. Some farms are experiencing labor shortages, leading to crop waste.</p>

          <p>A report commissioned by the Australian government examines the feasibility of implementing a social media ban for individuals under 16, set to take effect in December. The report assesses various age verification technologies, including formal identification, parental approval, and facial assessment. While all methods are technically possible, none are foolproof and each has risks. Verification using identity documents is the most accurate but raises data privacy concerns. Facial assessment technology has accuracy limitations, especially around the age of 16. The government insists that social media platforms implement age assurance methods, and there are concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification technology.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares experienced a significant surge of up to 18.84% due to better-than-expected bottom-line results in the June quarter. This growth was driven by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit and the ongoing revival of its e-commerce business. While revenue missed estimates, net income rose 78%, attributed to equity investment gains and the disposal of Trendyol. Excluding investment gains, net income would have decreased 18% due to investments in China's instant commerce space. Investors are focused on Alibaba's AI investments, with the cloud unit experiencing accelerated revenue growth and AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth.
