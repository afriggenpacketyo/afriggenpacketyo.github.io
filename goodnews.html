          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating two recent air traffic control outages, one in Colorado and another in Philadelphia affecting Newark airport, that raised safety concerns and caused flight delays. The Colorado outage impacted communications with some pilots, while the Philadelphia facility experienced two radar outages. While officials downplayed the safety risks, these incidents, coupled with construction and understaffing at Newark, have prompted discussions about limiting flights at the airport for the remainder of the year to minimize disruptions. The FAA is working with telecommunications providers to upgrade infrastructure and prevent future failures. </p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned investors that the retail giant will likely increase prices on various items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reduction in duties on Chinese imports. The company aims to absorb some costs but expects shoppers to see increases by the end of May and in June, with more markups predicted for the fiscal second quarter. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted that tariffs on goods from countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia, particularly on items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses, are contributing to the price pressure. The company is exploring alternative materials and sourcing strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ideal timeline for investing in gold is not based on a specific schedule but rather on its role as a portfolio component. Experts advise that gold should constitute no more than 10% of an investment portfolio as a hedge against inflation. The frequency of investment depends on how quickly one aims to reach this threshold, considering that waiting for a price dip may be futile. For those already invested, rebalancing the portfolio after selling gold for profit may require a strategy for rebuilding the gold portion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Doctors have successfully treated a baby with a rare genetic disorder using a gene-editing therapy specifically designed to repair his unique mutation. The treatment involved infusions containing microscopic gene-editors targeting a mutation in the baby's liver. While long-term results are pending, the therapy appears to have partially reversed the condition, reducing the risk of brain damage. This breakthrough demonstrates the potential for personalized medicine in treating rare diseases. </p>
