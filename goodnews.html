          <p>Thirty-one workers were successfully rescued after being trapped in a municipal wastewater tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred in an 18-foot diameter tunnel, part of a long-term infrastructure project, when a section of it gave way. The trapped workers were able to climb over a large pile of loose soil to meet colleagues on the other side, who then shuttled them over five miles to the single access point. Over 100 first responders managed the complex operation, and all workers were evaluated by paramedics upon exiting with no visible injuries reported, bringing a fortunate conclusion to a highly dangerous situation.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat persistent labor market pressures and sluggish economic growth, China's State Council has announced a new targeted subsidy for employers. Companies and social organizations will receive a one-time payment of up to 1,500 yuan for each unemployed person between the ages of 16 and 24 that they hire. To qualify, employers must provide a formal contract and make social insurance contributions for at least three months. This measure, funded by unemployment insurance reserves, is part of a broader government push to stabilize employment and support household incomes.</p>

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the North American cereal company, surged over 50% following reports that it is in advanced takeover talks with Italian confectionery giant Ferrero. A potential deal, valued at approximately $3 billion, could be announced as soon as this week. The acquisition would give Ferrero, owner of brands like Nutella and TicTac, a dominant position in the U.S. breakfast cereal market. WK Kellogg, which was spun off from its parent company Kellanova in 2023, has faced financial struggles and significant debt as consumer preferences shift toward healthier food options.

          <h2>South Korea's Central Bank Holds Interest Rates Steady Amid Housing Market Concerns</h2>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 2.5%, pausing to evaluate the effectiveness of recent government measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% year-over-year in June, prompting authorities to tighten mortgage lending to curb rapidly expanding household debt. While the broader economy has shown signs of weakness, the central bank is prioritizing financial stability due to the risks associated with the housing bubble. Analysts anticipate that rate cuts may resume later in the year if the cooling measures prove successful. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of thirteen brown pelicans, who survived a severe toxic algal bloom, were released back into the wild at Huntington Beach. The bloom, the deadliest since 2015, poisoned numerous marine animals with domoic acid, causing seizures and abnormal behavior. The birds were treated and rehabilitated at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center before their release, which was attended by community members. This event marks a moment of hope after a difficult period for local marine wildlife, which also saw many sea lions sickened by the same widespread and unusually intense toxic bloom.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, stating that the country must be able to defend itself against intense Russian attacks. This decision reverses a recently confirmed pause on some weapons shipments, which the White House had attributed to a broader review of global military aid and stockpile levels. The president expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians. The Pentagon confirmed it is sending additional defensive arms at the president's direction to ensure Ukraine can defend itself while the U.S. works toward a lasting peace.</p>
