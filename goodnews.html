          <p>Following a poor start to the season that left the club in 19th place, West Ham United has sacked manager Graham Potter after just eight months. The club announced that former Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo is set to take over, with the appointment expected before their next match. Potter acknowledged that the team's results had not met expectations, prompting the change in leadership. This move comes as the club seeks to reverse its fortunes and improve its standing in the Premier League table under new management.</p>

          <p>Charles Tillman, a former NFL star, revealed he resigned from the FBI due to disagreements with the Trump administration's immigration policies. In an interview, Tillman stated that the directive to target non-dangerous immigrants conflicted with his conscience and his desire to be on the right side of history. He explained that his financial stability from his football career allowed him to walk away from a job where he felt his colleagues were also uncomfortable with the orders coming from Washington. The article highlights a personal story of principle clashing with federal policy during a period of intense immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old girl named Imani Dell, who suddenly developed crossed eyes, was diagnosed with a fast-growing, golf-ball-sized brain tumor known as a medulloblastoma. After her mother noticed the symptom and rushed her to the hospital, surgeons successfully removed the mass and treated a dangerous fluid buildup in her brain. Imani then underwent a difficult year of radiation and chemotherapy, supported by her family. She has now completed her treatment, her scans are looking good, and she is returning to school and her normal childhood activities, showcasing a story of resilience and medical success.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), designed to give pilots more time to react to potential runway collisions. The technology aims to address a recent spike in serious near-misses at U.S. airports, which averaged 4.5 runway incursions per day last year. By using GPS-based ADS-B data, the system can provide warnings seconds earlier than current technology, a critical advantage in high-stakes situations. While not yet required by regulators, the NTSB has urged the adoption of such advanced alerts to enhance airport safety.</p>

          <p>The "dirty soda" trend, which involves mixing soda with flavored syrups and cream, has grown from a Utah-based novelty into a mainstream phenomenon influencing major beverage and fast-food companies. Brands like PepsiCo, Taco Bell, and McDonald's are now innovating with their own versions, hoping to energize a sluggish soda market. Originating from the chain Swig in 2010, the customizable and visually appealing drinks have gained widespread popularity through social media. This trend is helping to reverse a decades-long decline in soda consumption by attracting younger consumers and offering an affordable, novel treat.</p>

          <h2>UK Chancellor Advocates for EU Youth Migration Scheme to Boost Economic Outlook</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for an ambitious youth migration deal with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic forecasts ahead of the upcoming autumn Budget. Reeves argues that an exchange scheme for young workers aged 18-30 would stimulate growth and benefit businesses. She is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential positive economic impact of such a scheme into its official projections. This could potentially reduce the need for future tax increases or spending cuts to address a predicted fiscal gap of £20 to £30 billion.</p>

          <h2>Column Explores Hollywood's History of Pressuring Actors to Change 'Ethnic' Names</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent anecdote from Leonardo DiCaprio, who was advised to change his name to "Lenny Williams" early in his career, highlights a long-standing issue in Hollywood. This column reflects on how actors with so-called "ethnic" names have historically been pressured to adopt more anglicized stage names to improve their chances of success. The author uses a short fable about an aspiring actor who constantly changes his appearance to match others, only to be told the key is to be himself. The piece celebrates that actors like DiCaprio and Benicio del Toro ultimately rejected such advice and found success on their own terms.</p>

          <h2>Simple 'Thumb Test' Can Indicate Risk for Aortic Aneurysm</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 05:16:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A simple self-check known as the "thumb test" may help indicate an increased risk for an aortic aneurysm. The test involves placing your thumb across your flat palm; if it extends beyond the edge, it could suggest joint hypermobility associated with connective tissue diseases like Marfan syndrome, which weaken blood vessel walls. Cardiologists caution that the test is not diagnostic, as most aneurysm patients have a negative result, and a positive result doesn't confirm an aneurysm is present. However, they advise that a positive test should prompt a discussion with a doctor about further evaluation, especially if other risk factors exist.</p>

          <p>The American state fair, a beloved seasonal tradition, has evolved significantly since its origins in the 19th century. Initially established as agricultural competitions for farmers to showcase livestock and crops, fairs have transformed into large-scale events resembling pop-up theme parks with rides, concerts, and a vast array of fried foods. The first state fair was held in Syracuse, New York, in 1841, and while agriculture and craft competitions remain a core element, modern fairs have expanded to become major entertainment hubs. They continue to be a significant part of American culture and a major contributor to the economy.</p>
