        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refuted claims that his government's reversal on winter fuel payments was due to political pressure, attributing it instead to an improved economy. The revised policy will extend the payment, worth up to ¬£300 a year, to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less. Starmer explained that better-than-expected growth figures, falling interest rates, and new trade deals enabled the government to increase eligibility for the payment, reversing an earlier decision to restrict it to the poorest pensioners. The Conservative opposition criticized the government's claim of economic improvement and questioned how the change would be funded.

          <p>A recent survey indicates that corporate leaders are increasingly optimistic about the U.S. economy, with most CEOs not expecting a recession this year. The June poll by Chief Executive found that only 28% of business leaders anticipate a recession in the near term, a significant decrease from 46% in May. Despite ongoing economic uncertainty, CEOs believe the Trump administration will successfully negotiate trade deals to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While the nation's gross domestic product recently shrank, more recent economic indicators suggest the economy is holding up, although tariff-driven inflation could change the outlook.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that the project would create 10,000 jobs and provide energy independence, reducing reliance on foreign energy sources. However, the project is expected to take at least 10 years to complete, with power generation beginning in the mid-2030s, and has faced opposition over costs and environmental concerns.
