          <p>Coca-Cola reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street predictions, largely driven by strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment. However, the company saw a 1% decline in global unit case volume, indicating weakening consumer demand in markets like North America and Asia Pacific. Despite the mixed volume results, Coke narrowed its full-year earnings growth forecast to the upper end of its previous range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the U.S. cancels federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, China has unveiled its next-generation bullet train technology. Chinese researchers have overcome previous technical barriers to increase train speeds from 350km/h to 400km/h without increasing energy consumption. This was achieved through innovative aerodynamic designs inspired by nature and a new undercarriage structure that significantly reduces air resistance. The development showcases China's continued investment and leadership in high-speed rail infrastructure and technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Supporters of the rival Los Angeles soccer teams, LAFC and the Galaxy, displayed a moment of unity during a recent match to protest federal immigration raids. LAFC fans unveiled a large banner reading “Los Angeles Unidos Jamás Será Vencido” (Los Angeles, united, will never be defeated), showing solidarity with community members affected by the raids. The gesture was notable because LAFC is one of the few professional sports teams to have issued a statement supporting its community against the fear caused by the raids. The article highlights how fans are stepping in to voice opposition where many sports organizations have remained silent.</p>

          <p>This essay posits that in an era of escalating global heat, shade should be considered a fundamental public health necessity, akin to clean air and water. Heat is the deadliest weather phenomenon, and its effects will worsen as summers lengthen due to climate change. The article champions both natural shade from trees and artificial shade from public infrastructure as effective, democratic tools to cool urban environments and make life more livable. It argues that society has forgotten the importance of shade and must re-prioritize it as a crucial element of climate adaptation and a basic human right.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, and it reaffirmed its full-year guidance despite the negative impact of President Trump's auto tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated the company is actively working to mitigate its exposure to the tariffs through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. However, the company's net income and revenue were down compared to the previous year, and its North American profit margin saw a significant decline. The automaker's results reflect a resilient performance in a challenging trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's Political Influence in Washington Reportedly Surpasses Other Tech Leaders</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to tech pundits, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has become a more influential political figure in Washington than counterparts like Apple's Tim Cook or Tesla's Elon Musk. His influence is attributed to the critical role of Nvidia's AI chips in the global technology landscape and his successful lobbying efforts. A key example cited is the recent reversal of a U.S. restriction on exporting certain AI chips to China, a move that followed meetings between Huang and President Trump. This demonstrates his growing ability to navigate and shape policy in the high-stakes tech trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests a Path to Winning Back a Segment of Trump's Working-Class Voters</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:00:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from the Center for Working-Class Politics argues that a specific segment of Donald Trump's voters can be won over by Democrats. The research indicates that while working-class voters are often more socially moderate than the Democratic base, they are also broadly supportive of an "economic egalitarian" agenda. The study identifies that about 11% of Trump's working-class supporters hold these socially moderate and economically progressive views. The author suggests that a "social populist" platform, combining worker-focused economic policies with more moderate cultural messaging, could be key to rebuilding a Democratic majority.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles have created Xaia, an AI-powered "mental health ally" delivered through a virtual reality headset. The system, designed to supplement human therapy, engages patients in dialogue within a calming virtual environment to help manage conditions like anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. The technology is part of a growing trend in digital health, but also raises ethical questions about the role of AI in mental healthcare. While proponents see it as a tool to address therapist shortages, critics warn of the risks of emotionally responsive AI without proper clinical oversight and regulation.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell has announced the first significant leadership shake-up of his tenure, reassigning over a dozen high-ranking officials. The changes include elevating three deputy chiefs to top positions and resurrecting the department's Human Resources Bureau, which had been dormant for two decades. Emada Tingirides becomes the highest-ranking Black woman in LAPD history as assistant chief overseeing patrol operations. The reorganization signals McDonnell's strategic direction for the department as it grapples with recruitment challenges and prepares for major events like the 2028 Olympics.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Northwestern University have developed a small, wireless device worn on a mother's breast to measure the precise amount of milk a baby consumes during feeding. The technology aims to alleviate a common source of anxiety for new mothers: uncertainty about whether their infant is getting enough nourishment. By providing real-time data on milk flow, the device can offer reassurance and guidance, potentially helping more mothers continue breastfeeding. The innovation addresses a long-standing challenge in postpartum care and is currently being tested in research studies before public release.</p>

          <p>A new network of 20 air pollution monitors has been launched across northwest Los Angeles County by UCLA researchers to provide real-time, neighborhood-level data. The project, CAP AIR, aims to track both fine (PM 2.5) and coarse (PM 10) particulate matter, the latter of which is often kicked up by construction and not tracked by all public monitors. The network was created in response to community needs following the Palisades fire, offering a user-friendly online map to help residents make informed decisions about outdoor activities based on hyperlocal air quality.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of Denver suggests that the presence of a dog has a more complex biological benefit on human stress than previously understood. Researchers measured two major stress pathways and found that while people with their dogs had lower levels of the long-term stress hormone cortisol, they also had a healthy spike in the short-term "fight or flight" enzyme alpha-amylase. This indicates a more balanced and effective physiological response to stress, keeping a person alert but not overwhelmed. The findings suggest dogs help keep their owners in an optimal zone for handling stressful situations.</p>
