          <p>Sources suggest that the most likely opportunity for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this year is around the APEC summit in South Korea. The meeting could potentially take place in China before the summit or on the sidelines of the event, which runs from October 30 to November 1. This development follows recent diplomatic engagements, including a meeting between the two countries' top diplomats and a phone call where the leaders extended mutual invitations. Both sides have expressed a strong desire for a presidential meeting to help stabilize relations amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The small Mojave Desert community of Newberry Springs, located on the historic Route 66, is anticipating a resurgence as the famous highway approaches its 100th anniversary in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after the construction of Interstate 40 bypassed it, a fate shared by many similar communities. Now, residents and local business owners are preparing for an influx of tourists by organizing events, creating historical tours, and preserving local landmarks like the Bagdad Cafe. They hope the centennial will bring renewed attention and economic life to their town, which feels "frozen in time."</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues for a New Method to Measure the U.S. Labor Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:00:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that traditional methods of measuring the U.S. labor market, such as job creation numbers and the unemployment rate, are becoming obsolete. Given the rise of the "gig economy," side hustles, and remote work, many Americans now have multiple income streams that aren't captured by conventional jobs data. The author suggests that a more relevant metric would be to measure income, tracking how many people earn above a certain threshold from all sources, adjusted for inflation. This shift would provide a more accurate picture of economic health in an era of complex work arrangements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress and cabaret star Bridget Everett reflects on her career and the creation of her Peabody Award-winning HBO series, "Somebody Somewhere." The show, set in her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, is a semi-autobiographical story about a woman navigating grief and finding her place. Everett discusses how she used her provocative cabaret performances to process personal loss and connect with audiences, a side of her that the show's creators wanted to highlight. Despite HBO not renewing the series for a fourth season, Everett expresses gratitude for the opportunity to tell a story about friendship, hope, and authenticity.</p>

          <h2>The Science Behind Deliberately Changing One's Personality Traits</h2>

          <p>This article explores the concept of personality change, featuring writer Olga Khazan, who successfully redesigned her own personality to be less neurotic and more extroverted. Contrary to the belief that personality is fixed, research from psychologists like Shannon Sauer-Zavala suggests that traits can be altered through intentional, sustained changes in behavior and thinking. The process involves identifying desired traits and consciously acting in ways that align with them, such as an introvert joining an improv class to build social skills. While challenging, this "fake it 'til you make it" approach can lead to genuine and lasting shifts in one's characteristic way of feeling and behaving.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, discusses her new memoir and her trailblazing career. She recounts facing both racism and sexism in Washington, including a notable encounter with Senator Jesse Helms, and argues that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is "walking around in a daze" in its response to Donald Trump and warns of backsliding on civil rights. Despite these challenges, she remains optimistic that Americans value democracy and will resist authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists may have identified the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, a Portuguese warship captured by the notorious French pirate Olivier "La Buse" Levasseur in 1721. The ship was carrying a vast treasure of gold, silver, and diamonds, estimated to be worth over $138 million today. The wreck was discovered near Nosy Boraha, an island off Madagascar that was a known pirate hideout. While thousands of artifacts have been recovered, the main treasure remains elusive, perpetuating the 300-year-old mystery surrounding La Buse, who famously threw a cryptogram into a crowd before his execution, claiming it led to his riches.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial "Cop City" training center. The documents, obtained after a lawsuit by a news outlet and a research group, reveal the foundation's active lobbying efforts to prevent a citywide referendum on the project. Emails show the APF warned city officials that a public vote could derail financing and damage the city council's credibility. This ruling sets a significant precedent for the transparency of private police foundations, which have often operated as "black boxes" for funding police activities.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be a breakthrough for women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance, irregular periods, and infertility. While not yet approved for PCOS, some women in clinical trials and anecdotal reports have seen significant improvements in symptoms, including weight loss, regulated menstrual cycles, and reduced testosterone levels. Researchers believe the drugs' effectiveness stems from improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn helps balance hormones. However, more extensive research is needed, and high costs and limited insurance coverage remain major barriers for patients.</p>

          <p>A series of five powerful earthquakes, the largest a magnitude 7.4, struck in the sea off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on Sunday. The quakes initially prompted tsunami warnings for the Russian coast and a tsunami watch for Hawaii. However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and Russia's Emergencies Ministry later confirmed that the danger of significant tsunami waves had passed. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the seismic activity, which occurred about 144 kilometers east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Over two dozen aftershocks were also recorded in the region.</p>

          <h2>Cultural Analysis Explores Superman's Origins as a Leftist, Immigrant Figure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article pushes back against recent conservative criticism of Superman being portrayed as an immigrant, arguing that the character's origins are deeply rooted in leftist and immigrant experiences. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the earliest comics depicted Superman as a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and landlords, acting as a socialist figure. The piece, featuring insights from "All-Star Superman" author Grant Morrison, traces the character's evolution through different eras, from a patriotic symbol during WWII to a family man in the 1950s. It concludes that Superman's enduring power lies in his ability to embody universal ideals and reflect contemporary social issues.</p>
