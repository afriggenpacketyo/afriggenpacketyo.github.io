          <p>Inflation across the euro zone rose slightly to 2% in June, precisely meeting the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time in an extended period. This figure, reported by Eurostat, aligns with economists' expectations and signals a stabilization of consumer prices in the single-currency area. While the closely watched services inflation ticked up, the overall data has reinforced expectations that the ECB will hold its key interest rate steady in July. The ECB's chief economist stated that the central bank's cycle of interventions to curb peak inflation is now considered complete.</p>

          <h2>UK House Prices Experience Largest Monthly Drop in Over Two Years</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant monthly decline since February 2023. This drop is largely attributed to weaker demand following changes to stamp duty rules in April, which reduced tax relief for many buyers. Despite the monthly fall, annual price growth stood at 2.1%, its slowest rate in nearly a year. Economists suggest the market slowdown is temporary, with supportive factors like low unemployment and potential interest rate cuts expected to bolster housing activity in the coming months.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting in July, approximately 21 million households in Great Britain will see their energy bills fall by 7% under the new price cap set by regulator Ofgem. This translates to a reduction of about ¬£11 per month for a typical household, offering some relief from the high cost of living. However, analysts caution that prices remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels, and there is considerable uncertainty about whether costs will rise again during the winter. Consumers are being encouraged to explore fixed-rate deals to secure more predictable payments amid ongoing market volatility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>State lawmakers in California and across the U.S. are introducing legislation to improve menopause education for doctors, addressing a significant gap in medical training. Patients often report that their symptoms, which can range from hot flashes to cognitive issues, are dismissed by ill-equipped physicians. A California bill would require doctors to complete coursework on menopause to renew their licenses, part of a national trend to improve care for an issue that affects half the population. These efforts aim to ensure that providers are better prepared to diagnose and treat menopause-related health concerns effectively.</p>

          <p>A new report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission reveals a shift in how Americans are casting their ballots. While mail-in voting has decreased from its pandemic-era peak in 2020, it remains more popular than in pre-pandemic elections. The most notable trend is the rise of in-person early voting, which has become a widely embraced option across all states. The data also showed that the 2024 election had the second-highest turnout in the last five presidential elections and that the rejection rate for mail ballots remained consistently low, indicating robust participation and system integrity.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei has open-sourced two of its Pangu artificial intelligence models in a strategic effort to accelerate global AI adoption and expand its tech ecosystem. This move allows developers to build on Huawei's technology, which is designed to work with its Ascend AI chips, creating a vertically integrated alternative to competitors like Nvidia. Experts believe this strategy will help Huawei overcome U.S. trade restrictions by fostering a global community of developers. The open-source approach is expected to be particularly appealing in developing countries and solidifies Huawei's position as a major player in the AI hardware and software stack.</p>

Panelists argued that since many prominent AI models are English-based, it is crucial for nations to build systems that reflect their own languages, cultures, and priorities. They identified open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing as key tools to democratize AI development and ensure strategic autonomy.

          <p>While President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" faces criticism over its fiscal impact, some in the financial sector view it as a necessary economic stimulus. The American Bankers Association and economists from firms like Nomura and Citi argue the bill would avert a sharp fiscal contraction by extending expiring tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. They believe this would support household consumption and corporate investment in the short term. This perspective contrasts sharply with warnings from critics who highlight that the bill is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed an advanced framework using satellite remote sensing data to more accurately monitor carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. This new method offers a high-precision, standardized approach to global carbon accounting, which has been lacking. The study demonstrated the significant potential of satellite technology to track emissions from specific sources and retrospectively analyze historical data to identify anomalies. The team suggests this framework could also be applied to other major emission sources, such as steel plants and oil fields.</p>
