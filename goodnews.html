          <p>A large, bright meteor, also known as a fireball, was witnessed across Georgia and South Carolina before exploding over Georgia with an audible boom. NASA reported the meteor was approximately three feet in diameter, weighed over a ton, and released energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT upon its explosion. According to experts, such a bright daylight fireball is a rare phenomenon and may have been a part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, an initiative known as the "cool block" is testing innovative solutions to combat the Urban Heat Island effect, where dense areas become significantly hotter than greener ones. A local environmental group, GreenRoots, is transforming a single block by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with heat-reflecting light colors, and painting rooftops white. This urban laboratory serves as a potential template for other cities to adapt to the extreme heat waves exacerbated by climate change.</p>
