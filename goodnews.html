        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The release of a 2023 audio recording of President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has reignited concerns about his mental and physical fitness for office. The audio clip, documenting a portion of the interview regarding his handling of classified information, reveals Biden's halting speech and memory lapses. This has prompted fresh debate among Democrats and criticism from Republicans, particularly regarding his recollection of key dates, including the death of his son, Beau. The release follows a forthcoming book detailing concerns about Biden's cognitive decline and the efforts by his advisors to suppress discussion of his age-related limitations.</p>

          <p>The start of the third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was delayed due to bad weather, specifically thunder, with play suspended moments before the first shot. Practice had previously been interrupted for 17 minutes due to the threat of lightning. The scheduled tee times have been revised into threesomes off split tees, with Max Greyserman and Sam Burns initially set to lead off. The delay impacts several notable players, including Rory McIlroy, Xander Schauffele, and Jon Rahm, as they adjust to the altered schedule.</p>

The first involves operational restructuring to improve margins and optimize capital allocation, while the second explores a sale of the company. Given Irenic's track record, a sale to either a strategic or financial acquirer appears more likely, allowing Couchbase to pursue organic growth away from public market pressures.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with provisional figures indicating 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, the steepest single-year decline in 45 years. This improvement is attributed to increased availability of naloxone, policies stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, and opioid-settlement funds. However, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat to continued progress. The article suggests that, with effort, the course of this public health crisis can be reversed.</p>

A Kyodo News survey revealed that 73% believe a shift in top management's views is necessary, and 54% cited the need to change company culture to increase female representation in senior positions. Despite government efforts, women held only 16.2% of high-level roles in Japan's top companies in 2024, lagging behind its G7 peers.
