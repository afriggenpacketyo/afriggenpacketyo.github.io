          <p>With President Trump suggesting Alcatraz's reopening, this article revisits some of its notorious former inmates. Al Capone, the infamous gangster, was transferred to Alcatraz after allegations of preferential treatment in another prison; he spent his final year there in a hospital after contracting syphilis. George "Machine Gun" Kelly, known for his kidnapping crimes, also resided at Alcatraz, earning his nickname through his wife's encouragement of his criminal activities. The article also mentions Robert Stroud, the "Birdman of Alcatraz," and Alvin "Creepy" Karpis, a member of the Barker/Karpis gang involved in high-profile kidnappings. This piece provides a historical overview of some of Alcatraz's most well-known figures.</p>

The UAE plans to invest $1.4 trillion in the US over the next decade, with a focus on AI and semiconductors.

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere, after being stranded in orbit for 53 years due to a rocket malfunction.

Experts estimate the re-entry will occur around May 10th, with a landing site somewhere between 52 degrees north and south latitude. While the risk of ground impact is low, any recovered pieces would legally belong to Russia.</p>
