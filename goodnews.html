          <p>Following the elimination of all 23 British competitors from the Wimbledon singles tournaments, this article provides an analysis of the performances of five leading UK players. It examines the successes and shortcomings of athletes like Jack Draper, Emma Raducanu, and Cameron Norrie, discussing the high pressure they face at their home Grand Slam. The piece suggests that while some players like Raducanu showed promising form against top-ranked opponents, others faced tough draws or unexpected losses. It concludes by assessing their potential for future success based on their recent development.</p>

          <p>China has announced the completion of a massive 1,856-kilometer (1,153-mile) green belt aimed at containing the spread of three major deserts in its Inner Mongolia region. The project connects barriers across the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts, which cover a combined area of nearly 95,000 square kilometers. Engineers utilized methods like laying straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by planting drought-resistant vegetation such as sacsaoul trees. This large-scale environmental initiative is part of China's broader effort to build a "green great wall" to combat desertification and strengthen the region's ecological stability.</p>

          <p>AI server manufacturer Super Micro is planning to significantly increase its investment in Europe, including expanding its manufacturing capabilities in the region. CEO Charles Liang stated the decision is driven by rapidly growing global demand for the company's servers, which are essential for training and running large-scale artificial intelligence models. The company, which has an existing facility in the Netherlands, is looking to capitalize on the AI boom that has boosted its business. Liang dismissed recent concerns about slowing growth, asserting that the company's fundamental technology and expanding business scope provide a tremendous opportunity for continued expansion.</p>

          <p>Just weeks after his 80th birthday, John Fogerty delivered an explosive and energetic rock-and-roll performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The concert heavily featured the iconic songs of Creedence Clearwater Revival, the rights to which Fogerty fully regained two years ago after a lengthy legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's vocal performance remained remarkably consistent and powerful, and he played guitar for the entire two-hour show without a break. The performance was a memorable display of his enduring talent and the timeless appeal of the classic rock anthems he created.</p>

          <p>In a show of unity against potential U.S. economic pressure, Brazil and India have vowed to triple their bilateral trade flows. The announcement follows President Trump's threat to impose a 10% tariff on any country that is a member of the Brics bloc of emerging economies, which he claimed was established to harm the U.S. dollar. Trump's continued attacks on the group, which also includes Russia, China, and South Africa, have spurred member nations to strengthen their economic ties. This move by Brazil and India signals a coordinated effort to build resilience against potential U.S. protectionist policies.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to fill a void in providing global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. It contrasts the dismantling of USAID as an independent agency under an "America first" policy with China's proactive initiatives, such as the new International Organisation for Mediation based in Hong Kong. As the global center of gravity shifts eastward, the city's cosmopolitan status and connection to Beijing could allow it to become a new hub for international cooperation and development. This shift presents a strategic opportunity for Hong Kong to enhance its global prominence.</p>

          <p>An Iranian mother who had lived in the U.S. for 47 years was released from ICE detention after Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise intervened on her behalf. Mandonna Kashanian, 64, was detained last month from her New Orleans home despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. Following a surge of community support, Scalise asked the Department of Homeland Security to review the case, stating she should be judged on her life's work and community role. Her release highlights the complex and sometimes arbitrary nature of immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The court alleges they are responsible for the crime against humanity of persecution on the grounds of gender. The charges focus on the severe deprivation of fundamental rights for girls and women in Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power in 2021, including bans on education and freedom of movement. The Taliban dismissed the warrants as "nonsense," but the move represents a significant step by the international legal body to hold the regime's leadership accountable for its repressive policies.</p>
