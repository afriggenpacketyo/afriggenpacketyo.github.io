          <p>Independent left-wing politician Catherine Connolly secured Ireland's 10th presidency in a landslide victory over rival Heather Humphreys. Connolly, a seasoned TD since 2016, garnered support from major left-wing parties and ran a campaign she termed a "movement." Her composed debating style and engaging social media presence, including viral athletic videos, resonated particularly with younger voters. Despite scrutiny over her outspoken pro-Palestine views and criticism of NATO, Connolly's win marks a significant shift, as she intends to make the largely ceremonial role her own.</p>

          <p>Catherine Connolly has been officially declared the 10th President of Ireland following a decisive landslide victory, securing 63% of first preference votes. The independent candidate, backed by major left-wing parties, pledged in her acceptance speech to be "an inclusive president for all" and a voice for peace and neutrality. Her election marks a significant moment, as she takes over from Michael D Higgins, with inauguration set for November 11. Taoiseach Micheál Martin and other leaders congratulated Connolly on her clear mandate, despite an unprecedented number of spoiled votes.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has moved to restrict how law enforcement uses license plate data collected by high-tech camera systems. The board voted to request the Sheriff’s Department implement stricter regulations, including yearly privacy training for deputies and prohibiting data use for non-criminal immigration enforcement. The motion also calls for deleting plate sightings after 60 days unless flagged on criminal lists. This action follows reports of Southern California police departments sharing such data with federal immigration agencies, aiming to balance public safety with privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>England's two-time European champion women's football team faced a friendly defeat by Brazil, prompting reflections on the team's new cycle and experimentation. Despite the 2-1 loss, debutant goalkeeper Khiara Keating, playing at her childhood club's stadium, delivered an assured performance after a challenging start. Keating became the first black goalkeeper to represent the Lionesses, expressing immense pride and hope for future diversity. Coach Sarina Wiegman praised Keating's talent and composure, while also experimenting with Maya le Tissier's role, signaling a period of strategic adjustments ahead of the 2027 Women's World Cup.</p>

          <p>Manchester United secured a 4-2 victory against Brighton, marking their third consecutive win and signaling a potential turnaround after months of negativity. Under manager Ruben Amorim, the team has climbed to fourth place with a positive goal difference, a significant improvement from three weeks prior. While Amorim remains cautious, citing football's unpredictable nature, the improved results are seen as a boost for fan morale. Key summer signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo contributed goals, and the team's defensive stability under Matthijs de Ligt, alongside Casemiro's resurgence, suggests a more cohesive system is taking hold.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral chart claiming the UK is Europe's "sexual assault capital" is misleading, according to a DW fact check. While the data on sexual assault rates is accurately cited from the World Population Review, comparing these figures across countries is problematic due to vast differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors. Criminologists advocate for victim surveys over police reports for more accurate insights, as official statistics often only capture a fraction of actual incidents. Claims linking increased sexual assault rates to mass immigration are also debunked as false by the article.</p>

This initiative, in cooperation with the UK, Norway, and the US, aims to strengthen NATO's security by monitoring Russian submarine movements, which have significantly increased.

The public's obsession is partly attributed to the fantasy of the story and a desire for lighter news compared to massacres.

          <p>The "VOO and chill" passive investing strategy, involving exchange-traded funds tied to market indexes like the S&P 500, may be losing its appeal despite record stock highs. Investors are increasingly seeking diversification beyond broad index funds, as technology now comprises over 35% of the S&P 500, a record imbalance. Conversely, defensive sectors like consumer staples and energy are at an all-time low weight. This shift is driving renewed interest in small-cap stocks, which have recently outperformed the S&P 500, indicating a broader search for unique investment avenues. (not investment advice)</p>

He highlights that saving 40% on $2,000 spent annually on items like toothpaste and toilet paper yields $800, a tangible return often harder to achieve in the stock market. Cuban, who built his fortune in tech, emphasizes that smart money moves aren't always flashy.
