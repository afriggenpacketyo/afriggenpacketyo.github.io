          <p>Space transportation company Firefly Aerospace has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker "FLY." The filing occurs amid a renewed interest in IPOs, following a market downturn in 2022. Firefly, known for its Alpha rockets and a successful lunar landing with its Blue Ghost lander, reported a significant revenue increase to $55.9 million in the first quarter, though it also recorded a net loss of $60.1 million. The company's backlog is valued at approximately $1.1 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will send Patriot air defense systems and other weapons to Ukraine, with distribution and payment handled by NATO. The decision follows a direct appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for 10 Patriot systems to counter a surge in Russian drone and missile attacks. The move marks a reversal from a recent pause on some critical weapons shipments to Kyiv. The advanced Patriot systems are crucial for Ukraine's layered defense against Russian aerial bombardments, protecting cities and critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Shares of Robinhood surged to a new high, marking a 160% increase this year, though the company faces several significant challenges. Florida's Attorney General has launched an investigation into Robinhood Crypto for allegedly deceptive marketing about its trading costs. The company is also facing pushback over a new 25% fee on crypto staking rewards and friction with OpenAI regarding its tokenized stock offerings. Despite these headwinds, investors appear focused on the platform's growth, including its potential role in the government's 'Trump Accounts' initiative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is escalating its development of autonomous air combat systems by testing the integration of XQ-58A Valkyrie drones with crewed fighter jets. In a recent exercise, pilots in F-16 and F-15E aircraft each controlled two "loyal wingman" drones, a concept where uncrewed aircraft are directed by a nearby pilot. This test represents a significant step in the technological race with China for air dominance. The development aims to enhance combat capabilities by teaming crewed and uncrewed aircraft in real-time scenarios.</p>

          <p>The grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol will soon feature a statue of Robert Smalls, making it the first monument honoring a Black man at the site. Smalls was a formerly enslaved man who became a Civil War hero after commandeering a Confederate transport ship and delivering it to the Union. He later served as a U.S. Congressman. The statue will stand among existing monuments to white men, many of whom have ties to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era, marking a significant moment of historical recognition.</p>

Her journey back has been a "roller coaster," but her run at Wimbledon, including a semifinal win over the world's top-ranked player, proves a return to form is possible.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high, briefly surpassing $118,000, driven by the largest single-day inflow into Bitcoin ETFs this year. The surge was also supported by a broader rally in tech stocks and speculation about a more dovish Federal Reserve policy. The sharp price increase triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further fueling the upward momentum. This rally continues a trend of institutional investment pouring into cryptocurrency since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has rejected TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that TikTok intentionally uses manipulative and "addictive design features" to exploit young users and keep them engaged on the app for longer periods. The judge ruled the state's claims were valid, focusing on the app's alleged dangerous features rather than its user-generated content. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions by states targeting the design and safety policies of major tech companies.</p>
