          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone call described as highly productive, focusing on establishing peace in Ukraine. Zelenskyy reportedly urged Trump to apply similar diplomatic efforts that were used in the Middle East to resolve the ongoing conflict with Russia. The conversation also covered Ukraine's need for enhanced air defense systems following recent Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. This discussion marks a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who have previously had a contentious relationship but now seem aligned on Ukraine's potential to reclaim its territory.</p>

          <p>A potential historic peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, aimed at ending the war in Gaza, is being largely credited to the diplomatic pressure exerted by U.S. President Donald Trump. Political analysts suggest that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, recognizing his deep reliance on American support, was compelled to engage in the deal when pushed by Trump. This development marks a significant turning point in the long-standing conflict, with Trump preparing to visit the Middle East to help solidify the terms. The deal's success and durability, however, remain subjects of intense discussion among foreign affairs experts.</p>

The club's board has held talks with Wilshere, placing him ahead of other candidates to succeed Matt Bloomfield, who was recently dismissed. While a deal has not yet been finalized, Wilshere is in a strong position to take on the role.

          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) in North America to advance their careers and gain national team recognition. Players like Nashville SC's Patrick Yazbek have found that the league provides high-level competition and greater visibility than Australia's domestic A-League. The MLS has also provided professional opportunities for Australian coaches and staff, who note the league's shifting strategy toward developing and selling young talent. This trend suggests MLS will continue to be an attractive destination for promising players from Down Under seeking a global platform.</p>

          <p>In an era dominated by streaming services, independent movie theaters are finding creative ways to thrive by fostering a sense of community. Theaters like Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas in New Jersey and Vidiots in Los Angeles operate as non-profits, hosting special events, Q&As, and film festivals to draw audiences. Meanwhile, New York's Metrograph has found success as a for-profit venture by offering a curated experience with a bookstore, restaurant, and its own streaming service. These theaters demonstrate that the social experience of moviegoing remains a powerful draw for audiences seeking connection.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has seen the value of its stake in five major Japanese trading houses—Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo—grow to over $30 billion. This represents a nearly 400% increase from the initial $6.3 billion investment revealed in 2020. Berkshire has been actively increasing its positions, recently raising its stake in both Mitsui and Mitsubishi to over 10%. Buffett has expressed long-term commitment to these investments, which he was initially drawn to due to what he considered a "ridiculous price" in 2020. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As part of a ceasefire agreement brokered by the U.S., Hamas is insisting that Israel release prominent Palestinian prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat. Israel's initial list of 250 prisoners to be freed excluded these high-profile figures, who are viewed by many Palestinians as symbols of resistance. The disagreement could potentially complicate the timeline for the exchange, which also involves the release of 20 Israeli hostages from Gaza. The deal represents the first phase of a plan proposed by President Donald Trump to end the two-year war.</p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000 if they win the next Senedd election. The policy aims to retain teaching staff in Wales by matching the more competitive incentives offered in England, with a focus on Welsh-medium teachers and those in high-demand subjects like math and science. The payments would be conditional on the teachers working in Wales for five years after their training. The party estimates the policy would cost £6m-£7m, funded from money already designated for curriculum support.</p>
