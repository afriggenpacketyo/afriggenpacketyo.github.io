          <p>A Miami-based recycling company called Sneaker Impact is collecting used sneakers from donation boxes across the United States, giving them a new life. The company sorts the shoes for reuse or recycling, depending on their condition. Reusable shoes are shipped to developing countries like Haiti and Honduras to be resold by local businesses, creating microbusiness opportunities. Shoes that cannot be reused are crushed and repurposed into materials like flooring and sandals. The company aims to reduce waste and promote environmentally friendly business practices, with the founder emphasizing the importance of reuse and upcycling. </p>

          <p>Leaked audio from an interview with special counsel Robert Hur reveals that former President Joe Biden admitted he likely kept a classified document related to Afghanistan after his vice presidency "for posterity's sake." Biden initially claimed he didn't recall why he had the document. The House Judiciary Committee sued Attorney General Merrick Garland for the audio recordings, citing the importance of the "verbal and nonverbal context" given Hur's assessment of Biden as "an elderly man with a poor memory." Hur did not recommend criminal charges against Biden for mishandling classified documents.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans, according to a company source. This decision follows Nissan's announcement to shut down seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after reporting a significant net loss for fiscal year 2024. The two plants in question are the Oppama plant, which pioneered electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co. These closures could impact approximately 30% of Nissan's domestic production capacity.</p>
