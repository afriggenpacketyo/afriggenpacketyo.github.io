          <p>Screenwriter Steven Knight, renowned for his work on "Peaky Blinders," is launching "House of Guinness" on Netflix, a new drama exploring the power struggles within Ireland's most famous brewing family. The series commences at a moment of crisis following Sir Benjamin Guinness's death, as his four children, each harboring dark secrets, vie to control the brewery's destiny. Knight emphasizes that the drama blends real historical events with fictionalized elements, believing that true events are often the most unbelievable. Starring James Norton as an imagined foreman and Danielle Galligan as the aristocratic Lady Olivia, the show aims to tell a compelling Irish story on a global stage, with the cast expressing pride in the project.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald intensified the competition by stating his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," a clear dig at their American rivals who are receiving financial stipends for their participation. For the first time in the tournament's 98-year history, all 12 American players and captain Keegan Bradley are being paid $500,000 each, with a portion designated for charity, while the European players remain unpaid. Donald underscored that for Europe, the event is about pride, representing their flag, and honoring the legacy of those who came before them. This payment structure has drawn considerable negative attention and criticism from detractors who believe it undermines the Ryder Cup's traditional ethos.</p>

          <p>A senior US State Department official unequivocally reaffirmed India's strategic importance as a democratic counterweight to China within the Indo-Pacific region, dismissing any suggestions that recent sharp bilateral trade disputes or concerns regarding Pakistan have fundamentally altered this position for the Trump administration. The official explicitly stated, "Absolutely still see India as a critical partner in the Indo-Pacific," humorously adding that India is indeed the "indo" in Indo-Pacific. A leaders’ summit for the Quad, an informal strategic dialogue, is anticipated to take place in New Delhi in the fall, underscoring the enduring strength and strategic significance of US-India ties in maintaining regional stability.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's emotional return to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a network-imposed hiatus garnered an average of 6.26 million viewers, marking his program's largest audience ever in its regular 11:35 p.m. time slot. This impressive viewership was achieved despite the show being preempted in nearly a quarter of US television households by affiliate stations owned by Nexstar and Sinclair. Kimmel's opening monologue, where he addressed his suspension and the ensuing free speech debate, also amassed over 26 million views across YouTube and other social media platforms. The incident, sparked by FCC Chair Brendan Carr's remarks, transformed into a global news story, highlighting ongoing discussions about censorship and the media's role in political discourse.</p>

          <p>Leucovorin, an inexpensive and generic drug typically prescribed to alleviate side effects of cancer chemotherapy, is demonstrating significant promise in helping children with autism improve their ability to speak. Parents, like those of Mason Connor, reported their son's first words just days after starting the treatment. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, is leading research into the drug, which is theorized to bypass a blockage in folic acid transport to the brain, a factor potentially contributing to some autism spectrum disorders. Despite positive preliminary results from multiple studies and the FDA beginning approval processes, funding challenges for larger clinical trials and the drug's generic status hinder its widespread adoption, offering hope for a subset of autistic children.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Bears football franchise has achieved a record-setting valuation of $8.9 billion following the recent sale of a 2.35% minority stake to existing team owners, a deal officially approved by the National Football League's finance committee. This valuation significantly surpasses previous NFL records for minority stake transactions, highlighting the burgeoning financial strength and market confidence in professional sports teams. The sale involved the estate of Andrew McKenna, with shares being distributed to the McCaskey and Ryan families, further solidifying their ownership stakes. The team is also actively exploring ambitious plans to construct a new fixed-roof domed stadium in Arlington Heights, a move that could substantially enhance its year-round revenue opportunities beyond NFL events.

          <p>A preliminary trial of the gene therapy AMT-130 has demonstrated remarkable success, achieving a 75% reduction in the progression of Huntington's disease over three years in patients who received a high dose. This experimental, one-time treatment utilizes a harmless virus to deliver specific genetic instructions to the brain, effectively turning off the harmful protein responsible for damaging brain cells. While these early results are exceptionally promising and offer new hope for the approximately 100,000 Americans affected by this devastating condition, larger, more extensive studies are still required. If ultimately approved, AMT-130 would represent the first treatment to actively slow the disease, rather than merely manage its symptoms.</p>

          <p>President Trump is anticipated to sign a deal brokered by his administration that would permit TikTok to continue operating in the United States, declaring it a "qualified divestiture" under a bipartisan law. The agreement mandates that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must sever ties with the popular app, with cloud-computing firm Oracle stepping in to provide "top to bottom security" by hosting US user data and meticulously reviewing the app's code. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will acquire a stake in TikTok. While the administration asserts the deal ensures the app is "safe and secure," some lawmakers express ongoing concerns that the licensing agreement may not go far enough to entirely eliminate potential Chinese government control or influence.
