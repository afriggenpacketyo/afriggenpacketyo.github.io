          <p>China has approved mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, named the AES100, marking a significant step in its aviation ambitions. This development occurs despite recent export restrictions imposed by the United States targeting jet engine technologies critical for China's passenger aircraft production. While the AES100 differs from jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts emphasize its importance for the country's overall aviation sector. Li Gaiqi, the chief designer, highlighted China's growing ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines, reflecting a major stride in technological self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been released globally, with stores opening at midnight to accommodate eager fans awaiting the console's debut. While many customers pre-ordered the device, some retailers experienced setbacks, including order cancellations and tariff concerns. Despite the initial excitement, questions remain regarding the Switch 2's potential to replicate the success of its predecessor, partly due to higher game prices. The console features upgraded capabilities and a new Mario Kart game, but some fans are hesitant due to the cost, while others anticipate years of enjoyment from the new device.</p>

          <p>The government in England will extend free school meals to an additional 500,000 children by September 2026, making any child whose parents receive Universal Credit eligible, regardless of income. This change aims to save parents ¬£500 annually and lift 100,000 children out of poverty, with the Department for Education allocating ¬£1 billion to fund the initiative until 2029. While largely welcomed, some critics suggest other measures, like lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more cost-effective in reducing child poverty. The government is also considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap and has pledged ¬£13 million to food charities.</p>

          <p>Proposed visa restrictions in the U.S. are causing international students to consider alternatives like the U.K., potentially leading to an influx of applicants at British universities. The number of students searching for U.S. universities has declined sharply, with concerns about access and diversity arising in the U.K. if more international students choose to study there. While U.K. universities may see short-term financial benefits, experts warn of long-term consequences for global research collaboration. Uncertainty created by U.S. policies may have a lasting impact, regardless of their actual implementation.</p>

          <p>A security guard, Wayne Price, who was sacked after an altercation with a violent thief, was cleared of assault charges thanks to bodycam footage. The footage showed that Price was protecting staff and shoppers from a prolific shoplifter, Peter Swinbourne, who has a history of violence. Swinbourne was attempting to force his way into a Tesco Express when Price intervened. The bodycam footage proved that Price was being attacked by Swinbourne, leading to his acquittal and highlighting the importance of bodycam evidence in such cases.</p>

          <p>The UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) has announced that the April inflation rate was overstated by 0.1 percentage points due to a car tax data calculation error. The ONS initially reported an annual rate of 3.5% but revised it to 3.4% after identifying an error in the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport. The incorrect data overstated the number of vehicles subject to VED rates, affecting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI). The ONS apologized for the error and will use corrected data from May 2025 onward.</p>

Germany is adapting its military posture in response to NATO's plans for collective defense, which aims to bolster its eastern flank after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While conscription might be necessary at some point, Pistorius said voluntary participation applies until capacities grow. The minister has promoted a model that relies on voluntary service that also allows the country to make conscription compulsory if needed.</p>
