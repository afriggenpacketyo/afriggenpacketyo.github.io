          <p>Asia-Pacific stock markets experienced gains Monday, tracking Wall Street, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential monetary policy easing next month. South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq indices rose by 0.67% and 1.91% respectively, while Japan's Nikkei 225 increased by 0.69%. This optimism follows Powell's focus on slowing job growth, which outweighed concerns about tariffs, leading to a powerful Friday market rally.

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) issued a warning to a resident for charging a Tesla in their driveway using the car's standard Level 1 cable, citing aesthetic concerns about "electrical chords running along the ground."
