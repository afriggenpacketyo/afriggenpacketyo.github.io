          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team began their Australian tour with a commanding 54-7 win against the Western Force in Perth. Despite a competitive first half where the Force maintained significant possession, the Lions were more clinical, leading 21-7 at the break. The tourists pulled away in the second half, scoring a total of eight tries in front of a record rugby crowd of 46,656. The decisive victory was slightly marred by a worrying hamstring injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams, who had scored two tries before being forced off the field.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's upset victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary is being credited to the power of the grassroots Palestinian liberation movement. This opinion piece argues that his vocal support for Palestine, once a political liability, became a key asset due to a shift in public opinion driven by sustained activism. The campaign successfully mobilized a coalition of progressive organizers, students, and groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, who were already engaged in opposing establishment politics. Mamdani's win is presented as evidence that a pro-Palestinian stance can now be central to a winning domestic political campaign.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, are moving into the corporate mainstream, with major firms like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard embracing the technology. These companies see stablecoins as a way to significantly reduce transaction fees and enable instantaneous, 24/7 payment settlements. The trend is bolstered by growing regulatory clarity, such as the Senate's GENIUS Act, which sets guidelines for issuers. This shift indicates that stablecoins are evolving from a niche crypto asset into a foundational infrastructure layer for the future of finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As it turns 20, Reddit is confronting the existential threat posed by AI chatbots that scrape its user-generated content for training data. The company is fighting back by suing AI firms like Anthropic for unfair business practices while also licensing its data to others like Google and OpenAI. To compete directly, Reddit has launched its own AI tool, Reddit Answers, which generates responses based solely on conversations from its platform, providing a direct link to human discussions. This strategy bets on the enduring value of authentic human interaction over the "annotated sterile answers from AI."</p>

          <p>Journalist and public broadcasting icon Bill Moyers has passed away at the age of 91, leaving behind a profound legacy in American media. After starting as a reporter and later serving as press secretary for President Lyndon B. Johnson, Moyers dedicated six decades to journalism, winning numerous prestigious awards for his work on PBS. He was renowned for his thoughtful and probing interviews not just with newsmakers, but also with poets, scholars, and artists like Joseph Campbell and Maya Angelou.

          <p>England and Chelsea forward Lauren James is set to make her return to the pitch after a three-month absence due to a hamstring injury. The 23-year-old is available for England's final friendly match against Jamaica before the Euro 2025 tournament begins. Manager Sarina Wiegman confirmed James is in good condition but will have her minutes managed, likely coming on as a substitute. James was a standout player during the 2023 Women's World Cup, and her return is considered a significant boost for England's title defense.</p>

The group recently placed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a musician lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. Founded in 2021, the interracial and intergenerational group researches these forgotten atrocities and works with the Equal Justice Initiative to collect soil from lynching sites.

          <p>In an unusual move, Trader Joe's has opened a new, larger store in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, located directly across the street from one of its long-standing locations. The original plan was to close the older, smaller store, which has been open since 1973. However, the company decided to keep both locations operational to serve the high volume of customers in the area. The new store is about 40% larger and features underground parking, a major draw for shoppers who found the old lot too cramped, though some loyal customers prefer the cozier feel of the original.</p>

          <p>In a major policy reversal, Germany is planning a massive increase in defense spending to build the largest military in Europe. Spurred by a new Trump presidency and the war in Ukraine, Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced plans to spend 3.5% of GDP on defense, a figure equal to U.S. spending. This historic shift involves a constitutional change to suspend Germany's "debt brake," allowing for nearly $400 billion in defense spending by 2029 without cutting social programs. The move reflects a profound change in the country's post-war identity and a response to demands from NATO partners.</p>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against recent efforts by conservative gay figures, like Richard Grenell, to promote a form of "respectability politics" by distancing "normal gays" from transgender issues. The author argues that the spirit of Pride has always been rooted in its diversity and the contributions of its most marginalized members, including the drag queens and gender-nonconforming individuals who initiated the Stonewall Riots. The piece asserts that progress for the LGBTQ+ community has never come from a monolithic, heteronormative front, and that attempts to create such a divide are disingenuous and harmful.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1972 murder conviction of Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a Black Panther leader in Los Angeles, a case that his lawyer, Johnnie Cochran Jr., believed was a politically motivated frame-up. Pratt was convicted based on the testimony of a witness later revealed to be an FBI informant, part of the COINTELPRO campaign to neutralize Black nationalist groups. After 27 years in prison, eight in solitary confinement, Pratt's conviction was overturned in 1997 when courts found that prosecutors had hidden critical evidence. The case stands as a stark example of official corruption and the fight to undo a profound injustice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant local victory against MAGA-aligned politics, voters in Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public libraries. The measures successfully dismantled a new parent review board that would have controlled children's book selections and blocked the potential privatization of the library system. This result is seen as a major rebuke to the city's conservative supermajority council, which had pushed the changes. The successful grassroots campaign, led by the nonpartisan group Protect HB, suggests that even in conservative strongholds, voters will push back against perceived political overreach.</p>
