          <p>Independent UK Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." Lowe posted on social media platform X, alerting authorities and demanding mass deportations for the individuals in the boat. It was later confirmed by the HM Coastguard that the vessel contained a crew raising money for motor neurone disease (MND) research. After realizing his error, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity. The rowing crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" and noted the "vigilante-style" attention they received.</p>

Her comments follow reports that President Trump has directed the Pentagon to develop plans for action against Latin American cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized that any such intervention is "absolutely rejected," reinforcing Mexico's stance on national sovereignty while affirming its commitment to cooperation with the U.S. on security issues. The discussion has revived historical sensitivities in Mexico regarding U.S. military presence, with Sheinbaum asserting that she has previously declined offers of direct U.S. military assistance from Trump.</p>

          <p>Billy Long is leaving his position as IRS commissioner after only two months on the job to accept a nomination as the U.S. ambassador to Iceland. Long, a former Republican congressman from Missouri, was confirmed in mid-June to lead the tax agency, which has been a focus of the Trump administration's government-wide staff reduction efforts. His brief tenure follows a period of leadership instability at the IRS, which has seen several interim commissioners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will temporarily lead the agency, which has already seen its workforce shrink by approximately 25% this year amid plans for significant cuts.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace agreement at a White House summit hosted by President Trump, aiming to end decades of conflict. The deal establishes a new transit corridor connecting Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, which will be named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity." Both Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised the agreement as a "significant milestone" and credited President Trump's role in brokering the deal. The agreement marks a major diplomatic achievement and a geopolitical shift, potentially reducing Russia's historical influence in the South Caucasus region.</p>

          <p>Apple experienced its largest weekly stock gain since July 2020, with shares climbing 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance at the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. This commitment appeared to please President Trump, who suggested Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about profitability. The successful meeting, combined with strong quarterly earnings, has significantly boosted market confidence in the tech giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the U.S. housing market remains challenging, home prices are beginning to decline in certain regions, particularly in the South and West. A Realtor.com report shows that cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant drops in median listing prices compared to their 2022 peak, with Austin falling nearly 15%. This trend is attributed to a growing housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising prices, creating a divided real estate landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares for rare earth miner MP Materials rose over 4% after the company reported a narrower second-quarter loss and record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is essential for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, robotics, and electronics. The company is currently ramping up its magnet production facility in Texas, which will supply General Motors. This positive financial report follows a recent major investment from the U.S. Department of Defense, which purchased $400 million in stock and guaranteed a price floor for NdPr, making the federal government MP's largest shareholder.

          <p>The U.S. government is providing significant bipartisan support to bolster domestic mining and mineral processing, aiming to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly from China. One such project is a new nickel processing plant in Beulah, North Dakota, which received a $114 million grant from the Department of Energy. The plant will process nickel ore from a Minnesota mine owned by Talon Metals, which also received a Pentagon grant. This federal backing, initiated under the Biden administration and continued by President Trump, highlights a strategic consensus on the importance of securing domestic sources for critical materials like nickel.</p>
