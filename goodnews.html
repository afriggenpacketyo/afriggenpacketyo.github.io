          <p>Amid rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, wealthy mainland Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their capital away from the US real estate market. Data indicates that in 2024, Chinese buyers' demand for homes priced above US$5 million has shifted towards markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada. This marks a significant change from 2023 when the US was the top choice for Chinese buyers. Increased scrutiny of property deals and geopolitical friction are cited as key factors discouraging Chinese investment in US homes.</p>

Many would consider legal marriage if separate surnames were permitted. Common-law couples lack the legal benefits afforded to married couples, including spouse tax deductions and inheritance rights.</p>

          <p>The Salarno family's battle for justice after the murder of their daughter, Catina, has significantly impacted victims' rights. The family, after Catina was murdered by her boyfriend, embarked on a decades-long journey to keep her killer behind bars, a process which was emotionally and personally difficult. Harriet Salarno started Crime Victims United, an organization that has changed hundreds of laws. Now, victims in California are allowed to give impact statements at sentencing, parents can attend the trial, and children must be accompanied by a support person when testifying.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with a net increase of nearly 12,000 coffee shops in the past year. This surge is driven by expansion into smaller cities and increased accessibility, with a presidential endorsement further boosting interest in domestic beans. Starbucks, once dominant, has seen its market share decline amid competition from new entrants with innovative business models and flavors. The growth is concentrated in second-tier and "new first-tier" cities, reflecting a broader shift in coffee culture.</p>

          <p>A South Texas community largely composed of SpaceX employees voted overwhelmingly in favor of establishing a new city named Starbase, fulfilling a long-held aspiration of Elon Musk. With 212 votes in support and only 6 against, the community, formerly known as Boca Chica, officially became a municipality. As a municipality, Starbase will be eligible to create its own police and fire departments, adopt its own ordinances, and be eligible for state and federal grants.</p>

          <p>Ginzan Onsen, a hot spring town in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, has started restricting visitors to combat overtourism and protect its cultural heritage. Known for its Western-style wooden inns from the Taisho period, the town's charm has drawn crowds. In response, the city implemented admission restrictions for day-trippers from December 2024 to February 2025, requiring visitors to use a shuttle bus and purchase tickets in advance. While the measures have improved congestion, officials are considering year-round restrictions to preserve the town's atmosphere.</p>
