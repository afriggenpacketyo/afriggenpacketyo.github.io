          <p>England's women's football team suffered a friendly defeat to Brazil, leading to significant talking points about player performances and future strategy. Goalkeeper Khiara Keating made her debut at her childhood club's Etihad Stadium, becoming the first black female goalkeeper for the Lionesses, and despite an early 2-0 deficit, she delivered an assured performance praised by Coach Sarina Wiegman. The article also highlights the ongoing debate around Maya le Tissier's positioning, with Wiegman utilizing her at right-back despite her strong preference for center-back. This period marks the beginning of a new cycle for the Lionesses, focused on experimentation and preparation for the 2027 Women's World Cup.</p>

          <p>Ole Miss Rebels head coach Lane Kiffin engaged in a post-game exchange with Oklahoma lineman David Stone after securing a gritty 34-26 road victory. Kiffin, captured on a hot mic, playfully reminded Stone of his earlier taunts about Oklahoma's defensive prowess. The No. 8 Rebels notably squandered a 12-point third-quarter lead against the No. 13 Sooners but rallied to shut them out in the fourth quarter. Key moments included a crucial 8-yard touchdown pass and a recovered punt return fumble that led to a decisive field goal, cementing Ole Miss's 7-1 record.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has achieved three consecutive victories, culminating in a 4-2 win against Brighton, prompting speculation that the team has overcome its recent struggles. Coach Ruben Amorim, however, maintains a cautious perspective, emphasizing the volatile nature of football results. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, a minority owner, reportedly supports Amorim's long-term vision, with the improved performances enhancing fan confidence. Key summer signings like Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are proving instrumental, contributing goals and a renewed attacking drive that aligns better with Amorim's tactical system.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent Catherine Connolly has won Ireland's presidential election in a landslide victory, securing 63% of first-preference votes. Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and independent lawmaker, garnered strong backing from a range of left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin, Labour, and the Social Democrats. She pledged to be an inclusive president, championing diversity and advocating for peace while building on Ireland's policy of neutrality. Connolly will become Ireland's 10th president and the third woman to hold the largely ceremonial role, succeeding Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two terms.</p>

          <p>A viral bar chart claiming the UK is the "sexual assault capital of Europe" is misleading, despite accurately citing data from the World Population Review. DW Fact check explains that cross-national comparisons of sexual assault statistics are problematic due to vast differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors, such as the UK's consent-based laws. Criminologists advocate for victim surveys as a more reliable measure than police reports, which only capture a fraction of incidents. Claims linking immigration to increased sexual violence are also debunked as unsupported by evidence in this article.</p>

          <p>Germany is significantly bolstering its NATO defense capabilities by acquiring eight Boeing P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, specifically designed to detect Russian submarines in the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius witnessed a demonstration of the aircraft's highly sensitive radar and sonar equipment, underscoring the strategic threat posed by increased Russian submarine movements. This initiative, in cooperation with British, Norwegian, and US navies, aims to form a comprehensive surveillance network from bases in Lossiemouth, Keflavik, and Nordholz.

While she didn't commit to a 2028 bid, she acknowledged the possibility.

          <p>The popular "VOO and chill" passive investing strategy, centered on S&P 500 exchange-traded funds, is reportedly losing its appeal as investors seek greater diversification. Gavin Filmore of Tidal Financial Group notes clients are looking beyond index funds due to a lack of diversification within the S&P 500, where technology now comprises over 35%. Todd Sohn of Strategas Securities observes a renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 recently hitting an all-time high and outperforming the S&P 500 over the past six months. This trend suggests a broadening of market interest beyond large-cap tech. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban posits that for the average individual, practical savings strategies like bulk shopping can be a more reliable "investment" than attempting to pick stocks. He illustrates that saving 40% on typical annual household consumable expenses, such as toothpaste and toilet paper, could yield $800 in tangible savings. Cuban also strongly advises against using credit cards for these purchases, emphasizing that an investment is only truly beneficial if it doesn't lead to accumulating interest debt.
