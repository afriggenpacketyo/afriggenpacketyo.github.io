          <p>West Ham has appointed former Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espírito Santo as their new head coach after dismissing Graham Potter. The change comes after a poor start to the season left the club in 19th place in the Premier League table, with the board stating that results had not matched expectations. Potter's tenure lasted just eight months, during which the team secured only six wins in 25 matches. Nuno, who previously led Forest to European qualification, is expected to take charge immediately as the club seeks to improve its league position and performance.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has strengthened into a Category 4 storm in the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph. The National Hurricane Center currently reports no coastal watches or warnings for the United States, as the storm is forecast to travel over the central Atlantic through the weekend. Humberto is the eighth named storm of the season and is one of two systems being monitored in the region. A second, nearby system over the Caribbean is expected to become a tropical depression and could approach the southeastern U.S. coast early next week, potentially bringing significant rainfall to Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>Comedian Michael Richards, widely known for his role as Kramer on "Seinfeld," has returned to the stage for the first time in nearly 20 years. His comeback follows a 2006 incident where he delivered a racist tirade at a comedy club, which effectively ended his career and led to a long, self-imposed exile from public life. During his new show, Richards candidly addressed the past event, explaining that he spent years in self-reflection and personal work to understand his actions. In his recently released memoir, he details this period of introspection and his decision to step away from Hollywood.</p>

          <p>As "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" marks its 50th anniversary, its legacy as a cultural phenomenon is being celebrated by dedicated fan groups worldwide. These communities, like the Michigan Rocky Horror Preservation Society, keep the film's interactive spirit alive through regular midnight screenings featuring "shadowcasts" that act out the movie and audience call-and-response rituals. For decades, the film has served as a safe haven and a space for self-expression, particularly for queer and neurodivergent individuals. Participants emphasize the deep sense of community and the celebration of being different as key reasons for the movie's enduring appeal.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 06:07:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is championing an ambitious youth migration agreement with the European Union, hoping its potential economic benefits will improve the country's fiscal outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow individuals aged 18-30 to live and work in the UK for a set period, similar to existing agreements with countries like Australia and New Zealand. Reeves has urged the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the scheme's positive impact into its forecasts, which could potentially reduce the need for future tax hikes or spending cuts. The proposal faces criticism from conservatives who view it as a partial return to freedom of movement.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's All Blacks have secured the Bledisloe Cup for the 23rd straight year after defeating Australia's Wallabies 33-24 at Auckland's Eden Park.

However, a late try from scrum-half Cam Roigard sealed the win for New Zealand, placing them at the top of the Rugby Championship standings ahead of their final match against Australia next weekend.</p>

          <h2>King Charles's Traditional Urban Planning Philosophy Influences England's Next Generation of New Towns</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The architectural and urban planning principles long championed by King Charles are significantly shaping the design of a new wave of towns set to be announced by the UK government. Officials have indicated that the 12 new towns will prioritize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" with terraced housing rather than high-rises, echoing the King's vision seen in projects like Poundbury. Once criticized by the architectural establishment for his traditionalist views, the King's ideas on creating humane, community-focused spaces are now considered mainstream. The goal is to avoid the mistakes of past developments that were overly car-dependent and lacked a sense of community.</p>

          <p>The remains of two Scottish soldiers killed during the Battle of Loos in World War One have been identified over a century after their deaths. The discovery was made after construction workers in northern France unearthed more than 100 bodies in 2021. Through meticulous work by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the UK's 'war detectives' unit, the soldiers were identified as Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan. Investigators used regimental artifacts, census records, and DNA testing with living relatives to solve the long-standing mystery, allowing the soldiers to finally be laid to rest with full military honors.</p>
