          <p>At 80 years old, legendary musician John Fogerty captivated the Hollywood Bowl with a powerful rock and roll performance as part of his “Celebration Tour.” Despite his age, Fogerty impressively maintained his vocal strength and guitar skills throughout the two-hour concert, performing 18 of 24 songs from his Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) era. The show also celebrated the return of his CCR song rights after a lengthy legal battle, a significant personal victory. A touching moment included Fogerty recounting the story of his lost and recovered 1969 Rickenbacker guitar, found by his wife after 44 years. His enduring energy and iconic hits, like "Fortunate Son," continue to resonate, proving his lasting impact on classic rock and inspiring multiple generations.</p>

          <p>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has once again claimed the title of the world's busiest airport, processing over 108 million passengers in 2024, according to Airports Council International World. Globally, passenger traffic reached a record 9.4 billion in 2024, an 8.4% increase from 2023 and 2.7% more than in 2019, indicating a robust recovery in air travel. Dubai International Airport secured the second spot overall and leads in international passenger traffic, while several U.S. airports, including Dallas/Fort Worth and Denver, have seen significant growth in their rankings. Despite the overall surge, some major hubs like Chicago and Los Angeles are yet to fully recover their pre-COVID passenger volumes, though global traffic is forecast to grow further in 2025.</p>

          <h2>Philippines Defense Secretary Downplays Imminent War with China in South China Sea</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 21:37:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro stated that the prospect of war in the South China Sea is remote and not imminent, despite ongoing tensions. Speaking at the Reuters NEXT Asia summit, Teodoro asserted that China's "expansionist activities" in the region are driven by its own predetermined agenda, irrespective of U.S. leadership. He reiterated that China's sweeping nine-dash claims pose a major security concern for the Philippines, which remains a vocal critic of Beijing's actions. This stance contrasts with some neighboring countries that have adopted a more cautious approach. The article highlights the Philippines' commitment to international law in the face of China's unrecognized claims, emphasizing continued vigilance rather than immediate conflict.</p>

          <h2>Hong Kong Positioned to Fill Global Public Goods Gap as U.S. Aid Shifts</h2>

          <p>With the U.S. development sector undergoing significant dismantling and its foreign aid apparatus becoming more myopic, an opinion article suggests Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to fill the emerging global public goods gap. The article notes the recent high-profile debut of the China-initiated International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong, contrasting it with the perceived decline of USAID. This shift, driven by Beijing's more proactive role in international development and expectations from the Global South, could elevate Hong Kong's prominence as a hub for global cooperation. The piece argues that the "America first" mentality and outdated doctrines are hindering U.S. soft power, creating an opportunity for China's most cosmopolitan city.</p>

          <p>Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, an Iranian mother detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after 47 years in the U.S., has been released following advocacy from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Despite having lived in New Orleans for decades with U.S. citizen family members and consistently checking in with immigration authorities, Kashanian was detained while gardening. Scalise’s intervention, prompted by community support, led to a “second look” at her case, which her attorney called “absolutely crucial.” While her legal status remains uncertain, this article highlights the impact of political influence on individual immigration cases amidst broader Trump administration directives to increase arrests and deportations, raising concerns about due process for others.</p>

          <p>As forecasters predict an above-average 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, coastal homeowners are increasingly adopting climate-resilient designs to protect their properties from stronger and more frequent storms. Gene Tener's round home in Florida, for instance, is aerodynamically shaped to reduce wind pressure by 30% and includes flood vents, rated to withstand 190-mph winds. Built by Deltec Homes, such resilient constructions, though costing about 10% more, have a 99% success rate in hurricanes and can lead to significant long-term savings, like canceled flood insurance. The Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety also tests and recommends storm-ready upgrades, emphasizing the importance of reinforced roofs, high-impact windows, and garage doors.</p>

          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, known from "Tiger King," has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison and fined $55,000 for animal trafficking and money laundering. Antle admitted to illegally buying endangered animals, including chimpanzees, lions, and tigers, and laundering over half a million dollars to fund these purchases. Prosecutors highlighted his role in the black market for endangered species, while his lawyers argued for probation, citing his need to care for 150 exotic animals at his Myrtle Beach Safari. The judge, while acknowledging Antle's care for animals, noted he broke federal law. Antle apologized for his actions, which are likely the final legal chapter for the "Tiger King" figures.</p>

          <p>China has rapidly expanded its offshore wind energy capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total additions for all of 2024. The country is projected to add at least 9GW this year, representing over half of global additions, with another 22GW under construction. This surge is driven by strong central government support, including financial subsidies and strategic planning, as Beijing promotes the "high-quality development" of its marine economy. President Xi Jinping highlighted offshore wind as a key sector for job creation, energy security, and coastal economic development, demonstrating China's commitment to advancing renewable energy and maritime industries on a large scale.</p>

          <p>An Instagram advertisement featuring TV personality Gemma Collins, promoting a weight-loss drug and app, has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). Collins' post, which stated she was "two sizes down" thanks to Yazen's service and medication, was deemed illegal for advertising prescription-only weight loss drugs. Despite not naming a specific medication, the ASA concluded the ad implicitly promoted such drugs to the public, violating its code. This action is part of a broader crackdown by the ASA, which also banned eight other similar adverts from various health companies for promoting prescription-only weight loss treatments online, reinforcing regulations against misleading or illegal pharmaceutical promotion.</p>
