          <p>Florida's Operation Dragon Eye, a collaborative effort involving 20 agencies, rescued dozens of critically missing children from child sex trafficking operations. The operation, spearheaded by the U.S. Marshals Office and the state Attorney General, located 60 children aged 9 to 17, many at risk of exploitation, while also apprehending suspects involved in trafficking, drugs, and child endangerment. Authorities provided immediate medical evaluations and psychological support to the rescued children, and are setting up long-term care protocols to prevent re-victimization. Florida officials have pledged to continue fighting for missing children and making the state unsafe for traffickers, as the state is among the top three in the nation for reported human trafficking cases. The initiative underscores Florida's commitment to combating human trafficking through increased funding, legislative efforts, and awareness training. The rescue operation highlights the ongoing fight against child exploitation and the importance of providing comprehensive care to victims. Optimism surrounding these events is guarded due to the nature of the crimes. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after more than a week of aerial attacks following Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear program. This announcement came after Iran carried out a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs over Iran. Trump stated that ‚ÄúMonumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran,‚Äù though a full battle damage assessment is still pending. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the end of the conflict, according to Trump. This news follows heightened tensions and military actions between the two countries. The tone is cautiously optimistic given the potential for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel stated that he believes it is unlikely that Iran will close off the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions. He explained that Iran has threatened to close the strait for over 20 years but has never done so because it would harm its own exports, which currently amount to 1.7 million barrels a day through the strait. Braziel also noted that the market seems to agree, as oil prices dropped on Monday. He warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China are causing issues for exporters, as they are making global customers more hesitant to buy other energy products, because the U.S. has weaponized ethane. This situation could negatively impact the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy supplier of energy commodities. The situation is relatively stable.</p>

He stated that he believes his detention advanced the cause of Palestinian liberation and that he will not be deterred from speaking out against injustice. Khalil also emphasized that there is no place for antisemitism or any form of racism in the Palestinian movement, and that Jewish students are an integral part of the movement.

          <p>President Trump stated that the Iranian government provided "early notice" about a series of missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying Iran's response to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites as "very weak." He thanked Iran for the early warning, which he said prevented casualties or injuries. Diplomatic sources indicated that the counterattack from Iran was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing over the weekend. Trump also announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, though neither country has confirmed this. The situation seems to be stabilizing.</p>

          <p>A major fire that broke out at Hotspur House in Manchester city center, causing it to partly collapse, spread to a neighboring tower block, leading to the evacuation of residents. Embers from the blaze reached 1 Cambridge Street, prompting Greater Manchester Fire And Rescue Service to evacuate the building. The fire is no longer being treated as a major incident, and Manchester City Council is providing overnight accommodation for those without alternative housing. The fire at the former printing press building forced the cancellation of all trains through Manchester Oxford Road station, with significant disruption to rail services. The fire-hit building, also known as Medlock Mill, was slated for regeneration into a 36-storey student tower, but recently redesigned proposals were to be submitted to Manchester City Council. The situation has largely stabilized.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) contacted Tesla after videos surfaced showing the company's robotaxis operating erratically on public roads in Austin, Texas. One robotaxi was seen driving the wrong way down a road, while another braked abruptly in traffic, reacting to stationary police vehicles. Tesla's pilot robotaxi service, involving Model Y SUVs with FSD Unsupervised software, operates only during daylight hours and in good weather, with a human safety supervisor in the front passenger seat. NHTSA, which doesn't pre-approve new technologies, is gathering additional information and will investigate potential safety defects. Tesla has faced scrutiny over its autonomous driving technology, and the incidents have raised concerns about the safety and reliability of the robotaxi service. The incidents are likely not severe.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Trump voters expressed support for the president's actions, viewing them as aligned with his "America First" agenda. While some Republicans criticized the strikes as a betrayal of non-interventionist promises, most Trump voters interviewed believed the actions protected American interests and prevented Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Voters trusted Trump to safeguard the U.S. while avoiding a prolonged conflict, with some seeing the strikes as preventative rather than provocative. Nearly all defended Trump's decision to proceed without Congress' approval, arguing that the process of declaring wars is outdated. The voters' general trust in Trump's judgment and access to national security intelligence underpinned their support, even among those who previously criticized his foreign policy approach. The strikes do not seem to have caused any substantial upset.</p>

          <p>Following Iran's retaliation for the U.S. strike on its nuclear facilities, President Trump claimed that the response was "very weak" and that a ceasefire had been agreed upon. If the limited damage and lack of further attacks hold, Trump seems inclined to avoid further escalation and hopes for earnest negotiations. This high-risk maneuver could potentially yield positive outcomes if Iran is willing to negotiate, as a similar dynamic played out in 2020 after the killing of Qasem Soleimani. However, Trump had previously warned of an overwhelming American response to any Iranian attacks, raising concerns about future actions. The situation remains fluid, but Trump's willingness to de-escalate could lead to a resolution. The situation is cautiously hopeful.</p>

          <p>Pilots preparing for missions in the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which played a key role in strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, undergo weeks of preparation focusing on flight plans and nutrition. The B-2, demanding extraordinary endurance from its two-person crew, requires pilots to understand how nutrition affects alertness and digestion during long flights. Pilots are trained to be cognizant of foods that slow or speed digestion, critical in an aircraft with a single chemical toilet, with turkey sandwiches on wheat bread being a common meal choice. Despite its cutting-edge design, the B-2's success hinges on human performance, with pilots relying on visual cues and memorized reference points during mid-air refuelings.

          <p>Doug Emhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris, is joining the USC Gould School of Law faculty, where he will teach law students beginning in July. Emhoff, a USC law alumnus, will continue to work as a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a global law firm. He taught at Georgetown University‚Äôs law school while his wife served as vice president. The announcement comes as Harris weighs a potential run for California governor next year. Emhoff‚Äôs continued employment at Willkie Farr & Gallagher has raised eyebrows in progressive circles due to the firm's agreement with the Trump administration. The situation is more neutral than threatening.</p>
