          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are working with closer Tanner Scott to address mistakes in his pitching that have led to blown saves. Scott has been leaving pitches over the plate, resulting in hitters making good contact. The Dodgers' coaching staff is encouraging Scott to focus on more effectively locating his pitches to induce more chase out of the zone, even if it means walking a few more batters. The team is relying on Scott to stabilize the bullpen, especially with several key relievers currently injured.</p>
