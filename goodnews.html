          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. The ruling prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. President Trump hinted at a possible deal with Harvard, stating that negotiations are progressing and could lead to a 'historic' settlement. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism.</p>

One company even encourages employees to express creativity through clothing, including wearing hot pants.</p>
