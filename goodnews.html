          <p>Nippon Steel announced that a "golden share" will be issued to the U.S. government as part of its agreement to acquire U.S. Steel.  This share will grant the U.S. government veto power over major decisions.  The announcement follows President Trump's approval of the deal, subject to national security conditions.  The specifics of the golden share's power and its implications for the deal remain to be seen.</p>
