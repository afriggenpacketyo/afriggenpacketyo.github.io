          <p>A London-based entrepreneur, frustrated with the negative mental health impacts and "dating burnout" from apps like Tinder and Hinge, launched a new business focused on in-real-life (IRL) events. Her company, Haystack Dating, uses an algorithm to match attendees into small groups based on interests for activities like sports, fostering more authentic connections. This move taps into a growing trend of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, abandoning dating apps in search of more meaningful and safer social interactions. The founder's personal experiences and social media presence helped drive the initial success of the venture.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is seeing a boom, where people spend on small, mood-boosting luxuries and significant experiences like concerts, even while cutting back on daily expenses. This phenomenon, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," reflects ongoing economic anxiety, with high inflation and interest rates making major life milestones like homeownership feel unattainable for many. Instead, consumers are finding joy in more immediate, accessible purchases, from makeup and homewares to collectible toys and event tickets. Analysts predict this trend will persist for several more years due to sustained global economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that safely guided his crew back to Earth after an in-flight explosion, turning a potential catastrophe into a "successful failure." He was also part of the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the moon, from which he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space." Lovell's legacy is remembered for his courage, ingenuity, and profound contributions to human space exploration.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out in a chapel within the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba, a UNESCO World Heritage site in southern Spain, but was swiftly extinguished by firefighters. Officials praised the rapid response, stating it "averted a catastrophe" at the architecturally significant monument. The blaze, which may have been caused by an electrical short circuit, caused no major damage, and crews remained on-site to cool the structure and prevent reignition. The building, a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century that was converted to a cathedral in the 13th century, is a major tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles-based Spanish-language theater company, Nirvana Theatre, is premiering a new original play titled "CTRL" that explores the perils of artificial intelligence. The story follows four artists in Los Angeles who use a fictional app, inspired by real tools like ChatGPT, that promises to help their careers but ultimately seeks to control them. The production delves into themes of control, the modern artistic struggle, and the often-isolating nature of pursuing a creative life in Hollywood. The play marks the company's 10th anniversary of producing original Spanish-language theater.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled the lawsuit she filed after being fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over her controversial social media posts. While details are private, a Lucasfilm statement praised her professionalism and expressed hope for future collaboration. The article argues that while her posts were ill-conceived, her firing was an overreaction driven by social media outrage, and the settlement represents a reasonable conclusion rather than a capitulation to "cancel culture." The case highlights the complex relationship between entertainers, their public political speech, and corporate decision-making in a highly polarized environment.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The fact-check points out that Epstein's island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making it impossible for a plane of that size to land there; visitors arrived by boat or helicopter. Furthermore, the user who made the claim appeared to be wearing a costume pilot pin from an online retailer. The article highlights the spread of misinformation and the importance of verifying sources and basic facts.</p>
