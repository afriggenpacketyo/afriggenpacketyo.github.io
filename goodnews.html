          <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa is scheduled to visit the White House to counter President Trump's claims of genocide against white farmers in South Africa and to strengthen economic ties. Ramaphosa aims to address Trump's misinformation regarding the persecution of Afrikaners, presenting South African police data that contradicts the narrative of mass murder. The South African president also intends to engage Elon Musk, inviting Tesla to establish electric vehicle charging stations in South Africa in exchange for favorable tariffs. Ramaphosa also plans to discuss the ongoing conflict in Gaza and advocate for humanitarian aid, balancing the need to address Trump's concerns while upholding South Africa's principles.</p>

          <p>Top officials from the European Union and Britain are meeting in London to establish a new defense and security partnership, signaling a major reset in relations post-Brexit. The agreement aims to foster military cooperation and address geopolitical issues, particularly in light of Russia's war in Ukraine and the United States' evolving role in global security. Key points of discussion include trade, immigration, and the potential for Britain to participate in European defense initiatives. While challenges remain regarding fishing access and youth mobility schemes, both sides recognize the need for stronger collaboration in a world where the United States is a less reliable ally.</p>

          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a new deal, but train service will not resume until Tuesday to allow for safety inspections. The three-day strike, which halted trains across New Jersey, disrupted commutes for over 100,000 daily riders. Governor Phil Murphy announced the agreement, describing it as fair and fiscally responsible, with concessions on work rules to offset wage increases. NJ Transit will continue its contingency plan on Monday, including bus service from designated park-and-ride lots, while rail tickets will be cross-honored on bus and light rail lines.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after a challenging race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion's initial victory in the first round was fueled by anger over the annulled presidential race due to Russian interference claims. Dan secured 54% of the vote, attracting support from over six million Romanians who seek profound change in the country. While Simion had strong support in the diaspora, Dan's victory signifies a commitment to fighting corruption and maintaining support for Ukraine, contrasting Simion's attacks on the EU and calls to cut aid to Kyiv.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' estimates and signaling continued concerns about consumption in the Chinese economy. Industrial output grew 6.1% year on year, exceeding expectations, while fixed-asset investment rose 4.0% in the first four months. Despite trade war fears, the urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1% in April, and some analysts expect China's economic expansion to stay above 5% in the second quarter following a robust 5.4% growth rate in the first quarter. The Chinese government has implemented stimulus measures to support businesses and stimulate consumption across different sectors.</p>

          <p>Prostate cancer experts say that former President Joseph R. Biden‚Äôs diagnosis is serious, as the cancer has spread to his bones and is Stage 4. However, recent advances in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer have significantly improved survival rates for men with advanced disease. Treatments such as cutting off testosterone and using androgen blockers, along with improvements in diagnosis through PSMA PET scans, offer hope for patients like Mr. Biden. Federal research funding, particularly through Mr. Biden‚Äôs cancer moonshot effort, has contributed to this progress.</p>

          <p>China's economy showed resilience in April despite the impact of high US tariffs, with industrial output growing by 6.1% and retail sales rising by 5.1%. These figures were observed during the period when triple-digit tariffs were in full effect before Washington and Beijing agreed to remove or pause most of the duties. The Chinese government has vowed to stabilize employment, businesses, markets, and expectations in response to global trade uncertainties. The Politburo, a high-level political body, affirmed the need to shore up domestic consumption in an environment where the future of global trade is less than certain.</p>
