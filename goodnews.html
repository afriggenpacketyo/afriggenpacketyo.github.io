        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters through a mutual model. This proposal aims to rebuild trust and reform the organization's culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. While the government does not plan to reduce the current network of over 11,500 branches, it is seeking a "fresh vision" for the state-owned entity. The consultation will also explore what future services, particularly banking, the Post Office should offer in an evolving market.</p>

          <h2>Economic Uncertainty and Consumer Behavior to Shape Gold Prices in Late 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 09:59:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that gold prices, currently trading near elevated levels, will likely maintain their value through the second half of 2025, with potential for new highs if economic risks increase. Key drivers include persistent global tensions, which bolster gold's status as a safe-haven asset, and sticky inflation, prompting investors to seek a hedge. Consumer behavior is also a significant factor, with new buyers entering the market for security while long-term holders sell to realize gains. While silver presents a more affordable alternative, it is also more volatile and sensitive to industrial demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience warns that intimacy is essential for a thriving relationship and can be undermined by common, often overlooked behaviors. The article identifies four key intimacy blockers: constant phone use, unresolved feelings about an ex, a persistent negativity bias, and an unmanaged stress response. The therapist explains that intimacy is about more than just physical connection; it's about vulnerability and presence. To combat these issues, she advises setting screen-free boundaries, processing past relationships, challenging negative thoughts, and openly communicating with a partner about stress triggers and needs.</p>

          <h2>Communication Expert Advises on How to Show Empathy More Effectively</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 09:45:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A communication coach and former journalist advises against the common empathic response of saying "I've been there, too," as it can unintentionally shift the focus to oneself. Instead, the article suggests several techniques for showing true empathy, which is centered on deep listening. These include being fully present with open body language, repeating a meaningful word the speaker used to encourage deeper reflection, and becoming comfortable with silence to allow for a natural conversational rhythm. The most powerful tool recommended is simply saying "Tell me more," which empowers the speaker and fosters a more authentic connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, trading above $121,000 as U.S. lawmakers prepared for 'Crypto Week' to deliberate on new industry regulations. The rally is fueled by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and growing institutional demand, with some analysts predicting the price could reach $125,000 in the coming months. The proposed legislation, which includes the Genius Act for stablecoins, aims to create a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets and is supported by President Trump. This policy clarity is seen as a major boost for investor confidence and long-term institutional buying. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with top accounts currently offering high yields. While national average rates for one-year to five-year CDs range from 1.67% to 2.01% APY, competitive online banks are providing much higher rates, with some one-year CDs reaching 4.40% APY. To secure the best rates, savers should look to online banks, which have lower overhead, and consider short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher rates than long-term options.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 09:18:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, current mortgage rates remain a key factor in affordability. As of mid-July 2025, national average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage are around 6.70%, while a 15-year fixed mortgage averages approximately 5.88%. To secure the best possible rate in this elevated environment, borrowers should focus on strengthening their credit profile, as scores in the mid-700s or higher receive the most favorable terms. It is also crucial to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders, as rates and fees can vary significantly, impacting the total cost of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old inmate who escaped from a prison in Lyon, France, has been recaptured by authorities. The man made his getaway by hiding inside a large bag that was carried out by a fellow inmate who was being legitimately released from the facility. The escape, which was discovered 24 hours after it occurred, was described by a prison administration director as an extremely rare event that revealed serious systemic dysfunctions. The escapee was found and arrested in a nearby commune, though his accomplice remains at large. An internal investigation has been launched into the security failures.</p>

          <p>Chris Kirby, a former burnt-out restaurant cook, founded Ithaca Hummus while studying at Cornell University after identifying a culinary gap at the local farmers market. Starting with just a $450 blender and a few thousand dollars, he balanced his studies with making and selling his product, focusing on a fresh, high-quality recipe. By focusing on deep market penetration rather than rapid geographic expansion, the brand built a strong reputation and is now sold in over 8,000 stores. The company, which has resisted outside investment to maintain its vision, is on track to generate $50 million in revenue this year.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has discreetly pushed back against escalating attacks from the Trump administration by publishing a "Frequently Asked Questions" page on its website. The page defends the central bank's $2.5 billion headquarters renovation, directly addressing criticisms from officials like OMB Director Russell Vought, who accused Fed Chair Jerome Powell of mismanagement. The Fed's FAQ clarifies that no new VIP dining rooms are being built and explains that cost increases are due to unforeseen conditions and design changes. This move is seen as the Fed gearing up to defend its independence against a pressure campaign.</p>

Following a recent forum, Malaysia, the current ASEAN chair, announced that China has committed to signing the treaty without reservation, and indicated that Russia may do so as well.

He noted that the PBOC will carefully calibrate the pace of its policy implementation, monitoring domestic and international economic conditions.
