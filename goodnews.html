          <p>Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne will depart after 10 years with the club, and manager Pep Guardiola has praised him as the second-best passer he has ever worked with, behind only Lionel Messi. Guardiola expressed that it would be difficult to find another player with De Bruyne's passing ability, citing his unique talent and contributions to the team, particularly in the final third. He emphasized De Bruyne's exceptional stats, goals, and assists, solidifying his place as one of the best players in the club's history. Guardiola previously managed other pass-masters such as Andres Iniesta and Xavi at Barcelona, and former City midfielder David Silva.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful, declaring DOGE's actions "null and void." The decision orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose, and criticizes the administration's use of force and threats to seize the USIP headquarters, despite the agency's independence from the executive branch. Judge Beryl Howell emphasized that Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional. The USIP expressed its readiness to resume its programs following the ruling.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase will permit its clients to purchase bitcoin, despite CEO Jamie Dimon's continued skepticism about the digital currency. While the bank will not custody bitcoin directly, it will include it in client statements. Dimon expressed concerns about money laundering, lack of clarity in ownership, and associations with illicit activities, but defended the right of individuals to invest in bitcoin. This decision signifies a notable shift for the largest U.S. bank, given Dimon's history of criticizing bitcoin and the broader crypto market, and reflects the growing mainstream acceptance of bitcoin as an investment.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given suggests that Jack Grealish may need to leave the club this summer due to limited playing time. Grealish, a record signing for City, has struggled to secure regular starts and was an unused substitute in the FA Cup final. Given criticized the way Grealish is being treated, highlighting his talent and potential, and suggested that the player should explore opportunities elsewhere to revive his career. With Kevin de Bruyne potentially leaving, Given believes Grealish could be the perfect replacement in the midfield but may not get the chance at City.</p>

          <p>A proposal to eliminate federal income taxes on tips, championed by President Trump, has garnered bipartisan support but faces criticism over its actual benefits for low-income workers. While the policy is popular, reducing federal revenues by about $11 billion annually, labor economists and budget analysts express concerns about its impact on various stakeholders. The policy push has created odd bedfellows, with the National Restaurant Association supporting it and labor economists, budget hawks, and some restaurant interest groups opposing it. The analysis suggests that the tax benefits may not extend as far for lower-income workers as many may think, potentially favoring middle-income individuals more.</p>
