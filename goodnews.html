          <p>An immersive art exhibition in Salford combines digital versions of portraits from the National Portrait Gallery with animation and voiceovers to tell the stories of British icons like Charles Darwin, Amy Winehouse, and Ncuti Gatwa. The exhibition aims to reach new audiences outside of London and raise revenue for the gallery. While the National Portrait Gallery in London offers free access to original portraits, tickets to the immersive show cost up to £35, raising concerns about accessibility due to the cost of living. The article also mentions a separate free immersive experience featuring LS Lowry's artwork in Salford, showcasing a growing trend in immersive art installations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a Cabinet shuffle, nominating Michael Waltz as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and appointing Secretary of State Marco Rubio as interim national security advisor. The move came after Waltz faced scrutiny for inadvertently including a reporter in a Signal chat discussing a U.S. military strike. Vice President Vance downplayed the Signal incident, suggesting Waltz was better suited for the U.N. role after reforms to the National Security Council. Rubio's appointment was unexpected, with State Department spokesperson Bruce learning of the change during a press briefing. This article highlights the ever-changing landscape of Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>Migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border remained at historically low levels in April, continuing a trend observed since President Trump's implementation of stricter immigration policies. Border Patrol recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions, a slight increase from March but still among the lowest figures in decades. Experts suggest that the administration's tough rhetoric, rapid deportations, and dismantling of Biden-era programs have deterred migrants from attempting to cross the border. This marks a significant shift from the high levels of illegal crossings experienced under the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall may become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild, due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding program. The lynx was moved to Germany's Black Forest, where it will be monitored in an enclosure to assess its survival skills. Zoos are now focused on conservation, and the goal is to increase genetic diversity in central Europe. The key question is whether the lynx, having spent its life in captivity, will avoid human interaction.</p>

However, the company anticipates $900 million in additional costs for the upcoming quarter due to tariffs. CEO Tim Cook expressed uncertainty about future tariff developments, noting the difficulty in predicting beyond June. The company's stock dropped in after-hours trading, likely due to the tariff news and weaker-than-expected revenue from its services division. Cook stated that China would remain a major manufacturer, but India and Vietnam would increase production of iPhones, iPads, and Macs.</p>
