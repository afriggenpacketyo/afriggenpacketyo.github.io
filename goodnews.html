        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent US court ruling against Trump's tariffs has sparked questions about its implications for the UK's trade deal with the US; however, the ruling does not affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute the majority of UK exports to the US. While the UK has secured a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, this agreement has yet to be implemented. The ruling blocks Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods like salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, creating uncertainty for British exporters. Businesses face challenges in planning and investing due to the unpredictable nature of international trade standoffs. </p>

          <p>China has agreed to initiate steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Japanese authorities expect China to issue a public notice easing the ban and opening registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from ten prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The agreement follows technical talks and requires products to pass radiation checks, marking a potential improvement in relations between the two countries.</p>

These deals often employ a newco structure, combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle.

          <p>India's federal finance ministry has requested the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to relax its proposed new rules on gold loans to ensure small borrowers are not adversely affected. The ministry suggests excluding small ticket borrowers below 200,000 rupees from the tighter rules to ensure timely loan disbursement. Additionally, the ministry proposed delaying the implementation of the new rules until January 1, 2026, to allow lenders adequate preparation. The RBI's proposed rules aim to tighten monitoring and disbursement of gold loans, which surged nearly 30% between September and February. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions by the agency. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a potential shift in the U.S.'s approach to crypto regulation, particularly as the Trump administration aims to be an ally to the industry. Binance is also deepening its footprint in Pakistan, with Zhao appointed as an advisor to the country's newly formed Crypto Council.</p>
