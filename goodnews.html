          <p>Pfizer's new obesity drug acquisition, Metsera, has released encouraging mid-stage trial data for its lead injection, MET-097i, paving the way for phase three studies. The drug, a GLP-1 class treatment designed for once-a-month dosing, demonstrated up to 14.1% average weight loss after 28 weeks, with some participants achieving up to 26.5% weight loss. Importantly, it showed good tolerability with modest gastrointestinal side effects and a low discontinuation rate, suggesting a potential advantage over existing treatments. While head-to-head studies are still needed, the results indicate MET-097i could become a competitive entrant in the lucrative obesity market, potentially generating over $5 billion in peak annual sales.

          <p>For older homeowners, reverse mortgages offer a way to convert home equity into cash without monthly loan payments, appealing amidst high home values and inflation. However, this article warns against common pitfalls, including ignoring true costs like origination fees, mortgage insurance premiums, and ongoing property expenses, which can be substantial. Borrowers must also consider the significant impact on heirs, who will need to repay or refinance the loan to keep the property. It advises against borrowing more than necessary, understanding the potential effect on means-tested benefits like Medicaid, and crucially, seeking independent professional guidance beyond a lender's pitch.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted unconstitutionally by adopting a policy targeting noncitizen pro-Palestinian students and faculty for deportation, violating their First Amendment free speech rights. Judge William Young's scathing 161-page ruling found that State and Homeland Security officials misused their sweeping powers to "strike fear" and effectively curb lawful pro-Palestinian speech on college campuses. The case was initiated after immigration authorities arrested recent Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, and the administration has since canceled visas for hundreds of students and scholars.
