          <p>A recent influx of young Chinese immigrants to Paris is driving a significant expansion of the city's Chinese culinary scene, with a focus on authentic, regional dishes. New establishments like Tonton Mao are moving beyond traditional Cantonese fare to offer specialized cuisines such as northeastern kaochuan, or seasoned meat skewers. These restaurants cater to a growing demographic of young people and feature chefs and decor directly from China, creating immersive dining experiences that transport patrons from the streets of Paris.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a new rescue plan aimed at preventing the financial collapse of Thames Water, the largest water company in the United Kingdom. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances and fund improvements. The investors stated their plan would rebuild the company without requiring any taxpayer funding, focusing on reducing pollution and rebuilding public trust after years of financial instability.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda made landfall in Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, bringing powerful winds and heavy rainfall to the island nation before weakening to a Category 1 hurricane. As of early Thursday, the storm's center was moving away from Bermuda and was expected to transition into an extratropical cyclone. While a hurricane warning remained in effect, there were no immediate reports of significant damage from the storm, which was forecast to produce 2 to 4 inches of rain and life-threatening surf conditions along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI has finalized a secondary share sale worth $6.6 billion, allowing current and former employees to sell stock and cementing the company's valuation at a record $500 billion. The transaction, which involved investors like Thrive Capital and SoftBank, makes OpenAI the world's most valuable privately held company. The lower-than-authorized participation in the sale is reportedly viewed internally as a sign of confidence in the company's long-term prospects amid intensifying competition for AI talent.

          <p>Chinese researchers are preparing for future lunar exploration by testing and training four-legged robotic dogs in environments that simulate the moon's underground lava tubes. These tests are being conducted in a cave system in Heilongjiang province, which closely resembles the lunar subsurface, an area of high scientific interest for potential human bases. The robotic dogs act as "scouts," navigating narrow passages inaccessible to humans to perform surveying tasks, thereby advancing the embodied intelligence technologies needed for deep-space exploration.</p>
