          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 16:38:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising national credit card debt, consumers are increasingly exploring options like debt relief programs and credit counseling. Debt relief, such as settlement or consolidation, aims to reduce the total amount owed but can significantly damage credit scores. In contrast, credit counseling focuses on creating manageable repayment plans over several years, which has a milder impact on credit but requires disciplined budgeting. The article suggests the best choice depends on an individual's financial situation, debt level, and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attendees at the 80th UN General Assembly noted a different atmosphere, marked by anxiety and urgency following significant U.S. foreign aid cuts. Global health leaders expressed concerns about a lack of cohesive action, with some lamenting the cuts while others focused on finding new, sustainable solutions to global health crises. Despite the challenges, some participants felt a new energy and a stronger push for collaboration between the public and private sectors to overcome the funding gaps and continue addressing poverty and disease worldwide.</p>

          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have had a minimal impact on the monthly payments for home equity loans. A new $20,000 home equity loan would currently cost approximately $246 per month for a 10-year term or $194 for a 15-year term, only slightly less than before the cuts. Despite the modest change, home equity loans remain an affordable borrowing option with fixed rates that are lower than personal loans or credit cards. Their predictable payments and potential tax advantages continue to make them attractive for homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations, ending a preemption of the late-night show. The broadcaster had pulled the program following controversial remarks made by host Jimmy Kimmel regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After a six-day suspension by the network, Kimmel's show returned to the air, but Sinclair and Nexstar stations had continued to block it. Sinclair stated its goal was to ensure programming serves its communities while honoring network obligations.</p>

          <p>A rare, brightly colored orange lobster was rescued from a supermarket in upstate New York and released back into the wild. A shopper named Kyle Brancato noticed the one-in-30-million creature, purchased it to save it, and temporarily housed it in a tank at home. With assistance from the wildlife group Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium, the lobster, nicknamed Jean-Clawed Van Damme, was safely returned to the Long Island Sound, just ahead of National Lobster Day.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been readmitted to the UK's Labour Party after a year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs who defied the party line by voting to scrap the government's two-child benefit cap shortly after Labour's 2024 election victory. Their return comes as the Labour government faces increasing pressure to abolish the cap, with senior ministers recently suggesting that scrapping the controversial policy is now "on the table."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have won their 12th division title in 13 years, but players acknowledged that the season was a difficult journey. The team faced numerous challenges, including injuries, slumps, and bullpen collapses, which some attributed to a "World Series hangover" after their championship last year. Despite the adversity, the team believes these struggles have made them more battle-tested and better prepared for the pressures of the upcoming postseason as they aim to become the first repeat champions in over two decades.</p>
