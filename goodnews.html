        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, which aim to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments by ¬£5bn a year by 2030. The MPs are concerned about the potential impact on poverty levels, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. The amendment highlights the need for social security reform but objects to the bill's current form, citing consequences for the job market and public health. If the amendment is selected and supported by a majority of MPs, the bill's progress through Parliament could be halted, posing a significant challenge to the government's welfare plans.</p>
