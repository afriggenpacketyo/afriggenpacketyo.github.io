          <p>The Webb Space Telescope has identified a previously unknown, tiny moon orbiting Uranus, bringing the planet's total known moons to 29. This newly discovered celestial body, approximately six miles wide, eluded detection for decades due to its faintness and small size, even escaping the notice of the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its 1986 flyby. The observation was made in February by the telescope's near-infrared camera. Scientists believe this addition highlights the ongoing discoveries possible with advanced astronomical instruments. The moon is currently nameless, awaiting official designation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively working to arrange a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which would be their first face-to-face interaction since the conflict began over three years ago. Trump, following recent White House meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders, expressed optimism about the possibility of a deal, emphasizing the need for both sides to show flexibility. Security guarantees for Ukraine were a key discussion point, with European leaders willing to contribute ground troops and the U.S. considering air support, though Trump ruled out American ground troops. The proposed summit aims to accelerate peace efforts and avoid further casualties.</p>

          <p>For individuals with substantial savings, high-yield savings accounts offer a compelling middle ground between low-interest traditional accounts and volatile investments. A $150,000 deposit in a high-yield account with a 4.35% APY could earn over $1,600 in three months and more than $6,500 in a year, significantly outpacing traditional savings. While interest rates are variable, they generally remain competitive, offering substantial returns with safety and flexibility. Savers are advised to consider factors beyond just APY, such as fees, minimum balances, and customer service, to maximize their financial benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The senior living real estate market is on the cusp of a significant boom, driven by over 4 million baby boomers reaching age 80 in the next five years, yet supply growth has plummeted. Occupancy rates are rapidly rising in active adult and assisted living communities, while annual inventory growth has dropped to below 1%, the lowest since 2006. This massive supply-demand imbalance, exacerbated by higher interest rates hindering new development, is creating a critical problem for the industry. Companies like Ventas and Harrison Street are investing heavily, recognizing the strong and durable demand tailwinds in this sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings has maintained its AA+ credit rating for the U.S., with a stable outlook, despite concerns about growing national debt and recent tax cuts. The agency noted that significant tariff revenue generated by the Trump administration's trade policies is expected to largely offset weaker fiscal outcomes from the Republican's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While acknowledging a slowdown in the U.S. economy and a faltering job market, S&P highlighted the nation's resilient economy and strong GDP growth. The report suggests tariffs, though paid by U.S. importers and potentially leading to higher consumer prices, are bolstering government finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians in Los Angeles and Orange counties has successfully reclaimed a half-acre of ancestral land in San Gabriel, marking the first time in centuries their tribe has owned territory. The land, previously owned by the Presbytery of San Gabriel, was transferred for $0 and will serve as the Gabrieleno Tongva Tribal Center at Siban’gna, hosting cultural ceremonies, government meetings, and community programs. This significant achievement offers healing and connection to a land their ancestors walked, especially for a tribe without federal recognition that has historically struggled to secure land and preserve its culture. The tribe hopes other institutions will follow this precedent.</p>

Management reaffirmed full-year guidance, noting building strength in core categories and positive same-store sales growth, particularly in July. Lower interest rates are expected to stimulate the stalled housing market by reducing mortgage rates and encouraging home renovation activity, which directly benefits Home Depot. The company's strategic acquisitions, like SRS Distribution and the pending GMS deal, further position it for growth as economic conditions improve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's dilemma about whether to be kind to an aging stepfather who was previously unkind, despite feeling no obligation. The columnist, James Parker, argues for rising above "petty grievances" and extending kindness, viewing it as a rebalancing of scales. He suggests that actively ignoring someone is stressful and that showing generosity to a diminished antagonist can be empowering. Parker emphasizes that while he may be personally jaundiced, the values of niceness and positivity are inherently beneficial, advising the reader to engage with the stepfather as a form of personal growth and even a unique form of "revenge."

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the U.S. government should receive an equity stake in Intel in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, converting grants from the previous administration into equity under the Trump administration. This move, which would make the government a significant non-voting shareholder, aims to give American taxpayers a "piece of the action." Intel's shares rallied on reports of potential government involvement, alongside a $2 billion investment from SoftBank. Lutnick suggested similar equity-for-funds deals could be pursued with other CHIPS recipients, signaling a new approach to government funding in critical industries like semiconductor manufacturing.

The decision to return comes at a transitional moment for the tour, expanding its roster of Signature Events and adding to a crowded spring schedule.

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts remain an attractive option for savers with substantial funds, offering predictable and secure interest earnings despite a slight cooling of rates from their peak. A $150,000 CD investment can yield significant returns, ranging from approximately $1,587 over three months to over $34,000 across a five-year term, depending on the rate and duration. Unlike variable-rate savings accounts, CDs lock in the interest rate for the entire term, providing stability and peace of mind.
