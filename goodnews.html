          <h2>Trump Proposes Shift from Quarterly to Semiannual Corporate Earnings Reports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:02:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports to encourage long-term strategic thinking. This idea, which would require SEC approval, echoes previous proposals by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon who argued the current system fosters an unhealthy focus on short-term profits. Supporters of the quarterly system maintain that it provides essential transparency and timely information for investors, arguing that less frequent reporting could create more difficulties than benefits in the U.S. market. The proposal contrasts with current U.S. regulations but aligns more closely with practices in the U.K. and European Union.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reportedly established a framework for a deal concerning the ownership of TikTok, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The announcement followed negotiations in Spain and was teased by President Trump, who stated a deal was reached to save a company popular with young people. President Trump is scheduled to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday to finalize the agreement, which is described as being between two private parties with commercial terms already settled. This development comes after Trump delayed enforcement of a congressional bill that would have banned the app unless its parent company, ByteDance, divested.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value increased after CEO Elon Musk disclosed a purchase of approximately $1 billion worth of the company's shares, his first open-market buy since early 2020. The acquisition of 2.57 million shares is being interpreted by investors as a strong signal of his confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer's future. This move comes as Tesla's stock has faced challenges this year due to slowing sales and as shareholders prepare to vote on a new, potentially massive compensation package for Musk. Analysts believe the purchase reinforces Musk's commitment to transforming Tesla into a leader in AI, autonomous driving, and robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching near-record highs of over $3,600 per ounce, some financial experts argue it remains a worthwhile investment. They cite its potential for further growth, especially with an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, which could make gold a more attractive asset. Additionally, gold is seen as a hedge against a depreciating U.S. dollar and serves as a low-risk portfolio diversifier that is not tied to the performance of other asset classes. The article notes that various accessible options, such as fractional gold or ETFs, allow investors to enter the market without substantial initial capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged over 4% on Monday, pushing it past the milestone. This significant gain follows a favorable antitrust ruling where the penalties imposed by a judge were less severe than investors had feared, which sent shares to a record high. Despite facing increased competition from AI advancements and regulatory pressures in the U.S. and Europe, Alphabet's stock has risen more than 30% this year, outperforming the Nasdaq composite index.

          <p>Despite ongoing challenges like geopolitical tensions and strict internet controls, there are signs of a renewed interest among Europeans, particularly younger generations, in pursuing career opportunities in China. More than two years after stringent COVID-19 policies led to an exodus of foreigners, the country's rapid technological and entrepreneurial growth is once again proving to be a significant draw. For many young professionals, China represents a dynamic environment with vast potential for career advancement. This perspective highlights an emerging age divide in outlooks toward working in the country, as younger Europeans seem more willing to navigate the complexities for the potential rewards.</p>

          <p>Sushila Karki, a former chief justice, has been appointed as Nepal's first female interim prime minister following violent youth-led protests against corruption that forced the previous leader to resign. The 73-year-old was chosen after talks between the president and protest leaders, who valued her reputation for integrity and justice. Her appointment is seen as a reflection of growing trust in women's leadership in a country where patriarchal structures have been slowly eroding. Karki's immediate challenges include overseeing the rebuilding of government structures destroyed in the unrest, conducting fresh elections scheduled for March 2026, and navigating a complex political landscape to restore stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an expected Federal Reserve rate cut, mortgage experts advise prospective homebuyers to act promptly but with discipline. Key recommendations include getting a fresh pre-approval to reflect increased buying power, comparing offers from various lenders to secure the best rate, and locking in that rate quickly. However, they caution against common mistakes such as assuming rates will continue to fall, overextending one's budget based on a new pre-approval amount, or failing to shop around beyond one's current bank. The goal is to capitalize on lower rates to enter the housing market competitively without taking on undue financial risk or letting urgency compromise sound decision-making.

          <p>Financial experts are advising student loan borrowers on how to navigate unexpected transfers of their loans to new servicing companies, a process that can cause confusion and concern. Borrowers may discover the change with little notice and find their accounts placed in administrative forbearance, pausing payments but potentially accruing interest. To avoid payments getting lost during the transition, it is recommended to set aside the payment amount and wait until the new account is fully active before submitting it. It is also crucial for borrowers to download their payment history from the old servicer and verify that all information, including payment plans, has been transferred correctly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Job seekers are increasingly using AI tools for applications, but career experts warn against over-reliance, which can lead to significant errors and harm one's chances. A common issue is AI "hallucinating" or fabricating information to better match a job description, creating inaccuracies that candidates cannot defend in an interview. Additionally, AI-generated resumes and cover letters often lack authenticity and share a uniform structure, making them less likely to stand out to recruiters. Experts recommend using AI to polish a self-written draft rather than for initial creation, and always proofreading carefully to avoid embarrassing mistakes like including AI prompts or incorrect company names.</p>

          <p>Isadore Hall, a former state legislator with extensive experience in local politics, has announced his campaign to challenge incumbent Kenneth Mejia for the position of Los Angeles City Controller. Hall is positioning himself as an experienced leader who will focus on accountability, contrasting with Mejia, whom he accuses of prioritizing "social media theatrics." The race sets up a classic confrontation between an establishment Democrat, backed by prominent officials, and the city's ascendant left, represented by Mejia, who won in 2022 as a political outsider. The election will test whether voter sentiment has shifted since the last cycle, which was marked by deep distrust in City Hall.</p>
