The company delayed its Apple Intelligence feature, citing the need for more development time.

          <p>WWE's recent events in Los Angeles, including Worlds Collide and Money in the Bank, brought excitement but also mixed reactions. Worlds Collide, featuring AAA stars, broke viewership records on YouTube and celebrated Mexican wrestling. Money in the Bank, however, was marred by controversial decisions, particularly in the ladder matches. The veteran Naomi's victory in the women's match and Seth Rollins' second Money in the Bank win sparked debate. The return of R-Truth at the end of Money in the Bank was a pleasant surprise, potentially saving the show. </p>
