          <p>Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is projected to win a crucial by-election in the Alberta riding of Battle River-Crowfoot, ensuring his return to the House of Commons. Poilievre secured a commanding lead with over 80% of the vote in the conservative stronghold, a special election called after the previous MP stepped aside. This victory comes four months after his party's defeat in the general election and allows him to re-enter parliament ahead of a mandatory party leadership review scheduled for January.</p>

          <p>In a question-and-answer session, Formula 1 experts address various fan inquiries, dismissing the idea of artificially wetting tracks as it would compromise the sport's purity. The discussion highlights aesthetically celebrated cars like the 1990 Ferrari 641, once displayed in the Museum of Modern Art, and the current McLaren MCL39. The article also explains the technical differences between a car's performance in qualifying versus a race, attributing it to how peak tire grip can mask a car's deficiencies over a single lap. Finally, it clarifies the strict FIA rules governing engine and gearbox replacements.</p>

          <p>The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery has successfully reached its £3.8 million fundraising target to acquire Dame Barbara Hepworth's sculpture, "Sculpture With Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue And Red." The 1943 piece, which had been in private ownership, was placed under a temporary export ban due to its cultural significance. The campaign received widespread support, including over 2,800 public donations and major grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund. The rare wooden carving will now go on permanent public display in the artist's home city of Wakefield.</p>

          <p>The landmark 113-year-old Kiruna Church in Sweden is being moved 5 kilometers to a new site to make way for the expansion of the world's largest underground iron ore mine. The massive relocation project, financed by mine operator LKAB, involves lifting the 672-ton wooden structure onto remote-controlled trailers for a two-day journey. While celebrated as an engineering feat, the mine's expansion has drawn criticism from the indigenous Sami community, who warn that it threatens their traditional reindeer migration routes and livelihoods. Thousands of residents are also being relocated as mining activity weakens the ground beneath the original town center.</p>

The visit signals a continued thaw in relations, which had deteriorated after a deadly 2020 border clash. Discussions covered a range of topics including trade, border stability, and global developments, with both sides expressing a desire to move forward from a difficult period. This rapprochement occurs as India's relationship with the United States faces new challenges, particularly over trade tariffs and foreign policy.</p>

The personal essay critiques a culture that focuses on calories over nutrition and notes the difficulty of using health apps that default to calorie counting. Ultimately, she confronts how her identity became tied to her eating habits, both during her illness and in recovery.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering acquiring a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, a move that would make the U.S. government its largest shareholder. According to reports, the plan involves converting some or all of Intel's $10.9 billion in grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into company shares. This potential government intervention is seen as part of a broader strategy to bolster U.S. leadership in the critical semiconductor industry and support the struggling company, which has been a major recipient of federal funds.

          <p>China has unveiled images of a prototype tilt-rotor aircraft, which appears to be the country's first crewed version of such a vehicle. The aircraft combines the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing plane, similar to the U.S. V-22 Osprey. A photograph shows the prototype hovering with its rotors in a vertical position, indicating it was in helicopter mode. While this technology offers significant versatility, it is also known for its mechanical complexity, high costs, and historical safety concerns, posing challenges for its development and deployment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Open has revamped its mixed doubles competition, attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, and Novak Djokovic with a shorter format and a $1 million prize. The move is intended to elevate the event's profile and draw more fan interest, but it has polarized the tennis community. While some praise the initiative for its promotional value, many doubles specialists, like Jamie Murray, have criticized it as a "glorified exhibition." They argue it devalues the Grand Slam title and redirects significant prize money away from career doubles players to singles stars who are already top earners.</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized artificial intelligence to generate facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were transported to Australia in the 19th century. A team of volunteers traced the lives of 60 individuals deported from Anglesey for crimes ranging from theft to trampling on turnips. The AI profiles were created using detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and, where available, photos of modern-day descendants. The project sheds light on a period when an estimated 162,000 convicts were sent to Australia, with many never returning and instead forging new lives and families.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing travel trend, dubbed "coolcations," is seeing tourists avoid Europe's traditional summer hotspots in favor of cooler, quieter, and off-peak destinations. This shift is driven by concerns over record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires that have plagued southern Europe. Data from the European Travel Commission shows declining interest in popular Mediterranean destinations, while travel to Nordic countries, the Baltics, and alpine regions is increasing. While this trend may alleviate overtourism, it poses economic challenges for southern European nations heavily reliant on summer tourism, forcing the industry to adapt to a changing climate.</p>
