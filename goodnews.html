          <p>A pet zebra has been on the loose in Tennessee for several days after escaping and causing disruptions on a highway near Nashville, according to local officials. Professional tracking teams and a K9 unit have been deployed to aid in the search for the animal, which initially escaped into a wooded area off Interstate 24. The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office is in communication with the zebra's owner, who acquired the animal just the previous Friday. Anyone who spots the zebra is urged to contact the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office to assist in its safe recovery.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell, 49, has been exonerated after spending 28 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, marking the 51st exoneration linked to the misconduct of former Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was framed for murder after refusing to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect in a shooting case. There was no evidence connecting McDowell to the crime, but Guevara coerced false identifications from witnesses. McDowell was granted clemency in 2020, and his murder conviction was thrown out after DNA evidence excluded him as the source of DNA found on the victim's clothing.</p>

          <p>Police in central Florida have identified the body of an 84-year-old man, Edman Eric Gleed, more than 31 years after his remains were found floating near a bridge in Clearwater. Advanced DNA tests and investigative genetic genealogy were used to connect Gleed to his relatives. Gleed had been listed as missing from Fairfax County, Virginia, and was previously known as "Pinellas County John Doe 1993." The identification provides closure to Gleed's family after decades of uncertainty.</p>
