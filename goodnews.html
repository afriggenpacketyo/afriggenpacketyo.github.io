          <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has been elected as Germany's chancellor in a second-round parliamentary vote after initially failing to secure the necessary support. Merz received 325 votes, surpassing the required 316 out of 630 members of parliament. The German Dax stock market index pared losses following the announcement of the second vote's results. The CDU is expected to form a coalition government with the center-left Social Democratic Party, outlining plans for policies including migration, tax rule changes, and social security measures.</p>

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has classified the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as "confirmed right-wing extremist," intensifying debates over a potential ban of the party. This classification has already led to consequences, including the exclusion of AfD politicians from official trips. CDU leader Friedrich Merz stated that it is now inconceivable to elect AfD members to committee chairperson positions. The AfD has filed a lawsuit against the intelligence agency, claiming the classification is unlawful and politically motivated, though the agency's assessment is based on court rulings providing evidence of the party's radicalism.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have agreed to a trade deal after three years of negotiations, aiming to facilitate UK exports of whisky, cars, and other products to India, while cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. The deal does not include changes to immigration policy, including for Indian students in the UK. The British government hails the benefits for UK businesses and consumers as "massive". Once in force, UK consumers are likely to benefit from reduced tariffs on Indian goods, while UK firms can expand exports to India. Gin and whisky tariffs will be halved, with further reductions in later years.</p>

However, the report also indicated that the Fujian would require longer sea trials than China's other carriers due to the complexity of the launch system. The adoption of the electromagnetic catapult system means that the Fujian's carrier-based aircraft would take off with full fuel and full ordnance.</p>

          <p>The Haenyeo divers of Jeju Island, South Korea, have evolved unique genetic adaptations due to their generations-long cultural practice of deep-sea diving. Genomic analysis reveals distinctive traits, including bradycardia (slow heart rate) and genetic mutations associated with cold tolerance and decreased diastolic blood pressure. These adaptations may protect pregnant women while diving and could potentially lead to new medical therapies for conditions like stroke. The study highlights how humans can evolve genetic adaptations in response to long-standing marine-based cultural practices.</p>
