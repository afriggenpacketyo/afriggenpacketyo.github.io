          <p>Amid protests in Los Angeles, officials have outlined the rules of force for deployed National Guard and Marine personnel, stating they will primarily protect federal buildings and personnel without directly engaging protesters unless necessary. Troops are carrying weapons, but their guns will not be loaded with ammunition unless self-defense is required, and they will not be using rubber bullets or pepper spray. The rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done, and the personnel are instructed to de-escalate situations as much as possible. The Los Angeles Police Department emphasized the need for clear communication between agencies to ensure a coordinated and lawful response during this critical time. </p>
