          <p>Early tallies in the Irish presidential election indicate significant support for independent candidate Catherine Connolly over her main rival, Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. The election, which will decide the successor to President Michael D. Higgins, saw a third candidate's name remain on the ballot despite his withdrawal, leading to a high number of spoiled votes. Despite the strong showing for Connolly, who is backed by several left-wing parties, overall voter turnout is projected to be near a record low.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Viral Claims of Widespread German Christmas Market Cancellations</h2>

          <p>Social media posts claiming that Germany has canceled its Christmas markets for 2025 are false, according to a fact-check. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like renovations or low revenue, the vast majority of Germany's over 2,500 iconic markets are scheduled to open as planned. The viral claims appear to originate from a single, questionable source that uses sensationalist language and AI-generated images. Although security costs have risen for market organizers, this has not led to mass cancellations.</p>

          <p>As the clocks go back and daylight hours decrease, experts are highlighting ways to cope with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a type of depression that affects over a million people in the UK. The condition is particularly challenging in northern regions like Scotland's isles, which experience as little as six hours of daylight. A new "Wintering Well" initiative is providing therapeutic lamps and activity guides through libraries to help people establish new routines. Experts also suggest adopting a more positive mindset toward winter and learning from Scandinavian cultures by creating cozy and welcoming indoor light environments.</p>

          <p>Venture capitalist Carles Reina revealed he decided to invest in the AI voice technology startup ElevenLabs after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski in 2022.

His pre-seed investment proved successful, as ElevenLabs has since achieved a multi-billion dollar valuation. Reina emphasizes his strategy of investing in founders with deep technical knowledge in industries that are not yet considered "sexy" by other VCs.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has uncovered the country's first illegal production facility for weight loss medications in Northampton.

However, diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in Myanmar have been largely ineffective, with the bloc divided on how to handle the country's military junta and its plan for elections amid the conflict.
