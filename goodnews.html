        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has obtained a permit to operate a ride-hailing service in Texas, positioning it to compete with Uber and Lyft across the state. The permit allows the company to run its Robotaxi service, which has been in a limited trial in Austin with human safety supervisors, without a mandatory human driver. While CEO Elon Musk is optimistic about expanding autonomous ride-hailing, the company faces scrutiny over safety incidents and legal challenges concerning its driver-assistance technology claims. This permit marks a significant step for Tesla's ambitions, despite ongoing federal investigations and controversy surrounding its autonomous driving systems.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies like Meta and Alphabet are experiencing significant revenue growth in digital advertising, largely driven by advancements in artificial intelligence tools. These AI systems have enhanced ad efficiency, attracting increased spending from both large and small advertisers. In contrast, smaller platforms such as Snap and Pinterest reported lukewarm results, struggling with issues like botched platform updates and advertiser pullback amid economic uncertainty. The trend highlights a growing divergence in the market, where the massive AI investments by tech giants are solidifying their dominance and leaving less room for error for their smaller competitors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill, the Apeel Reveal Act, has been introduced in the U.S. House to mandate the labeling of shelf-life-extending coatings applied to fruits and vegetables. The legislation specifically targets products from companies like Apeel Sciences, aiming to provide consumers with greater transparency about the substances on their food. Apeel states its plant-based coatings are made from FDA-approved, safe ingredients and already uses its own logo for identification. The debate centers on consumer rights to detailed information versus the food industry's innovations aimed at reducing waste and lowering grocery costs for families.</p>

          <p>Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson has mutually agreed with the club that he can leave Stamford Bridge, with Newcastle reportedly interested in the Senegal international. The 24-year-old, who was left out of a recent friendly, trained alone as the club seeks a transfer fee significantly higher than the £32 million they paid for him in 2023. Chelsea's willingness to sell follows the signing of two new strikers this summer. If the club's asking price is not met, they plan to reintegrate Jackson back into the squad, but the current situation points toward his imminent departure.</p>

With four locations in New Jersey, the initiative aims to empower individuals by allowing them to earn their food, rather than receiving charity. The restaurants also serve as community hubs, connecting guests with resources for housing and healthcare. Despite some minor local controversy, the kitchens have received high praise for their food quality and have become a celebrated example of community-focused philanthropy.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a significant rally, marking one of its best weekly performances in a decade, after the company appeased the Trump administration with a $100 billion commitment to U.S. manufacturing.

The market's positive reaction signals renewed confidence in CEO Tim Cook's ability to navigate political pressures.

          <h2>EU Sanctions on Indian Refinery Unlikely to Derail Broader Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude is not expected to jeopardize a potential free trade agreement between the EU and India. Experts suggest the move is largely symbolic and has less impact than the threat of U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. In fact, pressure from the U.S. may paradoxically push India to seek a more stable and predictable economic partnership with the EU. The sanctions target Nayara Energy, partly owned by Russia's Rosneft, as part of the EU's effort to cut off funding for Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record high of over $1.21 trillion, this article outlines several strategies for consumers to combat compounding interest charges. Key methods include transferring balances to a credit card with a 0% introductory APR, which can provide an interest-free period of up to 21 months to pay down the principal. Other options discussed are enrolling in a credit card issuer's hardship program for temporary relief, using a personal loan to consolidate high-interest debt, and paying off balances before the statement closing date to avoid interest accrual entirely.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates are expected to decline, this article advocates for using a CD laddering strategy to maximize savings while maintaining financial flexibility. The approach involves opening multiple certificates of deposit (CDs) with staggered maturity dates, allowing savers to lock in currently high rates on some funds while keeping other portions of their money accessible in the short term. This method helps navigate an unpredictable economy where savers want to capitalize on favorable rates before they drop, without committing all their funds to long-term, inflexible accounts.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 13:25:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists from East Carolina University may have discovered the remains of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer ship that exploded during an attack on a colonial port in 1748. The shipwreck was one of four found near the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site. Wood sample analysis suggests the vessel was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from the ship was recovered in 1985. The discovery, along with three other wrecks, offers a significant opportunity to understand the maritime history and colonial life of one of North Carolina's earliest port towns.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. After he alerted authorities, HM Coastguard confirmed the vessel contained a crew rowing from Cornwall to Scotland to raise money for motor neurone disease research. Lowe later apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowers, one of whom is a former Royal Marine, said they found the incident, which involved being watched by people on shore and questioned by authorities, to be hilarious and ridiculous.</p>
