          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams' inspiring US Open journey concluded after she and partner Leylah Fernandez were defeated in the doubles quarterfinals by top-seeded duo Taylor Townsend and Kateřina Siniaková. The 45-year-old, who made a comeback after a 16-month absence from competition, received a heartfelt standing ovation from thousands of spectators, with her opponents also expressing their honor at sharing the court with a legend. Williams, a veteran of the sport with 14 Grand Slam women's doubles titles and seven major singles championships, demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout her tournament appearances. Her presence at the US Open, as the oldest player in the singles draw since 1981, underscored her enduring legacy and competitive spirit in professional tennis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economy experienced stronger-than-expected growth in the second quarter, with GDP expanding 1.8% year-over-year, marking its fastest pace since September 2023 and surpassing Reuters' forecast of 1.6%. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed this growth primarily to domestic spending, including household and government consumption, with net trade also contributing positively. This economic uptick follows the Reserve Bank of Australia's recent decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.6% in August, alongside a more optimistic outlook on global economic uncertainties. Despite the positive quarter, the RBA revised its annual growth forecast down slightly to 1.7% from 2.1%, mainly due to a lower productivity growth outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly dismissed recent speculation regarding his health, labeling the rumors as "fake news" and expressing frustration over their rapid spread. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump, 79, emphasized his active Labor Day weekend, which included conducting media interviews and visiting his Virginia golf course. The speculation had gained traction on social media, fueled by his lack of a public schedule late last week and comments from Vice-President JD Vance, who, while confident in Trump's health, indicated preparedness to assume duties if anything were to happen. This article highlights the former president's direct response to public concerns about his physical condition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill requiring K-12 schools, state universities, and community colleges to notify families and staff when immigration enforcement authorities are present on campuses. Authored by State Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, the legislation aims to inform and empower school communities amidst ongoing mass deportation campaigns by the Trump administration. The bill, which now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, is designed to create an early warning system similar to those for other campus emergencies, taking effect immediately if signed and remaining in force until 2031. This measure seeks to maintain schools as safe learning environments, particularly for the significant number of immigrant students in districts like Los Angeles Unified.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the "Labubu craze," exemplified by Pop Mart's successful gremlin doll, signifies the beginning of a major branding supercycle for China, challenging the perception of Chinese products as merely cheap. The author contends that Chinese companies are increasingly competing on trust and brand strength, moving beyond cost advantages. Examples like Xiaomi's rapid success in the automotive sector and CATL's dominance in the EV battery market illustrate this shift, where component brands are becoming recognized consumer names. This trend suggests a broader industrial transformation, with Chinese brands poised for global embrace across various sectors, from consumer goods to infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>Woman Rescued from Domestic Violence Using Viral Hand Signal at 7-Eleven</h2>

          <p>A woman in Alhambra was rescued from an alleged domestic violence incident at a 7-Eleven after discreetly using a hand signal popularized on TikTok, indicating a cry for help. A vigilant bystander recognized the gesture—tucking the thumb into the palm and trapping it with four fingers—and promptly alerted 911. Police quickly responded, arresting the suspect, John Palombi, who attempted to flee and was found to have an active warrant and a stun gun. The "signal for help," created by the Canadian Women’s Foundation in 2020 to provide a discrete way for survivors to reach out during the pandemic, has proven effective globally in enabling individuals to seek assistance covertly from gender-based violence.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B has been cleared of assault charges by a Los Angeles jury in a civil trial where a security guard sought $24 million in damages. Emani Ellis alleged that Cardi B scratched her face with a fingernail and spat on her during a heated argument outside an obstetrician's office in 2018, when the rapper's pregnancy was not publicly known. Cardi B testified that Ellis had followed and filmed her, denying any physical contact but admitting to a profanity-laden verbal altercation. The jury deliberated for only about an hour before finding the Grammy-winning artist not liable for assault, battery, or emotional distress.</p>

          <p>A divided U.S. appeals court has allowed Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, to resume her role, rejecting former President Donald Trump's attempt to remove her. The 2-1 decision by the District of Columbia circuit court of appeals affirmed that FTC commissioners cannot be fired by a president without cause, a legal principle established nearly a century ago. The court stated that the government was unlikely to succeed on appeal due to binding Supreme Court precedent. Slaughter, whom Trump had appointed in 2018 and Biden later reappointed, expressed eagerness to return to her duties, underscoring that Trump is "not above the law."</p>

          <h2>Google Avoids Break-Up in Antitrust Ruling But Ordered to Share Search Data</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 19:51:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome web browser or Android operating system in a landmark antitrust case, but must share search data with rivals and is barred from exclusive contracts. The decision, following years of legal battle over Google's dominance in online search, rejected the Department of Justice's more severe demands. Google viewed the ruling as a victory, suggesting the rise of artificial intelligence likely influenced the outcome, as the industry landscape has significantly evolved. While Google can continue paying distributors for default placement, it cannot enter into exclusive agreements for its search, browser, or AI products.</p>

          <h2>Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano Resumes Erupting, Sending Lava Fountains Skyward</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 19:41:02 EDT</div>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, spewing lava 330 feet into the sky from its summit crater, Halemaʻumaʻu. This marks the 32nd episode of molten rock release since its current eruption began in December 2024, with all lava flows contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma is continuously supplied to a lower chamber, building pressure that forces it through narrow vents to the surface. Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has exhibited similar repeated lava fountain patterns only three other times in the past 200 years. Scientists monitor seismic activity and ground changes to predict eruptions, though the long-term evolution remains uncertain.</p>

          <h2>Apple Shares Climb Following Ruling Allowing Google to Maintain iPhone Preload Deals</h2>

          <p>Apple shares rose over 3% in extended trading after a federal judge ruled that Google could continue making payments to be the default search engine on iPhones, Macs, and iPads. Although Apple was not a direct party in the search monopoly trial, the potential ban on these lucrative "preload deals" was a key consideration. The judge stated that prohibiting such payments would cause "substantial—in some cases, crippling—downstream harms" to distribution partners like Apple. While Google is now barred from exclusive contracts, the decision allows the two tech giants to strike new, non-exclusive revenue-sharing agreements, ensuring continued significant revenue for Apple's services business.</p>
