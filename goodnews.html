          <p>Following former Labour MP Zarah Sultana's departure from the party, Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that "discussions are ongoing" to form a new left-wing political entity. Corbyn praised Sultana's "principled decision" and stated he was delighted she would help build a "real alternative" for voters. This move formalizes long-rumored talks to create a new party from the small group of independent pro-Gaza MPs coordinated by Corbyn. While some on the Labour left have praised the development, none have yet committed to joining, signaling a potential realignment in UK progressive politics.</p>

          <p>The European Commission and Germany are championing the idea of forming a new global trade body to counteract the paralysis of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The proposal, floated by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, aims to create a "coalition of the willing" that can resolve trade disputes, a function the WTO's appellate body can no longer perform due to a long-standing U.S. blockade on appointments. This new organization would initially partner with the CPTPP trade alliance, excluding both the protectionist U.S. and China, which is seen as distorting markets.</p>

          <p>At a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, President Donald Trump celebrated the congressional passage of his "One Big, Beautiful Bill," touting it as the largest tax and spending cut in American history. He also used the event to preview plans for the "America 250" celebration, which will include a "Great American State Fair" starting in Iowa and a UFC fight on the White House lawn. Trump also discussed his recent call with Iran's leaders regarding retaliatory strikes, claiming they were "very respectful" in their communication. The rally served as a victory lap for his legislative agenda and a platform to promote future national events.</p>

Many popular fast-food chains and restaurants like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Applebee's are also expected to be open, but it is advisable to check local hours.</p>

          <p>An archaeological dig at the Magna Roman Fort in northern England has uncovered a mysterious collection of unusually large 2,000-year-old shoes. The Vindolanda Charity Trust found eight shoes measuring over 12 inches long, with one reaching nearly 13 inches, equivalent to a modern U.S. size 15. This high concentration of large footwear is unique compared to other Roman sites, prompting researchers to investigate who might have been stationed at the fort. The discovery, made in a Roman defensive ditch, highlights the diverse populations present across the vast Roman Empire and the remarkable preservation of organic artifacts at the site.</p>

          <p>A writer reflects on her initial reluctance to read Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own," having once viewed it as a symbol of exclusionary white feminism. Upon finally reading the essay, she found a powerful and relatable voice, dissolving her previous grievances. The article explores the enduring relevance of Woolf's arguments about the societal and economic limitations placed on women, noting that issues like the dismissal of female storytelling and the gender pay gap persist today. While acknowledging the book's historical blind spots, the author connects Woolf's ideas to modern intersectional feminism and the ongoing struggle for women's time, space, and financial independence.</p>

          <p>This historical analysis explores how the American Revolution transformed a collection of competing colonies into a unified nation. Initially, General George Washington held a low opinion of his troops, calling them "dirty & nasty people," reflecting the lack of a common American identity. However, the shared struggle and sacrifice of the eight-year war forged a new bond among soldiers from different states. The article details how the Continental Army created foundational national symbols and traditions, such as celebrating Washington's birthday instead of the king's and adopting a new flag, which helped build the framework for a national identity that continues to evolve today.</p>

          <p>A long-lost handwritten letter from Thomas Jefferson, dated 1783, has been rediscovered and is being offered for sale. In the letter to Virginia's governor, Jefferson discusses the right of citizens to bear arms in a revolutionary cause, drawing parallels between the American Revolution and rising democratic fervor in Europe. He notes that Dutch citizens were in "commotion" and taking up arms to demand rights from their rulers. The letter provides a unique insight into Jefferson's views on armed citizenry in the context of opposing autocracy, just after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War and the signing of the Treaty of Paris.</p>

          <p>In the 1990s, the Walt Disney Company embarked on an ambitious and ultimately doomed project to create a theme park dedicated to American history, called "Disney's America." The park, planned for a site near a Civil War battlefield in Virginia, intended to tackle complex and painful topics, with one executive infamously saying, "We want to make you feel what it was like to be a slave." The proposal ignited a culture war, drawing fierce opposition from historians, environmentalists, and locals concerned about the "Disneyfication" of history. The ensuing battle became one of Disney's biggest public failures and a precursor to contemporary debates over how America's story is told.</p>
