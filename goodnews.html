          <p>A recent clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine indicates that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease, specifically metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Participants receiving semaglutide experienced reduced liver inflammation and fat accumulation, with a significant percentage also showing improvements in liver fibrosis. While some adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were noted, researchers are optimistic about semaglutide's potential as a treatment option for fatty liver disease, adding to its existing benefits for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.</p>

          <p>Five people, including three women, a child, and the pilot, survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The survivors waited on top of the plane, surrounded by alligators, until fishermen discovered them and a helicopter was dispatched for rescue. The pilot believes that leaking petrol from the plane kept the predators at bay, and the group sustained themselves by eating cassava flour. All five were rescued in good condition and transported to a hospital.</p>

While proponents argue it offers compassionate end-of-life care, opponents raise concerns about risks to vulnerable individuals. The bill, sponsored by Kim Leadbeater, is set for a crucial vote in the House of Commons, with debates focusing on ethical considerations and potential financial implications.</p>

          <p>Singapore held its general election amidst global economic uncertainty and domestic issues, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong facing his first major test against a revitalized opposition. The People's Action Party (PAP), which has ruled for decades, is expected to retain power, but the opposition aims to increase its presence in Parliament. Key issues include potential tariffs imposed by the US, rising living costs, and housing availability. The election serves as a gauge of Wong's leadership and the enduring dominance of the PAP.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst a challenging global landscape and pressing domestic economic issues. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, with both major parties offering small-scale solutions. The election also reflects a broader dissatisfaction with the two major parties, as voters increasingly turn to independent candidates and minor parties. The influence of President Trump's political style and policies on the campaign has also been a factor, with some voters expressing concern about the adoption of divisive rhetoric.</p>

          <p>A US man, Tim Friede, who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the development of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies from his blood have shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. This could be a significant step towards a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. Friede's motivation stemmed from a desire to improve snakebite therapies after a near-fatal experience early in his self-experimentation.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the local currency, which had risen above its trading band against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion worth of local currency in its first market intervention in two years. This action comes ahead of the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where interest rate cuts are expected, potentially leading to further capital inflows into Hong Kong.
