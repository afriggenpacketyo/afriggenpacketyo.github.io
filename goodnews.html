          <p>European stock markets opened higher, with the regional Stoxx 600 index gaining 0.25%, as investors await a crucial US jobs report. Market sentiment improved after Thursday's US payrolls data increased expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, now at a 99% probability. In the UK, July retail sales surpassed forecasts, and house prices saw a slight rise in August, indicating some economic momentum. However, Danish wind farm developer Orsted's shares fell after it lowered its full-year earnings guidance due to low wind speeds and ongoing US project obstructions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes increased by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' predictions, attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) had delayed these figures due to data quality concerns, revising past year's data for accuracy. Despite the monthly rise, sales over the three months to July were down 0.6%. Experts caution that these positive factors are temporary, and retailers still face significant new costs.</p>

          <p>A growing number of millennials and Gen Z entrepreneurs are acquiring small businesses through "search funds," an investment vehicle that allows individuals to raise capital to buy and operate existing companies. This trend addresses a looming succession crisis as many baby boomer business owners prepare for retirement without clear plans. Search funds offer a lower-risk path to entrepreneurship, with strong historical returns (35.1% IRR). Investors often provide mentorship, capital, and strategic guidance, helping new CEOs navigate challenges like the fraud encountered by one entrepreneur. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced an executive order allowing pharmacists to prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines, aiming to significantly enhance accessible healthcare for all New Yorkers. This decisive action comes amidst considerable federal regulatory uncertainty and intense political scrutiny regarding vaccine availability and public health policies. The temporary order is designed to provide immediate and seamless access to vaccines while the Governor collaborates with the Legislature on a comprehensive, long-term solution. Hochul's spokesperson emphasized that this move directly counters "political attacks on science" emanating from Washington, ensuring individuals retain the ability to make informed health decisions.</p>

          <p>Italy is becoming a top destination for the ultra-wealthy, thanks to its investor-friendly environment and an accommodative flat-tax regime introduced in 2017. Despite a recent increase in the one-off charge on foreign income to €200,000, demand for luxury living and business opportunities, particularly in Milan, remains high. This influx has spurred significant real estate price increases in desirable areas, with Milan's prime market growing 49% since the tax regime began. The article notes that while this raises questions about wealth inequality, businesses hope for increased activity and job creation across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the UK's recently retired Chief of the Defence Staff, provided a reassuring assessment, stating that the nation's security is safe "for now and for the next few years." He attributes this measured optimism to the UK's status as a nuclear power, its robust membership in NATO—which he described as "the biggest and strongest gun club ever"—and its enduring strong alliance with the United States. Radakin commended the UK's decisive response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, characterizing the war as a "disaster" for Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also voiced skepticism regarding the formation of a new non-NATO "axis," despite recent high-profile military parades in China.</p>
