          <p>Kenza Dali expresses her intent to reveal her experiences following the Euros, motivated by what she perceives as inaccuracies in the current narrative. Dali emphasizes her respect for her teammates and her desire to avoid diverting attention from their preparations for the tournament. She feels saddened by her exclusion from the squad, especially considering her recent strong performances in football, and highlights her enjoyment of playing in the NWSL for San Diego, appreciating the tactical approach of coach Jonas Eidevall. Dali also touches on the personal grief she experienced during the Olympics after a family bereavement, and her subsequent challenging period at Aston Villa where she felt unwanted by the new manager. The article reveals that San Diego demonstrated strong commitment to bringing her on board, which she greatly appreciated, and she is now enjoying her football once again. The article underscores the significance of feeling valued in a team environment, which is what Dali feels she has found in San Diego. Dali concludes by noting the competitive nature of the NWSL, where every team has a shot at the title, contrasting with her experiences in England. The article concludes by noting that Dali expresses her preference for an attacking style of play and her belief in San Diego's potential to achieve significant success. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly compensate their athletes. The settlement, approved by Judge Claudia Wilken, enables schools to begin paying athletes as early as next month. It includes provisions for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion to be paid over the next decade to former players who were previously restricted from such revenue. Payouts will vary based on the sport and length of athletic career, with potential earnings reaching nearly $135,000 for most football and men's basketball players. (not investment advice)</p>

While Lee is expected to focus on economic ties with China, analysts anticipate continuity in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan.
