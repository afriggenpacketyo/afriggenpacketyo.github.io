          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 17:21:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary trial of the experimental gene therapy AMT-130 has demonstrated a remarkable 75% reduction in Huntington's disease progression over three years for patients receiving a high dose. Developed by University College London, this one-time treatment works by using a harmless virus to deliver genetic instructions that turn off harmful proteins in the brain. While these early results are highly encouraging, with one patient even returning to work, larger studies are still required. The treatment offers significant hope as the first designed to actively slow the disease rather than just manage symptoms, though FDA approval is years away.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has formed in the central tropical Atlantic and is projected to move northwestward, with steady strengthening anticipated over the coming days due to favorable environmental conditions. As of the National Hurricane Center's update, Humberto is located about 550 miles northeast of the Leeward Islands, moving at 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, extending outward up to 45 miles. While it is one of two systems swirling in the western Atlantic, currently there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect. However, some downstream impacts could potentially affect parts of the Southeast U.S. coast from Florida up to North Carolina.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign a deal brokered by his administration to allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., classifying it as a 'qualified divestiture' under a new law. The agreement involves cloud-computing firm Oracle providing 'top to bottom security' by hosting U.S. user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure appropriate algorithm behavior. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will hold a stake in TikTok, and its content recommendation algorithm will be retrained to run solely on U.S. user data. This article addresses lawmaker concerns about the algorithm's potential ongoing reliance on ByteDance, but the White House is confident in the deal's compliance.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift has secured a five-year restraining order against an alleged stalker, Brian Jason Wagner, who reportedly attempted to enter her Los Angeles home on three occasions. Wagner allegedly made 'untrue' statements about living on her property, being in a relationship, and her being the mother of his child, and even changed his driver's license address to hers. The order mandates he stay away from all of Swift’s homes, vehicles, and workplaces, and prohibits him from owning firearms. This article notes previous instances where Swift has sought similar injunctions.</p>

          <p>The National Football League's finance committee has approved the sale of a 2.35% stake in the Chicago Bears to existing team owners, a deal that values the franchise at an NFL record $8.9 billion. This valuation marks a significant increase from $6.4 billion just a year prior, placing the Bears at No. 7 in CNBC's 2025 NFL team valuations. The stake, previously held by the estate of Andrew McKenna, will primarily go to the McCaskey family and a portion to the Ryan family, solidifying their ownership and control. The team is also exploring building a new domed stadium. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lithium Americas' stock surged 95% after reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the Canadian mining company, based in Vancouver, British Columbia. This proposal comes as Lithium Americas renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. The White House aims for a small equity stake to create a 'cash buffer' for taxpayers and mitigate risk, marking the first such stake proposed for a Canadian firm in the U.S.'s critical mineral supply chain strategy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines critical mistakes borrowers often make when trying to pay off debt, emphasizing that good intentions alone are insufficient. Key pitfalls include only making minimum payments, which prolongs debt and increases interest costs, and taking on new debt while repaying old balances, which can quickly erase progress. It also advises against draining emergency funds, ignoring available professional help like credit counseling or balance transfers, and failing to adjust spending habits. The article stresses the importance of acting promptly, as delaying action allows interest to compound rapidly and makes debt more expensive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's political thriller, 'One Battle After Another,' is reviewed as an invigorating adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's 'Vineland,' reimagining its themes of rebellion and societal struggle. The article praises Teyana Taylor's powerful performance as revolutionary leader Perfidia Beverly Hills, contrasting it with Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of her 'pathetic' lover, Bob. The film, which reorients the story around race, explores the relentless, multi-faceted fight against oppression and highlights the impersonal nature of state violence. It ultimately suggests that the fight for liberation is a continuous, collective effort, with others always taking over from the fallen.</p>

          <p>This article explores various structured approaches to efficiently pay off multiple debts, a challenge exacerbated by high interest rates and inflation. It details the 'debt snowball' method, which prioritizes paying off the smallest balance first for psychological motivation, and the 'debt avalanche' method, which targets the highest interest rate debt to save money. Other strategies include using balance transfer credit cards with 0% introductory APRs, consolidating debts with a loan, implementing a debt management plan through credit counseling, or considering debt settlement for severe hardship. Consistency is highlighted as the most important factor in any debt payoff strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve initiating interest rate cuts, homeowners are comparing the costs of $100,000 home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). This article analyzes how both options have become cheaper than earlier this year. HELOCs, with their variable rates, are better positioned to benefit from future cuts, though they also carry the risk of rate increases, making budgeting difficult. Home equity loans offer fixed rates, providing stability but missing out on further reductions unless refinanced. Homeowners are advised to carefully weigh the pros and cons of each product, considering long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine has significantly ramped up its domestic drone production, now manufacturing millions annually, to both defend its front lines and conduct long-range strikes deep inside Russia. This article highlights companies like Fire Point, which produces drones capable of striking targets up to 3,000 kilometers away, focusing on Russian oil and gas infrastructure. Ukrainian military strategists believe targeting Russia's economic assets, rather than just casualties, is key to ending the war, as Russia 'doesn't care about people's lives' but losing money is painful. This self-reliant approach has led to a measurable impact on Russian oil exports and domestic fuel shortages.</p>

The article describes the redesigned stand, accommodating 5,000 fans, and notes the 'phoney war' already underway during practice days, with playful jeers directed at Rory McIlroy. While European captain Luke Donald emphasizes respect for the fans, American players like Collin Morikawa are eager to harness the 'chaos' to their advantage. Donald's team is undertaking a charm offensive, but expects the intensity to escalate significantly once the tournament officially begins, with President Trump's expected appearance adding to the partisan crowd.</p>
