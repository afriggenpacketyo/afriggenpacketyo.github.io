          <p>President Donald Trump declared on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, ending nearly two weeks of escalating air assaults. The agreement involves two 12-hour ceasefire periods, beginning with Iran, followed by Israel, after which the war would be officially declared over. However, Iran's foreign minister denied the existence of a ceasefire agreement but stated that if Israel halted strikes, Iran would cease its response. Trump's announcement came after the U.S. launched strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, joining Israel's war, which began due to concerns over Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing its plan to bar foreign nationals from studying at Harvard University. The injunction prevents the administration from enforcing a proclamation that cited national security concerns to justify the ban. Harvard argued that Trump was retaliating against the university for refusing to comply with demands to control its governance and curriculum. The university has filed lawsuits seeking to unfreeze funding and prevent the administration from blocking international students.</p>

          <p>Chongqing, a major inland city in China, is transforming into a global trade hub through the development of cross-border rail networks. These networks provide faster access to global markets and offer other countries a direct route into China's interior. The city aims to become a central node in the global economy, connecting Asia and Europe via rail, which is an alternative to the traditional Suez Canal route. This development reflects China's efforts to deepen its global trade footprint amidst geopolitical risks.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that the Iranian government provided "early notice" regarding missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, characterizing Iran's response to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites as "very weak." He thanked Iran for the warning, which allowed for the minimization of casualties and injuries. Diplomatic sources suggest the counterattack was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing in advance. This action echoes Iran's previous strikes in 2020, where advance notice was given.</p>

The attack led to a temporary closure of Qatar's airspace and shelter-in-place orders for Americans in Qatar, but the situation has since de-escalated.</p>

The risk-sensitive Aussie and kiwi currencies benefited from the news, while the dollar, previously supported by safe-haven demand, fell broadly. Dovish comments from Federal Reserve policymaker Michelle Bowman, suggesting potential interest rate cuts, also contributed to the dollar's decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Trump voters have expressed their support, viewing the actions as consistent with his 'America First' agenda. Many believe Trump is protecting American interests while preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and they trust his leadership in foreign policy. However, some high-profile supporters, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, argue that Trump is betraying the MAGA movement by engaging in foreign wars. Despite differing opinions, most Trump voters trust his decision-making and access to national security intelligence.</p>
