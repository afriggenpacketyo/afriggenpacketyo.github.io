          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have "both signed off" on the first phase of a peace plan, which he stated would lead to the release of all hostages and an Israeli troop withdrawal. The Families' Headquarters for the Return of the Abductees, representing those held since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, welcomed the news with "excitement, anticipation and apprehension." They urged the Israeli government to approve the agreement immediately, expressing deep gratitude to Trump for his leadership in achieving this "historic breakthrough" towards ending the war and returning all abductees.</p>

          <p>During a White House event, Secretary of State Marco Rubio passed an urgent handwritten note to President Trump, informing him that negotiators were "very close to a deal" on the Middle East peace plan. The note advised Trump to announce the deal first on Truth Social, highlighting the immediacy of the situation as top US and international officials were in deep negotiations in Egypt. Trump, who had previously expressed readiness to travel to the Middle East, including potentially Gaza, eventually acknowledged the breakthrough, emphasizing his administration's role in seeking peace. The incident underscored the rapid developments surrounding the critical peace talks.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "first phase" ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, aiming to end the devastating Gaza war. The agreement reportedly includes the release of nearly 50 hostages in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, with Hamas disarming and Israel withdrawing troops to an agreed line. This breakthrough follows multiple failed efforts and two previous ceasefires, with strong international support hoping this truce will last. The plan also outlines a transitional governance committee for Gaza and a vague pathway to Palestinian self-determination, while Israel emerges in a stronger security position despite international isolation.</p>

          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner championed Maya Le Tissier's qualities after her match-winning penalty in the club's Champions League debut, despite her limited international appearances for England. Le Tissier, a consistent Women's Super League defender with a record 71 consecutive appearances, has only eight caps, with England coach Sarina Wiegman preferring her at right-back despite her club role as a center-back. Injuries to key England players like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze may open an opportunity for the 23-year-old, whom Skinner hails as a future "incredible England stalwart" and a "rock" for her club.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. has renewed the contracts of studio heads Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy, following a remarkable turnaround year marked by a string of box office hits. Just six months prior, the co-chairs were on thin ice after underperforming films, but successes like "A Minecraft Movie" ($958 million worldwide) and others propelled the studio past $4 billion globally for the first time since 2019. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav credited their leadership for a balanced slate of blockbusters, intellectual property adaptations, horror, and original works, delighting moviegoers and critics alike.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he "may go" to the Middle East, specifically Egypt and potentially Gaza, as early as this weekend, contingent on the progress of peace talks between Israel and Hamas. His top negotiators, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are currently in Egypt for indirect discussions on a 20-point peace proposal. Trump emphasized the urgency for negotiators to "move fast" and noted Hamas's prior acceptance of key elements of the plan, including hostage release. A presidential trip abroad during a federal government shutdown, however, would present an unusual backdrop for such foreign policy engagement.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and US President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the possible revival of the Keystone XL pipeline project during a meeting in Washington. Carney raised the pipeline, which would connect Alberta to the US, in the context of broader trade discussions, and Trump was reportedly receptive. The project, approved in 2010 but blocked by previous US administrations, was halted by President Biden on his first day in office, leading the company behind it to "move on." The preliminary talks indicate a potential shift, with both leaders instructing their teams to continue discussions amidst domestic pressure on Carney for trade and security deals.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator dismissed concerns about "circular investments" in the AI industry, stating that major tech companies are simply buying infrastructure due to high demand. CoreWeave, which went public earlier this year and saw its stock soar, recently expanded its contracts with OpenAI to $22.4 billion and inked a $14.2 billion deal with Meta. The company also has a significant order with Nvidia, a key backer. Intrator asserted that these deals represent a "fundamental infrastructure buildout" and that partnerships are normal during such massive expansions, predicting the "circular investment" narrative will pass as market drivers are enormous.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large study of US military veterans, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that last year's updated COVID-19 vaccines significantly prevented severe outcomes, including hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccinated veterans who received the 2024-2025 Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech boosters were also less likely to visit the emergency room compared to unvaccinated COVID patients. While the absolute impact was smaller due to milder circulating variants and increased immunity, the vaccines provided meaningful additional protection. Experts, including a former FDA chief scientist, emphasize that observational studies consistently support the vaccines' effectiveness against significant outcomes, particularly for middle-aged and older populations.</p>

From 1933 to 1950, some 20,000 crates of treasures traveled over 10,000 miles across war-torn China to protect them. Today, the collection remains divided between the original Palace Museum in Beijing and the National Palace Museum in Taipei, with branches in Chiayi and Hong Kong. This division is seen by some as a continuing barometer of tensions across the Taiwan Strait, highlighting the complex relationship between national heritage and political realities.</p>

The state's Department of Public Health will identify prohibited foods by 2028, requiring schools to phase them out. The bill, championed by Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, builds on previous food safety laws and is expected to lead to a major overhaul of school cafeteria meals, with vendors likely adapting recipes.</p>
