          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh achieved a significant milestone by hitting his 54th home run of the season, equaling Mickey Mantle's 1961 record for a switch-hitter. This powerful accomplishment helped the Mariners secure an 11-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels, propelling them into sole possession of first place in the American League West. Raleigh, who also expressed humility and a strong focus on team success, contributed to the Mariners' impressive ninth consecutive win as they aim for their first division title since 2001. His manager praised his overall performance, defensive skills, and leadership with the pitching staff, underscoring his immense value to the team's championship aspirations and his humble way of making history.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has officially endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, citing his commitment to a safe and affordable New York City and his focus on economic accessibility. Despite past disagreements, Hochul expressed confidence in Mamdani's leadership, particularly his shared goal of confronting the agenda of former President Trump. This endorsement from a moderate governor is significant for Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has recently moderated some of his past stances, including apologizing for a 2020 social media post critical of the NYPD. The move aims to unify the Democratic party and secure funding for key policy proposals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high, extending its gains for the tenth consecutive session, after the government announced it would abandon plans to raise taxes on stock investments. This positive market movement occurred as investors also monitored ongoing U.S.-China trade discussions in Spain and processed new economic data from Beijing. While Hong Kong and China saw mixed trading with China's economy slowing, the broader context of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the U.S. fueled hopes and contributed to the positive sentiment in some Asian markets. This policy reversal is expected to encourage further investment in the South Korean stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California lawmakers passed Senate Bill 627, known as the No Secret Police Act, which would prohibit most local and federal law enforcement, including immigration agents, from wearing face coverings during operations. The bill, now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, aims to enhance transparency and public trust in law enforcement by preventing officers from evading identification. Supporters argue it will combat impersonation and address concerns about federal immigration enforcement tactics. However, critics, including the Department of Homeland Security, contend the bill undermines officer safety and ignores operational realities.</p>

          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a leading cause of death and infertility for the marsupials. Developed over a decade by UniSC researchers, the vaccine aims to reduce the disease's rapid spread, which affects up to 70% of some koala populations, causing blindness, starvation, and bladder damage. This scientific breakthrough offers three levels of protection—reducing infection, preventing disease progression, and reversing existing symptoms—providing a crucial and hopeful tool for koala conservation efforts. The vaccine has been approved for widespread production and use by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brain fog, characterized by difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common cognitive symptom often linked to stress or busy lifestyles. While not a medical condition itself, it signals mental fatigue or overwhelm, and can affect anyone. Dr. Tharaka, a medical expert, offers four practical tips to combat it, emphasizing the importance of recognizing it as temporary and not a personal failing. Strategies include deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities to allow the brain to reset and reduce lingering stress, effectively creating "mental buffers." If concerns persist or symptoms are severe, consulting a GP is recommended for further evaluation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers showcased a renewed offensive approach, securing a 10-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants to win their three-game series. After a second-half slump, the team focused on fundamental "small ball" tactics, emphasizing quality at-bats, situational hitting, and manufacturing runs rather than solely relying on home runs. This strategic shift, yielding 18 hits and six walks, signals a promising development for the Dodgers as they head into the playoffs. Pitcher Tyler Glasnow also delivered a strong performance, settling down after early command issues to pitch into the seventh inning.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a respected two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has died at 79 from complications related to pancreatic cancer. Credited with bringing financial stability to the state in the 1990s, Edgar was known for his reserved demeanor and commitment to public service.
