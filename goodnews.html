          <p>The families of seven living hostages released by Hamas have shared statements of profound relief and gratitude after their loved ones returned home following over two years in captivity. This emotional reunion is part of a broader Gaza ceasefire agreement that has brought a mix of elation and anguish. Concurrently, the Hostage Families Forum has expressed shock and dismay, accusing Hamas of breaching the deal by returning only a fraction of the deceased hostages' bodies as initially agreed. The group is urging the Israeli government and international mediators to take immediate action to address what they call a "grave injustice."</p>

          <p>As part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement, the final 20 living hostages held by Hamas were returned to Israel on Monday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. President Donald Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset before traveling to a peace summit in Egypt, where he formally signed the agreement with regional leaders, declaring that "the war in Gaza is over." While the initial phase of the deal is being implemented, with some released hostages receiving medical evaluations, Israeli officials have noted that the return of deceased hostages is proceeding slower than agreed upon, creating a point of tension.</p>

          <p>A reverse mortgage is a financial tool for homeowners aged 62 and older, allowing them to convert a portion of their home equity into cash without needing to sell their home or make monthly mortgage payments. Borrowers can remain in their home for as long as it serves as their primary residence and they meet all loan obligations, which include paying property taxes, maintaining homeowners insurance, and keeping the property in good condition. The loan becomes due when the borrower moves out, sells the home, or passes away, at which point the balance is typically paid back through the sale of the property. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actors Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri are starring in the new psychological thriller "After the Hunt," directed by Luca Guadagnino, which explores the complex fallout of a sexual assault accusation within a competitive academic environment. In an interview, the stars described the film as a story about power, loyalty, and blurred truths, designed to provoke conversation and nuanced debate among viewers. Roberts plays a professor whose world is upended when her protégé, played by Edebiri, accuses a close colleague of misconduct. Both actors emphasized that the film intentionally avoids providing a clear answer, leaving the audience to grapple with the characters' competing perspectives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the release of all living Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan is moving into its next, more challenging phases. Key unresolved issues include the postwar governance of Gaza, Israel's demand for Hamas to completely disarm, and the long-term prospect of a Palestinian state, which the current Israeli government opposes. The plan proposes an international body to oversee Gaza's administration and an Arab-led security force, but negotiations on these points are expected to be contentious. The success of these later stages will depend heavily on building trust and navigating deep-seated political disagreements.</p>

          <h2>New Health Guidance Suggests Kiwis and Mineral Water as Effective Remedies for Constipation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 12:24:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new guidance from researchers at King's College London, simple dietary changes like eating several kiwi fruits per day can be more effective for relieving constipation than focusing solely on a high-fiber diet. The research, which reviewed existing evidence, also recommends drinking mineral water rich in magnesium over tap water and consuming 8-10 prunes daily to help improve symptoms. Dr. Eirini Dimidi, the lead author, stated that these options offer practical and accessible first steps for the one in ten people affected by chronic constipation. The guidance suggests these remedies work by increasing water content in the gut and adding stool volume.</p>

          <p>While the U.S. government shutdown deepens, the White House is reportedly close to nominating Mike Selig, a key figure on the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This potential appointment is seen by industry insiders as a significant step toward creating a more cohesive regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. by bridging the policy gap between the SEC and CFTC. However, the extended political stalemate, which prediction markets suggest could become the longest in U.S. history, threatens to delay this and other critical policy decisions, leaving the crypto industry in a state of uncertainty.

          <p>In an exclusive interview with the BBC, King Abdullah II of Jordan issued a stark warning that the Middle East is "doomed" without a viable peace process that leads to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Speaking ahead of a peace summit in Egypt, the king emphasized that a two-state solution is the only path to lasting stability, expressing hope that the recent U.S.-brokered ceasefire could create a new political horizon. While expressing deep mistrust of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, King Abdullah conveyed cautious optimism that Hamas would abide by the agreement's terms, stressing the critical need for continued U.S. engagement to secure a future for Palestinians.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a high-interest-rate environment, several persistent myths about credit card debt can negatively impact personal finances. Contrary to popular belief, carrying a balance does not improve your credit score; it only costs you money in interest. Another harmful misconception is that making only the minimum payment is an effective debt management strategy, when in reality it can take decades and thousands of extra dollars to pay off the principal. Furthermore, closing old credit card accounts can actually harm your credit score by increasing your credit utilization ratio and shortening the length of your credit history.

          <p>The end of major hostilities in Gaza, marked by the release of hostages and a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, has fostered a sense of "paradoxical optimism" among some observers in the region. The article suggests that the immense price paid by both Israelis and Gazans during the two-year conflict may force a new willingness to consider different paths forward. This fragile hope is largely underwritten by the Trump administration's active role, which envisions an international security force and a technocratic Palestinian committee to govern Gaza. This new reality, born from catastrophe, could represent the end of one political era and the unknown beginning of another.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of over two million 401(k) accounts found that investors moved their money from stocks into more conservative assets like bonds, money market funds, and stable value funds during September. This "flight to safety" saw these fixed-income options account for 82% of all investor inflows for the month. The shift occurred despite the stock market reaching high points, suggesting investors may have been hedging against potential market volatility or reacting to economic uncertainty, such as the looming government shutdown. Financial experts caution against trying to time the market, but also note the behavior could represent prudent rebalancing of portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the SNP conference, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney announced a new plan to create a network of walk-in GP services across the country, aiming to deliver one million additional appointments. The proposed sites would operate seven days a week from noon to 8 p.m., staffed by GPs and nurses, to alleviate the "08:00 rush for appointments" that currently strains existing surgeries. Swinney stated that the first of these new facilities would be operational within a year. The announcement was a key part of his speech, where he also criticized the Westminster government and reiterated his party's commitment to pursuing Scottish independence.</p>
