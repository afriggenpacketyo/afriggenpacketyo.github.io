          <p>Walmart's CFO warned investors that the retail giant will raise prices on many items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reprieve on duties from China. The company is trying to navigate the situation, but the speed and magnitude of price increases are unprecedented. While Walmart will absorb some costs, shoppers will likely see increases towards the end of May and more in June, with toys and electronics being heavily impacted. Walmart is also taking steps to reduce tariff exposure, such as switching to alternative materials and sourcing merchandise from different locations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. However, the plan requires both parents to have a Social Security number, potentially excluding 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present. The credit is partially refundable, providing up to $1,700 even if a family owes no federal taxes. The tax break starts to phase out for higher-income couples with AGI exceeding $400,000. The proposal is being debated for its impact on low-income families.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case concerning President Trump‚Äôs executive order on birthright citizenship, focusing on whether a single district court judge can block a policy nationwide. The justices did not consider the legal merits of the order itself, which seeks to deny citizenship to babies born to undocumented migrants, but rather the use of universal injunctions. Several justices expressed skepticism about the legality of Trump's proclamation, with Justice Sotomayor stating that it violated multiple Supreme Court precedents. The justices also explored the history and practical implications of nationwide injunctions, with concerns raised about potential chaos if different states followed different rules.</p>

The U.S. aims to help establish a peaceful, stable Syria, encouraged by calls for peaceful relations with Israel and the expulsion of terrorists.
