          <p>Inter Milan's participation in the expanded FIFA Club World Cup highlights the increasing strain on players due to packed schedules. The team, recently under new management after parting ways with Simone Inzaghi, faced a 1-1 draw with Monterrey amidst a demanding calendar. Manager Giuseppe Marotta has called for a serious dialogue between FIFA, UEFA, leagues, clubs, and players to redesign the international calendar and protect player health, noting that the expanded Club World Cup and new Champions League format have significantly increased the workload on teams and players. The tournament itself has expanded to a 32-team, month-long competition, offering a lucrative $1 billion prize purse.</p>

          <p>China plans to establish an "international operations center" for the digital yuan to enhance the renminbi's global reach, according to People‚Äôs Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng. This initiative is part of a broader effort to promote Shanghai as a global financial hub and address issues with traditional cross-border payment systems. China has been building a multi-channel, wide-coverage cross-border renminbi clearing network for over a decade. Trials will include refinancing schemes using credit-based relending for foreign trade enterprises, cross-border trade refinancing with rediscount support, and an expanded green finance programme.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose the gender they identify with when renewing or applying for a passport, or when changing their name or sex designation. Applicants can still select "X" on passport application forms. The executive order reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration that allowed for Americans to self-select their gender on their passport application and included an "X" for those who do not identify as either male or female.</p>

Homan called for the passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" to further secure the border and implement a large-scale deportation operation.

Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, finding that many creatures could find new homes in biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis aims to guide the government in ensuring Marine Protected Areas continue to protect species as habitats shift.</p>
