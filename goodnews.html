          <h2>Scholar Suggests Trump May Use Tactics Beyond Tariffs with China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 02:37:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Wu Xinbo, a scholar at Fudan University, Beijing should anticipate Washington employing alternative pressure tactics in future tariff negotiations, as the Trump administration recognizes the limits of heavy tariffs. Wu suggests that while Trump might continue using tariffs, he'll exercise more restraint due to the mixed results and significant side effects for the US. These alternative measures could span science, diplomacy, and security, requiring China to remain vigilant across various domains. This shift implies a more multifaceted approach from the US in its dealings with China, moving beyond solely relying on tariffs.</p>

In addition to retrieving asteroid samples, the Tianwen-2 spacecraft will also explore comet 311P.

          <p>German defense firm Renk is looking to hire talent from the struggling auto sector as it scales up production due to rising geopolitical tensions and increased military spending.

This collaboration allows Renk to capitalize on the automotive industry's skilled workers and implement methods like continuous improvement and lean principles.

The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal. If the White House is unsuccessful in its appeal, businesses who've had to pay tariffs will receive refunds on the amounts paid, with interest. (not investment advice)</p>
