          <p>A new study reveals that Buddhist and Taoist temples across China have served as unexpected sanctuaries for tens of thousands of ancient trees for at least 2,000 years.  These trees, many over 100 years old, have been protected within temple grounds, a phenomenon unique to China due to the extensive human transformation of other landscapes. The Guanyin Chan Temple's 1,400-year-old ginkgo tree exemplifies this preservation.</p>
