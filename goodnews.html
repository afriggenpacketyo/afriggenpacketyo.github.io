        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have moved forward with President Trump's tax breaks, but a disagreement persists regarding the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). The House Ways and Means Committee passed the legislation, which proposes raising the SALT cap to $30,000 for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. Some House lawmakers are pushing for a higher limit before a full House vote. The current $10,000 SALT cap was implemented to help fund the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The full House vote is expected soon, but the legislation may face significant changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>In an effort to alleviate overcrowding in prisons across England and Wales, limits will be implemented on the duration that some offenders can be returned to prison. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that offenders recalled for breaching their licenses will be released after a fixed 28-day period. This measure is expected to free up approximately 1,400 prison spaces, providing ministers with time to overhaul the system. The changes will apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years who have been released but recalled for breaching their license terms, but not those who commit a serious further offense or pose a high risk.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to Qatar marks a turnaround in relations after previously criticizing the emirate as a funder of terrorism. The visit is seen as the culmination of Qatar's efforts to overhaul its global reputation, including significant spending on lobbyists and hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022. The promised gift of a luxury jetliner to Trump has drawn criticism and ethical concerns. Qatar's role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas has also been highlighted, with some critics remaining skeptical of the country's motives and influence.</p>

          <p>With ever-changing U.S. tariff policies causing confusion for Americans, consumers can take several steps to mitigate the impact on their budgets. A U.S. agreement with China would reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%, while China would cut tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. Consumers should look for sales, check the origin of products, and purchase domestic products to avoid price hikes. Electronics and toys are the most likely to be affected by tariffs, so shoppers should consider purchasing them sooner rather than later. (not investment advice)</p>

The test involved nearly 2,700 participants who sampled 122 plant-based meat products alongside animal meat benchmarks. Twenty of the plant-based products were rated as good or better than their animal-based counterparts, with Impossible Foods receiving six awards. The results suggest that some consumers' preference for animal meat is psychological, as prepared plant-based dishes can be just as enjoyable. The top-performing products include burgers, chicken nuggets, breakfast sausage, and deli slices.</p>
