          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts of 1.9%, though it slowed from the previous quarter's 4.5% growth. Manufacturing and construction sectors saw moderation, while the services sector also slowed due to contractions in wholesale and retail trade, as well as transportation and storage. Despite beating recent expectations, the Monetary Authority of Singapore warned that GDP growth is projected to moderate further in 2026, aligning with external developments and a normalization of trade-related sectors. Global investment in artificial intelligence is expected to offer some support to the manufacturing sector.</p>

The "Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity" laid out broad commitments for diplomatic engagement and resolution of future disputes, though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was notably absent, citing a Jewish holiday. Trump, who earlier addressed Israel's parliament declaring a "new dawn in the Middle East," praised the agreement as historic and expressed confidence it would hold.

          <p>Missouri has enacted a new hands-free law targeting distracted drivers, aiming to reduce crashes that kill an average of nine people daily nationwide. The legislation, championed by Adrienne Siddens after her husband was killed by a distracted driver, allows for tickets up to $150 for a first offense. The state's Department of Transportation is now using anonymous smartphone and vehicle data to identify distracted driving "hot spots," revealing that such incidents are likely three times higher than previously reported. This data-driven approach will inform targeted educational programs and increased law enforcement visibility to improve road safety.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation to significantly increase the pay for state prisoners assigned to battle wildfires, raising their wages from approximately $1 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. This measure, Assembly Bill 247, takes effect immediately with a $10 million allocation, addressing a long-standing social justice issue. Incarcerated fire crews are a critical part of the state's wildfire response, performing dangerous tasks like clearing brush. The article highlights this positive step towards fairer compensation for a voluntary, coveted, and hazardous prison job, despite opposition from some groups over cost.</p>

          <p>Following the release of all 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and increased aid to Gaza, the next phases of President Trump's peace plan face significant challenges. While a ceasefire is in effect and Israeli troops have partially withdrawn, major questions remain regarding Gaza's postwar governance and Hamas's disarmament, which the group rejects. Reconstruction efforts, estimated at $53 billion, and the establishment of an international security force are also critical. This article highlights the fragility of the situation, emphasizing that while initial steps are positive, thorny issues like statehood and full military withdrawal are yet to be resolved.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Assembly Bill 749, establishing a commission to study inequalities in youth sports, focusing on access regardless of race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, income, or location. The legislation has drawn criticism from Republicans, who argue its inclusion of "gender identity" is a veiled attempt to support transgender athletes and rig the issue. Newsom, while an LGBTQ+ ally, previously expressed concerns about transgender women's participation in women's sports. The article highlights the complex and often controversial nature of such legislation, aiming to address disparities while navigating a contentious national debate.</p>

          <p>The UK government is strongly advising chief executives to prepare for potential cyberattacks by having physical, offline copies of their operational plans. This guidance from the National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) follows a reported increase in "nationally significant" cyber incidents this year, which have caused chaos for major companies like Marks and Spencer and Jaguar Land Rover. The NCSC advocates for "resilience engineering" to build systems that can anticipate, absorb, and recover from attacks. This article highlights the growing threat of cybercrime and the critical need for robust, even low-tech, preparedness strategies to maintain business continuity.</p>
