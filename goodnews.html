          <p>The UK's Labour party plans to launch an online NHS hospital service by 2027 to help alleviate extensive patient waiting lists in England. The service, named NHS Online, would feature its own dedicated medical staff to conduct virtual assessments, consultations, and follow-up appointments through the NHS app. If physical examinations or treatments are required, patients would be booked into local hospitals. While the initiative aims to deliver millions of appointments and is based on successful pilot programs, experts raise concerns about implementation, including staffing sources and ensuring digital access for all patients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has decided to maintain its benchmark policy rate at 3.6%, a move widely anticipated by economists. This decision comes as the country's headline inflation rate reached 3% in August, its highest point in over a year, driven by rising costs in housing and food. In its statement, the RBA acknowledged that inflation might be higher than previously expected and noted that private demand was recovering. The bank has already cut rates by 75 basis points this year as it attempts to balance economic growth with the persistent challenge of curbing inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Zijin Gold, the overseas mining unit of China's Zijin Mining, surged more than 60% during their trading debut in Hong Kong. The company raised approximately $3.2 billion in its initial public offering, making it the second-largest IPO globally this year. The successful listing comes as gold prices have reached all-time highs, driven by safe-haven demand and expectations of interest rate cuts. This debut contributes to a significant resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market, which has seen a nearly 700% year-on-year increase in funds raised in the first half of the year.

          <p>Leaders across Europe and the Middle East have welcomed a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages by Hamas within 72 hours, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Key Arab nations issued a joint statement supporting the effort, which they hope will lead to a two-state solution. The proposal also outlines a future for Gaza governed by a technocratic committee overseen by an international body, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair playing a role.</p>

          <p>President Trump has unveiled a 20-point plan, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, aimed at ending the Israel-Hamas war. The proposal mandates an immediate halt to fighting and requires Hamas to release all remaining hostages within 72 hours in exchange for a large number of Palestinian prisoners. Governance of Gaza would be transferred to a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" overseen by an international "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. The plan also includes provisions for the demilitarization of Gaza, a significant increase in humanitarian aid, and an Israeli withdrawal in phases, while leaving the door open for future Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Supermarkets Embrace Discount Tactics to Attract Price-Conscious Consumers</h2>

          <p>Major grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are shifting their strategy to compete for frugal shoppers by adopting tactics similar to those of discount chains like Aldi. Amid a slowing economy, these stores are reducing clutter, streamlining operations, and heavily promoting their own private-label brands, which offer comparable quality to name brands at lower prices. This pivot to a value-focused model aims to reverse a slump in sales and cater to a growing consumer demand for affordability. The trend reflects a broader shift in Chinese consumer behavior towards more rational and price-sensitive purchasing decisions.</p>

          <p>Meng Fanli, the current party chief of Shenzhen, has been appointed as the party chief of the Guangdong provincial government, positioning him to become the next governor of China's most prosperous province. This move is part of a high-level personnel reshuffle within the Communist Party, filling a vacancy left by the incumbent governor, who was promoted to a new role in Inner Mongolia. Meng took charge of Shenzhen in 2022 during a period of economic challenges, including the pandemic and trade war impacts. His promotion is expected to be formally confirmed by the provincial legislature.</p>

          <p>Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national, has been convicted in London for her central role in a massive cryptocurrency scam that defrauded over 128,000 victims in China between 2014 and 2017. She pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing over 61,000 bitcoins, valued at more than £5 billion, which constitutes one of the largest crypto seizures in the world. After fleeing China, Qian attempted to launder the stolen funds in the UK by purchasing property with the help of an accomplice. The conviction is the result of a complex, multi-jurisdictional investigation into the global money laundering operation.</p>

          <p>Two mountain lion cubs that were found alone and malnourished earlier this year have been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the San Diego County wilderness. The cubs received specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, where human interaction was minimized to encourage natural behaviors. This release is a positive development for California's wild mountain lion population, which is classified as "near-threatened" and faces significant risks from habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict. Recent studies suggest the state's population is smaller than previously estimated, making such conservation efforts crucial.</p>

          <p>After ending their full-season championship drought last year, the Los Angeles Dodgers are heading into the MLB postseason with a new set of challenges as they aim to become the first repeat champions in 25 years. Despite winning their division, the team failed to secure a first-round bye and will face the Cincinnati Reds in a wild-card series. The team's outlook is mixed, with a strong and healthy starting rotation seen as a major advantage over last year, but significant questions surrounding the reliability of their bullpen. The Dodgers hope to carry the momentum from a strong finish to the regular season into October.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point proposal for ending the Gaza war represents a significant diplomatic step, but its success hinges on overcoming deep-seated political challenges for both Israel and Hamas. While presented as a comprehensive deal, the plan is more of a framework with ambiguities that either side could use to stall negotiations. The analysis suggests that although Prime Minister Netanyahu has publicly accepted the principles, his political survival may depend on not fully implementing them. Ultimately, the plan's viability will depend on whether both parties see more to gain from peace than from continuing the conflict.</p>

          <p>Paralympic world champion Stef Reid is leading a campaign urging major sportswear companies like Nike, Adidas, and Puma to sell single shoes. As an amputee who competed with a carbon-fibre blade, Reid was forced to buy pairs of expensive running shoes while only needing one, resulting in significant waste and cost. Her campaign is motivated by both the financial burden and the principle of inclusivity, arguing that retailers' use of inclusive imagery with bladed mannequins should be matched by their sales practices. The initiative would also benefit thousands of non-amputees who have different-sized feet.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece proposes that Hong Kong should become the United Nations' primary hub in Asia, arguing that such a move would benefit both the UN and China. The author suggests that establishing a major UN secretariat in the city would support the organization's reform efforts by increasing its presence in the world's most populous continent. It would also align with China's Global Governance Initiative by leveraging Hong Kong's unique status as a common law jurisdiction with English as an official language. This could help Beijing strengthen its international engagement by bringing the world to China through Hong Kong.</p>
