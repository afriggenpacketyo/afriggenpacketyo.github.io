          <p>The U.S. Air Force conducted a routine test launch of an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The missile, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, traveled to a test range near the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The Air Force emphasized that the test was routine and not a response to current world events, designed to demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the nation's nuclear deterrent. The Minuteman weapon system, operational since the early 1970s, is slated to be replaced by the modernized Sentinel system.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is giving "very serious consideration to bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public" in a social media post. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that play a key role in America's housing financial system. They buy mortgages from lenders, bundle them into mortgage-backed securities, and sell those securities to investors, providing liquidity, stability, and affordability to the mortgage market. Trump stated he would consult with his economic advisers and make a decision soon.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to invest $1,000 on behalf of every American baby born over the next four years, initially referring to the accounts as ‚ÄúMAGA accounts‚Äù before changing the name to ‚ÄúTrump accounts.‚Äù Under the bill, children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested in financial markets. Upon reaching adulthood, the proceeds could be used for specific expenses like college or buying a house. The accounts have puzzled tax experts due to their lack of tax advantages compared to other investment vehicles.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024, falling to 431,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This decrease was attributed to declining numbers of people coming to work and study following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. The Home Office reported a decrease in asylum seekers being housed in hotels, but the number remains higher than when Labour came to power last year. The government aims to further reduce net migration through measures outlined in the Immigration White Paper.</p>
