          <p>Former President Trump has changed his opinion on a controversial American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, now calling it "fantastic" after learning she is a registered Republican. The ad, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," had drawn mixed reactions, with some critics alleging it had eugenics-era undertones while supporters defended it as a lighthearted marketing tactic. The article notes that Sweeney's Republican voter registration in Florida surfaced amid the social media debate surrounding the campaign. This development highlights the increasing intersection of celebrity culture and partisan politics.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has begun removing propaganda loudspeakers from its border with North Korea, a significant step aimed at de-escalating tensions and fostering trust. The speakers, which broadcasted anti-Pyongyang messages and K-pop music, were a major source of irritation for the North Korean regime. This conciliatory action by South Korea's new liberal government follows a halt to the broadcasts in June and represents a practical measure to revive dialogue between the two nations. The move was made unilaterally by the South, without prior military discussions with the North.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology start-ups Innovent and BeOne are projected to become profitable in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's biotech industry. This shift indicates that these companies are maturing and no longer solely reliant on investor funding for their operations. Innovent, in particular, is expected to see a major revenue boost from its newly launched weight-loss drug, mazdutide, which could contribute a substantial portion of its total sales. This development reflects the growing value and innovation within China's healthcare sector, benefiting both patients and government payers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced an extra £100 million in funding to intensify its crackdown on illegal people smuggling across the English Channel. The investment will support the National Crime Agency with up to 300 new officers and advanced technology to disrupt the criminal networks facilitating the crossings. This move comes as a record number of over 25,000 people have made the dangerous journey this year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the funding would help "track the gangs and bring them down," though political opponents have criticized the measure as insufficient.</p>

          <p>An international team of biologists from Cuba and the UK has initiated a project to save the endangered Polymita tree snails, often called the world's most beautiful. Native to eastern Cuba, these snails possess vibrant, multi-colored shells that, ironically, have made them a target for the illegal shell trade, pushing them toward extinction. The conservation effort aims to understand the snails' unique genetics, establish a captive breeding program, and combat the illegal trade that threatens their survival. The project highlights the dual role of the snails' beauty as both an evolutionary marvel and a critical vulnerability.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plans to launch a compensation scheme for motorists who were mis-sold car finance agreements involving hidden commissions. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while narrowing the scope for many claims, found that deals with particularly large, undisclosed commissions were unfair. The now-banned practice, known as discretionary commission arrangements, incentivized dealers to charge customers higher interest rates. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and provide redress to millions of consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Begins National Rollout of Gonorrhoea Vaccine in Sexual Health Clinics</h2>

          <p>In a world-first public health initiative, the UK has started a widespread rollout of a gonorrhoea vaccine through its sexual health clinics. The vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, is being offered first to high-risk groups to combat record-high infection rates and the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains. While the vaccine is only 30-40% effective, health officials predict it could prevent up to 100,000 cases over the next decade. This proactive measure is being hailed by sexual health charities as a significant new tool in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted infections.</p>

          <h2>Financial Expert Dave Ramsey Argues Debt, Not Income, Is the Cause of Financial Hardship</h2>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey asserts that many people struggle financially not because of insufficient income, but because their earnings are consumed by debt payments. He identifies credit cards, car payments, and student loans as the primary culprits that prevent individuals from building wealth. Ramsey's advice is to create a zero-based budget, aggressively pay down debt using the "debt snowball" method, and avoid financing purchases by paying with cash. He argues that this disciplined approach is how most millionaires achieve wealth, by saving and investing their income rather than giving it away to lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from 60 Minutes explores the significant financial costs associated with egg freezing, a procedure growing in popularity among women seeking to preserve their fertility. The average all-in cost for a single cycle can range from $12,000 to $13,000, and multiple cycles are often recommended to increase the chances of a future successful pregnancy. While some employers are beginning to offer coverage, the majority of women must pay out-of-pocket for the procedure, storage, and subsequent IVF treatments. This high price tag presents a major barrier for many considering the option as a form of reproductive insurance.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated a groundbreaking AI model named Genie 2, which can create playable, interactive 3D environments from a single static image or text prompt. This technology represents a significant leap in generative AI, moving beyond simple images and videos to build entire explorable worlds on the fly. CEO Demis Hassabis explained that beyond entertainment applications, the primary goal is to build a "world model" that understands our physical reality. Such simulated environments could be used to train AI agents and robots for complex tasks in a safe and infinitely variable setting before deployment in the real world.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, forcing the pilot to declare a mayday emergency. The Boeing 787, carrying 219 passengers and 11 crew members, was ascending when the left engine failed. The pilot communicated the emergency to air traffic control and safely returned the aircraft to Dulles. No injuries were reported, and the plane was towed to the gate where passengers deplaned. The airline confirmed the diversion was due to a mechanical issue and arranged alternate travel for the affected customers.</p>
