          <p>Residents of a South Texas community, primarily SpaceX employees, have voted overwhelmingly to establish a new city called Starbase, fulfilling a long-held ambition of Elon Musk. The community, located near SpaceX's rocket launch site, will now be eligible to form its own police and fire departments, adopt ordinances, and apply for state and federal grants. While road maintenance will no longer be the county's responsibility, the new municipality gains immunity from lawsuits and the power to condemn property. The New York Times article details the vote and the potential implications for the area.</p>

Measures include shuttle buses, advance ticket purchases, and hourly limits on visitors. Locals express support for these changes, aiming to preserve the town's serene atmosphere and cultural heritage, though officials are addressing loopholes to improve the system's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) is deploying inspection teams to investigate lower-level officials as part of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign.

The latest round includes 16 teams stationed in various regions, with Shanxi province and its former governor Jin Xiangjun already under investigation.
