          <h2>Guidance on Pausing Federal Student Loan Payments Through Deferment or Forbearance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of student loan borrowers are utilizing deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments. The primary difference is that interest may not accrue during deferment on certain government-subsidized loans, making it a preferable first option for those experiencing economic hardship. While forbearance is more accessible, interest typically continues to accumulate, which can significantly increase the total debt over time. Financial experts advise that these are short-term solutions and recommend exploring income-driven repayment plans for more sustainable, long-term management of student debt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, Dr. Marc Siegel argues that while vaccination is a personal choice, it becomes a matter of community protection when a disease is highly contagious. He contends that schools have the right to exclude unvaccinated children to protect those who are immunocompromised and cannot receive live-virus vaccines like the one for measles. The author criticizes the Florida surgeon general's stance against mandates, asserting that public health should not be politicized. The article differentiates between vaccines that stop transmission and those that reduce severity, justifying mandates based on their ability to protect the vulnerable.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Guidance on Investing in Gold Amid Record-High Prices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices reaching new records, investors are increasingly turning to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way to gain exposure to gold is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track its physical price, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). This method avoids the higher costs and storage issues associated with owning physical bullion. Despite its recent performance, financial advisors typically recommend limiting gold investments to a small percentage, such as under 3%, of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A district judge in Utah has invalidated the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature acted unconstitutionally by ignoring a voter-approved independent redistricting commission. In 2018, Utah voters passed a proposition to end gerrymandering, but lawmakers later gutted the commission and drew their own maps. The court's decision, which orders the legislature to draw a new, fairer map, is being hailed as a significant victory for voters and a rare pushback against partisan gerrymandering in a deeply Republican state. The ruling affirms that the will of the voters, as expressed through ballot initiatives, must be respected.</p>

          <p>The Chinese military has sent Y-20 transport aircraft to deliver emergency humanitarian aid to Afghanistan following a series of devastating earthquakes that have killed over 2,200 people. The initial shipments consist mainly of essential supplies like tents and blankets to assist those left homeless by the disaster. This aid mission is part of a 50 million yuan (US$7 million) emergency fund that Beijing has allocated at the request of officials in Kabul. More aid flights are scheduled to arrive in the coming days to support the ongoing relief efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A total lunar eclipse on Sunday evening will be visible across much of the UK, creating a spectacle known as a "Blood Moon." The Moon will take on a deep red color as it passes through the Earth's shadow, an effect caused by sunlight refracting through our planet's atmosphere. While the full eclipse occurs between 18:30 and 19:52 BST, UK viewers will only see it after moonrise, with visibility varying by location. Astronomers recommend finding a clear view of the eastern horizon to witness the celestial event, which requires no special eye protection.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, has been canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis was a tech-savvy youth who used his skills to create websites cataloging Eucharistic miracles to spread his faith. His relatively swift path to sainthood is seen by the Vatican as a way to connect with and inspire younger generations of Catholics. His body, preserved in wax, lies in Assisi, which has become a major pilgrimage site.</p>

More than 300 South Korean nationals were among the 475 workers arrested for allegedly working illegally.

The raid, part of a broader immigration crackdown, had caused diplomatic concern in Seoul, a key U.S. ally and major investor in American manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Charles Robinson, a 24-year-old university dropout, founded the water filtration company Water2, which has rapidly grown into an eight-figure business. After identifying a gap in the market for a simple, effective tap water filter, he developed a product with help from an academic at his former university. The brand's breakthrough came from authentic social media videos where Robinson shared his story, which resonated with consumers and led to explosive growth. The company's success even attracted British adventurer Bear Grylls, who became a customer and later a co-owner of the business.</p>
