          <p>Nvidia has announced its expectation to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, stating it has received assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary licenses will be granted. The sales of these chips, specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, were previously halted in April. This development occurs amid a preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing and follows increased lobbying by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has argued against the export controls. The company also announced a new, fully compliant GPU to support its global market strategy.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding economists' forecasts but decelerating from the previous quarter's growth. The data reflects an economy navigating challenges, including deflation, a housing market downturn, and the lingering effects of trade tensions with the United States. While industrial output was strong, key indicators like retail sales and fixed asset investment showed signs of slowing, pointing to insufficient domestic demand. Economists caution that underlying fragility remains, suggesting further fiscal stimulus may be necessary to ensure sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The crew, led by retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, includes members from India, Poland, and Hungary, marking a significant milestone for their respective national space programs. During their 18-day stay, the astronauts conducted numerous scientific experiments in microgravity. This mission is the fourth privately-funded flight organized by Axiom Space, which aims to develop a commercial successor to the aging ISS.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed a plan to send "top-of-the-line weapons" to Ukraine, facilitated through NATO countries who will be reimbursed by the United States for sending their own systems. This policy shift is coupled with a significant threat to Russia: the imposition of 100% secondary tariffs on countries trading with Moscow if a peace agreement is not reached within 50 days. The announcement, made alongside NATO chief Mark Rutte, marks a tougher stance against Russia from the Trump administration. The move aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities and pressure Vladimir Putin into negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's annual salary report often omits many of its highest-paid stars, a situation explained by the corporation's commissioning structure. Many top-tier presenters and actors are not directly employed by the BBC but by independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. Because BBC Studios competes in the commercial market, it is not required to disclose talent salaries funded through its productions, unlike those paid directly by the public license fee. This means the published list provides an incomplete picture of talent earnings for popular shows like "Strictly Come Dancing" or "The Traitors."</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary administrative stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the country. The decision comes after the immigration advocacy group CASA filed an emergency motion challenging the administration's move to terminate the protections. The Department of Homeland Security had announced in April that conditions in Afghanistan no longer warranted the special status. This ruling provides a temporary reprieve for Afghan evacuees while the legal challenge proceeds in court.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly advance the country's aircraft engine capabilities, particularly for next-generation fighter jets. The innovation involves a method for rapidly cooling forged superalloy turbine discs, a critical component that determines an engine's power, efficiency, and lifespan. The quality of these discs has historically been a major challenge for China's aerospace industry. This technological breakthrough could help close the gap with Western nations in the development of high-performance military aircraft engines.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally recommended that the Supreme Court deny the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Maxwell's legal team argued that her conviction was invalid due to a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to the district of Florida and did not grant nationwide immunity to potential co-conspirators like Maxwell. This response is the latest step in Maxwell's ongoing legal efforts to overturn her 2021 conviction.</p>
