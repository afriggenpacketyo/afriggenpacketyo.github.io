          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is essential for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan, particularly amid geopolitical tensions and de-dollarization discussions. Businesses in Qatar are interested in leveraging Hong Kong's yuan capabilities for joint ventures and investments with China. The trend reflects a broader move by countries and businesses to explore alternatives to the U.S. dollar in international trade, driven by the U.S.'s trade war. This push aligns with China's long-term strategy to internationalize its currency, aiming to reduce risks and establish financial independence amid increasing Sino-American decoupling.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, offering specialized care for individuals in acute mental distress. The NHS aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, reducing long A&E waits. While some are skeptical of the scheme, citing the difficulty of separating physical and mental health issues, others emphasize the need for proper funding and testing of the model before national rollout.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The incident occurred due to a temporary antenna's location, which disrupted contact with the helicopter as it approached the landing site. The Army stated that there were no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic, but the FAA air traffic controllers aborted the landings as a precaution due to conflicting positional data. The NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through the media before briefing the agency.</p>

Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision is driven by record-high rice prices in Japanese supermarkets, partly due to a poor harvest in 2023, with the average price reaching 4,268 yen per 5 kg, roughly double last year's level.</p>

The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and discourage youth vaping, but some former smokers worry about the accessibility and taste of rechargeable alternatives. Retailers have seen a surge in sales as customers stock up, while others fear a return to smoking cigarettes. The government hopes to reduce environmental impact and cut the number of children and young people vaping, but some believe the ban may be counter-productive.</p>

A symbolic development was Trump's approval of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel. Akazawa emphasized the importance of economic security issues in the tariff talks and expressed hope for an agreement between leaders next month.

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers to lower prices, aiming for a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms.

The government plans to commence procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms in early May, nearly double last year's level.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is downsizing and restructuring the National Security Council, with some staff being reassigned within the administration. Andy Baker, Vice President Vance's national security adviser, is taking a top role as deputy national security adviser. Approximately 20 people have been informed that they are on administrative leave as part of the changes. The restructuring comes after Marco Rubio replaced Mike Waltz as national security adviser. This move aims to streamline the NSC and reduce bureaucracy, but some former members express concern that fewer people will lead to less control of the bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire United States Steel Corp., according to a White House official. Trump stated that the two companies are set to sign a partnership that will create at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boon to the American economy. This decision follows a review by a panel of federal agencies and comes after initial opposition from Trump, who expressed concerns about Japanese ownership. Both steelmakers have praised the decision, with Nippon Steel calling it a "remarkable turning point" for the U.S. steel industry.</p>
