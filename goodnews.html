          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as no casualties were reported, raising hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil futures fell significantly, and the global benchmark Brent also decreased. The strike was in retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, and Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the missiles without causing casualties. Energy Secretary Chris Wright attributed the oil sell-off to the belief that tensions in the Middle East would eventually de-escalate due to President Trump's foreign policy.

          <p>The U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about the potential impact on the oil and gas industry, particularly the possibility of higher energy prices. While oil prices initially surged, they later retreated as experts doubted Iran would close the Strait of Hormuz. Disruptions to the Strait could severely impact oil markets, especially in countries like China, India, Japan, and South Korea. While a closure is deemed unlikely, even a limited disruption could cause prices to spike significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeowners are advised to carefully consider their options regarding home equity loans this summer, understanding the differences between a home equity loan and a HELOC. A home equity loan disburses the equity in a single lump sum with a fixed interest rate, while a HELOC functions as a revolving line of credit with variable interest rates. Shopping around for rates and terms is crucial, and homeowners should use the equity for financially sound purposes rather than frivolous expenses. Using home equity wisely can improve financial standing, but poor decisions can worsen it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Venice is experiencing protests ahead of Jeff Bezos' wedding due to concerns about the event's extravagance and its impact on the city. Activists are protesting what they see as the privatization of Venice and the prioritization of tourism over residents' needs. They have hung anti-Bezos posters and banners throughout the city. While organizers claim to be minimizing disruptions and supporting local organizations, protesters worry about the environmental impact and the worsening of Venice's housing crisis.</p>
