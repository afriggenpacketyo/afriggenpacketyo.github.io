          <p>Anthony Albanese has been re-elected as Australia's Prime Minister in a decisive victory, defying expectations and securing a significant majority for the Labor Party. Albanese's campaign focused on cost-of-living concerns, healthcare affordability, and climate change. The election outcome marks a turnaround from earlier polls that had indicated low approval ratings for Albanese. He emphasized reconciliation with First Nations people and promised to address inequality. The Liberal-National coalition suffered a major defeat, with Peter Dutton conceding and losing his own seat after 24 years.</p>

          <p>Michigan State Senator and U.S. Senate candidate Mallory McMorrow has publicly distanced herself from the use of 'inclusive language,' such as 'birthing persons,' despite the inclusion of such terms in her constituent newsletters as recently as November 2024. McMorrow stated that these phrases can be alienating to voters outside the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Her campaign clarified that while McMorrow writes a portion of her newsletters, the 'birthing' language was written by the Senate Democratic Caucus. McMorrow has been critical of Chuck Schumer's leadership and is advocating for a new generation of leaders in Washington.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that grizzly bears, which disappeared from California in the 1920s, could potentially return to the state. The study identifies suitable regions and highlights the ecological benefits of reintroducing the species. While public support is mixed, proponents emphasize the symbolic and environmental advantages of restoring the grizzly population. Reintroduction would be a slow, deliberate process, starting with a small number of wild-born female bears in remote areas. The return of grizzlies could shift the narrative from loss to a future of ecological restoration.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that certain lifestyle choices can significantly lower the risk of developing dementia, stroke, and depression later in life. A study in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry found that modifiable risk factors account for a substantial portion of these conditions. Key practices include managing physical activity, maintaining a healthy diet, and engaging in cognitive stimulation. People who have experienced a stroke are more likely to develop depression or dementia, and vice versa, highlighting the interconnectedness of these brain conditions.</p>

          <p>Several German states are contemplating banning smartphones from classrooms, with one high school already piloting the initiative. The Dalton High School in Alsdorf requires students to keep their smartphones turned off in their bags throughout the school day.

However, some student representatives and unions are skeptical, arguing that students should learn responsible smartphone use instead.
