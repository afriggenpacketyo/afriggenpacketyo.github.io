          <h2>US Southern Border Sees Historic Low in Unlawful Crossings for June</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data obtained by CBS News reveals that unlawful migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 apprehensions recorded. The Trump administration attributes this significant decrease to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced border security measures, which stand in stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration. Officials also noted that for the second consecutive month, no migrants were released into the U.S. pending their court cases. These policies, including swift deportations and the deployment of troops, have faced legal challenges and criticism from civil rights advocates.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced via social media that Israel has accepted the conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in its ongoing conflict with Hamas. While details of the proposal were not disclosed, Trump urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating it is their best possible offer. The announcement comes ahead of a meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Previous ceasefire efforts have failed, and neither Israel nor Hamas has officially commented on this new proposal, which is reportedly being delivered by mediators from Qatar and Egypt. The war, which began in October 2023, has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a new law that bans smoking in most public areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in an effort to "denormalize" the habit. Violators of the new rules face fines up to 826 euros, although an initial grace period is expected. The move targets the country's high smoking rate, which contributes to 75,000 deaths annually, and is particularly concerned with the popularity of smoking among young people. While smoking in restaurants and bars has been illegal for years, caf√© terraces remain a notable exception, which some view as a last bastion of freedom.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, named "Amara's Law" after Amara Strande, a 20-year-old who advocated for the bill while dying from cancer, will phase out nonessential PFAS products by 2032. The state has a history of PFAS contamination from manufacturing giant 3M, which has agreed to pay $850 million for cleanup and cease production. Strande's family sees the law as her legacy, demonstrating the profound impact one individual can have on public health policy.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, only three of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks‚ÄîMicrosoft, Nvidia, and Meta‚Äîmanaged to close the first half of the year at all-time highs. Cramer attributes Microsoft's success to its rebounding Azure cloud growth and Nvidia's rally to its persistent dominance in the AI chip market despite earlier concerns. He suggests Meta's outperformance, following an initial dip, was driven by its surprisingly strong advertising business and impressive quarterly earnings. These three companies have distinguished themselves from their megacap peers in a challenging quarter for the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy has demonstrated notable resilience through the first six months of 2025, navigating US trade policy shifts while maintaining stable growth. While the country is on track to meet its annual GDP growth target of around 5%, experts warn of emerging challenges in the latter half of the year. Analysts predict that export growth will likely slow or even contract due to a front-loading of orders and an expected slowdown in US consumer spending. Despite diversifying its trade partners, China faces an uphill climb to sustain its economic momentum through the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California has passed what experts are calling the most significant reform to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in its 55-year history. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, largely exempts low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas from the lengthy and costly CEQA review process. This move is intended to remove a major barrier to development, reduce the threat of lawsuits from project opponents, and address the state's severe housing affordability crisis. While other hurdles remain, the reform marks a seismic political shift away from policies that have stifled construction.</p>

          <p>A large, invasive Argentine black and white tegu was successfully captured in a county park near San Jos√©, California, after being spotted by hikers. Park officials had issued a public warning, advising people to stay away from the lizard, which can grow up to five feet long. While not directly dangerous to humans, tegus pose a significant threat to local ecosystems by preying on the eggs of native ground-nesting birds and other reptiles. The captured tegu was likely an escaped pet, highlighting the dangers of exotic pet ownership and its potential to introduce harmful invasive species.</p>
