          <p>Investors are increasingly favoring short-term Treasury bills, mirroring Warren Buffett's strategy, due to concerns about market volatility and stable yields. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) have attracted significant investor flows, reflecting a preference for ultrashort opportunities. Berkshire Hathaway has doubled its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries. This trend suggests a cautious approach to fixed-income investments, with investors prioritizing stability over long-term duration. (not investment advice)</p>
