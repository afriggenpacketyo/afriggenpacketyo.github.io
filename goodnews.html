          <p>In Kerrville, Texas, a family-owned restaurant named Billy Gene’s is providing free, home-cooked meals to first responders managing the catastrophic flood crisis. The owners expressed their gratitude for the emergency personnel, stating that offering food is their way of supporting the community during this difficult time. This act of kindness highlights the local spirit of resilience and mutual support as the community grapples with the disaster's aftermath. The restaurant itself was not damaged, but it is helping an employee who lost their home in the flood.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reportedly allowed a rule requiring passengers in standard screening lines to remove their shoes to expire at some U.S. airports. While the change appears to be a phased rollout, travelers at several major airports have reported not having to remove footwear. This adjustment brings the standard screening process closer to the expedited TSA PreCheck experience, which already permits leaving shoes on. The TSA stated it is continuously exploring ways to improve the passenger experience while maintaining strong security.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (CalTech) is severing ties with e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit. The suit alleged that the partners misled students about a costly cybersecurity boot camp, falsely implying it had strong connections to the prestigious university and its faculty. As part of the settlement, CalTech and Simplilearn agreed to new transparency measures and will provide over $2.4 million in tuition refunds. The case represents a significant victory for critics of the growing online program management industry, which has faced scrutiny for questionable quality and marketing practices.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has reversed its plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have eliminated up to 80,000 jobs. The agency now states that it will achieve its staffing reduction goal of about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through normal attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze. The initial plan was part of a Trump administration effort to cut the federal workforce to pre-Biden administration levels. Critics argue the high rate of attrition is due to a toxic work environment and will negatively impact veteran care.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has officially concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that no evidence of a so-called "client list" or blackmail material exists. The findings, detailed in a public memo, aim to quell years of conspiracy theories surrounding the case. Investigators confirmed that no one entered Epstein's cell at the time of his death and found no credible evidence to pursue charges against other third parties. The White House affirmed its commitment to transparency while noting some graphic material was withheld from public release.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been selected for his 11th career All-Star Game, this time as a special “Legend Pick” by the MLB Commissioner. The 37-year-old, who recently recorded his 3,000th career strikeout, expressed surprise and gratitude for the honor, acknowledging he wouldn't have been chosen based on his limited number of starts this season. This selection recognizes his distinguished career and allows him to participate in the Midsummer Classic, an event he says he never takes for granted. His selection ties him with Mike Trout for the most among active players.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea has aborted a $2.2 billion plan to purchase 36 additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, citing their vulnerability on the modern battlefield. The decision was influenced by the demonstrated effectiveness of drones, loitering munitions, and advanced air defenses in conflicts like the one in Ukraine. A South Korean lawmaker stated that instead of investing in expensive legacy platforms, the country must prioritize capabilities that reflect the future of warfare. This move signals a significant strategic shift for a key U.S. ally and reflects a broader reevaluation of the attack helicopter's role. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a surprising turn, police in Budapest, Hungary, announced they will not prosecute participants of the recent Pride parade, which was officially banned by the government. The decision comes after the event drew a record crowd of over 200,000 people, with organizers like Budapest's mayor facing potential prison time for defying the prohibition. Police cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, created by organizers, as the reason for not pursuing legal action. This development is a notable moment for LGBTQ+ rights in a country with an increasingly restrictive political climate.</p>

A UK-France summit hosted by Prime Minister Keir Starmer will also address illegal channel crossings and continued support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Market analyst Jim Cramer advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's latest tariff announcements, suggesting they are likely a starting point for negotiations rather than a fixed policy. He argued that the administration has a history of postponing or reducing tariffs and that the ultimate goal is to increase U.S. exports, not just build domestic plants. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction to the news, Cramer believes the tariffs may not significantly impact inflation or the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, and he cautioned against major selling.
