        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Design software company Figma is preparing for its initial public offering, with plans to sell approximately 37 million shares at a price between $25 and $28 each. This could result in a fully diluted valuation for the company of up to $16.4 billion and generate as much as $1 billion in proceeds. The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2022 due to regulatory opposition. The company reported strong preliminary revenue growth for the second quarter and has added notable figures like Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger to its board.</p>

          <p>Two uplifting stories showcase the profound impact of giving back and innovation in the face of adversity. One man, Brian Flynn, became a rare double living organ donor by donating a kidney to a stranger and later part of his liver to a 4-year-old boy, saving both their lives. In another story, teenager Rachel Bee, diagnosed with Crohn's disease, invented a specialized sweatshirt with zippered sleeves called "Infusion Hero" to provide warmth and comfort to patients during IV treatments. Both individuals have found deep meaning and purpose by transforming personal challenges into opportunities to help others.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, a company that rents out AI data centers, saw its stock rise over 5% after announcing plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds due in 2031. The company intends to use the capital for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May that was reportedly five times oversubscribed, signaling strong investor confidence in the company's growth strategy. CoreWeave, which counts Nvidia and Microsoft as major clients, has seen its share price more than triple since its Nasdaq debut in March.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has officially announced that its highly popular Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) will return to menus on August 26, 2025. This year's launch continues the trend of an early autumn season for the coffee giant, which is also reintroducing other fall favorites and adding new items like a Pecan Cortado and Italian Sausage Egg Bites. The return of the PSL is a key part of Starbucks' strategy to boost sales and customer traffic, which have recently stalled after years of strong growth. The iconic beverage has become a cultural phenomenon since its introduction in 2003.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While filing a tax extension grants an additional six months to submit tax returns, it does not postpone the deadline for paying the taxes owed to the IRS. Taxpayers must still estimate their tax liability and pay it by the original April 15 deadline to avoid penalties and interest. The late payment penalty is typically 0.5% of the unpaid amount per month, and interest accrues daily on the outstanding balance. For those unable to pay their full bill, the IRS offers options such as installment agreements and, in cases of severe financial hardship, an Offer in Compromise.</p>

The ship was found 60 miles off the coast of Scotland at a depth of 82 meters by the historical shipwreck project, ProjectXplore. Thirty-eight crew members were killed when the ship was torpedoed on August 19, 1916, but its final resting place remained a mystery despite numerous search attempts.

The proposal includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on land formerly occupied by a golf club. The campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected for public recreation. The judge ruled that the planning authority's decision was a rational judgment, allowing the significant expansion to proceed.</p>
