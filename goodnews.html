          <p>Nvidia's stock fluctuated as the company reported strong quarterly earnings, with sales surging 56% to $46.74 billion, slightly above estimates, and adjusted earnings per share topping projections. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized "tremendous progress" in AI, projecting $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. However, the outlook was clouded by uncertainty surrounding future sales in China, following a Trump administration block on its H20 chip. While a deal to restart sales is pending, management noted a "real possibility" for its advanced Blackwell processor in China, but H20 shipments remain conditional on the geopolitical environment (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Department for Transport has announced the first electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for discounts under a new £650 million grant scheme, aiming to encourage a shift from petrol and diesel cars. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier qualify for the maximum £3,750 discount, while 26 other models receive £1,500. The grants, available for three years, aim to make EV prices competitive with their fossil fuel counterparts. Despite government pledges to ban new petrol/diesel car sales by 2030, high upfront costs and a lack of charging points remain significant barriers for many drivers, who also advocate for incentives for hybrid vehicles.</p>

          <p>Pure Storage shares surged over 30% to a record high after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results and raising its full-year guidance. The data storage management vendor saw significant success from its deal with Meta, where it is a "key storage provider" for AI infrastructure, recognizing revenue from deployments in the second quarter. CEO Charles Giancarlo highlighted the company's ability to efficiently manage space, power, and cooling, which is crucial for energy-intensive AI operations. The company expects to deploy 1-2 exabytes with Meta by year-end and sees increased interest from other hyperscalers, signaling strong growth in the AI-driven storage market (not investment advice).</p>

While the grand prize remains unclaimed, six tickets won prizes of $1 million or more in New York, Arizona, and Virginia, with three winning $2 million.

          <h2>Kim Harvey Appointed Executive Producer of Struggling 'CBS Evening News'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 12:37:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Veteran producer Kim Harvey has been named the new executive producer of the "CBS Evening News," replacing Guy Campanile, as the program continues to struggle with declining viewership since its recent revamp. The newscast, which introduced co-anchors John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois and a "60 Minutes"-style emphasis on longer stories, has failed to gain traction against competitors. Harvey's appointment, following her previous role as senior broadcast producer, is seen as a precursor to potential larger changes, including a possible return to a single anchor and a more traditional news format. This leadership change occurs amid speculation about the future of CBS News under new parent company Skydance Media.</p>

Jim Cramer noted the market's difficulty to "kill," highlighting the strength of these portfolio members even as Nvidia's stock experienced slight pressure. Analysts suggested that the rallies in these stocks indicate that fears of a serious deceleration in Nvidia's growth might be misplaced.

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed removing tariffs on American industrial goods, fulfilling a key part of the US-EU framework trade agreement. This move will retroactively ensure lower automobile tariffs for the EU, starting from August 1st. The European Commission stated these steps aim to restore stability and predictability in trade relations, benefiting businesses and citizens on both sides. The proposal now requires approval from the European Parliament and Council. This development follows weeks of tense negotiations and President Donald Trump's earlier announcement of a 15% tariff on most European goods, including cars, which he said the deal would address.</p>

          <p>The US economy expanded at a robust 3.3% annualized pace in the second quarter, surpassing initial estimates and analysts' forecasts, according to the Commerce Department. This stronger-than-expected growth was primarily fueled by a rise in consumer spending and an increase in final sales to private domestic purchasers, a key indicator for Federal Reserve officials. The GDP figure also reflected the unusual impact of tariffs, with a significant tumble in imports and a smaller fall in exports. While the economy grew about 2.1% in the first half of the year, experts predict a slower pace going forward as tariffs become more visible to consumers (not investment advice).</p>

Amorim's post-match comments had sparked speculation about his future, but club sources emphasize a long-term vision for his tenure, avoiding short-term decisions based on a few poor results. The club has significantly backed Amorim with a £200 million transfer budget this summer for attacking players. While negotiations are ongoing for several players to join other clubs, Amorim is expected to address his comments and the team's performance ahead of upcoming Premier League matches and major derby games.</p>

These solar-powered robots mimic real rabbits by emitting heat, smell, and natural movements, helping to detect the highly camouflaged snakes that are decimating native wildlife. This effort follows previous, more costly attempts using live rabbits. The $4,000 per robot project, financed by the South Florida Water Management District and University of Florida researchers, uses cameras to alert contractors for python removal. While in its infancy, initial results are promising, with officials confident in the long-term success of this novel approach.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the concept of diversity in business, distinguishing between acquired attributes (skills, opinions) and innate attributes (race, gender), and questioning the effectiveness of traditional DEI programs. It highlights research suggesting that cognitive and creative diversity, including ideological differences, are more valuable for innovation and protecting against groupthink than solely demographic diversity. The author notes a growing resistance to political differences in society and offers three pointers for companies to pursue truly useful diversity: avoid demographic proxies, seek individuals with high openness to new ideas, and embrace political diversity to gain market information and avoid errors. Cultivating curiosity is presented as key to achieving this.</p>

Players like Casper Ruud and Maria Sakkari have voiced frustration, citing the distraction during matches. Despite a strict no-smoking policy within the grounds, New York's legalization of recreational cannabis in 2021 allows legal consumption in adjacent Corona Park, from where the odor drifts. Tournament officials maintain vigilance but acknowledge the challenge of controlling external factors.
