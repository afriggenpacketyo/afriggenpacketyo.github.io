          <p>According to sources, a brief outage at Newark Liberty International Airport caused air traffic control computer screens to go dark for approximately 60 to 90 seconds, preventing controllers from communicating with aircraft. The incident led to significant delays, exacerbating existing issues due to short-staffing, runway construction, and adverse weather conditions in the New York City metro area. Newark was the world's most delayed airport on Monday morning, highlighting the severity of the disruptions caused by the outage and compounding pre-existing issues. </p>

          <p>The Greek government has launched "Kids Wallet," a state-operated mobile application designed to help parents monitor their children's screen time and verify their age on digital platforms and social networks. Digital Governance Minister Dimitris Papastergiou emphasized that this tool empowers parents to protect their children online, confirming their ages when using social media. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed concerns about technology's impact on family life, supporting the initiative which sets the age for parental consent at 15, with the app's use being voluntary. The app integrates with government services and allows parents to restrict app access and set daily time limits, aligning with EU plans for enhanced online protection for minors.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democrats, is anticipated to become Germany's next chancellor following his party's election victory in February. The Bundestag is set to decide on May 6, after all parties in the proposed government agreed to a coalition agreement laid out in early April, marking a significant moment in his unconventional political career. Despite never holding a top governmental office with leadership responsibilities, Merz hopes to lead a coalition between the CDU and the SPD, mediating between their interests. Merz, a commercial lawyer from Sauerland, is described as a "trans-atlanticist, friend of Europe, and reformer," potentially making him well-suited for the current times.</p>

          <p>The annual Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art raised a record $31 million this year, solidifying its status as a premier fundraising event in the city, though this figure does not account for the substantial cost of staging the event.

Hosted by an array of Black celebrities, the event's proceeds will support the Costume Institute, the only department that raises its own budget.

          <p>After six decades of leadership, Warren Buffett announced his retirement as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, marking the end of an era. Buffett's tenure saw Berkshire's stock rise from $18 a share to over $809,000, vastly outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Known for his long-term focus, Buffett eschewed Wall Street's chicanery and treated his duty to shareholders as a sacred trust, earning comparisons to J.P. Morgan Sr. His success was rooted in his ability to look past short-term distractions and focus on long-term value, making him an irreplaceable figure in American capitalism.</p>

According to AAA, U.S. drivers are paying $3.165 per gallon on average, which is an increase from last week.

          <p>The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change on the agency recovering overpayments that sparked concerns it could cause financial hardship for tens of thousands of beneficiaries. In an April 25 "emergency message" to Social Security employees, the agency said it is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%. The change comes after SSA on March 27 started recovering erroneous overpayments to Social Security recipients by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up shaply from the prior rate of 10%. The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration.</p>
