          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has announced a breakthrough in the fight to reauthorize and expand access to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), which provides compensation to individuals exposed to nuclear waste. The Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes the largest expansion of the program since its inception in 1990. Individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders" exposed to nuclear radiation from atomic bomb testing, will be eligible for compensation. Hawley calls this a "huge step forward" and a "huge victory" for those affected by nuclear exposure, with the Senate having previously passed expansions that failed in the House due to cost concerns.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Todd S. Purdum's biography, "Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television," explores the impact of the Cuban-born entertainer on American culture, highlighting his role in transforming television production methods and turning himself and Lucille Ball into cultural icons. The excerpt emphasizes Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen and his ability to assemble a world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to film the show in front of a live studio audience with three cameras in sync. Arnaz's ability to preserve episodes on film led to the invention of the rerun and syndication, establishing a business model that lasted for decades.</p>

          <h2>Consumer Sentiment Rebounds as Tariff Shock Subsides</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 10:27:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment in early June showed a considerable rebound as concerns about the economy and potential inflation surges eased, particularly with progress in the global trade war, according to a University of Michigan survey. The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, surpassing expectations, with improvements across current conditions and future expectations. This shift coincides with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs and a 90-day negotiation period, notably with China. Despite these improvements, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels, with ongoing worries about the impact of tariffs on prices and geopolitical concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is reportedly close to finalizing a return to Saracens after a season with French side Racing 92. While a deal has not yet been signed, an agreement is expected to be reached to allow Farrell to move this summer. Saracens are seeking cover for the injured Alex Lozowski and are allowed dispensation in the salary cap to replace him for next season. Though initial reports suggested a player-coach role, sources indicate it will be a two-year deal as a player only, with a transition into coaching at Saracens appearing inevitable.</p>

          <p>Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS began trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.65 a share, valuing the company at approximately $30 billion. JBS operates worldwide, with divisions in Brazil, the U.S., and Australia, and owns over 80% of Pilgrim's Pride. The U.S. listing comes after more than 15 years of planning, which was delayed due to corruption investigations involving JBS and its top executives. The company faced bribery charges and fines, leading to opposition from lawmakers, but was eventually approved by the SEC in April.</p>

          <p>A second judge has halted additional provisions of President Trump's executive order related to voting, affirming a pause on requiring proof of citizenship for national voter registration and blocking a provision barring states from counting mail ballots postmarked by Election Day but received after. Judge Denise Casper emphasized that the Constitution grants states the power to set election rules, not the president. The ruling also blocked new requirements for U.S. citizens abroad, including military members, to provide proof of citizenship and eligibility when registering to vote.</p>
