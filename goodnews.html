        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally called on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to permit him to appoint peers to the House of Lords. Farage argues that the current composition of the upper chamber exhibits a significant democratic disparity, particularly given Reform UK's substantial popular vote at the general election and recent successes in local government. He highlighted that other parties with fewer votes, such as the Liberal Democrats, possess a disproportionately higher number of peers. Farage's request aims to address this imbalance, though Downing Street indicated that appointments adhere to established conventions and advisory bodies, suggesting a complex path forward for his proposal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article, from NPR's "Short Wave" podcast, delves into the fundamental question of what constitutes "life," exploring the criteria that define living organisms. Developmental biologist Crystal Rogers, featured as part of Black History Month, discusses the complexities of applying these definitions to challenging cases such as viruses, which exhibit some but not all characteristics of life. The discussion also extends to futuristic concepts like android robots, prompting a Star-Trek-themed debate on sentience and existence. This insightful piece highlights the ongoing scientific and philosophical challenges in precisely defining what it means to be alive.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has announced his government's intention to restore the 2018 Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA) with North Korea, aiming to curb the risk of accidental clashes along their heavily fortified border. The pact, which previously included measures such as ending military drills near the border, banning live-fire exercises, and establishing no-fly zones, fractured amid rising tensions and mutual accusations of breaches. President Lee's administration seeks to re-engage Pyongyang, having already ceased activist balloon launches and dismantled loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts. However, the potential response from North Korea remains uncertain, as top officials have recently dismissed such diplomatic overtures.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study from Tsinghua University reveals that China's textile industry produced over one billion tonnes of textile fibers between 1978 and 2022, a period of immense economic and societal transformation. This staggering volume, approximately double the total human mass on the planet, underscores China's unparalleled role as a global clothing supplier. The research also highlights significant environmental concerns, noting that China's textile waste recovery rate is a mere 17%, with most recovered materials being downcycled.

          <p>Following a remarkable Premier League title victory in his debut season, Liverpool manager Arne Slot faces significantly increased pressure due to the club's unprecedented summer spending, potentially exceeding £300 million. Major acquisitions like Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, and Hugo Ekitike elevate expectations for continued success, including retaining the league title and winning the Champions League. While Slot has demonstrated a calm and tactically shrewd approach, the integration of numerous new, young players and the shift from being the "hunters" to the "hunted" will be a substantial test of his leadership. Despite these challenges, the club's fanbase maintains strong trust in his proven capabilities.</p>

          <p>Surrey Police have launched the "Jog On" campaign, deploying female police officers in plain clothes to identify and address street-based harassment, including catcalling and sexually suggestive comments, directed at joggers. PC Abby Hayward, an officer involved, shared her personal experience of feeling "icky" and having her runs "ruined" by such behavior. The initiative, part of a broader commitment to tackle public space violence against women and girls, has focused on educating perpetrators rather than making arrests. This proactive approach aims to bridge a significant reporting gap, as a recent survey indicated nearly half of harassment incidents go unreported.</p>

          <p>A children's playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has safely reopened after a remarkable discovery led to the removal of 177 World War Two practice bombs, buried just inches beneath the surface for decades. The ordnance, found during the installation of new equipment, prompted a three-week operation by specialized explosive ordnance disposal teams. Theories suggest the bombs were deliberately interred by soldiers or the Home Guard in a former wartime ordnance depot, a common practice for disposing of excess munitions in the post-war era when safety standards were minimal. Local residents expressed immense relief that the devices, which carried a charge, are now safely cleared.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have released new guidelines for managing hypertension, strongly recommending reduced alcohol consumption and continued vigilance over sodium intake. The updated advice suggests men limit alcohol to two drinks daily and women to one, noting that even a 50% reduction can lead to healthier blood pressure levels. Clinicians are now advised to initiate lifestyle changes for individuals diagnosed with stage 1 hypertension. The report also advocates for adopting heart-healthy diets like the DASH plan and engaging in regular physical activity to mitigate the pervasive impact of heart disease, which remains a leading global cause of death.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by a stronger-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, primarily propelled by resilient exports despite recent U.S. tariff headwinds. On an annualized basis, growth reached 1%, more than doubling initial forecasts. While positive market reactions included a rise in the Nikkei 225 and a slight yen appreciation, analysts anticipate a renewed slowdown in upcoming quarters. This projection is attributed to expected softening in investment spending and a slight decline in exports, particularly in light of the new 15% blanket tariff on all Japanese exports to the U.S. The Bank of Japan, while upgrading its fiscal year forecast, also cautioned about global trade policies impacting domestic corporate profits.
