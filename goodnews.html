          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. has finalized an agreement to acquire United States Steel Corp., making it a wholly-owned subsidiary, after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed his initial opposition. The deal grants Nippon Steel, Japan's largest steelmaker, greater access to the expanding U.S. market for high-grade steel. As part of the agreement, the U.S. government will retain a "golden share," allowing it to veto significant management decisions to protect national interests.

          <p>Japan is arranging the evacuation of approximately 90 nationals and their family members from Iran by land, as concerns grow over the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel. The Japanese nationals will travel by bus to neighboring Azerbaijan, as airports have been closed. The government is also considering deploying a Self-Defense Forces transport aircraft to Djibouti for standby. Additionally, an overland evacuation of Japanese nationals from Israel to Jordan is being organized. The decision follows Japan's raising of its travel alert for Iran to the highest level, advising nationals to evacuate.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, revealed that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees by offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is personally trying to build a top artificial intelligence team for its "superintelligence" AI lab, investing heavily in AI through Meta AI. These efforts come after Meta reportedly delayed the release of its latest AI model due to capability concerns. Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, recently joined Meta as part of a deal involving a significant stake in the AI startup.</p>

          <h2>UK Parliament Moves to Decriminalize Abortion in England and Wales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 08:25:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, approving an amendment to a crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished for ending a pregnancy. The change aims to protect vulnerable women and end the prosecution of those suspected of illegal abortions, including some who suffered miscarriages. While doctors can legally carry out abortions up to 24 weeks, the amendment seeks to repeal parts of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which has led to recent prosecutions. Supporters hail it as a landmark reform for reproductive rights.</p>
