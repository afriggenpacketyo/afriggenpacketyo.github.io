        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) are offering returns that can help protect savings. While national average yields for CDs remain modest, online banks are providing significantly higher rates, with some one-year terms exceeding 4.40% APY. Financial experts note that an inverted yield curve currently makes short-term CDs more lucrative than long-term ones. To maximize returns, savers are advised to compare offerings from online institutions and consider laddering CDs with varying terms to balance high rates with long-term goals.

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose approximately 4% after the company maintained its full-year forecast, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The home improvement retailer is navigating a market where homeowners exhibit a "deferral mindset" for large projects due to economic uncertainty. However, the company saw encouraging signs, including a 2.6% increase in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. Home Depot's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate home improvement spending.</p>

          <p>Kentucky's governor has issued an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug known as "designer Xanax," which has been linked to dozens of overdose deaths in the state. The action makes possession or sale of the drug illegal and follows a request from the state's attorney general. This move is part of a larger effort by a coalition of 21 attorneys general urging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to classify the unregulated substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance nationwide, citing a growing public health threat.</p>

          <p>During his visit to the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a letter from his wife, First Lady Olena Zelenska, to Melania Trump. The letter expressed gratitude for Mrs. Trump's efforts to raise awareness about the estimated 19,500 Ukrainian children who have been abducted by Russia since the 2022 invasion. This diplomatic gesture followed Melania Trump's own public letter to Vladimir Putin, urging him to consider the children's welfare. The issue of returning these children is a central humanitarian point in Ukraine's position for any potential peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has reached a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, ending a strike that lasted nearly four days and caused widespread travel disruptions. The airline announced plans to gradually resume flights but cautioned that it could take up to a week for operations to fully return to normal. While the full terms have not been disclosed, the union stated the deal achieves "transformational change," including addressing the key issue of unpaid work for time spent on the ground. The agreement must now be ratified by union members.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against a Maryland-based ticket broker, Key Investment Group, for allegedly making millions by illegally purchasing and reselling hundreds of thousands of event tickets.

In one year, the group allegedly bought nearly 380,000 tickets for $57 million and resold them for about $64 million, violating federal consumer protection laws.</p>

          <p>Best Buy is launching a third-party marketplace on its website and app in an effort to reverse a trend of declining sales and broaden its product selection. The new platform will allow vetted third-party sellers to offer items not traditionally stocked by the retailer, such as custom tech accessories, seasonal decor, and sports collectibles. This strategy, similar to those used by Amazon and Walmart, aims to fill gaps in Best Buy's assortment and create a new revenue stream from sales commissions. The move is a key part of the company's strategy to adapt to changing consumer shopping habits.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis column from CNBC's Investing Club argues that the recent 5% decline in Cisco Systems' stock is an overreaction to an otherwise strong earnings report. The column suggests this pullback is an opportunity to buy shares, citing significant momentum in the company's AI infrastructure orders, which totaled over $800 million from major tech clients. While acknowledging a revenue miss in the security segment, the analysis attributes this primarily to cuts in U.S. federal government spending, with the rest of the portfolio showing strong growth.

          <p>A recent study from Fidelity Investments indicates that despite market volatility, overall investor confidence remains relatively high, with newer investors showing increasing bullishness. However, more seasoned investors, likely having experienced past downturns, have a more pessimistic outlook and lower risk tolerance. A certified financial planner advises that all investors should be continuously calibrating their risk based on their goals and life changes. Maintaining a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs is recommended to navigate the market's ups and downs. (not investment advice)</p>
