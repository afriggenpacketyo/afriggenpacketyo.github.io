        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury yields experienced a decline as investors reacted to President Trump's renewed threats of trade tariffs against the European Union and Apple. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 2 basis points to 5.041%, while the 10-year Treasury yield fell by 4 basis points to 4.515%. Trump suggested imposing a 50% tariff on the EU and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., which led to market volatility and a flight to safety in bonds. This occurred after concerns arose earlier in the week regarding Trump's budget bill and its potential impact on the U.S. deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jemele Hill has dismissed claims that Caitlin Clark is being specifically targeted in the WNBA, asserting that the hard fouls and trash talk are simply part of the competition. Clark, who became a college phenom, has faced physical play and allegations of racism since joining the league, but Hill believes that these are normal aspects of basketball. Hill's comments came after an incident where Clark and Rhyne Howard had to be separated during a game, with Clark appearing to say, "I'm not scared of you." The Indiana Fever won the game against the Atlanta Dream 82-76, with Clark contributing 11 points.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's plans to sharply cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the Department of Government Efficiency initiative led by Elon Musk. The order halts further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch during the lawsuit. Judge Susan Illston emphasized that Congress creates and funds federal agencies, and agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates.

          <p>The domestic policy bill passed by House Republicans includes a mix of broad measures and subtle tweaks, some only tangentially related to the bill's main objectives. Among the changes are a tax break for the U.S. Virgin Islands, lighter regulation for A.I. companies, legal protections for Trump officials, a new break for investors, and more generous terms for health savings accounts. There is also a shake-up to the tobacco industry. These provisions could change as the legislation moves through the Senate, but are a glimpse into the wide range of policy goals being pursued alongside the headline tax and health care measures.</p>
