          <p>Retired NFL star Jason Kelce recounted an amusing incident on a podcast where he and his brother, Travis Kelce, unknowingly consumed non-alcoholic beer during a football game. The mix-up was humorously pointed out by Taylor Swift, who is soon to marry Travis. Kelce expressed initial shame but later found the situation comical, highlighting his positive relationship with Swift and his belief in her and Travis's strong connection. This lighthearted anecdote offers a glimpse into the personal lives of the high-profile couple and their family interactions.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy grew by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing Reuters' forecast of 1.6% and marking its fastest expansion since September 2023. This growth was primarily fueled by domestic spending, including household and government consumption, despite a slight fall in public investment. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates to 3.6% and noted improved clarity on global tariffs, leading to a more optimistic outlook. Consumer and business confidence are also rising, with inflation nearing the RBA's target range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill mandating that schools notify families and staff when immigration enforcement authorities are present on campuses. Authored by State Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, the 'Safe Act' aims to inform and empower school communities amidst the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaigns. The legislation, which now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, seeks to ensure students feel secure in educational environments, mirroring existing emergency warning systems. This measure reflects a broader state-level effort to protect immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>China is undergoing a significant branding 'supercycle,' moving beyond consumer products like the popular Labubu doll to establish brand muscle in industrial sectors. This shift indicates that Chinese origin is no longer synonymous with 'cheap,' as companies like Pop Mart forecast billions in sales. The phenomenon extends to batteries with CATL and electric vehicles with Xiaomi, demonstrating a broader business mindset prioritizing trust and brand advantage over mere cost. This trend suggests a global embrace of Chinese brands in diverse industries.</p>

          <p>A woman trapped in a domestic violence situation at an Alhambra 7-Eleven was successfully rescued after using a discreet hand signal for help, popularized on TikTok. A bystander recognized the gesture—tucking the thumb into the palm and covering it with four fingers—and called 911. Police quickly apprehended the suspect, John Palombi, who attempted to flee and was found to have an active warrant and a stun gun. This incident highlights the effectiveness of the 'signal for help,' created by the Canadian Women's Foundation, in enabling survivors to discretely seek assistance.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B was cleared of assault charges by a Los Angeles jury in a civil lawsuit brought by security guard Emani Ellis. Ellis had alleged that Cardi B scratched her face and spat on her during a confrontation outside an obstetrician's office in 2018, while the rapper's pregnancy was still private. Cardi B testified that the argument became heated but denied physical contact, stating she feared for her unborn child's privacy. The jury deliberated for only an hour before finding the Grammy-winning artist not liable, concluding a trial that garnered significant public attention.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled against the most severe penalties sought by the U.S. Department of Justice in its landmark antitrust case against Google, allowing the tech giant to retain its Chrome browser. The court's decision was significantly influenced by the rapid emergence of generative AI, which has fundamentally altered the competitive landscape in information retrieval. While Google must share search data and is barred from exclusive contracts, the judge acknowledged AI's role in fostering new market dynamics, preventing a more drastic breakup of the company and recognizing the industry's evolving nature.</p>

          <p>A divided U.S. appeals court reinstated Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, rejecting the Trump administration's attempt to remove her. The 2-1 decision affirmed that FTC commissioners cannot be fired by a president without cause, citing nearly a century of clear legal precedent. Slaughter, appointed to a second term by President Biden, expressed eagerness to resume her work, stating that Trump is 'not above the law.' This ruling reinforces the independence of regulatory agencies and sets the stage for a potential Supreme Court review of presidential authority over such appointments.</p>

          <p>Scientists have made a promising discovery that waxworms can digest polyethylene, the most common type of plastic, converting it into body fat within days. Researchers at Brandon University found that around 2,000 waxworms can break down an entire plastic bag in 24 hours, a process compared to humans eating steak. While the worms cannot survive solely on a plastic diet, scientists are optimistic about developing supplements to maintain their health while they process waste. This breakthrough could be a significant step in addressing the global plastic pollution crisis, which generates 57 million tons annually.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge ruled that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome web browser or Android operating system in a landmark antitrust case, but must share search data with competitors. The decision also bars Google from entering exclusive contracts that condition payments on default placement of its products. Google hailed the ruling as a victory, citing the transformative impact of AI on the industry. While the Department of Justice expressed concerns about the scope of the remedies, the ruling is seen as a mixed outcome, aiming to restore competition without drastic structural changes.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, marking its 32nd episode since December 2024, with lava fountains shooting up to 330 feet from its Halemaʻumaʻu summit crater. All lava from this ongoing eruption has remained contained within the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain the phenomenon as magma rising through narrow vents, with expanding gases creating the spectacular fountains. While the current eruption pattern is not unprecedented for Kilauea, its future trajectory remains uncertain, with possibilities ranging from a summit cessation to a prolonged leak from lower elevations, as seen in past decades.</p>

          <p>Police forces and councils nationwide have issued fresh warnings about an increase in sophisticated parking fine scams, ranging from fake text messages to tampered payment machines. Scams expert Nick Stapleton advises checking for three key details on any fine—vehicle registration, time, and location—as genuine notices always include them. He also cautions against clicking suspicious links in texts, recommending device restarts and password changes if compromised. Additionally, he warns against 'skimming devices' on parking machines, urging users to inspect for extra stickers or mismatched branding before paying.</p>

          <p>Apple shares rose over 3% in extended trading following a federal judge's ruling that Alphabet can continue making payments to preload Google Search onto the iPhone. Although Apple was not a party in the antitrust trial, the decision to allow Google to continue these lucrative deals is a significant win for the tech giant, which relies on this revenue for its services business. While the ruling imposes restrictions on exclusive contracts, it stops short of banning the payments entirely, leaving open the possibility for new agreements that benefit both companies.
