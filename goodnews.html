          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has been elected as the new president of Poland, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. The election result is a turnaround from initial exit polls, which had predicted a win for Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda and energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition. Nawrocki supports traditional Catholic and family values, Polish sovereignty within the EU, and continued support for Ukraine, but opposes Ukraine joining NATO and the EU during Russia's aggression. Poland's president has limited influence on foreign policy and defense, but can veto legislation.</p>
