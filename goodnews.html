          <p>A jury has awarded $19.7 million to six bystanders who were injured during a 2022 shooting involving Denver police. The incident occurred when officers opened fire on a suspect in a crowded downtown area. One officer, Brandon Ramos, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and resigned from the force. Attorneys for the victims stated the verdict sends a clear message about police accountability and the need to consider public safety during operations.</p>

          <p>Indian opening batter Pratika Rawal is emerging as a key player at the Women's World Cup, a journey that began with her father's dream. Pradeep Rawal, a former university-level cricketer himself, encouraged his daughter's passion for the sport from a young age, challenging traditional gender roles. Despite being overlooked in the Women's Premier League auction, the 25-year-old earned her national team call-up and has since become a consistent top-scorer. Her success highlights a story of personal dedication and strong family support in a sport where women's cricket is gaining recognition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has described the high cumulative tariff rate on Chinese goods as "not sustainable," even while defending the policy as a necessary response to Chinese trade practices. His comments come as U.S. and Chinese officials prepare for a new round of trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating the economic conflict. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to broker a truce before a key agreement expires in November. The talks follow recent escalations, including China's export controls on rare earths and U.S. threats of further tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new blood test called Galleri has shown the ability to detect more than 50 types of cancer, with promising results from a trial involving 25,000 adults in North America. The test identifies fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, successfully detecting cancer in 62% of positive cases, over half of which were at an early stage. Crucially, three-quarters of the cancers found are types that currently lack routine screening programs. While researchers are optimistic, further data is needed from an ongoing NHS trial to confirm if the test translates to reduced mortality rates.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has developed a new computing solution called Aegaeon that it claims can significantly reduce the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) required for artificial intelligence models. During a beta test, the system cut the number of H20 GPUs needed to serve dozens of large language models from 1,192 to just 213, an 82 percent reduction. The system addresses resource inefficiency by pooling GPU power, allowing a single GPU to serve multiple models concurrently. This innovation could lead to substantial cost savings for cloud service providers running AI workloads. (not investment advice)</p>
