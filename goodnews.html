          <p>A joint China-US study, utilizing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core, approximately 600km in radius. This discovery challenges previous assumptions about the planet's internal structure, as Mars was not expected to have cooled sufficiently to form such a core. The finding could reignite discussions about the past existence of plate tectonics on Mars, similar to Earth. This significant geological insight expands our understanding of planetary evolution and the conditions required for inner core formation.</p>

          <p>Japanese markets experienced a significant surge, with the Nikkei 225 rising 1.5% and the Topix reaching a record high, following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's announcement of his resignation. Investors are now focused on potential successors, with Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae emerging as key contenders, the latter favored by some for her growth-driving, deregulation-focused policies. The yen weakened, and bond yields rose amidst inflation and fiscal uncertainty, while other Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed performance. Global oil prices also edged higher after OPEC+ announced a slower pace of production increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC, is urging the UK government to demonstrate its commitment to working-class communities, particularly following a recent Labour reshuffle. He advocates for lifting the two-child benefit cap, funded by new wealth taxes. Concurrently, Unite union leader Sharon Graham has warned Labour that her union may sever its long-standing financial ties, worth £1.3m annually, if the party fails to improve living standards. These calls underscore growing pressure on the Labour government to deliver on its promises and prevent voter migration to parties like Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Robinson, 29, experienced the "biggest shock of her life" when she unexpectedly gave birth to her son, Henry, in a football club toilet, having been unaware of her pregnancy. This phenomenon, known as a cryptic pregnancy, affects approximately one in 2,500 births. Robinson reported no typical pregnancy symptoms, continuing her normal routine and even traveling. The dramatic arrival, witnessed by family and aided by an off-duty paramedic, occurred at a match dedicated to a deceased "uncle Huggy," leading the couple to name their son Henry James in his memory.</p>

          <p>Rams linebacker Nate Landman made a game-sealing play by forcing a fumble against the Houston Texans in the final minutes, leading to a 14-9 victory in the season opener. This crucial "punch-out" was recovered by Braden Fiske, highlighting the defense's strong performance which limited the Texans to three field goals. Quarterback Matthew Stafford, in his 17th season, passed for over 60,000 yards, becoming the 10th NFL player to do so. The Rams' defense, under ninth-year coach Sean McVay, showcased its potential for the season.</p>

          <p>Margaret, living in London, and her husband Peter, residing in Australia, have maintained a faithful and happy marriage for 15 years despite living in different countries. This arrangement, known as "living apart together" (LAT), allows Margaret to pursue a new career in London after earning a PhD, while Peter remains in their family home. Although they face challenges like loneliness and lack of companionship, regular communication is key to their success. Experts suggest this dynamic can offer space and identity, proving a fulfilling marriage doesn't always require cohabitation.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for a million dollars, aiming to reopen it by its 2026 centennial. This "crown jewel" of the park, famously where Walt Disney conceived Disneyland, closed in 2022 after its operator's death and fell into disrepair. The acquisition is part of a broader park restoration project ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games. The carousel, one of California's oldest wooden merry-go-rounds, requires significant repairs but retains most of its original features, promising a return of a beloved landmark.</p>

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from US equities for the first time in a decade, drawn to Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence market and anticipated looser Federal Reserve policies, according to Bank of America. While US equities attracted significant capital previously, inflows have slowed this year, with investors now allocating evenly between US and international markets. The weakening US dollar and expectations of easier Fed policy in 2025-2026 are spurring capital movement into Asian equities and debt funds. Asia's AI market alone is projected to quadruple to nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, with a substantial portion deployed in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, parts of Europe, and Africa witnessed a captivating "Blood Moon" during a total lunar eclipse. This phenomenon occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue on the lunar surface. The red coloration results from sunlight being reflected and scattered through Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more easily. The event provided a stunning celestial display, continuing to astound observers as it has for millennia.</p>

After an early German lead, Isaac Price equalized, but two quick goals from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz secured Germany's victory. O'Neill lamented defensive errors and questioned a free-kick decision, stating his side lacked the squad depth for back-to-back away games.

          <p>Ian Goldin, an Oxford professor of globalisation and development, asserts that globalization is "alive and well" in Asia, even as it becomes more fragmented and regional. He credits globalization for Asia's significant economic growth and poverty reduction. Goldin highlights the challenge posed by the US's desire to withdraw from globalization, emphasizing the importance of Africa and Latin America integrating into the global economy. He also acknowledges that while globalization brings benefits, it also amplifies risks, as demonstrated by events like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
