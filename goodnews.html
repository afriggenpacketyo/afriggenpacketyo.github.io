          <p>A new partnership allows Hertz to sell its used rental fleet directly to consumers via Amazon's online platform, potentially disrupting the traditional auto dealership model. While Amazon provides the e-commerce infrastructure without holding inventory, analysts worry this could undercut dealers. Rental companies like Hertz buy cars in bulk at a discount, enabling them to sell at lower prices than many dealerships can afford, creating a new competitive pressure in the auto market.</p>

          <p>On CNBC, Jim Cramer shared a positive long-term outlook for Nike, attributing current struggles to excess inventory that the company is actively clearing while expressing confidence in CEO Elliot Hill's turnaround strategy.

          <p>This article outlines critical errors people make when trying to become debt-free, emphasizing that the right strategy is as important as the amount paid. Key mistakes include using predatory debt-relief services, prematurely tapping into retirement funds like a 401(k), and ignoring smaller debts which can grow with interest and fees. It also warns against over-relying on balance transfer cards without a clear payoff plan and failing to build an emergency fund for unexpected expenses.</p>

          <p>The UK's Education Secretary announced that maintenance grants will return for some university students in England by 2029, a decade after they were abolished. The grants, which do not need to be repaid, will be targeted at tens of thousands of students from lower-income families who are enrolled in "priority courses" aligned with the government's industrial strategy. The plan will be funded by a new tax on international student fees, a move that has drawn criticism from university representatives.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the early Premier League season suggests that all major title contenders, including Liverpool, Arsenal, and Manchester City, have demonstrated significant vulnerabilities. Liverpool has appeared defensively shaky despite securing late wins, while Arsenal is still working to overcome a tendency to react poorly to adversity. Manchester City is adjusting to a new tactical approach, and Chelsea seems far from a title challenge, highlighting that no single team has established clear dominance yet.</p>
