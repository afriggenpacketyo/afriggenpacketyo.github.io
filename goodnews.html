        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill in California proposes to make it a misdemeanor for local, state, and federal law enforcement officers to cover their faces while on duty, with exceptions for SWAT teams and officers responding to natural disasters. Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin introduced the bill to promote transparency and public trust in law enforcement. They cited recent instances of federal officers conducting raids with covered faces and unmarked vehicles, raising concerns about accountability. The proposal seeks to ensure that law enforcement officers are identifiable to the public, fostering greater transparency and accountability in their actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea's Club World Cup campaign began with a match played before a stadium with many empty seats, raising questions about fan interest in the revamped tournament. Experts suggest that factors such as the Monday afternoon kickoff time, high ticket prices, and lack of marketing contributed to the low attendance. Some observers worry that this apathy could extend to the upcoming World Cup in 2026 if FIFA does not address these issues. The incident serves as an early warning for FIFA to consider realistic ticket pricing and effective marketing strategies for future events.</p>
