          <p>The UK's Health Secretary is set to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) for crucial talks aimed at preventing a five-day strike by resident doctors scheduled for late July. The BMA insists the industrial action will only be suspended if the government presents a credible new pay offer to address the long-standing dispute over real-term pay cuts. While the government has stated its 5.4% pay increase offer is final, sources suggest a willingness to discuss improvements to doctors' working conditions. This development comes as recent polling indicates a significant drop in public support for the strikes.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of up to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was found in 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the Viking space probe. The auction also features the skeleton of a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur, highlighting a growing market for unique natural history artifacts.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its decades-long armed conflict with the Turkish state, initiating a disarmament process with a ceremonial destruction of weapons. This move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and has been cautiously welcomed by the Turkish government as an opportunity for reconciliation. The success of the peace process hinges on concessions from Turkey, including potential amnesties and legal reforms to allow former fighters to enter politics. A sustainable peace could significantly enhance Turkey's stability and improve its diplomatic standing throughout the Middle East.</p>

          <p>While installing a water pipeline in the historic Old Town harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia, workers unexpectedly discovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was found embedded in the seabed, and marine archaeologists have confirmed its age through radiocarbon analysis, dating it to the late 1700s. This finding adds to a series of recent maritime archaeological discoveries across Europe. The site is now being protected to allow for further examination of the shipwreck, which offers a glimpse into the region's naval history during that period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Forty years after the historic Live Aid concerts, the event's legacy is being re-examined, celebrating its unprecedented global reach and fundraising success for Ethiopian famine relief while also acknowledging its significant flaws. Critics point to the lack of African performers and female artists in the 1985 lineup, which reinforced a "white savior" narrative that has been scrutinized in subsequent decades. While organizer Bob Geldof defends the event's impact on political agendas and debt relief, others argue it promoted a patronizing image of Africa. The anniversary prompts a reflection on how global charity and media representation have evolved since the monumental broadcast.</p>

          <p>A campaign in the UK, supported by Member of Parliament Becky Gittins, is calling for cosmetic and skincare products to list ingredients in English rather than the currently required Latin-based scientific names. Advocates argue that the use of Latin, under the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) system, puts individuals with severe allergies at serious risk, as common allergens are difficult to identify. Parents of children who have suffered allergic reactions and makeup influencers have joined the call for clearer labeling, similar to food packaging standards. The industry's trade association defends the Latin system, citing the need for global harmonization and consistency.</p>

Luis Enrique has praised Dembélé as the season's best player, highlighting how his intense work rate forces defensive errors and sets the tone for the entire team.

          <p>As he turns 18, FC Barcelona's phenom Lamine Yamal has already established himself as a central figure for both his club and the Spanish national team, drawing comparisons to football legends. Having played over 100 first-team games, his statistics far surpass those of Lionel Messi at the same age, though Yamal himself dismisses the comparison. Raised in a working-class, multicultural neighborhood, he remains grounded by his family despite his rapid rise to stardom and a new contract with a 1 billion euro buyout clause. His on-field maturity and consistent improvement suggest a remarkable career ahead as he continues to evolve.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's large dams on the upper Brahmaputra River in Tibet may actually increase water flow to downstream countries like India during the dry season, countering widespread fears of induced drought. By analyzing data from two existing dams since 2014, researchers found that low-flow levels in February rose by more than 50%, with significant increases throughout the dry period. This suggests that reservoir regulation releases water when it is most scarce. The findings provide the first data-driven insight into the potential impact of China's planned mega-dam on the region's water security.</p>
