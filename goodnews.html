          <p>Data from Germany's Federal Motor Transport Authority shows that the total distance driven by cars increased in 2024, reversing a five-year trend of decline. German drivers traveled 594 billion kilometers, 3 billion more than the previous year, primarily due to a higher number of registered vehicles. However, the average distance driven per car continued to fall. In separate news, Germany's Constitutional Court dismissed a complaint regarding the use of Ramstein Air Base for U.S. drone missions, ruling that Germany does not have a duty of care in this context.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 06:01:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will require teaching children how to recognize and counter misogyny as part of their relationships, sex, and health education. The updated curriculum aims to help pupils identify positive male role models and resist harmful online influences, such as those from incels. While previous plans for strict age limits on topics like sex education have been dropped, the guidance will outline age-appropriate content for primary and secondary levels. The changes, which also emphasize parental engagement, have been welcomed as an overdue update to reflect the modern challenges young people face.</p>

          <p>Google is rolling out a new "Manage Subscriptions" tool for Gmail on desktop and mobile, designed to help users easily clean up their inboxes. The feature consolidates all mailing list subscriptions onto a single page, allowing for bulk unsubscribing with just a few clicks. This provides a more secure and efficient alternative to clicking individual unsubscribe links in emails, which can sometimes be malicious. The article also offers additional tips for maintaining a clean inbox, such as using filters, creating a secondary email for sign-ups, and marking unwanted messages as spam.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old boy in Minnesota has made a full recovery after a freak accident where he fell and an arrow penetrated his head, passing through his brain. The boy, Gus Deterding, slipped on ice while carrying a youth bow and arrow, with the arrow entering near his nose and coming close to exiting the back of his skull. Despite the severity of the injury revealed by scans, he showed minimal symptoms, astounding medical staff. His doctors and family have described his survival and lack of lasting effects as a miracle, as the injury would typically be considered fatal.</p>

          <p>With the war in Ukraine and a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy, France is emerging as a key player in Europe's push for greater defense autonomy. French President Emmanuel Macron has announced significant increases in defense spending, aiming to double the budget between 2017 and 2027. The country's robust defense industry, which includes 4,500 companies, is seen as a cornerstone for the continent's rearmament. However, experts caution that France faces hurdles, including sourcing raw materials and training engineers, and must pursue cooperation with European partners rather than acting alone.</p>

          <p>The UK government, under Chancellor Rachel Reeves, has unveiled plans to encourage people with cash savings to invest in the stock market. Banks will be prompted to send their customers information about investment opportunities, supported by a government advertising campaign. The proposals, part of the "Leeds Reforms" to boost the UK's financial services sector, also include a review of risk warnings to ensure they are not overly cautious. Additionally, a scheme that provides government backing for low-deposit mortgages for first-time buyers will be made permanent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of approximately $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. The high price is largely due to India's steep import tariffs and luxury taxes on vehicles. This positions the Model Y in the premium segment, competing with brands like BMW rather than mass-market local EVs. Analysts suggest Tesla is "testing the waters" and that a full commitment to the Indian market, including local manufacturing to lower costs, may not happen until the market matures further.</p>

          <p>Spinner Liam Dawson has been called up to the England Test squad for the first time in eight years as a replacement for Shoaib Bashir, who is out with a broken finger. The 35-year-old's selection for the fourth Test against India is a reward for his outstanding domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. Dawson, a left-arm spinner and capable batsman, offers a like-for-like replacement for Bashir and provides an unexpected opportunity to press his claim for a regular spot in the Test side.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage drivers to switch to electric vehicles (EVs) by offering discounts of up to £3,750. The grants will apply to eligible cars costing up to £37,000 and are part of a £650 million program aimed at phasing out new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the government hopes this will make EVs more affordable, some industry leaders and consumers point to the lack of public charging infrastructure as a more significant barrier. The government has also pledged a separate £63 million investment to expand the charging network.</p>

The decision allows Nvidia to serve the significant Chinese market, where half of the world's AI researchers are located. The move comes after intense lobbying from tech leaders who argued that export controls hindered U.S. competitiveness. While the policy shift is expected to boost Nvidia's revenue, some analysts caution that Chinese firms will likely continue developing domestic chips due to the unpredictability of U.S. policy.

Coming off an obsessive and devastating relationship, she found that withdrawing her energy from sex and love allowed her to focus on herself, her friendships, and her creative work. Febos explains that the period of celibacy helped her understand her own needs, such as a desire for more alone time, and ultimately led to a more honest and sustainable partnership with the woman who is now her wife.</p>
