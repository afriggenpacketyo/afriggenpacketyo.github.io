          <h2>Genetic Study Reveals Ancient Human Migration from Asia to the Americas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 02:04:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of researchers has traced the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas through an extensive genetic analysis. The study indicates that Native Americans descended from Asian populations, specifically from the West Beringian region, and that early migrants to South America formed isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This work, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, could provide insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have experienced significant population declines. Archaeological evidence suggests this migration was underway at least 23,000 years ago, with a human presence in South America confirmed by 14,500 years ago.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is speaking out against AI companies using her likeness and voice without permission, advocating for legislation to regulate the evolving technology. Johansson claimed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asked her to voice their Chatbot, but after she declined, the feature sounded remarkably like her. Her legal team sent letters to OpenAI, leading the company to remove the voice. Johansson emphasizes the need for boundaries in AI to prevent exploitation and supports others in the public eye speaking out on the issue, as she has become a reluctant voice in the AI conversation.</p>

          <p>The latest Sunday Times Rich List indicates a decline in the number of UK billionaires, while King Charles' personal wealth has risen to match that of former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty. The number of billionaires has fallen from 165 to 156, the biggest drop in the list's history, partly due to criticism of tax changes by the new Labour government. Meanwhile, the King's wealth grew by ¬£30 million to ¬£640 million, increasing his rank to 258. Topping the list for the fourth consecutive year is the Hinduja family, with a fortune exceeding ¬£35 billion.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, totaling 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion), as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets amid trade tensions. This shift was largely driven by institutional investors, with pension funds and asset managers aggressively purchasing equities, and reserve managers, life insurers, and pension funds buying Japanese bonds. The inflows occurred predominantly in the first week of April, following President Trump's tariff announcements, which altered global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy and asset performance. While the U.S. is softening its trade stance, the confidence in U.S. assets is getting restored.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, giving the government the ability to legally monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers during peacetime. The "active cyberdefense" law will require operators of key infrastructure to report cyber breaches to the government. This change comes as the government aims to counter cyberattacks following threats on an airline and banks, with the goal of being fully operational by 2027. An independent panel will be set up to approve data acquisition and analysis, ensuring government surveillance is properly conducted.</p>
