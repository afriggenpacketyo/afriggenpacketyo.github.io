          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that President Donald Trump's executive order sharply limiting birthright citizenship "violates four Supreme Court precedents" during a hearing. Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan questioned the Justice Department lawyer's argument that individual federal district court judges should not have the power to impose national injunctions blocking such executive actions. The justices suggested that the argument could prevent courts, including the Supreme Court, from ruling on the constitutionality of the executive order. The case involves executive orders issued by Trump that have been halted by federal district court judges.</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, the company may be forced to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that tariffs create cost pressure, particularly on electronics and toys, and CFO John David Rainey warned that a restoration of higher tariff levels could jeopardize earnings growth. The retailer aims to absorb some costs to keep food prices low but acknowledges the impact of tariffs on consumer spending. The article notes that rising cost pressures for retailers are emerging, and economists predict that the impact on prices will put additional pressure on demand.</p>

The company avoided providing second-quarter profit guidance due to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs, but maintained its annual sales and profit forecast for fiscal 2026.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. He noted that conditions have significantly changed over the past five years, including a period of surging inflation. Powell suggested that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon and that "supply shocks" could create a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation. While he didn't mention President Trump's tariffs directly, Powell has previously noted their potential to slow growth and boost inflation.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after it grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, exceeding expectations. The growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts warned that the strong rate of growth is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Reeves emphasized that the Labour government's top priority is boosting the economy, while critics pointed out the potential negative impacts of recent policy decisions.</p>

They also caution against taking too much risk, noting that Tesla's valuation relies heavily on the narrative of Elon Musk's genius and the future of electric vehicles. The experts are cautious about investing in Tesla, as this launch has yet to play out in real time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. applications for jobless benefits remained steady last week at 229,000, indicating that layoffs remain low despite economic uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate steady, acknowledging the risks of both higher unemployment and inflation. While trade wars disrupt business, the labor market remains robust with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs. Economists anticipate that the negative impact from trade wars will materialize later in the year.</p>

          <h2>Overdose Deaths in the US Fall, but Concerns Remain</h2>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, marking the strongest sign yet of progress against the opioid crisis. Deaths declined in all major drug categories and in most states, leading to a nearly 27% drop nationwide. Public health experts attributed the improvement to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and wider use of naloxone. However, concerns remain as the Trump administration proposes to cut funding for many programs believed to have contributed to the decline.</p>
