          <p>China has released an action plan to reduce the amount of grain used in livestock feed, particularly soybean meal, to maintain food security amidst global trade uncertainties.

This initiative is part of a broader effort to minimize grain losses and ensure a stable supply of staple crops, driven by concerns over increasing meat demand and the soybean trade becoming a point of contention in trade relations.</p>
