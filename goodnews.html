          <p>Researchers have identified the cause of a devastating sea star wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The culprit is a bacterium, Vibrio pectenicida, which was found in the coelomic fluid of infected animals. The epidemic has critically endangered species like the sunflower sea star, leading to a cascade effect where unchecked sea urchin populations have destroyed vast kelp forests. This discovery offers hope for developing interventions, such as breeding resistant sea stars in captivity to help restore the crucial marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle experienced a significant 20% surge after President Donald Trump praised its new ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The campaign, initially met with criticism from some who found its 'great jeans/genes' slogan problematic, received a boost when Trump called it the ''HOTTEST' ad out there.' This market reaction highlights the complex interplay between marketing, celebrity culture, and political polarization, turning a controversial ad into a financial boon for the company. The event has also driven search interest for American Eagle to its highest level in over two decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell by 23% on Monday, giving back a significant portion of the gains from its highly successful market debut last week. The company's stock had more than tripled on its first day of trading, signaling strong investor appetite for high-growth tech IPOs. Despite the slide, Figma's valuation remains nearly triple the amount Adobe had offered in its failed 2022 acquisition attempt. The company, which has a history of profitability, is still valued at approximately $56 billion, with its CEO's stake worth over $5 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key but often misunderstood guideline for reverse mortgages, the '60% rule,' limits how much money a borrower can access in the first year of the loan. This FHA rule stipulates that homeowners taking out a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) can only withdraw up to 60% of their total loan proceeds initially, unless a larger amount is needed to pay off existing mandatory debts. While designed to prevent seniors from depleting their home equity too quickly, the rule can pose challenges for those needing a large lump sum for immediate expenses. It encourages long-term financial stability but may make reverse mortgages less appealing for some borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Josh Brolin is starring in his first horror film, 'Weapons,' playing a father searching for answers after his child and others mysteriously disappear. Brolin described the role as a creative challenge and an opportunity to explore themes of masculinity, particularly how a man who represses emotion reacts when the thing he cares about most is taken away. Although new to acting in the genre, he revealed that horror films were a significant part of his childhood. The movie, which marks a new direction for the 'Dune' and 'Avengers' star after 41 years in the industry, opens in theaters this Friday.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will delay its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States for six months, following a trade deal reached in late July. The countermeasures were set to take effect this week but will be suspended to allow for the finalization of the agreement between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump. The deal, described by the EU as restoring 'stability and predictability,' involves a 15% tariff on most European goods entering the U.S. This pause represents a significant concession and de-escalation in the ongoing trade discussions.

          <p>A new UK study has found that individuals lost twice as much weight on a diet of minimally processed, home-style meals compared to a diet of ultraprocessed foods, even when the latter were designed to be nutritionally healthy. Over an eight-week period, participants on the minimally processed diet naturally consumed fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat. This research, the largest of its kind, suggests that the level of food processing itself, not just the nutritional content, plays a key role in calorie consumption and weight management. The findings reinforce the benefits of diets based on whole, unprocessed foods.</p>

          <p>An electrical engineer in Orange County, Vermont, is single-handedly tackling the problem of poor cellular coverage by installing restored pay phones that offer free calls. Patrick Schlott modifies old pay phones to work over an internet connection and has placed them in three towns, personally covering the minimal operating costs. The phones, which can call anywhere in the U.S. and Canada without coins, have become a vital resource for residents, from stranded drivers to kids needing to call home. With Vermont set to ban cell phones in schools, Schlott anticipates growing demand for this retro-tech public service.</p>

          <p>In the current uncertain economic climate, financial experts advise that annuities can be a valuable tool for some, but not all, individuals planning for retirement. Near-retirees who want to lock in currently high interest rates and risk-averse seniors seeking guaranteed income may find annuities beneficial. They can act as a personal pension, providing a predictable lifetime income stream. However, younger investors with long time horizons, individuals who may need access to their funds soon, and anyone carrying high-interest debt should likely avoid them due to their lack of liquidity and lower growth potential compared to other investments.

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This rise is directly linked to the success of updated screening guidelines, which lowered the recommended starting age from 50 to 45. Following the change, screening rates in this age group increased by 62% between 2019 and 2023. While the findings are celebrated as promising news that will save lives, researchers caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and that disparities in access still need to be addressed.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has approved a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk valued at approximately $29 billion, consisting of 96 million restricted shares. This grant comes just six months after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion package from 2018, a ruling Musk is appealing. Analysts believe the new package is designed to ensure Musk remains as CEO until at least 2030 and to motivate him through the company's transition into an AI-focused entity. The award is conditional; it will be forfeited if the Delaware courts ultimately reinstate the original 2018 pay plan.</p>
