          <p>Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have partnered to launch tokenized money market funds, allowing institutional clients to purchase fund ownership recorded on a blockchain. This innovation aims to increase transaction efficiency and reduce friction compared to traditional markets. The project, which already includes major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, is seen as a foundational step for a real-time digital financial ecosystem. These digitized funds could eventually be transferred between intermediaries without liquidation, enhancing their use as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old shortstop Ethan Holliday has agreed to a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies that includes a record-breaking $9 million signing bonus. This is the largest bonus ever awarded to a player drafted directly from high school under the current system. Holliday, the son of former MLB All-Star Matt Holliday and brother of another top prospect, was the fourth overall pick in the draft but was widely rated as the No. 1 available talent. His deal matches the fourth-highest bonus for any drafted player, including college athletes.</p>

          <p>U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is set to travel to Europe to continue diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire and peace agreement in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Indirect negotiations are reportedly ongoing, with a recent Israeli proposal for troop withdrawal zones being reviewed by Hamas. The Trump administration is said to be cautiously optimistic about a potential 60-day truce that would include the release of Israeli hostages and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The visit aims to build momentum as diplomatic efforts reach a critical stage.</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate quashed by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal fight. The court ruled that their trials were unfair due to flawed directions given to the juries, making the convictions "unsafe." The men, who were jailed following the financial crisis, have long maintained their innocence, arguing they were scapegoated for what were considered normal commercial practices at the time. The Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the 61-year-old case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of assault in 1964 for biting off part of her sexual attacker's tongue while defending herself. At 19, she was given a suspended prison sentence, while her attacker received a lighter penalty. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi sought a retrial to clear her name, a fight that reached the nation's top court. In a significant turn, prosecutors at the new hearing have asked the court to acquit her, reflecting a major shift in legal and societal perspectives.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed designating Apple and Google as having "strategic market status," a move that would empower the regulator to enforce changes to their mobile businesses. The CMA is targeting the companies' control over app stores, browsers, and operating systems, citing concerns about unfair commission fees and processes that stifle competition. Proposed remedies include forcing greater transparency in app reviews and making it easier for developers to direct users to alternative payment methods, though both tech giants have opposed the changes.</p>

          <p>A challenging sales market, marked by high mortgage rates and hesitant buyers, is leading some homeowners to become "accidental landlords" by renting out their properties instead of selling them. This trend is increasing the supply of single-family rentals, especially in popular Sun Belt markets like Atlanta and Phoenix. This new inventory is creating direct competition for large institutional landlords, which could limit their ability to raise rents and potentially lead to a slight decline in occupancy as the rental market becomes more crowded.

          <p>A wooden shipwreck uncovered by a storm on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a rich history dating back to the 18th century. Originally built as HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate, it served in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship in the Arctic. The identification was the result of a collaborative effort between archaeologists, scientists using tree-ring dating, and dedicated local community researchers who recovered the ship's timbers.</p>
