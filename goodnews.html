          <p>A contentious period of trade negotiations between the United States and the European Union has culminated in a new agreement, averting a potential trade war. The talks, initiated after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, were marked by escalating threats and last-minute reprieves. The final deal establishes a single 15% tariff rate for most EU exports and creates zero-for-zero tariffs on certain strategic products. This timeline traces the key moments, from the initial tariff announcements in March to the final agreement in July, highlighting the diplomatic turbulence and political maneuvering involved.

          <p>Following the new US-EU trade agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on most EU goods sold to America, analysts are comparing its terms to the UK's existing deal. The UK faces a lower baseline tariff of 10%, potentially giving its firms a competitive pricing advantage over EU counterparts in the US market. However, the comparison is complex due to specific quotas and exceptions, such as the UK's 100,000-vehicle annual limit for its lower auto tariff. Uncertainty also remains regarding how pharmaceuticals and steel will be treated under the EU deal, which could affect any potential advantage for UK exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane of the season in the central Pacific Ocean. As a Category 1 storm located approximately 895 miles southeast of Honolulu, it is not currently an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect Iona to strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane by Tuesday before gradually weakening later in the week. The storm is projected to continue on a westward path, remaining well south of Hawaii, providing reassurance to residents while marking a significant point in the hurricane season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles luxury real estate market demonstrated significant strength in June, with five of the nation's top ten most expensive home sales occurring in the area. The month's top sale was Mark Wahlberg's former Beverly Hills mansion, which sold for $63 million to Paris Hilton and her husband, Carter Reum. This sale represents a profitable flip for the sellers, even after accounting for the city's mansion tax. Brokers attribute the market's vitality to demand from buyers displaced by recent wildfires and increasing interest from foreign investors, particularly from China, signaling continued momentum in the high-end property sector.</p>

In response, President Trump emphasized that his immediate focus is on getting humanitarian aid into Gaza, particularly for children, before addressing future political arrangements.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue Medicaid reimbursements for all Planned Parenthood clinics. The ruling expands a previous, more limited injunction and blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by cutting its Medicaid payments for one year. In her order, the judge noted that restricting services would likely lead to adverse health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. Planned Parenthood had argued that losing the funding would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics, affecting over a million patients.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently declined, offering a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners compared to high-rate credit cards and personal loans. With average rates for both products now sitting around 8.25%, prospective borrowers should act strategically. This article advises homeowners to carefully compare the two products, as HELOCs are variable-rate credit lines while home equity loans are fixed-rate lump sums. It also recommends getting quotes from multiple lenders and precisely determining borrowing needs to avoid taking on unnecessary risk with their home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

The Seed Sounds Weekender, taking place in September, will feature events at over 1,000 pubs and bars, which Healy describes as the "foundation of any real culture." He argues that without these "seed" venues, where iconic acts like Amy Winehouse and The Smiths got their start, new talent cannot emerge. The festival aims to highlight the vital role these small stages play amid unprecedented economic challenges facing the hospitality sector.</p>

          <p>With growing evidence linking high red meat consumption to health risks like Type 2 diabetes and cancer, experts are highlighting alternative sources of iron. This is crucial as many Americans may have an undiagnosed iron deficiency. Registered dietitians recommend plant-based options such as lentils, beans, tofu, spinach, and pumpkin seeds, as well as certain seafood like oysters and clams. They also note that fortified breads and cereals are a major source of iron in the U.S. diet. For plant-based sources, it is recommended to pair them with vitamin C-rich foods to enhance the body's absorption of the essential mineral.</p>
