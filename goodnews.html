          <h2>First Blood Test for Alzheimer's Diagnosis to Be Available in US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 00:51:29 EDT</div>

          <p>Fujirebio Holdings, a Japanese company, will launch the first blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease in the U.S. by late June, potentially revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The test, cleared by the FDA, detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, in a process that takes approximately 30 minutes and costs significantly less than a PET scan. This development is expected to improve access to new Alzheimer's treatments and facilitate earlier diagnosis, enabling timely intervention for the nearly 7 million Americans affected by the memory-robbing disease. This non-invasive method is a critical step in making new types of Alzheimer‚Äôs treatments widely accessible. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed a bill that would offer a tax deduction on tips worth up to $25,000 for tipped workers, including waiters, waitresses, and beauty service providers. Sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz, the bill also extends business tax credits for payroll taxes on tips in beauty and spa services, aiming to provide financial relief to millions of workers in tipped occupations. To be eligible, an employee's compensation must not exceed $160,000 in the prior tax year, and the tips must be reported to the employer for payroll tax withholding. The bill's passage through the Senate marks a rare bipartisan achievement and now moves to the House of Representatives for consideration. </p>

          <p>Koizumi, the newly appointed farm chief in Japan, has vowed to ease public concerns regarding the escalating prices of rice. This announcement comes in the wake of the previous farm minister's resignation due to controversial remarks about receiving rice as gifts rather than purchasing it. The focus now shifts to Koizumi as he takes on the responsibility of stabilizing rice prices and addressing the anxieties of Japanese consumers amidst rising inflation and economic pressures. This is a developing story and further details are awaited. </p>

          <h2>Focus Shifts to Young Women's Leftward Political Turn, Challenging Narratives of Far-Right Support</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While media attention often focuses on young men supposedly voting for the far right, the article argues that a more significant shift is occurring among young women, who are increasingly turning towards left-wing politics. Studies show that young people, in general, hold more progressive values, and the gender gap is primarily driven by a sharp leftward turn among young women rather than a rightward shift among young men. This trend presents a political opportunity for center-left parties to prioritize the values of female voters, such as climate action and strengthening the welfare state, rather than catering to reactionary politics. By focusing on female voters, progressive politics could transform the political debate and encourage greater participation from young women. </p>

          <p>Chengdu, an inland city in southwestern China, is experiencing a surge in population and a booming real estate market as young people seek a more relaxed lifestyle compared to the hypercompetitive coastal cities. With a 30 percent population increase in the last five years, Chengdu has earned the reputation of being "China's happiest city," attracting those disillusioned with the intense work culture of megacities. While jobs in Chengdu may pay less, the city offers a less stressful environment, a vibrant cultural scene, and affordable living, making it an appealing alternative for young Chinese seeking a better work-life balance. The city's economy, driven by the service sector and entertainment, has also proven resilient amid trade tensions and economic uncertainty. </p>

          <p>Veterinary students are in high demand due to a shortage of professionals caused by high turnover, rising debt, and increased pet ownership.

The profession's challenges include high tuition costs, resulting in large student debt, and alarming suicide rates among veterinarians due to the emotional toll of the job. Despite the pressures, pet ownership is increasing, leading to higher spending on pet care and investments in veterinary medicine. </p>

          <p>Corey O'Connor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city's current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. O'Connor's victory reflects a trend of losses for progressive candidates in deep-blue cities, raising questions about the power of progressive officeholders. Positioning himself as a pragmatic candidate, O'Connor pledged to improve city services and rebuild the tax base, contrasting with Gainey's focus on affordable housing. The outcome suggests a desire for more moderate leadership in Pittsburgh, a Democratic stronghold. </p>
