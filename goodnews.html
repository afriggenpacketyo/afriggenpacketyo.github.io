The district is heavily Democratic, and her victory is expected to help narrow the slim Republican majority in the U.S. House.

          <p>Representatives Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) and Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) have introduced the Dignity Act of 2025, a bipartisan immigration reform bill. The legislation would offer a renewable seven-year legal status with work authorization to undocumented immigrants who arrived before 2021, requiring them to pay restitution. The bill, which does not offer a path to citizenship or federal benefits, also aims to bolster border security and mandate E-Verify for employers. It represents a compromise effort to address labor shortages and the status of long-term residents.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy firms will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania to develop a new artificial intelligence economy. The initiative, revealed at a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, includes building new data centers and an energy innovation training center in the Pittsburgh region. The plan aims to leverage the state's energy resources, including natural gas and nuclear power, to support the high energy demands of AI. The announcement was met with some protests from activists concerned about the focus on fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at an expo in Beijing, predicted that artificial intelligence and robotics will replace most human labor in factories within the next ten years. He described AI as a fundamental infrastructure, comparable to electricity or the internet, that is set to revolutionize supply chains and manufacturing processes. Huang also noted that Nvidia is poised to resume shipments of its H20 chips to China, after the US government provided assurances that export licenses would be granted.

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to create national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move follows the rapid growth of a multi-million dollar market for college athletes since NIL rules were relaxed in 2021. The order aims to supersede the current patchwork of state laws and comes as a House subcommittee advanced a related bill, the "SCORE Act." The White House's intervention seeks to bring federal oversight to the quickly evolving and often contentious landscape of college athlete compensation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia that includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods exported to the U.S., a reduction from a previously threatened 32% duty. As part of the agreement, Indonesia has reportedly committed to purchasing $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing aircraft. The deal also allegedly grants U.S. companies full access to the Indonesian market with no tariffs on their exports. The announcement follows a similar pattern of direct negotiations and tariff agreements with other nations, including Vietnam. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal deployment in Los Angeles, about half the total force federalized by President Trump. The troops were deployed over a month ago to respond to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions, a move opposed by Governor Gavin Newsom. The Trump administration stated the drawdown was possible because "lawlessness is subsiding," while Newsom called for the remaining troops to also be returned to state control, calling their deployment a political maneuver.</p>

The gold uniform, a first for the team in a game, has drawn mixed reactions online, with some comparing it to Big Bird or a mustard bottle. The navy uniform is a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and early 2000s, an era that included their only Super Bowl appearance. The team will also have the option to wear their popular powder blue pants with their primary home and away jerseys.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines rather than on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to acquire gold at a discount, use local currency to bolster reserves without depleting foreign exchange, and support their domestic mining industries. Countries like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines are actively pursuing this approach. The trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire to strengthen reserve buffers against global financial and geopolitical risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, also calls for standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow concerns over patient safety and a lack of clarity about the roles' responsibilities since they were introduced to ease doctor workloads.

A key goal of the refurbishment is to make the building net-zero in emissions by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps.
