          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the southwestern coast of Mexico, according to the National Hurricane Center. While there are no coastal watches or warnings currently in effect, the storm is expected to bring two to four inches of rainfall to western Mexico, potentially leading to flooding and mudslides. The storm is also likely to generate dangerous sea swells and rip currents along the coast, and Barbara is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane on Monday. NOAA officials have predicted an above-normal hurricane season for 2025, with 13 to 19 named storms expected.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the growing trend of American parents financially supporting their adult children and argues that it's detrimental to both the children and the parents' retirement. The author suggests that children should be financially independent between the ages of 22 and 25, contributing to household expenses if they live at home. While parents may still cover health insurance and occasional emergencies, the author stresses the importance of teaching financial responsibility and protecting their own retirement savings. The piece also offers advice on how to have these difficult conversations and set clear expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering introducing stricter online safety measures to limit the amount of time children spend on social media. Proposals include a two-hour cap on individual social media apps and a 10 PM curfew, according to reports. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said he is examining the "addictive nature of some of the apps and smartphones." However, an online safety campaigner criticized the government for delaying the implementation of new laws to protect children, arguing that stronger legislation is needed to address unsafe online content.</p>

Correspondent Mo Rocca visits the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., and speaks with Maureen Dowd about Shakespeare's enduring relevance. Dowd compares today's political figures to Shakespearean characters, while actor Patrick Page discusses the enduring appeal of Shakespeare's villains. Ira Glass, who once tweeted that "Shakespeare sucks," admits that he may have been too harsh, while Farah Karim-Cooper explains how Shakespeare's works can resonate with modern audiences.</p>

          <p>Pomona College is seeing a growing movement among students and faculty to reduce the pervasive influence of technology on campus life. Students are advocating for more tech-free classes and creating spaces for unplugged socializing, while professors are limiting or banning electronic devices in their classrooms. This pushback comes as more people recognize the detrimental effects of technology on students' academic and social experiences, particularly at small residential liberal-arts colleges. While the college administration has yet to fully align with this vision, the movement aims to create a more focused and engaged learning environment.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing the effects of water-only fasting diets on 20 people over 10 days reveals potential negative impacts. Participants experienced an average body weight loss of 7.7 percent, but also reported side effects such as headaches, insomnia, and low blood pressure. Researchers found that prolonged fasting seemed to increase inflammation and put more stress on the body, potentially leading to health complications. While some proteins linked to muscle and bone breakdown were reduced, the study emphasizes the need for medical advice before starting such diets and further investigation into the long-term effects. The findings suggest that there's no one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to fasting.</p>

However, the author argues that the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts, while China has emerged as a major economic and political power.

          <p>The poem "Under a Supermoon" by Arthur Sze reflects on the beauty and significance of small details in life. The speaker expresses a lack of desire for grand adventures, such as space travel or deep-sea exploration, instead finding joy in simple observations like a gold flare in cottonwood leaves and the smell of split pi√±on. The poem draws upon Blake's idea that persistence in folly can lead to wisdom, suggesting that perseverance has allowed the speaker to catch how this life has exploding, exploded, and birthing stars inside it. The poem finds a sense of wonder and appreciation in the everyday.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's aim to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers, with a projected shortage of 25,000 aircraft technicians by 2028. The industry faces a retirement wave compounded by pandemic-related layoffs, prompting airlines and manufacturers to attract younger talent. Base pay averages between $80,000 and $90,000 a year, based on qualifications and experience. While wages for technicians have increased, some argue it's not enough, and experts note that the sector is seen as politically important and symbolic to the country's economic power.

          <h2>Chinese Sports Movie Reflects Evolving U.S.-China Relations</h2>

          <p>An article explores how a Chinese sports comedy, Clash, mirrors the changing relationship between the U.S. and China. The film, about a Chinese American football team, has a premise similar to a story the author wrote years prior, that was optioned by Hollywood but never produced. The Chinese studio made its own version, shifting the focus to local issues and sidelining the American influence. The author reflects on how narratives about China have evolved, and how the film reflects the current state of U.S.-China relations and the desire to cater to a domestic audience.</p>
