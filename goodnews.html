          <p>Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel to co-develop data center and PC chips, a move that sent Intel shares soaring. Nvidia's investment is priced at $23.28 a share, and Intel will build x86 central processing units for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms. This partnership also includes Intel building x86 system-on-chips using Nvidia's RTX graphics processing units for PCs, signaling a major collaboration between the two tech giants. The White House hailed the partnership as a significant milestone for American high-tech manufacturing, with Intel shares experiencing their best day since October 1987. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK and France have initiated a 'one in, one out' migrant exchange program, with the first migrant deported to France. The agreement aims to deter small boat crossings by exchanging migrants, where for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong asylum case in the UK will be accepted. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood emphasized the program sends a message against illegal entry into the UK, while the government is appealing a High Court decision blocking another deportation due to modern slavery concerns. This initiative comes as the UK seeks to manage migration through safe, legal, and managed routes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett indicated the White House is content with the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its key borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point. While new Fed Governor Stephen Miran advocated for a larger cut, Hassett acknowledged the move as a prudent first step towards lower rates. President Trump has previously criticized the Fed for not cutting rates aggressively enough, despite strong economic growth. Hassett assessed the decision as a balanced approach, considering economic models and inflation levels, reflecting a compromise within the committee. (not investment advice)</p>

The company aims to increase annual sales to 5.55 million units by 2030, a roughly 34% increase from last year. CEO José Muñoz highlighted the U.S. as the "engine of growth" and announced a $26 billion investment from 2025 to 2028 to expand U.S. operations. The company aims to produce more than 80% of its U.S. vehicle sales locally by 2030, compared to roughly 40% currently.</p>
