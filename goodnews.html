          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, despite a significant 44% decline in net income compared to the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company's adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.77, beating the $1.70 forecast, with revenue also topping estimates. A key factor in mitigating the impact of lower prices was record second-quarter production, including a notable jump in U.S. output. Chevron also expressed optimism that its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation will begin to positively contribute to earnings by the fourth quarter and help achieve significant cost reductions.

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully adapted a 2,000-year-old anti-corrosion technique to significantly extend the service life of modern artillery barrels. The original method, observed on well-preserved bronze swords from the Terracotta Army, involved a thin layer of chromium salts. By refining this ancient process, scientists have developed a cutting-edge coating that combats the extreme heat, pressure, and chemical erosion that cause rapid wear and microcracking in high-velocity cannons. According to a defense tech journal, this innovation has effectively doubled the operational lifespan of the artillery, addressing a persistent challenge in modern weaponry.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, even as net income fell 23% from the previous year due to lower oil prices. The company posted earnings of $1.64 per share against an expected $1.54, supported by its highest second-quarter production output in over 25 years. Record production in the Permian Basin and Guyana was crucial in softening the impact of a 10% year-over-year decline in oil prices. The company also demonstrated strong financial discipline, returning $9.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and continuing its significant cost-cutting program.

The Foo Fighters have hired Ilan Rubin, who recently played with Nine Inch Nails, to replace Josh Freese, who had joined the band following Taylor Hawkins' death. Freese is now rejoining Nine Inch Nails, a band he previously played with from 2005 to 2008, just in time for their North American tour. Freese explained his original departure was for family reasons and expressed his excitement to return, while the Foo Fighters prepare for upcoming international tour dates with Rubin behind the kit.</p>

          <p>Founded in 1903, the same year as Ford Motor Company, Pewabic Pottery in Detroit has survived over a century of economic turmoil by focusing on handcrafted products rather than mass production. The studio is renowned for its unique, iridescent glazes and its commitment to the Arts and Crafts design movement, which values craftsmanship over industrialization. Despite Detroit's decline and subsequent revival, Pewabic has remained in its original location, using traditional methods and equipment from the early 20th century. Now operating as a nonprofit, the pottery had its best year ever in 2024, demonstrating the enduring appeal of its artisanal tiles and vessels.</p>

          <p>In an interview with NPR, popular Twitch streamer and political commentator Hasan Piker explored his role as a prominent progressive voice online. Piker, who has been called a "himbo gateway drug to leftist thought," rejects the idea that masculinity or hobbies like gaming are inherently tied to conservative politics, arguing these spaces are often wrongly ceded to right-wing actors. He believes Democrats need to focus on substantive policy changes rather than searching for a "Joe Rogan of the left" to solve their problems. Piker also commented on the rise of reactionary politics, which he sees as hyper-focused on provoking a negative reaction from liberals.</p>

          <p>Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has completed his leadership transition by selling his remaining equity shares and stepping down from the board. Dalio, who founded the firm in 1975 and stepped down as CEO in 2017, will continue to serve as a mentor and remain a significant investor in the firm's strategies. In a LinkedIn post, Dalio expressed his thrill at seeing the firm he built over 50 years positioned to be "alive and well without me." The transition was facilitated by raising capital from existing investors and employees to purchase Dalio's final stake. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Pakistan have agreed to a new partnership for the joint development of Pakistan's oil reserves, an announcement made by President Donald Trump. While Pakistan is not known for massive reserves, the deal is seen as a significant step toward a more economically focused relationship, moving beyond traditional strategic ties. The energy partnership was unveiled alongside a broader trade agreement that lowers the U.S. tariff rate on Pakistani imports from 29% to 19%. This move is viewed by some analysts as a U.S. effort to counter China's growing economic influence in Pakistan and secure strategic interests in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jason Nellis, a 41-year-old chief product officer for a U.S.-based tech company, has moved his family from Washington, D.C., to the south of France. The relocation, which cost around $20,000, was driven by a long-held desire to live abroad and provide a different cultural foundation for their two young sons. Nellis continues to work remotely for his fully remote company, adjusting his schedule to overlap with U.S. time zones. He and his wife believe the move offers an opportunity to slow down from the intense American work culture and build a family life with healthier boundaries, while also expanding his career on a global scale.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is planning a five-year pilot program to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. This move aims to address the U.S. obesity crisis by providing access to GLP-1 medications, which have proven effective for weight management but come with high costs. The proposed plan would permit state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans to voluntarily cover these drugs starting in 2026 and 2027, respectively. The initiative marks a potential shift in federal policy, as coverage for these drugs for weight loss has previously been restricted, raising questions about long-term affordability for government health programs.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a Marine Corps veteran, has been released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after being detained for two months. She was arrested in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, just weeks after giving birth to her second child. Her husband, Adrian, said he felt betrayed by the arrest, which occurred despite his veteran status and his wife's family situation. Paola was released on a recognizance bond and must now wear an ankle monitor, but the family is relieved to be reunited while they continue to navigate the immigration process.</p>

          <p>Electric aircraft developer Joby Aviation is partnering with defense giant L3Harris to create a next-generation military aircraft that can be either piloted or flown autonomously. The collaboration will combine Joby's hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems. The project will initially focus on applications like airborne surveillance and logistics in contested environments, reflecting a shift in military thinking towards smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable autonomous aircraft. The companies plan to begin testing this fall, with operational demonstrations scheduled for 2026, aiming for rapid development and deployment.</p>
