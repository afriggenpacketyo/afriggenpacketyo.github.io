          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard say new intelligence indicates the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities caused damage that could take years to repair.  This contradicts a preliminary assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency that estimated a shorter setback. President Trump reiterated his claim that the strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program and said talks with Iran are expected next week. The conflicting assessments raise questions about the extent of the damage and Iran's remaining nuclear capabilities.</p>
