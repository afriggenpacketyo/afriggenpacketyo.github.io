          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located atop a volcano in Hawaii, has captured a detailed image of a cluster of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope that this instrument will enable them to better predict powerful and potentially damaging solar storms. Sunspots, described as areas of intense magnetic activity, can trigger solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The telescope's success marks a significant milestone in solar physics research.</p>
