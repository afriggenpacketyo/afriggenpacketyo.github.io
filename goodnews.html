          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders, currently third on the team's depth chart, has voiced strong confidence in his ability to outperform some current NFL starters. Despite sitting behind veteran Joe Flacco and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel, Sanders stated he is preparing daily as if he could be called upon at any moment. His father, Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, also predicted his son would start for the Browns this season.

          <p>Costco has surpassed Wall Street's expectations for its quarterly earnings and revenue, reporting significant double-digit growth in both membership income and its e-commerce sector. The warehouse club's success is attributed to attracting more members, including a growing demographic of younger shoppers, and its ability to manage tariff costs by introducing private-label alternatives and adjusting merchandise. Despite a slight dip in same-store sales growth, the company plans to open 35 new warehouses in the coming fiscal year. Membership fee increases also contributed to the strong financial performance.

          <p>Raynae Madison and her family from Oklahoma discovered a nearly 3-carat chocolate brown diamond at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. Madison initially thought the stone was too large to be a diamond but it was later identified by park staff. Named the "William Diamond" in honor of her nephew, the 2.79-carat gem is the third-largest found at the park this year. The article explains that brown diamonds from the Crater are formed through plastic deformation, reflecting light to create their unique color. The park, a popular destination for diamond hunting, has seen over 75,000 diamonds unearthed since 1906.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since April, outperforming rivals and effectively stepping out of the takeover spotlight it occupied months prior. This improved sentiment is attributed to a fundamental strategic reset, a leadership shake-up, progress on cost-cutting initiatives, and recent oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasized the company's focus on growth rather than acquisition. Analysts have upgraded BP's rating and price targets following stronger-than-expected second-quarter results, signaling a period of renewed stability and confidence in the company's direction.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Assembly Bill 238 into law, providing up to one year of mortgage relief for victims of the January 7 firestorms. This urgency measure allows borrowers to pause payments without penalties by attesting to financial hardship caused by the fires. The legislation, which offers more generous terms than a previous voluntary program, prohibits foreclosures and protects credit scores. It aims to ease the financial burden on thousands of homeowners who are struggling with rebuilding and insurance claims. The article also mentions a federal tax filing relief act signed by President Trump.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order paving the way for a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure, avoiding a potential ban. The order designates the agreement as a "qualified divestiture," satisfying congressional requirements for TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sever ties. Under the deal, Oracle will provide security by hosting U.S. user data and reviewing the app's code, with ByteDance retaining a minority stake of less than 20% in a new U.S.-based joint venture. The administration aims to address national security concerns while allowing the popular app to continue serving its millions of American users.</p>

Law enforcement agencies urged residents in affected areas to use local alternative numbers for emergencies during the restoration efforts.

          <p>Late billionaire Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime partner, contended that "really fancy houses" often make people less happy, not more. Despite his vast wealth, Munger lived in the same modest Los Angeles home for seven decades, deliberately avoiding a grand lifestyle. He believed excessive homes, while good for large-scale entertaining, were expensive and could negatively influence children's values. The article notes Munger's perspective challenges the common belief that larger homes equate to greater satisfaction, especially amidst current high housing costs and upkeep frustrations. This philosophy suggests that true happiness stems from stability rather than material excess. (not investment advice)</p>
