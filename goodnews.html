          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's stop-work order on the Revolution Wind farm, allowing the nearly completed project to resume construction. The Danish energy company Orsted had sued the Interior Department after it halted the project, which is set to provide power to over 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. In his ruling, Judge Royce Lamberth noted the project was 80% complete and that the company would suffer irreparable harm if the order remained. The decision marks a setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will resume broadcasting on Tuesday after a week-long suspension. The show was pulled following comments Kimmel made regarding the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which Disney described as "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The decision to bring the show back was made after several days of "thoughtful conversations" with the host, amid a broader debate on free speech and corporate responses to political pressure. The suspension had drawn criticism from many, including former President Barack Obama.</p>

This new entity will have a majority of U.S. investors and board members, with software company Oracle overseeing security, including the app's powerful algorithm. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order approving the deal's national security provisions and extending the deadline to finalize it. While the White House expressed confidence that China has approved the plan, Beijing has not yet publicly confirmed the agreement.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates on a downward trend, prospective homebuyers are optimistic about a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in October. Financial experts suggest that while waiting, buyers should take proactive steps to prepare for a more competitive market. Key recommendations include checking credit reports for inaccuracies and then securing a mortgage pre-approval to demonstrate financial readiness to sellers. Additionally, now is an opportune time to research real estate agents and compare lenders to be well-positioned to act quickly when rates fall. (not investment advice)</p>

New leadership is refocusing on core products and rebuilding retail partnerships, with a recent earnings report showing early signs of success.

          <p>Consumer Watchdog, a prominent California advocacy group, has proposed a ballot initiative aimed at protecting homeowners from losing insurance coverage. The "Insurance Policyholder Bill of Rights" would require insurers to offer coverage to homeowners who implement wildfire safety measures. Companies that refuse would be barred from selling any home or auto insurance in the state for five years. The proposal comes in response to insurers pulling back from the California market and is intended to counter a separate, industry-backed initiative that would weaken existing consumer protections.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing via a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable. For a $100,000 loan, monthly payments are now modestly lower than they were at the start of the year. For example, a 15-year loan would cost approximately $974 per month at current rates, compared to about $986 in early February. With further rate cuts anticipated later this year, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) with variable rates may offer additional savings for homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. more than doubled at one point on Monday after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson recommended the stock. Jackson, known for his influence on the trading of Opendoor, called Better Home "the Shopify of mortgages" and suggested it could be a "350-bagger in 2 years." His firm, EMJ Capital, has taken a position in the company, which he argues is undervalued compared to newly public competitors like Figure Technology Solutions.

          <p>With the official start of fall, leaf-peeping season is underway across the United States, though climate change is causing delays compared to historical patterns. Foliage prediction maps from sources like the Old Farmer's Almanac estimate that northern regions will see peak colors by early October, with the vibrant hues moving south later in the month. Experts note that timing and intensity can vary based on local factors like temperature and rainfall. For the best views, they recommend monitoring updates from state forestry agencies and exploring different elevations or areas with varied conditions.</p>

          <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has organized an open letter, signed by over 400 prominent entertainers, in support of Jimmy Kimmel. The letter condemns the suspension of his show as a "dark moment for freedom of speech" resulting from government pressure on a private company. Signatories include Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston, and Lin-Manuel Miranda, who argue that such actions threaten the livelihoods of creatives and run counter to constitutional values. The letter calls for a united front to protect the right to speak freely without fear of reprisal from those in power.</p>
