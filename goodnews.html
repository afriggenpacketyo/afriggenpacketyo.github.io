          <p>Liverpool's 16-year-old forward, Rio Ngumoha, is generating significant excitement after a standout performance in a pre-season friendly at Anfield against Athletic Bilbao. The England Under-17 player scored one goal and assisted another, continuing a strong summer showing that has fans speculating about his inclusion in the first-team squad for the upcoming season. Ngumoha, who joined from Chelsea's youth academy last year, became Liverpool's second-youngest player ever in an FA Cup match in January. Amid changes in Liverpool's front line, his recent form presents a compelling case for more competitive opportunities.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of Ireland, Spain, and Norway have officially recognized the state of Palestine. The decision, which took formal effect this week, was described by Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris as a historic and important moment, urging other European nations to follow suit. The action reflects a growing sentiment among some countries that Palestinian statehood should not be contingent on a final peace settlement with Israel. Israel has strongly condemned the decision and withdrawn its ambassador from Dublin, while Palestinian officials have welcomed the recognition as a significant step toward self-determination.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence has created a massive and unexpected demand for energy, positioning GE Vernova as a key player in the tech revolution. The company, a leading producer of gas-fired turbines, is seeing record orders from entities building power-hungry AI data centers, causing its stock to double this year. This surge is testing the industry's manufacturing capacity, with GE Vernova's turbines largely sold out through 2027, prompting a $600 million investment to expand U.S. facilities. The situation reflects a broader energy bottleneck for AI infrastructure, shifting the primary constraint from computing chips to electricity itself. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the pioneering first female director general of the British security service MI5, has passed away at the age of 90. She led the agency from 1992 to 1996, a period of significant transformation for the intelligence community. Dame Stella was the first MI5 head to be publicly named upon appointment, a move that shattered decades of secrecy and required her and her family to relocate for security reasons. Her public profile and leadership style were widely believed to have inspired the character of 'M,' played by Dame Judi Dench, in the James Bond film series.</p>

          <p>Following its $8.4 billion acquisition of Paramount, Skydance Media has announced a new leadership structure, marking the end of the Redstone family's control. David Ellison will serve as Chairman and CEO, with former NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell as President, overseeing television operations. The new team includes several key executives from Skydance, RedBird Capital, and outside hires, such as former Netflix programmer Cindy Holland, who will run streaming services. This shake-up, which follows a politically contentious FCC approval, is expected to bring significant changes, including further layoffs, as the new leadership aims to revitalize the iconic entertainment company.</p>

          <p>Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and his wife, BBC Radio 1 host Vick Hope, have announced the birth of their son, Micah, through a controversial Instagram post. The post included intimate photos from the home birth and a graphic image of the placenta, which was later shown being processed into pills. While many celebrities and fans congratulated the couple and praised the post for normalizing childbirth, others expressed shock and discomfort over the explicit nature of the images. The debate highlights differing cultural attitudes towards sharing personal moments and the practice of placentophagy, the consumption of the placenta after birth.</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters surged by 20% after Donald Trump praised its new ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. Trump's social media post, which commended the ad after he learned of Sweeney's reported Republican voter registration, reversed a recent slump in the company's stock. The campaign had previously faced criticism for its slogan, which some deemed a double entendre, while others found it overly sexualized. This event underscores the significant and unpredictable impact that political commentary can have on brand perception and market performance in today's highly polarized environment.

          <p>Researchers have identified the cause of a mysterious wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. A new study reveals the culprit is not a virus, as previously suspected, but a bacteria called Vibrio pectenicida, which infects the sea star's internal fluid, causing its limbs to fall off and its body to disintegrate. The epidemic has devastated over 20 species, pushing the sunflower sea star to be listed as critically endangered. This discovery provides a crucial step toward potential interventions, such as captive breeding programs, to restore these vital predators and the kelp forest ecosystems they protect.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Minimally Processed Diets Double Weight Loss Compared to Healthy Ultra-Processed Foods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial has found that people lost twice as much weight on a minimally processed diet compared to an ultra-processed one, even when both diets met official nutritional guidelines. In the eight-week study, participants eating meals made from scratch, like homemade spaghetti, consumed fewer calories and lost more weight than when they ate pre-packaged 'healthy' options like ready-to-eat lasagna. This suggests that the level of food processing itself, not just the nutritional content, plays a significant role in calorie consumption and weight management. The findings reinforce the benefits of diets based on whole, unprocessed foods for health.</p>

          <h2>The 60% Reverse Mortgage Rule: How It Affects Senior Homeowners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 12:57:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key regulation known as the 60% rule significantly impacts senior homeowners using a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), a common type of reverse mortgage. This FHA rule limits borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds during the first year, unless a larger amount is needed to pay off mandatory obligations like an existing mortgage. While designed to prevent homeowners from depleting their equity too quickly and ensure long-term financial stability, this restriction can pose challenges for those needing a large lump sum for immediate expenses. Understanding this rule is crucial for seniors evaluating their financial options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States for six months, a move intended to de-escalate trade tensions and allow time for negotiations. The countermeasures were set to take effect this week in response to U.S. tariffs. This delay follows a political agreement reached in late July between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump to restore stability to trans-Atlantic trade. The EU stated it will continue working with the U.S. to finalize the details of the broader trade deal, which aims to reduce duties on both sides. (not investment advice)</p>
