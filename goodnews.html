          <p>Meta has entered into a significant six-year agreement to utilize Google's cloud services, a deal valued at over $10 billion. This strategic partnership focuses heavily on artificial intelligence infrastructure, supporting Meta's development of its Llama models and AI integration across its platforms. The deal represents a major win for Google Cloud as it competes with rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for large-scale enterprise contracts. Despite being competitors in the online advertising market, Meta's extensive infrastructure needs have led it to partner with major cloud providers, including Google. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, slowed to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month but still slightly above economists' expectations. The moderation was largely driven by an easing in rice price inflation, which had previously surged past 100%. The "core-core" inflation rate, a key metric for the Bank of Japan that also strips out energy prices, remained steady at 3.4%. This data follows the central bank's recent upward revision of its inflation forecasts and comes as the nation's economy shows modest growth, though trade figures have been sluggish.

          <p>The UK government has introduced new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt content and cease marketing snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict health claims that are not supported by scientific evidence, a practice that critics say misleads parents. This move follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given an 18-month period to comply, after which the government may consider further action if the guidelines are not adopted.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite a strong quarterly report that included an increased full-year forecast. Simon described the quarter as exceptionally good for a retailer in any economic climate, highlighting Walmart's growing sales and expanding margins. He believes investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by restructuring costs rather than a systemic issue with the business. Simon also noted that Walmart has successfully retained higher-income shoppers who were initially drawn by inflation, citing the appeal of low prices and convenience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to reverse six consecutive years of declining sales, Jeep has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Cherokee, which was previously discontinued in 2023. The new model is the first hybrid for the Jeep brand and for parent company Stellantis in North America, featuring a 1.6-liter turbo-four hybrid powertrain. Starting at just under $37,000, the new Cherokee is longer, wider, and taller than its predecessor, with increased cargo capacity and updated interior technology. The launch is a key part of CEO Antonio Filosa's strategy to recover Jeep's market share in the competitive midsize SUV segment.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 9-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies, earning a split in their four-game series and maintaining a narrow one-game lead in their division.

While the Dodgers swept the Padres in their last series, the division lead has shrunk significantly from six games in early July, setting the stage for a high-stakes weekend matchup.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly half-a-billion-dollar penalty imposed on President Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial, deeming the fine excessive. While the court upheld the underlying ruling that Trump is liable for fraudulently inflating the value of his assets, it concluded the massive financial penalty was likely unconstitutional. The New York Attorney General's Office, which brought the case, plans to appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court. Non-monetary penalties, such as a three-year ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York, were left in place by the ruling.</p>

          <p>China is amending its 1998 pricing law in an effort to curb "involution," a term for hyper-competitive, often loss-making business practices that have plagued sectors like the solar panel industry. The revision, currently open for public feedback, aims to create a more sustainable market equilibrium by regulating aggressive price slashing. A solar panel manufacturer in Zhejiang province noted that severe overcapacity has led to purely price-based competition, causing substantial industry-wide losses. The move by regulators to address this issue has already led to a recent rebound in product prices in some sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed after the match that Eze would not play for the club again. The win, secured by a goal from Jean-Philippe Mateta, allows the team to advance in the tournament, but the club now faces the urgent task of reinvesting and rebuilding following the loss of its key player.</p>

In his introductory press conference with his new team, Mihailović implied Toronto had a greater commitment to winning, which may have prompted the Rapids' gesture.
