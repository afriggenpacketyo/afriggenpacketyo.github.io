          <h2>Gen Z's Return to Religion: Exploring the Reasons Behind the Trend</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 06:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent trend shows that Gen Z is increasingly finding religion, reversing previous declines in religious attendance. Experts suggest this may be a form of rebellion against atheist parents or a search for meaning in a chaotic world. Some note a rise in young men joining Catholicism, possibly due to the perceived privileged position of men in the church hierarchy. This shift indicates a potential change in the cultural landscape of religion in America, as young people seek answers and community in religious institutions.</p>

          <p>David Bull, a TV presenter, has been named the new chairman of Reform UK, replacing Zia Yusuf, who resigned after disagreements over a burka ban. Nigel Farage stated that Bull's role is to inspire the party's base and provide leadership to volunteers, while Yusuf will lead the "Doge team" focused on cutting wasteful spending in Reform-controlled councils. Yusuf regretted his social media post about Pochin and attributed his actions to exhaustion, and the party is restructuring leadership roles, including creating a head of operations and head of treasury.</p>

          <p>Timothy Gay, Rory McIlroy's biographer, expressed his delight at McIlroy's Masters victory, which completed his career grand slam, even though it contradicted his book's original epilogue.

The book, titled *Rory Land: The Up-and-Down World of Golf‚Äôs Global Icon*, explores McIlroy's career, family, and Northern Irish heritage, and Gay also addressed the recent driver controversy involving McIlroy at the PGA Championship.</p>

          <p>Scientists have helped Yosemite National Park's native turtles recover by removing invasive bullfrogs, and the research shows that near-total eradication of bullfrogs can lead to the recovery of the Northwestern pond turtle. The American bullfrog, which is not native to the area, preys on various species, including pond turtle hatchlings. After removing approximately 16,000 bullfrogs from two sites, researchers observed the return of younger turtles and other native species. The study offers a potential tool for restoring freshwater ecosystems under certain circumstances.</p>
