          <h2>Texas Governor Signs School Choice Bill Into Law Amid Controversy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities up to $30,000, and home-schooled students $2,000 annually. Democrats argue the legislation will siphon funds from the already underfunded public school system, primarily benefiting wealthier families who already send their children to private schools. Abbott and supporters say the bill empowers parents to choose the educational option that best suits their children's needs, while opponents describe it as welfare for the wealthy at the expense of public-school children.</p>

          <p>A psychologist identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like...?" as a highly damaging statement in relationships, arguing it's more toxic than many realize. This comparison can lead to irreparable insecurity issues, making partners feel inadequate and constantly question their worth. The phrase is often a symptom of a deeper issue: a fear of openly expressing needs, which can lead to suppressed frustrations and resentment. The psychologist suggests that open and direct communication, without shame or comparison, is essential for a healthy relationship.</p>
