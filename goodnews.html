          <p>Independent candidate Catherine Connolly has secured a decisive victory in Ireland's presidential election, garnering over 64% of the vote in a race against two mainstream party candidates. Backed by left-wing parties, the 68-year-old lawmaker from Galway campaigned on themes of peace and neutrality, often expressing critical views of the US and EU. The election was marked by a low voter turnout and a high number of spoiled ballots, which some analysts interpret as widespread dissatisfaction with the political establishment's handling of issues like immigration and housing.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has reported that President Xi Jinping personally led the drafting team for the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan, underscoring his deep involvement in shaping national policy. The reports emphasize that Xi played a "decisive role" and dedicated significant effort to the document's formulation, which was informed by his extensive inspection tours across China. This personal oversight highlights the centralization of power under Xi, as the plan's framework underwent multiple revisions by the Politburo Standing Committee before its presentation to the Central Committee.</p>

While dismissing current polls that show her with low favorability, she expressed confidence that a woman will eventually become president and affirmed her commitment to a life of public service. During the interview, she also criticized former rival Donald Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" who has weaponized the justice system and to whom many business leaders have capitulated.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University have developed a bionic jellyfish robot designed for stealthy underwater surveillance. Described as an "underwater phantom," the compact and lightweight device mimics the appearance and movement of a real jellyfish, allowing for near-silent operation with low power consumption. Its transparent body is made from a specialized hydrogel material, making it uniquely suited for tasks like monitoring fragile marine ecosystems, inspecting underwater structures, and conducting covert observation missions in deep-sea environments without causing disruption.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his Seattle-area mansion for $63 million, marking a significant profit from his original $37.5 million purchase price. The sale comes as Bezos has relocated to Miami and continues to reduce his ownership stake in Amazon, which has now fallen below 10%. This financial move coincides with an ongoing legal battle where Bezos is seeking to have his wife's brother, Michael Sánchez, cover nearly $200,000 in legal fees related to a past defamation lawsuit. These actions reflect a period of significant personal and financial transition for the billionaire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A certified child life specialist and therapist advises that saying "no" to children should be a constructive process that builds connection rather than conflict. The article suggests turning denials into teachable moments by explaining the reasoning behind a boundary, such as safety or kindness, which helps children understand and accept limits. Offering choices within established boundaries can also empower children by giving them a sense of autonomy. Consistency is key, as it creates a predictable and secure environment, and parents are encouraged to repair interactions when they react emotionally.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic soccer gold medalist Abby Wambach advises parents against attending their children's sports practices to foster resilience and internal motivation. She argues that a parent's presence can cause children to "outsource their motivation," making them either nervous or overly focused on impressing their parents rather than playing freely. By allowing kids to interact with coaches and teammates independently, parents can help them develop self-starting behaviors and a sense of agency. Wambach also suggests that during games, parents should emphasize acts of leadership and good sportsmanship over the final score.</p>
