          <p>Microsoft reported stronger-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, causing its stock to rise significantly in after-hours trading. The company's revenue grew 18%, its fastest rate in over three years, largely driven by its Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes the Azure platform. For the first time, Microsoft disclosed that Azure's annual revenue exceeded $75 billion, a 34% increase from the previous year. The robust performance, fueled by AI investments and strong demand for cloud services, has pushed Microsoft's market capitalization towards the $4 trillion mark. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. By declining a gubernatorial bid, Harris keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run and plans to remain active in politics by campaigning for Democrats.

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of four charges related to deliberately receiving yellow cards to influence betting markets. An independent regulatory commission found the spot-fixing allegations, which could have resulted in a lifetime ban, to be "not proven." The investigation by the Football Association began in August 2023 and centered on four separate Premier League matches. However, Paqueta was found guilty of two counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation, and he will face a sanction for those breaches at a later date.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif argues for the creation of a Middle East Network for Atomic Research and Advancement (Menara). He proposes this regional body to foster peaceful nuclear cooperation among nations in the Middle East and North Africa, based on a commitment to reject nuclear weapons. Zarif contends that this approach can build trust and provide a new path forward, rather than waiting for Israeli disarmament, which has stalled progress. The initiative aims to reframe the nuclear issue from one of risk to one of shared opportunity.</p>
