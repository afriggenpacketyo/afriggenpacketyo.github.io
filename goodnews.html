          <p>During a press conference about the installation of new flagpoles at the White House, President Trump jokingly questioned the immigration status of the construction workers present. This remark followed a question about his administration's deportation efforts, during which he mentioned the removal of "murderers, drug dealers, and people that are mentally insane." Trump's comments came as his administration continues to pursue stringent immigration policies, including mass deportation programs. He added that the flagpoles were a gift from him to the White House, which he felt was missing them.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives, ensuring that elections for both chambers of parliament will not occur simultaneously in July. This decision comes as Yoshihiko Noda, head of the main opposition party, has decided not to submit a no-confidence motion against Ishiba's Cabinet. Noda cited concerns about creating a political vacuum amid rising U.S. tariffs and Middle East tensions as reasons for his decision. The House of Councillors election is still expected to be held in July, following the end of the current parliamentary session.</p>

          <p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has reduced its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, bringing it to 0%, citing easing inflationary pressures. The SNB noted that inflation in Switzerland had slightly dipped into negative territory in May compared to February, primarily due to declining prices in the tourism and oil sectors. The bank projects annual inflation at 0.2% this year, rising to 0.5% next year, and 0.7% in 2027, assuming the target interest rate remains at zero. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With a significant heat wave expected to hit much of the United States, it's crucial to take precautions when planning outdoor activities.

Recognizing the symptoms of heat exhaustion, staying hydrated, and taking frequent breaks are also essential for staying safe in hot weather. Extreme heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the United States, and warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected throughout the summer.</p>

The negotiations are crucial for Japan's export-driven economy, but making easy concessions could hurt voter support.
