          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and emphasized the importance of the Constitution as a unifying force. He was honored for upholding the constitutional transfer of power during the 2020 election. Pence highlighted the need to find common ground despite differences, referencing disagreements with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues like spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine. While avoiding direct mention of Trump, Pence underscored his commitment to the peaceful transfer of power.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its last in-house beagle laboratory following accusations of animal cruelty. A report detailed the lab's alleged history of conducting deadly experiments on beagles, prompting investigations and condemnation. Animal rights groups praised the closure, with PETA highlighting Anthony Fauci's alleged approval of funding for similar tests in Tunisia. The move follows other Trump administration initiatives to phase out animal testing, including actions by the FDA and EPA. The company that bred the beagles for research pleaded guilty to neglecting thousands of dogs at its breeding facility.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is a medical procedure in which a woman's eggs are harvested, frozen, and stored until she is ready to have children. The procedure does not ensure success, and is extremely expensive, especially for women who do not have insurance coverage from their employer. The average cost of a single cycle, from egg retrieval to freezing to storage, is around $12,000 to $13,000. Doctors sometimes recommend that a woman undergo multiple cycles of egg freezing to increase the number of eggs available for fertilization and implantation.</p>
