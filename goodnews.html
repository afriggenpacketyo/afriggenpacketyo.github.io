It explains the nomination criteria, the selection process by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and lists past notable winners like Barack Obama and Malala Yousafzai. While Trump has been nominated for his role in brokering a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, the nominations came after the deadline, and experts believe the committee is unlikely to award him the prize despite his claims of deserving it.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. companies involved in mining rare earths and critical minerals experienced a significant surge after China announced new, tighter restrictions on its exports of these materials. The new rules require licenses for exporting products containing even small amounts of rare earths, a move seen as an effort to control global technology supply chains. This has fueled speculation that the U.S. government will increase investment in domestic supply chains to reduce its dependency on China for these crucial materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released the updated federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year, adjusting the income thresholds to account for inflation. This annual change is designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets even if their real income hasn't increased. For 2026, married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200, while single filers will have a deduction of $16,100, providing potential tax relief for many Americans.</p>

The agreement is expected to boost trade by an additional $34 billion, cutting tariffs on UK products like Scotch whisky and medical devices, while the UK will reduce duties on Indian goods such as clothing and food. The partnership also includes cooperation on technology, with plans for a joint AI center and initiatives to strengthen critical mineral supply chains.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines executives predict that revenue from its premium seating, such as first class, could soon exceed sales from its standard economy cabin. In the last quarter, premium cabin ticket revenue rose by 9% to nearly $5.8 billion, while main cabin revenue declined by 4%. This trend reflects a broader airline industry strategy to cater to high-spending travelers by outfitting planes with more luxurious seating options, which has become a significant driver of profitability and customer loyalty for carriers like Delta.</p>

          <p>A Texas court has granted a stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who was convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter in 2002 based on a "shaken baby syndrome" diagnosis. The court's decision allows for his case to be re-examined under a state law concerning "junk science," as Roberson's defense argues the child died from pneumonia complicated by medication. The ruling comes after years of appeals and growing support for a re-examination of his case, with scientific understanding of shaken baby syndrome having evolved significantly since his trial.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of "collective illusions," where individuals privately disagree with a perceived majority opinion but remain silent out of fear of social rejection. Citing research showing a significant gap between public statements and private beliefs on sensitive topics, the article argues this phenomenon harms both democracy and personal well-being by fostering inauthenticity. Drawing on the philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson, it suggests that breaking free requires honesty, reframing independence as a strength, and distancing oneself from sources of social pressure.</p>
