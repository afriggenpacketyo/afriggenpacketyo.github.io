          <p>President Trump has issued a full pardon for Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of "Chrisley Knows Best," who were convicted three years ago of evading taxes and defrauding banks of over $30 million. The pardon follows their daughter Savannah Chrisley's public support of Trump and claims that her parents were victims of a weaponized justice system, similar to the former president's own grievances. The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 of financial fraud and tax evasion, with Todd receiving a 12-year sentence and Julie a seven-year sentence. Their lawyer argued that their conviction exemplified the weaponization of justice against conservatives.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk voiced his disappointment with the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" supported by President Trump, stating it increases the budget deficit and undermines efforts to improve government efficiency. Musk, who previously stepped back from running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), criticized the bill's $3.8 trillion deficit increase by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The legislation includes extensions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, border security spending, and changes to Medicaid and clean energy tax credits. Musk suggests the bill cannot be both "big" and "beautiful."</p>
