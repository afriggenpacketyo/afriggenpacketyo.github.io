          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured his first US PGA Championship title by holding off Jon Rahm, ultimately winning by six strokes at Quail Hollow. Despite a shaky start, Scheffler maintained his lead, while Rahm faltered in the final three holes. This victory marks Scheffler's third major win, adding to his Masters victories in 2022 and 2024. The emotional win came after a challenging front nine, where Scheffler's patchy play allowed Rahm to briefly share the lead before Rahm's collapse.</p>
