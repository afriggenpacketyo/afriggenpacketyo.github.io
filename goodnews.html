          <p>Gemini Space Station, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss brothers, saw its shares soar over 40% on its Nasdaq debut after raising $425 million in an initial public offering. The stock opened at $37.01, above its expected IPO price of $28, valuing the company at approximately $3.3 billion before trading commenced. Despite reporting net losses in 2024 and the first half of 2025, Gemini offers a range of crypto services, including a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin and custody services for institutions. The Winklevoss brothers, known as early Bitcoin investors, remain highly bullish on the cryptocurrency's future, predicting it could reach $1 million within a decade, underscoring their long-term vision for the digital asset market.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched a pilot program aimed at accelerating the deployment of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxis, with major players Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation participating. This initiative will establish at least five public-private partnerships with state and local governments to ensure the safe integration of eVTOL aircraft. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted the program as a move to cement America's leadership in advanced aviation, with supervised trials potentially starting next year. The announcement follows President Trump's executive order and is seen as a critical step toward widespread air taxi service, promising reduced emissions and eased traffic congestion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses the common investor concern that high-priced stocks are out of reach, arguing that value, not price, should be the focus. It explains that the dollar amount invested, not the number of shares, determines risk and reward, making valuation metrics like price-to-earnings ratios more important than share price. The article highlights the role of fractional shares in making expensive stocks accessible to retail investors, though it notes caveats regarding options trading and voting rights. Ultimately, it advises prioritizing fundamental characteristics like management quality and growth opportunities over share price when making investment decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for leading a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 elections and "annihilate" democracy. Four of five judges found Bolsonaro guilty of orchestrating a plot that included an online disinformation campaign and plans to assassinate the newly elected president, culminating in the January 2023 riots in Brasília. Seven close allies from the military and security establishment were also convicted. This landmark decision challenges historical norms of impunity in Brazil, sending a powerful signal globally that leaders must be held accountable for undermining democratic norms, despite potential domestic backlash from his supporters.</p>

The article praises creator Julian Fellowes for grounding the narrative in character-driven conflicts, such as Lady Mary's tabloid divorce scandal and Lord Grantham's resistance to passing on estate management. The film adeptly uses its period setting to comment on contemporary issues, like generational divides, making archaic norms feel relevant. With delightful guest stars and a mix of old and new characters, the article concludes that the film offers a pleasurable, albeit perhaps temporary, visit to the world of Downton, despite some character development limitations.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie, ranked 34th in the world, secured a crucial 1-0 lead for Great Britain against Poland in their Davis Cup World Group 1 match. Norrie survived a scare and saved set points in a nervy first set against world number 545 Tomasz Berkieta, ultimately winning 7-6 (11-9) 6-4 in Gdynia. In a significant development, world number 227 Arthur Fery, 23, is set to make his Davis Cup debut in the second match against Olaf Pieczkowski, replacing the injured Jacob Fearnley. The winners of this tie, which will conclude on Saturday, will advance to next February's first round, thereby having an opportunity to compete for the 2026 title.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Refutes "Trigger-Happy" Label for LAPD, Citing Long-Term Restraint in Shootings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 13:08:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues against the perception of a "trigger-happy" LAPD, contending that recent spikes in officer-involved shootings (OIS) must be viewed within long-term trends and specific incident facts. It highlights a 72% drop in OIS since 1990, attributing it to decades of reform and a post-2018 "command and control" training doctrine emphasizing restraint. The article posits that violent crime levels explain about 70% of OIS fluctuations, and the LAPD has consistently averaged fewer OIS per year than crime rates would predict since 2018. It concludes that the department demonstrates professionalism and restraint relative to the threats officers confront.</p>

          <p>The family of Steve Biko, the prominent South African anti-apartheid activist, expressed confidence that a new inquest into his 1977 death will lead to the prosecution of those responsible. Biko, a Black Consciousness Movement founder, died from a brain injury after being assaulted by police while in detention. Despite former officers admitting to the assault after apartheid ended, no one has been prosecuted. Biko's son, Nkosinathi, stated that the country cannot move forward without addressing its violent past and that a democratic court will find his father's murder was orchestrated by the implicated policemen. The case was adjourned until November, reigniting hopes for justice after decades.</p>

          <p>Following Nebius Holdings' stock surge due to a massive Microsoft contract, this article highlights CoreWeave as another promising AI cloud infrastructure provider. CoreWeave, which rents out GPU-powered data centers for AI workloads, saw its stock jump and reported a 207% revenue increase in Q2 2025 to $1.2 billion, with a $30.1 billion backlog. The company, a major Microsoft customer and partner to OpenAI and Google Cloud, is expanding its data center capacity rapidly, aiming for 900 MW by year-end. With a significantly lower valuation than Nebius, CoreWeave is presented as an attractive investment in the booming $400 billion AI data center market, poised for substantial growth.

          <p>This article revisits the 1985 congressional hearings where Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) advocated for warning labels on albums with explicit lyrics, facing opposition from musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister. Snider argued against censorship, emphasizing parental responsibility, while Gore pushed for "truth in packaging" to aid parental guidance. The PMRC eventually succeeded, leading to the "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" stickers, which caused some stores to stop carrying labeled records. Ironically, some artists claimed these labels boosted sales. The article highlights the lasting impact of this cultural battle on the music industry and the ongoing voluntary nature of these warnings.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are urgently addressing their inexplicably poor offensive performance, which saw them rank 30th in scoring for a five-week stretch, despite boasting a star-studded lineup. President Andrew Friedman expressed disbelief at the slump, which followed a dominant first half. Manager Dave Roberts and players acknowledge that health issues were a factor, but also that the team lost sight of fundamental "team at-bats" and competitiveness. With key players returning and a renewed focus on situational hitting and approach, the Dodgers hope to rectify their offensive woes and avoid past postseason failures.

          <p>The European Union has accepted Microsoft's commitments to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its popular productivity apps, effectively exempting the tech giant from a potentially hefty antitrust fine. Microsoft was accused by the European Commission of breaching competition rules by abusively bundling Teams with its Office products. Under the binding agreement, Microsoft will offer versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites at reduced prices without Teams, allow customers with long-term licenses to switch, and ensure interoperability with rival tools. Salesforce-owned Slack, which filed the initial complaint, lauded the settlement as a meaningful step towards holding Microsoft accountable and fostering fair competition in the market, signaling a positive outcome for market dynamics.</p>
