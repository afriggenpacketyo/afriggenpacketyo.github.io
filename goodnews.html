          <p>China's central bank has kept its benchmark lending rates steady, following the monetary easing measures implemented last month to stimulate economic growth. The People's Bank of China held the one-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. Last month, authorities reduced lending rates for the first time since October by 10 basis points, aiming to mitigate the impact of trade tensions with the United States. This decision follows a trend of commercial banks trimming deposit rates to protect their net interest margin.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with ICE to receive transportation funding. The administration's policy aimed to withhold funds from "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

California's Attorney General lauded the decision, arguing that President Trump was attempting to coerce states into carrying out his immigration agenda.
