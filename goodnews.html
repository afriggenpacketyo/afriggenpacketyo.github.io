          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to slow the pace of its government bond purchases beyond April of next year, reducing them by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen. This adjustment aims to reduce the total amount of bond purchases to approximately 2 trillion yen by early 2027. While scaling back its debt buying, the BOJ is maintaining its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, marking the third consecutive meeting without an adjustment. This decision reflects a prudent approach to normalizing monetary policy amid economic uncertainties, particularly with U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs potentially impacting Japan's export-oriented economy.

During a phone conversation last week, both leaders expressed a mutual desire to foster stable bilateral relations, especially as this year marks the 60th anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic ties.

          <p>Gold has emerged as the leading safe haven asset, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025, surpassing the performance of traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys. The appeal of gold lies in its independence from government liabilities, as it is not tied to any specific economy or fiscal policy. Concerns about fiscal sustainability and geopolitical instability have fueled demand for gold, while the dollar index has weakened and U.S. Treasurys have faced sell-offs due to tariff policies and credit rating downgrades. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference highlighted gold's key advantage as "no one else's liability."</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that the Trump administration's directives to cancel research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were illegal and void. The judge, William Young, stated that the cancellations, which targeted studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), violated federal law. The judge ordered the NIH to restore the terminated grants, and the ruling came in response to lawsuits filed by the American Public Health Association and a group of 16 states. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) expressed disagreement with the ruling and is considering legal options, including an appeal.</p>

          <p>Southern Water, serving approximately 2.6 million customers across southern England, has cautioned its customers to conserve water due to a prolonged dry spring. The company advises shorter showers and allowing lawns to turn brown, as local chalk streams and rivers like the Test and Itchen are affected. These rivers supply the majority of the south's water, and Southern Water warns that if river levels continue to drop, hosepipe bans or ceasing the use of these streams altogether may become necessary. England has experienced its driest spring since 1893, exacerbating the situation.</p>

This speed is five times faster than Starlink, which operates at much lower altitudes. The team overcame atmospheric turbulence by using a combination of adaptive optics (AO) and mode diversity reception (MDR), a solution they call "AO-MDR synergy." Led by Professor Wu Jian and Liu Chao, the achievement marks a significant advancement in satellite laser downlink technology, potentially enabling high-definition movie transfers from Shanghai to Los Angeles in under five seconds.</p>

          <p>China has suggested that its most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may soon be commissioned into service. State media hinted at the ship's imminent entry by referencing a future era with three Chinese carriers. Satellite images revealed 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, indicating a higher capacity than existing carriers. The new markings suggest that the Fujian is getting prepared to be commissioned, with potential sea trials and coordination exercises to follow before its formal entry into service by the end of the year.</p>
