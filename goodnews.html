          <h2>Google Trends Analysis Reveals Regional Preferences for Pumpkin-Flavored Foods in the U.S.</h2>

          <p>A recent analysis of Google search trends indicates that pumpkin bread is the most popular pumpkin-based food in 20 U.S. states, particularly in the South and Midwest. The study, conducted by Coffeeness, shows regional variations, with muffins favored in states like California and Massachusetts, and cookies being the top choice in places such as Arizona and Pennsylvania. A food trend expert suggests this reflects a post-pandemic increase in home cooking and social media recipe sharing, driven by both economic pressures and cultural shifts. Savory options like pumpkin soup are popular in Florida and Texas, while pumpkin seeds are preferred in warmer climates like Hawaii.</p>

In response, Sri Lanka struggled against a formidable English bowling attack, with Sophie Ecclestone taking four wickets for just 17 runs. Despite a promising start, Sri Lanka was bowled out for 164, placing England at the top of the tournament standings.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through central London in April 2024, has been retired to a sanctuary in the countryside. The 15-year-old horse sustained a broken bone and significant bleeding after being spooked by construction noise during a morning exercise. The incident, which saw the horses collide with vehicles and injure several soldiers and civilians, garnered widespread public attention. Due to the severity of his injuries, Quaker was unable to return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry and will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire.</p>

          <p>A'ja Wilson has led the Las Vegas Aces to their third WNBA title in four years, capping a season where she achieved an unprecedented quadrafecta of individual and team honors. The 29-year-old star won the league's scoring title, the Most Valuable Player award, Defensive Player of the Year, and the Finals MVP in the same year. The Aces' championship run was remarkable, as the team overcame a difficult 14-14 start to the season before winning 16 straight games to secure a high playoff seed. Wilson's leadership and on-court dominance were pivotal in their turnaround and successful title defense against the Phoenix Mercury.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have formally backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum. The plan, endorsed at the party conference in Aberdeen, stipulates that winning a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election will be considered a mandate to negotiate a new vote. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path, mirroring the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. An alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto referendum on independence itself was rejected in favor of Swinney's more conventional strategy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 12:46:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young consumers, often referred to as Gen Z, are pushing back against the "fast furniture" industry by opting for secondhand and vintage items. This trend is driven by an increased awareness of the environmental impact of cheap, mass-produced decor, which contributes to millions of tons of waste annually. Like its "fast fashion" counterpart, fast furniture is designed for short-term trends rather than durability, making it difficult to repair or recycle. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace and a surge in searches for "secondhand decor" on Pinterest indicate a cultural shift towards sustainability, affordability, and the desire for unique pieces with a personal story.</p>

          <p>Tomaino Hermine Patricia Ndam Njoya is one of 12 candidates, and the only woman, running for president in Cameroon, challenging the 43-year rule of 92-year-old President Paul Biya. As the mayor of Foumban and leader of the Democratic Union for Cameroon (UDC), Ndam Njoya is campaigning on a platform of "Freedom. Justice. Progress." to lead the nation into a new era. Despite facing a divided opposition and a deeply entrenched incumbent, she has gained the endorsement of a dozen former presidential candidates. Her candidacy is seen as a notable development in a country where women are underrepresented in high-level politics.</p>

          <p>Following the start of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are returning to their devastated homes in Gaza as humanitarian aid efforts are expected to increase. The deal involves the release of 48 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners from Israel, with transfers already underway. Meanwhile, a top U.S. Navy commander visited the region to discuss assistance, and a White House envoy praised President Trump's role at a rally in Tel Aviv. Tensions remain high, however, as an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed at least one person, and pro-Palestinian solidarity rallies were held in major European cities.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) in North America to advance their careers and gain national team recognition. Players like Nashville SC's Patrick Yazbek are finding that the league offers a high level of competition and visibility, serving as a springboard to the Australian national team, the Socceroos. The trend extends beyond players to coaching and conditioning staff, who find professional opportunities that may be limited in Australia's domestic A-League. As MLS shifts its strategy to develop and sell young talent, it is increasingly seen as a viable and attractive pathway for promising Australian players.</p>

          <p>According to BlackRock, a significant trend among investors this year involves moving capital from traditional, broad technology sector funds into more targeted, AI-specific exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Jay Jacobs, the firm's head of U.S. equity ETFs, noted that investors are seeking more granular exposure to the entire AI ecosystem, from semiconductor manufacturing to large language models. He highlighted funds like BlackRock's iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI) as beneficiaries of this shift. Additionally, Jacobs pointed to strong investor interest in blockchain technology, particularly surrounding Ethereum, as another key thematic investment area. (not investment advice)</p>

Others, like New York's Metrograph, have found success as for-profit businesses by offering a premium experience with a restaurant, bar, and bookstore.

Berkshire has been actively increasing its holdings, with recent disclosures showing its stakes in Mitsui and Mitsubishi have surpassed 10%.
