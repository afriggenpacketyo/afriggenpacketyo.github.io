          <p>Chinese media reported that President Trump and President Xi Jinping held a phone call to discuss trade relations between the two countries. The call occurred amidst ongoing trade tensions and accusations of breached agreements between Washington and Beijing. This conversation is considered a potential step towards de-escalating the trade war that has threatened global trade flows. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment, leaving the specifics of the discussion undisclosed, however, the discussion has been widely seen as an endorsement for de-escalating the trade war. The tone of the call remains undisclosed, so a full evaluation of the call is difficult. Optimism surrounding the resolution of US-China trade tensions is cautiously positive.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, an Egyptian national accused of attacking demonstrators in Colorado. The order came after the family was taken into custody by ICE agents, with the Department of Homeland Security initiating removal proceedings.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit saw a significant reduction in April, primarily due to a sharp decrease in imports following President Trump's escalation of tariffs. The trade gap fell by more than half, registering at approximately $61 billion compared to $140 billion the previous month. Imports dropped by 16% as trade barriers took effect, though some firms had previously stockpiled supply in anticipation of the levies. While Trump views tariffs as a means to reduce the nation's trade deficit, many economists argue that the deficit reflects the consumer-driven nature of the U.S. economy. The long-term effects of these trade policies remain to be seen.</p>

          <p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) has endorsed democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. Mamdani, a city assemblyman, is challenging former New York governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary. AOC praised Mamdani's ability to build a coalition of working-class New Yorkers, while Mamdani criticized Cuomo for being beholden to wealthy donors. Cuomo, in turn, attacked Mamdani as being too young and inexperienced. The endorsement highlights the ongoing ideological battle within the Democratic party.</p>

This change, set to take effect in September 2026, aims to help families who need it most and is considered a down payment on child poverty. The government has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, and the move is expected to lift 100,000 children out of poverty.

However, traffic remains below the average of 72-75 ships per day seen before the Houthi attacks began in November 2023. The mission, tasked with safeguarding navigation and monitoring illegal arms shipments, has provided close protection to 476 ships and shot down 18 drones. Despite the increased traffic, the commander cannot guarantee that merchant ships won't be attacked, and some companies are deterred by the mission's limited capacity.</p>
