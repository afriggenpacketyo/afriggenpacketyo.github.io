          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary on President Trump's 79th birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade is expected to feature over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the FAA. Abrams tanks will also be part of the event, with metal plates laid down to protect the streets from damage. While the White House claims the cost will be shared, the event has drawn criticism from Democrats who view it as a wasteful display of ego.</p>

          <p>The Illinois House has passed legislation mandating more comprehensive background checks for police officers before hiring, spurred by the Sonya Massey killing. This article details how the bill, sponsored by state Rep. Kam Buckner, requires law enforcement agencies to inspect prior employment records of applicants, including conduct and fitness-for-duty examinations. The legislation aims to prevent situations like the hiring of Sean Grayson, who was charged with first-degree murder in Massey's death, despite documented concerns about his conduct at previous police jobs. The bill now heads to Gov. JB Pritzker's desk after unanimous Senate approval.</p>

          <p>Washington Elementary STEM magnet school in Pasadena, California, is planting trees and creating green spaces to enhance childhood development, addressing unequal access to parks and green spaces in Los Angeles County. Amigos de los Rios, a local non-profit, is leading the effort to transform the school's paved environment into an outdoor classroom with native plants, vegetable gardens, and climate-resilient trees. Studies show that green spaces reduce stress, encourage physical activity, and improve academic performance, making this initiative crucial for the health and well-being of students from low-income households.</p>

          <p>As pressure mounts to eliminate artificial food coloring in the United States, companies are exploring natural alternatives derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers, and even insects. This Los Angeles Times article explains how Sensient Technologies Corp., a major dye manufacturer, is helping food companies transition to natural colors, with the federal government planning to persuade companies to eliminate artificial colors by 2026. However, making the switch is not easy, quick, or cheap, as natural dyes are less consistent, less stable, and more expensive than their synthetic counterparts. The article also details how some companies are already making the switch to varying degrees of success.</p>
