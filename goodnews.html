          <p>This article details how Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney with a Ph.D. in biology, pioneered the use of investigative genetic genealogy to solve major crimes. Initially a hobby, her work led to the 2018 identification and capture of the notorious Golden State Killer, Joseph James DeAngelo. The technique involves building family trees from DNA evidence uploaded to public genealogy websites, a method she also used to identify a living Jane Doe who had been kidnapped as a child. Despite privacy concerns, this forensic tool is now widely used by law enforcement, leading to breakthroughs in numerous cold cases.</p>

          <p>The UK's transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric cars cheaper to purchase, with details expected later this week. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct subsidies, the plan aims to address the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier for many motorists. The government also announced a £88 million package to expand charging infrastructure, including installing "cross-pavement gullies" for homes without driveways. This initiative is part of the UK's strategy to meet its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Women's basketball hall-of-famer Nancy Lieberman has publicly called on WNBA players to "embrace" the attention Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark is bringing to the league. She argued that any jealousy or pettiness towards Clark, who she called the best guard in the league, is counterproductive to the sport's growth. Lieberman compared Clark's impact to that of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, suggesting that her popularity benefits all players by increasing revenue and visibility for the entire WNBA. She encouraged players to celebrate each other's successes to collectively elevate the sport.</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks must become more "self-centred" and develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He contends that many Chinese universities are still too reliant on Western academic frameworks for their social science and policy analysis. Zheng believes that by focusing on empirical research derived from China's own practical experiences, think tanks can better explain the nation's policies and predict its future trajectory. This shift is presented as essential for creating authentic narratives about China.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, the 72-year-old woman who gained international acclaim for waiving her anonymity to testify against her husband, has been awarded the Legion of Honour, France's highest distinction. Her husband was convicted for drugging her and inviting dozens of men to sexually assault her over a decade. Pelicot's powerful testimony and her stated desire to make "shame swap sides" from the victim to the perpetrator inspired people worldwide. French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to her courage, and her lawyer announced that a memoir detailing her story will be published next year.</p>

          <p>A retrospective art exhibition in New York City is celebrating the work of Dutch-American painter Joop Sanders, who was the last surviving member of the original Abstract Expressionist movement when he died in 2023 at 101. Curated by his granddaughter, Isca Greenfield-Sanders, the show highlights his significant contributions to the first major homegrown American art movement. Sanders was a contemporary of Willem and Elaine de Kooning and participated in the landmark 9th Street Show of 1951. The exhibit serves as a reintroduction of his influential work to the world, showcasing his dynamic and humanistic style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist who studies relationships, couples in the happiest partnerships practice five key habits during the work week that many others neglect. These include establishing a brief morning routine together, sending thoughtful check-in messages during the day, and taking individual time to de-stress after work before reconnecting. Additionally, they prioritize a daily, distraction-free period of "us time" and end each day with a quick, quiet check-in to maintain emotional alignment. These small, intentional rituals are crucial for fostering intimacy and connection, especially during busy periods.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, have reportedly docked in geostationary orbit, potentially marking a historic achievement in autonomous satellite servicing. According to US-based space-tracking firm COMSPOC, the two spacecraft appeared "visually merged" for several days in early July after conducting a series of close-proximity maneuvers. This event suggests China may have successfully completed an in-orbit refueling mission, a complex technological feat that enhances the longevity and capability of space assets. The operation was closely monitored by US surveillance satellites, highlighting the strategic importance of this advanced space technology.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Analysis confirmed its origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking probe. Representing nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet, its size and rarity make it an exceptionally valuable item for collectors.</p>

          <p>Researchers conducting a sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River have accidentally discovered a previously unknown shipwreck believed to be the L.W. Crane, a vessel that sank in 1880. The team from the Wisconsin Historical Society was mapping the river bottom for other known cultural sites when they found the partially buried 90-foot hull. The L.W. Crane was a wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in Oshkosh over 140 years ago. This unexpected find highlights the potential for new archaeological discoveries, even in well-traveled waterways.</p>

          <p>An article querying ChatGPT about car reliability found that the AI identified Toyota as the most dependable brand, a conclusion that aligns with established industry sources like Consumer Reports and J.D. Power. The AI highlighted Toyota's reputation for longevity, low average annual repair costs ($441 compared to a $652 industry average), and strong resale value as key factors. Honda, Subaru, and Mazda were also noted as reliable alternatives. In contrast, luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz were cited as generally less reliable due to their complex engineering and higher maintenance expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully developed a biotransformation system that can turn methanol, an alcohol derivable from carbon dioxide, into sucrose, or white sugar. This breakthrough, achieved at the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, offers a potential pathway to convert captured carbon into food without relying on traditional agriculture. The enzyme-based process bypasses the need for land and water-intensive crops like sugar cane. The researchers state this "artificial conversion" strategy could help address both environmental challenges and global food security, contributing to carbon neutrality goals.</p>

          <p>Following years of patients sharing experiences of painful IUD insertions, the medical community is now taking the issue more seriously. The CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recently issued recommendations urging doctors to discuss and provide pain management options, a shift from past practices where pain was often minimized. Options now being considered more widely include topical anesthetics and nerve-blocking injections. This change reflects a broader movement to address the historical dismissal of women's pain in medicine and improve the patient experience for this popular contraceptive method.</p>
