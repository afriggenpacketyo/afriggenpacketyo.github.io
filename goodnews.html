        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.2 billion for Monday night's drawing, marking the fifth-largest prize ever in the game's history, with an estimated cash value of $498.4 million. This surge follows no winner in Saturday's $1 billion drawing, though nine tickets matched five white balls to win $1 million, and three Power Play tickets won $2 million. No one has claimed the jackpot since May 31, contributing to its massive growth. The next opportunity to win this life-changing sum will be in Wednesday's drawing, with tickets available across 45 states and other U.S. territories.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 23:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers from the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre have developed a compact, detergent-free washing machine designed to address the challenges of laundry in space, where water is a scarce resource. This cube-shaped device, slightly larger than a carry-on suitcase and weighing 12kg, utilizes only 400ml of water per cycle, delivered as an ultra-fine mist through ultrasonic atomization. Instead of traditional detergent, the machine employs ultraviolet light to produce ozone, a powerful disinfectant that sterilizes clothes for up to five wears. This innovation represents a significant step towards more sustainable and comfortable long-duration space travel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded with mixed results as investors closely monitored the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting of leaders in Tianjin and weighed the impact of new tariff concerns. This uncertainty was heightened by a recent U.S. federal appeals court ruling that declared most of former President Donald Trump's global tariffs illegal. India's markets were particularly scrutinized after Trump stated India offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. imports to zero, criticizing the existing "one sided" trade relationship. While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 experienced a decline, reflecting diverse regional responses to these geopolitical and economic developments.</p>
