          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, has publicly stated that the central bank's monetary policy must remain "fully independent of political influence." His comments come amid President Trump's repeated pressure on the current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, to cut interest rates, raising concerns about White House overreach. Hassett warned that historical examples show political control over central banks often leads to inflation and economic hardship. The statement underscores a critical debate within the administration about the proper role and autonomy of the nation's central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her US Open title, defeating Amanda Anisimova to win her fourth major championship. This victory is presented as a testament to her mental growth, particularly after a difficult loss in the French Open final earlier in the year. Sabalenka reflected on learning to control her emotions under pressure, a key factor in her consistent high-level performance, having now reached at least the semifinals in 11 of her last 12 Grand Slams. At 27, she has solidified her position as a dominant force in women's tennis, with her next challenge being to replicate her hard-court success on other surfaces.</p>

          <p>The reunited British rock band Oasis performed a sold-out show at the Rose Bowl, marking a significant stop on their first tour in over 15 years. The concert was characterized by a powerful sense of collective catharsis, with tens of thousands of fans singing along emotionally to classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova." Despite the Gallagher brothers' famously contentious history, the performance focused on the music's unifying power, creating an experience centered as much on the audience as the band. The event has been compared to major cultural touchstones like Taylor Swift's Eras tour for its ability to foster real-world connection.</p>

          <p>At the Italian Grand Prix, a strategic decision by McLaren overshadowed Max Verstappen's victory, highlighting the team's commitment to fairness in the tight intra-team title fight between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. After a slow pit stop for Norris caused him to lose his second-place position to Piastri, the team instructed Piastri to let his teammate pass, restoring the original order. Team Principal Andrea Stella defended the call as consistent with McLaren's "racing principles," even as it sparked on-air disagreement from Piastri. This incident showcases the unique, non-acrimonious culture McLaren is fostering while managing two top-tier, competitive drivers.</p>

          <p>John L. Burton, a towering figure in California politics for over six decades, has passed away at the age of 92. Known for his pro-labor stance, colorful language, and passionate advocacy for the underprivileged, Burton served in the Assembly, Congress, and as the powerful leader of the state Senate. Alongside his brother Phillip and Willie Brown, he was a key architect of the Democratic machine that dominated San Francisco and state politics. After overcoming addiction, he returned to public service, championing causes like foster youth rights and presiding over the California Democratic Party's rise to supermajority dominance.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached for the release of approximately 300 South Korean nationals who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. The raid, part of the Trump administration's nationwide anti-immigration campaign, has strained diplomatic relations between the two allies, particularly as it occurred shortly after leaders met to discuss trade and investment. South Korean officials expressed that it was "lamentable" that the raid unfolded at a critical time for bilateral cooperation. The workers will be flown home on a chartered flight once administrative procedures are complete.</p>

          <p>In the third one-day international cricket match, England secured a record-breaking 342-run victory against South Africa. The win was highlighted by a breakout performance from 21-year-old Jacob Bethell, who scored his first professional century with an elegant 110 runs, supported by Joe Root's 100. Following the strong batting performance, which set a total of 414-5, bowler Jofra Archer devastated the South African lineup, taking four wickets in a hostile opening spell. Although the series was already lost, the dominant performance served as a significant morale boost for the English team.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of government data reveals large disparities in lottery spending among US states, with Massachusetts residents spending the most at an average of $915 per year. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually, a difference potentially attributed to easier access in more urbanized states. For many states, lotteries represent a significant source of revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of general funds and reaching as high as 3% in states like Rhode Island and West Virginia. This data comes as the Powerball jackpot recently swelled to nearly $1.8 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

The Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, stated that "tens of millions of phones successfully sounded," calling the test an important step in public safety. The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening events like severe weather or public safety emergencies. Public events, including sporting matches and theatre performances, paused or made announcements to accommodate the nationwide alert, which was largely successful despite some minor reported glitches.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that while the recent elimination of the "de minimis" tariff exemption will hurt some small businesses, the widespread panic is likely misdirected. The author points out that the majority of the 33 million small businesses in the U.S. are service-based and do not import goods, meaning they will be unaffected by this specific policy change. The larger concern, according to the analysis, should be the overall health of the economy and consumer spending power. As long as incomes and wealth continue to grow, the economy can likely absorb the price increases caused by tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
