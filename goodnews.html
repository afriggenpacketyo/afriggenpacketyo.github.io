          <p>Taiwan's coast guard has requested additional funding to enhance coastal surveillance after several undetected landings by mainland Chinese individuals in inflatable boats. The request follows incidents where mainland residents crossed the Taiwan Strait, landing on sensitive shores used for military exercises. The coast guard confirmed the authenticity of a viral video showing a man claiming to have crossed the strait, raised a Chinese flag, and returned, though investigations are ongoing to determine the specifics of the crossing. Authorities are assessing the feasibility of such crossings and bolstering surveillance to prevent future breaches of Taiwan's coastal defenses.</p>

          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, claims to have broken the world record for running across Australia, completing the 3,800km journey in 35 days. Goodge ran the equivalent of two-and-a-half marathons daily, starting from Cottesloe Beach in Perth and finishing at Bondi Beach. The run raised money for cancer charities in memory of his mother, who died from cancer in 2018. The record is pending verification by Guinness World Records, while some in the running community have questioned the accuracy of data tracking his speed and heart rate.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its influence in Latin America by offering financial support, infrastructure investments, and visa exemptions, contrasting with what is seen as President Trump's negative approach to the region. Xi Jinping announced a $9.1 billion credit line and visa-free entry for tourists from several Latin American countries during a summit with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). This strategy positions China as a reliable partner, promoting free trade and multilateralism, while Trump's policies are viewed as protectionist and disrespectful towards the region. China's engagement includes inviting Latin American politicians to study its governance model, raising concerns about promoting autocracy.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has defended farm minister Taku Eto, despite criticism over remarks about receiving ample rice from supporters and not needing to buy any amid rising rice prices. Eto apologized for the insensitive comments but insisted on continuing his work to lower rice prices. Opposition parties have called for Eto's resignation, arguing that he is out of touch with the public's concerns about the high cost of the staple food.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly adopting AI technology to address labor shortages and boost production, despite concerns among artists about copyright infringement. Japan's copyright act allows the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models without the copyright holder's consent, aiming to attract AI investors. While many artists worry about job losses, some studios are using AI to assist with coloring, background generation, and converting photos into anime, significantly reducing production time. The cultural acceptance of technology and the need to fill labor gaps are driving the integration of AI in anime production, though debates about copyright protection continue.</p>

The recovered items include documents, photographs, and handwritten letters from Cohen's time as an undercover agent in Syria. Cohen's intelligence work is credited with helping Israel win the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, also known as the Six-Day War. The recovery, a joint effort between the Mossad and an allied foreign government, is seen as a symbolic moment of unity in Israel, though the location of Cohen's remains is still unknown.</p>
