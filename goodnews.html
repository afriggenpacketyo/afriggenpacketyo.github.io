          <p>The 190th Oktoberfest in Munich has concluded after a two-week period that drew 6.5 million visitors, who consumed an equivalent 6.5 million liters of beer. Organizers described the event as a "roller-coaster," starting with record-high temperatures but later experiencing temporary closures due to overcrowding and a significant disruption from a bomb scare. Despite these challenges, the festival was characterized by a positive and celebratory atmosphere. Officials noted that about 21% of attendees were international visitors, primarily from the US, Italy, and the UK.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a recent interview, addressed the routine protests and serious threats she has faced since joining the court, stating that she is not afraid and refuses to let them disrupt her emotionally or influence her work. She reflected on how she has learned to be "businesslike" about protests, a stark contrast to how she imagined she would react before her appointment. Barrett emphasized her commitment to an originalist interpretation of the Constitution, similar to her mentor Justice Antonin Scalia, and strives to separate her judicial decisions from personal emotions or political pressures, including in cases involving former President Trump.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is undertaking a massive nationwide search for sites to build its next-generation "Stargate" AI data centers, essential for training more powerful language models. Keith Heyde, the company's head of infrastructure, is leading the effort, which has narrowed down around 800 applications to about 20 potential sites in advanced review. The primary criteria for selection are access to immense power, the ability to scale rapidly, and strong community support, with tax incentives playing a smaller role. The project, backed by a potential $100 billion investment from Nvidia, highlights the critical importance of physical infrastructure in the race for AI dominance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Across the world, from refugee camps in Bangladesh to war-torn areas in Gaza and Ukraine, children are using play as an essential tool to cope with trauma and instability. Psychologists note that play helps children manage stress, express emotions, and reclaim a sense of normalcy in chaotic environments. In Bangladesh, Rohingya refugee children use jump ropes made of rubber bands, while in Ukraine, some engage in make-believe war games to process the conflict around them. These activities are not just pastimes but critical lifelines that foster resilience, cultural connection, and moments of joy amidst profound hardship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fire department in Wiesbaden, Germany, was repeatedly dispatched on Saturday to investigate suspected gas leaks that turned out to be the potent smell of durian fruit. The odor, emanating from an Asian supermarket within a shopping center, was distributed by the building's ventilation system, causing concern among visitors. Despite the lack of any gas connection to the building, emergency services were called to the location twice. A separate, similar incident occurred in a residential building the same evening, where a resident's durian fruit was identified as the source of a gas-like smell in the staircase.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming Tax Law Changes May Influence Strategies for Year-End Charitable Donations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that tax changes enacted under President Donald Trump could alter strategies for charitable giving, particularly as year-end approaches. A key change starting in 2026 will introduce a new charitable tax break of up to $2,000 for married couples who do not itemize their deductions, potentially making it advantageous for some to delay smaller gifts until the new year. Conversely, higher earners may face a reduced benefit from their donations in 2026 due to a new deduction floor and a cap for top-bracket filers, creating an incentive to accelerate giving in 2025, possibly through donor-advised funds.

          <p>China has successfully conducted its first manned deep-sea dive beneath the Arctic polar ice, a milestone achieved during its 15th and largest-ever scientific expedition to the region. The operation was also the world's first coordinated mission involving both crewed and uncrewed submersibles in a polar environment. The expedition, which involved multiple research vessels and icebreakers, allowed scientists to collect hundreds of deep-sea samples. Researchers also gathered extensive data on the Arctic's biodiversity, hydrology, and water chemistry to better understand the changing polar environment.</p>

          <p>The podcast "I've Had It," hosted by Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan from Oklahoma City, has emerged as a significant voice in liberal media, offering a sharp-tongued and often profane counterpoint to the right-wing media landscape. Initially an entertainment show, the podcast pivoted to politics, gaining millions of followers and attracting high-profile Democratic guests like Barack Obama and Kamala Harris. The hosts, who describe themselves as "two middle-aged women in the buckle of the bible belt," use humor and direct, unfiltered language to critique conservatives and sometimes challenge their own party, resonating with an audience seeking an authentic and aggressive liberal perspective.</p>

          <p>Elvira Alvarado, a 70-year-old Colombian marine biologist known as "the mother of Colombian corals," is pioneering efforts to save the country's endangered reefs using in-vitro fertilization. Witnessing the decline of Caribbean corals for decades due to pollution and rising ocean temperatures, she now leads a team that collects coral eggs and sperm to fertilize them in a lab. The resulting coral hatchlings are raised in nurseries before being transplanted back to the sea, with a focus on reproducing hardier varieties that are more resistant to heat and disease, offering hope for the future of these vital ecosystems.</p>

          <p>The recent, seemingly random explosion of consumer fads like Labubu dolls and Dubai chocolate is a product of our algorithm-mediated world, where trends lack deep cultural connection. Unlike past crazes such as Beanie Babies, which were driven by discernible marketing and economic factors, today's trends are fueled by their ability to capture attention on platforms like TikTok. Visually stimulating items, such as the colorful Labubu or the textured Dubai chocolate, are perfectly suited to make users pause while scrolling. This dynamic prioritizes momentary, often infantile, engagement over coherent cultural narratives, reshaping how and why products become popular.</p>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting its strategy from that of well-meaning activists to a more combative and insurgent political force. Polanski, a self-proclaimed "eco-populist," has promised to "pick fights" to gain attention and cut through a splintered political landscape, a style his party has embraced. With membership at an all-time high, the party aims to capitalize on voter disillusionment by being bolder and more direct. The new approach recalibrates their electoral strategy, focusing on simple messaging and emotional appeals to turn growing momentum into actual votes and parliamentary seats.</p>

          <p>The prominent medical publisher BMJ Group has retracted a study that claimed daily doses of apple cider vinegar could lead to significant weight loss. The retraction of the March 2024 study, which had garnered global media attention, was due to "concerns raised about the quality of the work." Nutrition experts, who had long been skeptical of the study's implausible results, were not surprised by the decision. This development is the latest setback for the popular wellness product, which has been endorsed by celebrities but increasingly questioned by scientific and medical institutions for its purported health benefits.</p>

The flag, featuring a grinning skull in a straw hat, represents the show's protagonists, a band of pirates fighting against an oppressive world government. Young protesters who feel unheard and trapped by corrupt systems identify with the anime's core themes of freedom, rebellion, and challenging unjust authority. The symbol's adoption demonstrates how global pop culture can provide a common narrative and a sign of solidarity for youth movements with diverse local grievances.</p>

The author praises how Raquel's story explores her Mexican American heritage and connects compassion across generations. However, the article also critiques Mattel for making Raquel physically resemble a previous Latina doll, Maritza Ochoa, thereby missing an opportunity to represent the diverse appearances of Latinas. The author argues that while the dolls carry powerful messages of compassion and activism, the brand flattened the richness of Latina identity by presenting a narrow physical image.</p>
