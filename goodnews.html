          <p>Japan has initiated direct sales of government rice stockpiles to major retailers, aiming to reduce soaring prices and alleviate pressure on household budgets. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi plans to lower prices to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move bypasses the traditional auction system, allowing the government to have greater control over pricing. The decision comes after public criticism of the government's handling of rising rice prices, which have doubled due to a poor harvest.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the rate detected in 2022. The increase is attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improvements in the company's detection systems. Boosting and member fraud constitute the majority of fake reviews, while paid reviews are considered a smaller but more pernicious category. Tripadvisor employs auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to combat fake reviews, and penalizes violators by lowering their rankings.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a delay in the implementation of a threatened 50% tariff on goods from the European Union until July 9, providing more time for negotiations. The decision follows a conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a willingness to engage in serious negotiations. Trump had previously threatened to impose the tariffs due to perceived difficulties in trade discussions with the EU. Von der Leyen affirmed the EU's readiness to advance talks quickly to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.</p>
