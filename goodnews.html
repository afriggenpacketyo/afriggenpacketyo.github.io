          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss a potential end to the war with Russia. The meeting was notably more cordial than their previous encounter, with Trump expressing optimism for a lasting peace and pledging "very good protection" for Ukraine, though specifics on security guarantees were not provided. Trump also backed away from a firm ceasefire demand, acknowledging strategic complexities, and indicated he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin following the talks to push for a trilateral summit.</p>

          <p>Reflecting the influence of internet culture on modern language, the Cambridge Dictionary has officially added several new words, including "skibidi," "delulu," "tradwife," and "broligarchy." These terms, largely popularized by Gen Z and Gen Alpha on social media platforms, have entered mainstream discourse, with "delulu" even being used by the Prime Minister of Australia. Lexicographers noted that they only add words that demonstrate staying power, highlighting how online trends are now rapidly shaping the evolution of the English language.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang reflected on his journey from a pre-med student obsessed with TV shows to an Emmy-nominated comedian. He discussed how pop culture served as a crash course in American life after his family moved from Quebec, and how his initial role as a writer at SNL provided a crucial understanding of the show's mechanics. Yang also shared personal anecdotes, including co-hosting the popular podcast "Las Culturistas" and hiding his sister's copy of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" as a teenager.</p>

          <p>Conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the airing of false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The settlement follows a judge's ruling that Newsmax had indeed defamed the company, with the agreement being reached before a jury could determine malice or damages. This resolution comes after Fox News paid a much larger settlement in a similar case, highlighting the significant financial consequences for media outlets that propagated baseless election fraud conspiracies.</p>

In one, two childhood cancer survivors who were treated for leukemia together at age four discovered they were classmates 17 years later on their first day of medical school. In another story, an Arkansas hairstylist's keen observation during a routine appointment led to the early detection of skin cancer on her client's scalp, ultimately saving her life. Both accounts underscore the profound impact of shared experiences and the importance of attentiveness in everyday interactions.</p>

While the move has been successful in attracting big names, it has drawn criticism from doubles specialists who have been pushed out of the draw due to the entry list being based on singles rankings.</p>

A survey found that nearly a third of individuals using the OTC pill Opill had not been using any form of birth control beforehand. The study also showed that users of the prescription-free pill were more likely to be younger, uninsured, and live in rural areas, suggesting it is reducing significant barriers to access. The most common reason for choosing the OTC option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advocate for using dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a simple yet powerful strategy for long-term investors to harness the benefits of compound interest. Instead of receiving cash dividends, a DRIP automatically uses the funds to purchase more shares of the same stock, often including fractional shares. This passive approach ensures money is consistently put to work in an investment the owner already trusts. Over a decade, this strategy significantly boosted the total return of an S&P 500 ETF compared to just its price appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic envisions a specialized police unit in Washington, D.C., tasked with preventing "sandwich-based crimes." The piece humorously imagines the detectives' dismay after a 25-year streak without a sandwich-related incident is broken by a man throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent. Through the detectives' dialogue, the article playfully critiques heavy-handed policing tactics by contrasting them with the unit's supposed community-focused, non-carceral approach to de-escalating situations involving hoagies and paninis. The narrative serves as a commentary on law enforcement priorities and methods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners aged 62 and older, a reverse mortgage can provide access to home equity in retirement, but experts advise that the best time to take one out depends on individual circumstances. Since the loan amount increases with age, waiting until one's 70s can yield more funds and is often better for those committed to aging in place. Homeowners should carefully consider their long-term financial needs, health, and other retirement income sources before tapping into their home equity, as the loan reduces the asset's value for heirs and must be repaid upon moving out.
