          <p>Divers have successfully recovered artifacts from the HMHS Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic, for the first time since it sank in 1916. The vessel, which was serving as a hospital ship during World War I when it struck a mine, lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. The recovered items, including the ship's bell and silver-plated trays, offer a glimpse into both its luxurious design and wartime role and will be conserved for a new museum in Greece.</p>

          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's willingness to let TikTok be banned in the U.S. was the crucial factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent explained that the administration prioritized national security over the deal itself, which he believes "turned the tide" in negotiations. The commercial terms of the deal between parent company ByteDance and new investors have reportedly been settled for months, with a final agreement expected to be formalized soon.</p>

          <p>The article recounts Europe's surprising 1995 Ryder Cup victory at Oak Hill, one of only four times they have won on American soil. Led by captain Bernard Gallacher, the underdog European team overcame internal selection disputes and a day-one deficit to stage a dramatic Sunday comeback. Key moments, including Philip Walton securing the final point and Nick Faldo's pivotal win over Curtis Strange, cemented the event as a memorable upset in Ryder Cup history, which was broadcast live by Sky Sports for the first time.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens, restoring full access to the Visa Waiver Program after Hungary addressed key security vulnerabilities. The previous administration had limited the validity of travel authorizations for Hungarian passport holders due to concerns over a simplified naturalization process that granted citizenship to nearly a million people without adequate vetting. This move, which allows for two-year, multiple-entry travel authorizations, signals a significant warming of diplomatic relations between Washington and Budapest.</p>

          <p>With average mortgage rates dropping to their lowest levels since late 2024, homeowners are increasingly considering refinancing their loans. Experts suggest that individuals with current rates above 7% should begin exploring their options, as even a small reduction can lower monthly payments and improve cash flow. While rates may fall further, waiting carries the risk of missing out on current savings, and a cash-out refinance could also be a strategic tool for consolidating high-interest debt.

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, many workers are "hugging" their jobs, with the rate of voluntary departures falling to its lowest level since 2016. Labor economists attribute this trend to a cooling job market, making it harder to find new positions, and employers retaining staff to avoid being caught short-handed. Career experts advise that while staying put can feel safe, employees should avoid complacency by seeking internal growth opportunities and expanding their professional networks to remain valuable and prepared for future opportunities.</p>
