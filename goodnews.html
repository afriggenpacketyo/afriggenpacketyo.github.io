          <p>After a month-long trial, eight out of ten people were convicted in Paris for the 2016 robbery of Kim Kardashian, where millions of dollars worth of jewelry was stolen. The ringleader, Aomar A√Øt Khedache, received the heaviest sentence of eight years, though most of it was suspended, and he will not return to prison due to time already served. Kardashian expressed gratitude to French authorities for pursuing justice and acknowledged the lasting impact of the crime on her and her family. The defendants, dubbed the 'Grandpa robbers' due to their ages, were convicted on charges ranging from direct involvement to complicity, with sentences reflecting their age and health issues.

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily blocked lower court orders requiring the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to provide information to a government watchdog group. The lawsuit tests whether President Trump's cost-cutting task force must comply with federal public records law. The dispute stems from a Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), seeking data about DOGE's operations and personnel. Roberts' stay allows the Supreme Court time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief, delaying deadlines for document turnover and a deposition of DOGE's acting administrator.</p>

          <p>This article outlines key considerations for beginners investing in gold in May 2025, noting gold's reputation as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. It suggests gold ETFs as an efficient entry point, cautioning against physical gold due to high premiums and storage concerns. The article emphasizes that gold prices don't always rise predictably with economic instability and advises a long-term perspective, treating gold as a portfolio hedge rather than a quick profit source. Finally, it warns of scams and inflated premiums, urging investors to conduct thorough research and work with reputable dealers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Paris court found eight individuals guilty in connection with the armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in 2016, during which millions of dollars worth of jewelry was stolen. The robbers, known as the ‚Äúgrandpa robbers‚Äù due to their age, received prison sentences ranging from three to eight years, with most of the terms suspended. Kardashian testified earlier this month that she feared for her life during the robbery, which prompted her to increase her private security. The reality TV star stated she was grateful to French authorities for pursuing justice in the case, and the court's ruling was satisfactory.</p>

          <p>Dave Nadig, an ETF expert, predicts a massive increase in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due to SEC rule changes allowing mutual fund managers to offer ETF share classes. He estimates the number of ETFs could surge from 4,000 to over 7,000 within a month, creating a significant challenge for investors to navigate the expanded market. While many new ETFs will be traditional asset allocation products, Nadig advises caution with new, straight-to-ETF strategies, particularly those involving illiquid assets like private credit. Nadig emphasizes that investors need to do thorough research to make informed decisions amidst the growing complexity of the ETF landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Jersey is preparing for its gubernatorial elections this year, with hotly contested primaries in June that could signal the country's mood ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Experts say the race will test the potential Democratic backlash against the Trump administration and indicate shifting partisan allegiances in New Jersey. The Democratic primary features six candidates, while Republicans are hoping to flip the governorship red, with Trump endorsing Jack Ciattarelli. Issues at stake include immigration enforcement, housing costs, and general affordability, which are dividing Americans and will likely take center stage in the midterms.</p>

Federal officials alleged that the Bobcat fire ignited when trees not properly maintained by Edison and its contractor came into contact with power lines. The settlement does not include an admission of wrongdoing by Edison, and the funds will help rehabilitate burned areas and restore wildlife habitats.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has created a 'Survey of Surveys' to identify and eliminate U.S. government surveys, raising concerns about bypassing OMB oversight. This effort duplicates OMB's existing review of federal surveys and may violate laws requiring the government to report statistics produced by canceled surveys. DOGE claims to have already terminated five 'wasteful' surveys, criticizing questions about internet usage and alcohol consumption. The 'Survey of Surveys' warns agencies of 'adverse actions' for non-participation, sparking criticism for its heavy-handed approach and potential disregard for federal law.</p>

          <p>Despite a Supreme Court ruling against a religious charter school in Oklahoma, conservatives may still achieve their goals through a growing school voucher movement. The House passed legislation that could create a federal school voucher program, setting aside $5 billion to fund vouchers for families to pay for private education, including religious schools. The program is structured as a tax credit, offering a dollar-for-dollar tax write-off for donations to nonprofits that grant private-education scholarships. While voucher advocates once focused on low-income students, they are now pushing for vouchers for most everyone, with the support of wealthy donors.</p>

          <p>The Republican-backed budget bill includes tax rules that could significantly impact workers who earn tips or overtime pay. The 'No Tax on Tips' provision would create a new tax deduction, eliminating federal income taxes on tips for qualifying workers earning less than $160,000 annually. Similarly, the bill includes a tax break for workers receiving overtime pay, allowing them to claim a deduction on their taxes. However, there are restrictions, including the requirement for workers and their spouses to have Social Security numbers. Some experts argue that these tax breaks may disproportionately benefit higher-paid workers, while low-income workers may not see any benefit. (not investment advice)</p>
