          <p>Former President Trump reportedly told the children of Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of "Chrisley Knows Best," that he would pardon their parents, who are currently serving prison sentences for bank fraud and tax evasion. The couple was convicted in 2022 for submitting false financial statements to obtain over $30 million in loans and concealing income from the IRS. Trump stated he felt they received "pretty harsh treatment." Their daughter, Savannah, had been seeking a pardon, claiming they were unfairly targeted due to their celebrity status, comparing their case to Trump's legal troubles.</p>

          <p>A federal judge struck down an executive order targeting the U.S. law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional, marking the third time this month a judge has rejected Trump's law firm edicts. The order against WilmerHale, which previously employed Robert Mueller, was seen as part of a broader effort by the president to target perceived adversaries. Judge Richard Leon wrote that allowing the order to stand would be unfaithful to the judgment and vision of the Founding Fathers, affirming the importance of an independent judiciary and bar.</p>

          <p>A new Covid variant, NB.1.8.1, is spreading across the U.S. following a surge in China, although federal tracking dashboards may not reflect this. The variant, an omicron offshoot, has been detected in multiple states, with the WHO designating it as a variant under monitoring. The WHO says current data do not indicate that this variant leads to more severe illness than other variants in circulation. Experts also say currently-approved Covid shots are expected to remain effective against this variant and protect against severe disease.</p>
