          <p>Brazilian police thwarted a planned bomb attack at Lady Gaga's free concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, where over two million people gathered. The suspects, who identified as Lady Gaga fans, were arrested for spreading hate speech and radicalizing teenagers online, including promoting self-harm. Authorities seized electronic devices and materials in multiple states, following a tip about online groups encouraging violence using coded language. The concert, funded by the city to revitalize Rio's economy, featured heavy security with 5,000 officers, metal detectors, drones, and facial recognition cameras. Lady Gaga performed Brazil-themed acts, expressing her gratitude to the emotional crowd after a decade since her last performance in the country.</p>

          <p>Active management is staging a comeback in the market as investors are increasingly trading the market rather than using index funds. There have been net inflows into active equity ETFs while index funds experienced net outflows. A record number of ETFs have launched this year, and active ETFs now rival index ETFs in number, taking over one-third of investor flows this year. Experts advise investors to remain invested and avoid panic trading, as time in the market is more important than timing the market. (not investment advice)</p>

Zhao aims to become China's first world champion in snooker. He won the UK Championship in 2021 but served a 20-month ban for match-fixing. He is hoping to join Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy as the only qualifiers to land snooker's biggest prize since the tournament's 1977 move to South Yorkshire. He showcased his skill with breaks of 51 and 77 in the first frame, followed by a century in the second and finished the session with another century and a break of 83.</p>
