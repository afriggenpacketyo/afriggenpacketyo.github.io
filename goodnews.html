          <p>Shares of Chinese tech company Xiaomi surged after the launch of its new electric SUV, the YU7, which is priced to undercut Tesla's popular Model Y. The company reported receiving over 200,000 orders within minutes of the launch, signaling strong consumer interest in the competitive EV market. While the YU7 boasts a longer driving range than its Tesla counterpart, it reportedly falls short in driver-assist technology. The launch is part of Xiaomi's broader expansion into new product categories, including AI-connected glasses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it is retiring its infamous "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD) after more than four decades as the face of critical Windows system errors. The change is part of a broader effort to improve system resilience, partly in response to the major 2024 Crowdstrike IT outage. The new error screen will feature a black background and a more simplified message, aiming to make unexpected restarts less jarring for users. This updated user interface is scheduled to roll out with the Windows 11 (version 24H2) update later this summer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signaled that the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, set to expire on July 9, could be extended. A White House spokesperson stated the deadline is "not critical," suggesting flexibility as negotiations with key trading partners, including Japan, continue. The pause applies to country-specific tariffs under the administration's reciprocal trade framework but does not affect the baseline 10% duty on global imports. This development comes as Japan's top negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks, with Japan particularly concerned about the high tariffs imposed on its automotive industry.

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers made a series of trades to move up in the second round of the NBA draft, ultimately selecting Adou Thiero from the University of Arkansas at pick number 36. To acquire the pick, the Lakers first traded their 55th pick and cash to the Bulls for the 45th pick, then sent that pick and more cash to the Timberwolves. The 6-foot-8 Thiero is described as a "super athletic wing" who can address the team's need for athleticism alongside its star players.

          <p>A large, bright meteor, also known as a fireball, streaked across the sky over the southeastern U.S. before exploding above Georgia. NASA reported that the meteor, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. It disintegrated at an altitude of 27 miles, releasing energy equivalent to 20 tons of TNT and creating a pressure wave that resulted in audible booms on the ground.

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city vulnerable to the "Urban Heat Island" effect, a local environmental group is testing solutions on a single "cool block." The initiative, led by GreenRoots, aims to combat extreme temperatures by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. These measures are designed to cool dense urban areas that can be up to 20 degrees hotter than greener neighborhoods. This project serves as a real-world laboratory for strategies that could be replicated in other cities facing rising temperatures due to climate change.</p>

In an opinion piece, he explains that the 1994 addition of Asperger's disorder, a milder condition, vastly broadened the spectrum and led to overdiagnosis, which was further fueled by the internet and the link between diagnosis and educational services. He is speaking out now to counter what he calls conspiracy theories from figures like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who incorrectly link the rise to vaccines.</p>
