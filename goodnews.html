          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz is leaving his White House post to be nominated as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepping in as interim National Security Advisor. This decision came after concerns that Waltz did not adequately vet NSC staff and due to the Signal chat controversy, where sensitive information was shared inappropriately. President Trump respects Waltz and wanted to give him a high-profile position rather than an unceremonious ousting. Waltz's nomination requires Senate confirmation, and Rubio will maintain his role as Secretary of State while serving as interim advisor.</p>

Following a report on poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, nearly ¬£100 million was invested annually to improve maternity services. However, new changes mean only ¬£2 million of that funding is guaranteed for maternity care this year, with the rest allocated to Integrated Care Boards for local spending decisions. Campaigners and the Royal College of Midwives have condemned the move as a betrayal and a wrecking ball to maternity safety.</p>

          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall may become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding program, the cat was moved to Germany's Black Forest for monitoring in an enclosure. The goal is to assess her survival skills and suitability for rewilding, which aims to increase genetic diversity among lynx populations in central Europe. The key factor will be the lynx's interaction with humans, ensuring it does not seek out human contact.</p>
