        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with rising grocery prices, consumers are increasingly turning to generic or store-brand products. Experts suggest that these brands often offer comparable quality to name-brand counterparts, especially for staples like pasta and canned goods. Nutritional differences between generic and name-brand items are often minimal, with similar levels of sodium or sugar. By focusing on flavor balancing and intentional cooking, shoppers can create great meals using budget-friendly generic ingredients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully extracted rubidium directly from salt lake brine on a commercial scale, potentially reducing China's reliance on imports. The new industrial-scale method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations. Rubidium is a strategically important metal used in electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace, with applications ranging from solar cells to atomic clocks. This breakthrough offers a new domestic source for a strategically vital material.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Canada for the G7 summit offers an opportunity to improve strained relations between the two countries. Tensions arose after Canada accused Indian government agents of assassinating Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen. Despite the ongoing investigation and differing views on Sikh activism, both countries recognize the importance of stabilizing their relationship, especially in areas of trade and people-to-people ties. The meeting could lead to a mutually agreeable resolution of outstanding issues.</p>

The paper's editor, Claudio Cerasa, views AI as a new colleague that needs to be looked after, emphasizing that AI should augment rather than replace human intelligence. The newspaper is transparent about its use of AI, clearly labeling AI-written articles. Cerasa believes AI is good at research, summarizing, and sometimes writing, but lacks the ability to find news, develop sources, or have interesting ideas about the world.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong can play a critical role in the internationalization of mainland China's currency by expanding its offshore liquidity, according to HSBC's co-CEO David Liao. As a financial hub connecting East and West, Hong Kong can facilitate the orderly opening of mainland China's capital markets. The yuan is currently the third most used currency for global trade finance, but still accounts for a relatively small percentage of the total. Hong Kong could further scale up yuan-denominated trade finance to promote its international ascent. (not investment advice)</p>

Copenhagen has also broken ground on a human-made island, Lynetteholm, to protect the city against storm surges.

          <p>Deconstruction, the practice of taking apart buildings piece by piece, is gaining traction as a climate solution. It creates a circular economy for building materials, reduces waste, and shrinks the carbon footprint of construction. Cities like Portland, Ore., and Boulder, Colo., are leading the way in deconstruction, but challenges remain in establishing the necessary infrastructure and end markets. A few local governments are incentivizing deconstruction practices to promote sustainability.</p>
