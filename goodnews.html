          <p>Following his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, former President Donald Trump stated that terms for a potential Ukraine peace deal, including land swaps and U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine outside of NATO, have been "largely agreed on." In a Fox News interview, Trump asserted that these points were negotiated on behalf of Ukraine and the broader NATO situation, describing the three-hour discussion with Putin as a "very warm meeting." He conveyed a strong sense of optimism, claiming that the two sides are now "pretty close to a deal" to end the ongoing conflict, placing the onus on Ukraine and European allies to finalize it.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has agreed to rescind its order replacing Washington D.C.'s police chief following an emergency court hearing. The city had filed a lawsuit after Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed the head of the DEA as an "emergency police commissioner," effectively seizing control of the Metropolitan Police Department. A federal judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the move, prompting the DOJ to revise its directive. Under the new agreement, Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, while the DEA administrator will act as an intermediary, resolving a tense standoff over federal authority and local autonomy.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) designed to be sold as a condominium, separate from the main property it shares a lot with. This development comes a year after the city enacted a pioneering law to allow such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities amid the state's housing crisis. Officials hope this ADU condominium will serve as a model for other cities, potentially creating a new category of starter homes at a more affordable price point. The initiative is part of a broader trend that has seen ADUs account for approximately one-fifth of California's housing growth in 2024.</p>

The agreement was made with the band's conductor, Bruce Moss, who jokingly suggested the idea in the early 2000s and formalized it in writing. Although Gabriel's declining health prevents him from traveling, he was determined to fulfill his promise and led the band remotely from his home in Virginia. The event celebrated his commitment to his word, with Gabriel stating, "If you sign a contract, you have to fulfill it."</p>

          <p>New research from India is challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes, suggesting the fruit may actually improve metabolic health when consumed in moderation. Two clinical trials found that replacing carbohydrates like white bread with a controlled portion of mango led to smaller post-meal blood sugar fluctuations and improvements in key health markers, including fasting glucose and insulin resistance. The studies emphasize that this is not a license for unlimited consumption but indicates that mangoes, rich in fiber and other nutrients, can be part of a managed diet. Researchers stress the importance of portion control and clinical supervision for individuals with diabetes.</p>

          <p>An iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant celebrating has been reimagined for a new, sprawling mural in Redondo Beach that honors the Los Angeles Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship. Instead of his classic gold Lakers jersey, the mural portrays Bryant wearing a white No. 24 jersey with "Dodgers" in blue script, a creative choice by the artist to thematically link the basketball legend to the baseball team's victory. The artwork, which also features key Dodgers players, is located on the side of a future restaurant. While the alteration has sparked some debate among fans, the artist and restaurant owner say the goal was to celebrate two pillars of L.A. sports culture together.</p>

          <p>China's bubble tea industry has grown into a multi-billion dollar market, with three major chains recently raising over $700 million in Hong Kong IPOs as investors bet on the country's consumer sector.

However, the industry faces significant challenges, including intense price wars, market saturation at home, and the difficulties of replicating its success in overseas markets. Analysts question whether these brands can maintain their high valuations and prove they are a sustainable business rather than a passing fad. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting an American-made electric pickup truck with a minimalist, "open source" design aimed at affordability. The company's strategy is to sell a barebones, two-seat base model and allow owners to customize it with over 100 planned accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, attracting over 100,000 reservations. However, with the rollback of EV incentives, the truck's price will be closer to $28,000, placing it in a more competitive market segment and testing whether its simple, customizable approach remains compelling to consumers.
