          <p>Air quality across the United States is improving as smoke from Canadian wildfires diminishes, although some areas near the Canadian border continue to experience unhealthy air conditions. The Air Quality Index indicates that northern Minnesota, parts of Michigan, and northern New York are still facing unhealthy air, while other areas in the Midwest and Northeast have ratings ranging from good to unhealthy for sensitive groups. While some air quality alerts remain in effect, the overall intensity of the smoke has decreased, and forecasts predict further improvement over the weekend.
