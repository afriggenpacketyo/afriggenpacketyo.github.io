          <p>The Soviet-era Venera mission probe Cosmos 482, which failed to leave Earth's orbit in 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Designed to withstand Venus's harsh atmospheric conditions, the lander may partially survive its re-entry, posing a potential threat if it lands on ground. While most space debris burns up, Cosmos 482 is relatively large, weighing 495 kilograms, and its descent is uncontrolled, but the risk of human injury is low. Russia plans to launch a new mission to Venus, Venera-D, in the early 2030s, signaling a renewed interest in exploring the planet.</p>

          <p>Ofcom has launched investigations into two pornographic websites, Itai Tech Ltd and Score Internet Group LLC, for suspected failings in implementing robust age-checking techniques as required by the UK's Online Safety Act. The regulator claims the sites have failed to detail how they are preventing children from accessing their platforms. Many other services publishing porn content have provided details of effective age assurance methods, or have blocked UK users entirely to prevent children accessing them. Firms found in breach of the Act face significant fines.</p>
