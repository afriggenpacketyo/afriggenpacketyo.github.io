          <p>Japan's health ministry plans to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, to combat the country's declining birthrate, according to the article. The proposal involves fully covering normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes them as they are not considered medical conditions. While the government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen per birth, rising delivery costs often exceed this amount. The move aims to set a unified national price, though obstetricians worry about financial strain due to reduced revenue. </p>

          <p>A new initiative called NeoTest is targeting neonatal sepsis, a common and preventable cause of infant death in developing countries, as the article explains. The project aims to develop a rapid and affordable diagnostic test to improve antibiotic targeting and reduce the high mortality rate associated with this condition. The team behind NeoTest, including global health experts and economists, plans to use an advance market commitment to incentivize manufacturers to produce a better sepsis test. The project is notable for seeking funding primarily from middle-income countries that would directly benefit from the test, highlighting the growing capacity of the Global South to address its own health challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has lifted sanctions on Syria, a move celebrated in Damascus as a chance for the war-torn nation to rebuild, as the article states. The sanctions, in place for 14 years, have crippled the Syrian economy, exacerbating humanitarian crises. Trump's decision, influenced by Saudi Arabia and Turkey, aims to stabilize the country under its new leadership. Lifting sanctions will allow aid agencies to deliver supplies and encourage investment from wealthy neighbors, potentially fostering economic recovery. However, challenges remain, including devastated infrastructure, corruption, and the need for significant international funding.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to Qatar marks a culmination of the Gulf emirate's charm offensive, despite his past criticism of the country as a terrorism funder, according to this New York Times article. The visit includes a potential gift of a luxury jetliner to Trump, sparking ethical and security concerns. Qatar has spent millions on lobbying and hosted the FIFA World Cup to transform its global image. Despite playing a crucial role in mediating between Hamas and Israel, Qatar faces skepticism due to its ties with the militant group. The visit underscores Qatar's efforts to solidify its strategic relationship with the U.S. and compete with regional rivals.</p>

The visit underscores the importance of deals in Trump's foreign policy approach, following a pattern established during his first term.

Beijing agreed to pause or remove all non-tariff countermeasures imposed since April 2 , alongside the lowering of most tariffs imposed by the two countries, for 90 days, from today.

"Sound of Falling" is set on a farm in a small village in northeastern Germany and follows the lives of four generations of women living on the farm, interweaving their stories by jumping back and forth among the different timelines until the lines between them blur, and what starts as portraits of four generations becomes a sweeping depiction of a century. Schilinski says that the female gaze was very important to her and her co-writer, Louise Peter, because it's so rare in films.</p>
