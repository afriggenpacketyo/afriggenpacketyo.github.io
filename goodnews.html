          <p>Novak Djokovic has advanced to the Wimbledon semifinals after a four-set victory over Flavio Cobolli, setting up a highly anticipated match against world number one Jannik Sinner. Sinner secured his spot by defeating American Ben Shelton in straight sets, despite concerns over an elbow injury. This marks the second major semifinal meeting between the two this year, with Sinner having won their last encounter at the French Open. Djokovic, aiming for a record 25th Grand Slam title, will look to leverage his experience on grass in the upcoming clash.</p>

          <p>Amid catastrophic flooding in Central Texas that has claimed over 100 lives, one man's bravery is being highlighted as an act of heroism. Matthew Crowder rescued a sleeping family from their home in the early morning hours as floodwaters rapidly rose, telling emergency dispatchers he had to act regardless of their advice. The family lost their home and possessions but were brought to safety due to Crowder's decisive intervention. His story is one of many emerging examples of community members stepping up to help one another during the devastating natural disaster.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to meet at the end of July, homeowners are considering whether to tap into their home equity now and which product to use. The article explores the strategic choice between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) with a variable rate and a home equity loan with a fixed rate. A HELOC could be advantageous if rates are cut, while a home equity loan offers stability and protection against potential rate increases. The decision hinges on a homeowner's risk tolerance amid an uncertain interest rate climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting indicate that while most officials anticipate rate cuts this year, there is significant disagreement on the timing and extent of the reductions. The summary showed a divide between policymakers concerned about tariff-driven inflation and those focused on a potentially weakening labor market. Opinions ranged from some members being open to a cut as early as July to others who felt no reductions would be appropriate in 2025. This reflects a cautious, data-dependent approach as the central bank navigates a complex economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new HBO documentary, "My Mom Jayne," directed by her daughter Mariska Hargitay, offers a new perspective on the life of 1950s Hollywood star Jayne Mansfield. The film argues that Mansfield was more than just a "dime-store variant" of Marilyn Monroe, highlighting her intelligence, musical talents, and ambition to be a serious actress. It portrays her as a shrewd navigator of the restrictive studio system who was ultimately typecast by her bombshell persona. The documentary serves as both an affectionate tribute and a critique of an era that limited the creative potential of many female stars.</p>

Dunne revealed in a TikTok video that she had a contract for the $1.6 million property and was prepared to pay in cash. However, the building's co-op board rejected her application just before she was scheduled to receive the keys. While no official reason was given, Dunne speculated it could be due to her public profile, humorously suggesting it might even be a college sports rivalry.</p>

          <p>Following deadly flash floods in Texas, New Mexico, and North Carolina, water rescue experts are emphasizing the extreme danger of these events and the importance of preparedness. They advise that just six inches of fast-moving water can be fatal and survival often comes down to luck. The primary recommendation is to avoid floodwaters entirely and get to high ground immediately when a warning is issued. Experts also stress the need for a "go-bag," a weather radio, and a clear understanding of flood warnings, as reactive responses are often too late.</p>

          <p>The Volkswagen Group announced a significant 47% increase in global electric vehicle sales during the first six months of 2025, delivering 465,000 units. This growth in the EV segment helped offset declines in other areas, leading to a slight 1.3% rise in the company's total vehicle deliveries. The surge was particularly strong in Europe, where EV sales grew by nearly 90%. However, the company faced challenges in North America due to new tariffs and a competitive decline in China's fierce EV market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Geological Survey has reported the most significant seismic activity at Mount Rainier since 2009, as a swarm of hundreds of small earthquakes began on Tuesday. The observatory noted that the earthquakes are too small to be felt at the surface and are not a cause for immediate concern or an indication of an impending eruption. Scientists believe the swarm, which is expected to continue for several days, is likely caused by the movement of water within the earth's crust above the volcano's magma chamber. The volcano remains under close monitoring.</p>

          <p>Amid record numbers of small boat crossings, an analysis explores the reasons why asylum seekers choose the UK over other European nations. While the French government has cited the UK's informal economy as a major draw, data suggests the UK's informal economy is smaller than France's. Research indicates that more significant pull factors include family and community ties in the UK and the ability to speak English. The UK's policies on access to legal work are actually more restrictive than those in countries like France and Italy, challenging the narrative of a "soft touch" system.</p>

          <p>Former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning has said he is no longer interested in purchasing a minority stake in the team, citing the skyrocketing cost of NFL franchises. Manning explained that with valuations potentially reaching $10 billion, even a small 1% stake has become "too expensive for me." He also noted that ownership could create conflicts of interest with his current role on ESPN's "ManningCast." The Mara and Tisch families, who co-own the team, are exploring the sale of a non-controlling stake, attracting interest from other high-profile investors.</p>
