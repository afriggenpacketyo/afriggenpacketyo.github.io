        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has refuted allegations made by Telegram founder Pavel Durov regarding interference in Romania's presidential election. Durov hinted that a Western European country, possibly France, had requested Telegram to suppress conservative voices. The French Foreign Ministry dismissed these claims as baseless and accused Russia of attempting to divert attention from its own interference. The ministry emphasized France's commitment to Romanian democracy and its long-standing support for the country, asserting that such allegations are insulting and break historical ties. </p>

          <p>Todd S. Purdum discusses how Desi Arnaz challenged racism in 1950s Hollywood by insisting on playing Lucille Ball's husband on television, despite network concerns about his Cuban heritage. Arnaz's vaudeville tour proved their chemistry, leading to 'I Love Lucy' and his role as a groundbreaking Latino executive. Arnaz's success highlights the importance of embracing diversity and rewriting the rules of stardom. He not only changed how Hollywood did business but also broadened the public's perception of who could be a star, demonstrating the value of inclusion. </p>

          <p>A Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Scarlett Johansson and Bad Bunny explored the misinterpretations arising from a language barrier, as two men used Spanish to confide about their relationships while onlookers misinterpreted their conversation as a heated, macho argument. The sketch played on the contrast between the superficial understanding of the barflies and the genuine emotions expressed by the characters, highlighting the subtleties often missed in translation. The subtitles elided the nuances of the Caribbean-inflected Spanish, making the punchlines land less effectively for non-Spanish speakers. The sketch challenged audiences to consider the truth they can discern from strangers across language and cultural barriers. </p>
