          <p>Kensington Palace released a new photograph of Princess Charlotte, taken by her mother, Catherine, Princess of Wales, to celebrate her 10th birthday. The image, captured during a family trip to Cumbria earlier this year using an iPhone, shows a smiling Charlotte. As Prince William and Kate's second child, she is third in line to the throne, and due to succession rule changes in 2013, she is the first British princess to rank above a younger brother, marking a significant moment in royal history and tradition.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have entered into an economic agreement granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals, potentially bolstering Ukraine's defense and providing the U.S. with a strategic alternative to China's rare earth mineral dominance. The deal, described as an equal partnership, involves U.S. investments in Ukrainian mineral, oil, and gas projects, with Ukraine contributing half of future royalties. This agreement could mitigate America's reliance on China for critical minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing and military equipment, as China has recently imposed export restrictions in response to U.S. tariffs.</p>

Transgender women and girls can continue playing in open and mixed cricket categories. This policy change follows a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines a woman based on biological sex.
