          <p>As autumn approaches, health officials are anticipating a seasonal increase in both influenza and COVID-19 cases, prompting public guidance on distinguishing between the two illnesses. While both viruses share symptoms like fever and fatigue, flu often presents more suddenly with body aches, whereas COVID-19's latest variants frequently include a hoarse throat and cold-like symptoms. Experts emphasize that vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe illness from either virus, particularly for vulnerable populations, helping to reduce hospitalizations and strain on healthcare systems.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>West Ham has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as its new manager, a move seen as a return to a more pragmatic, counter-attacking style of football. After previous attempts to implement a possession-based approach under other managers failed, Nuno's philosophy aligns more closely with the successful tenure of David Moyes. His tactical approach, which emphasizes a solid defensive structure and quick transitions, is expected to better suit the strengths of the current squad, particularly players like Jarrod Bowen. Beyond tactics, Nuno's reputation for strong interpersonal skills may also be crucial in revitalizing a team environment that had reportedly soured.</p>

          <p>Following their victory in the Women's Rugby World Cup, England's Red Roses are focusing on creating a lasting legacy for the sport. Efforts are underway to capitalize on the momentum, including a nationwide "RugbyFest" to attract new players and an expanded broadcast deal for the domestic Premiership Women's Rugby league. The Rugby Football Union's "Impact 25" program, a multi-million pound investment, aims to bolster grassroots infrastructure to support a 35% increase in youth players. The victory is seen as a pivotal moment to embed women's rugby deeper into mainstream culture and ensure sustainable growth from the grassroots to the elite level.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Union party, led by President Maia Sandu, has won a majority in parliamentary elections, a result seen as crucial for the nation's path toward EU membership. The Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) secured approximately 50% of the vote, comfortably ahead of the pro-Russian opposition bloc. The election was tense, with President Sandu warning of "massive Russian interference" and several bomb scares reported at polling stations abroad. The victory allows the PAS to form a government without coalition partners, reinforcing its mandate to pursue closer integration with Europe despite ongoing political pressure from Moscow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police is consulting on a policy change that would require officers to declare if they are members of the Freemasons. This proposal follows a recommendation from the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel, which investigated the unsolved murder of a private detective and found that officers' membership in the secretive fraternity was a recurring source of suspicion and mistrust. The force stated that concerns have been raised about the potential impact of such memberships on impartiality in investigations, promotions, and misconduct proceedings. The policy aims to strengthen public trust and ensure there are no conflicts of loyalty.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed a new mobile air defense system, the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), to one of its bases in South Korea for the first time. The system is designed to counter threats such as cruise missiles, drones, rockets, and mortars, functioning similarly to Israel's Iron Dome. This deployment is seen as a strategic response to the evolving military capabilities of both North Korea and China. The move follows reports earlier this year that the U.S. Army was considering sending prototype missile defense technologies to global hotspots to enhance the protection of its forces and allies in strategically important regions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of American shopping malls is creating new opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime commercial real estate that was previously unaffordable. With national vacancy rates in shopping centers rising, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms, lower rents, and other incentives to fill empty storefronts. This trend is allowing a diverse range of entrepreneurs, from wellness practitioners to gourmet food sellers, to establish a physical presence in high-traffic areas. While the opportunities vary by region, the overall softening of the commercial rental market is enabling a revitalization of some retail spaces with unique, local businesses.</p>

The successful listing values the financial arm, which includes insurance and banking divisions, at over $6.7 billion. Sony stated that the separation allows the financial unit to raise its own capital for growth while freeing up the parent company to focus on its core entertainment and semiconductor businesses.
