          <p>Donald Trump is concluding his four-day visit to Scotland with a meeting with First Minister John Swinney to discuss key trade issues, including the 10% US tariff on Scotch whisky. The visit, which has been a mix of political and business engagements, also saw Trump meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his Turnberry resort. During his trip, Trump has reiterated his criticism of wind turbines while promoting North Sea oil and gas. The visit culminates with the opening of a new golf course at his Aberdeenshire resort before he returns to the UK for a state visit in September.</p>

          <p>Amid the current popularity of collectible toys like Labubu, this article explores the history of the Monchhichi doll, a Japanese creation that became a global sensation in the 1980s. While the toy was a massive success in Western Europe and the US, it was unavailable in communist East Germany due to a ban on capitalist consumer goods. In response, a state-owned enterprise in the toy-making town of Sonneberg created a similar doll called the Tiemi. These East German versions became popular throughout the Eastern Bloc and are now sought-after collector's items.</p>

          <h2>Barclays Exceeds Second-Quarter Profit Forecasts, Announces Share Buyback</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:26:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British bank Barclays reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its investment banking division. The bank also announced a new £1 billion share buyback program. The positive results were largely due to increased market volatility, which boosted trading income and helped offset a decline in advisory fees. This performance aligns with trends seen at other major banks like Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase, which also benefited from recent market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has identified Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as top targets to strengthen their striking options, should they decide to make further acquisitions this transfer window. The club acknowledges the need to sell some current players first to fund any new signings, which may delay potential moves until closer to the deadline. Securing either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa is reluctant to sell Watkins and Newcastle is also reportedly interested in Sesko. United considers the suggested £60 million price for Watkins to be excessive for the 29-year-old.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Experts Advocate for Proactive Strategy to Shape Global Narrative</h2>

          <p>Experts in China are urging Beijing to adopt a more proactive approach in shaping its international image and to engage more with other Asian nations to counter Western-dominated narratives. They argue that as global power dynamics shift, China must leverage its cultural symbols and lead in defining Asian discourse, rooted in principles of "harmony and diversity." This strategy involves taking a leading role in setting international norms in emerging fields to better align the country's soft power with its economic growth. The call comes as the influence of the Global South and blocs like Brics continues to rise in global governance.</p>

          <p>Qatar's bid to host the 2036 Summer Olympics is seen as a logical next step in its history of hosting major sporting events, but it faces significant hurdles. An Olympic scholar notes that key criteria for the IOC are political and popular support, which could be complex to gauge in Qatar. The primary challenge is the extreme summer heat, which would likely necessitate moving the games to November, disrupting the global sports calendar. Other potential issues include human rights concerns, regional competition with Saudi Arabia, and the overall image of the nation, making it a potentially risky choice for the IOC.</p>

          <p>For the first time, India has overtaken China to become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., according to new market research. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, with total volume jumping 240%. This shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and U.S. tariff policies. In contrast, China's share of smartphone exports to the U.S. fell to 25%, highlighting a significant realignment in global technology supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

While the EU has a strong research base, it has lagged in computing capacity, a problem these factories are designed to solve.

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate and looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy for parents. The new policy offers families 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a program expected to benefit around 20 million families. This move follows various local pilot programs and comes as official data shows China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024. The high cost of raising children is considered a major factor in the low birth rates, and this subsidy aims to help alleviate that financial burden.</p>
