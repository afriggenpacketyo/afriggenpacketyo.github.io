          <p>Canada has scrapped its planned 3% digital services tax on large tech companies just hours before it was set to take effect, prompting the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The tax, which would have impacted major US firms like Amazon and Meta, had been criticized by President Trump, who threatened retaliatory tariffs and paused negotiations. The Canadian Foreign Ministry stated its preference for a multilateral agreement and expressed hope for a comprehensive trade deal with the US by the July 21 deadline.</p>

Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline, suggested that any deal would likely need approval from Beijing, but expressed optimism that Chinese President Xi Jinping would agree to it.</p>

          <p>A family from Cumbria has successfully won a full refund for their ¬£3,500 "dream holiday" to Lapland after a lack of snow meant all their planned winter activities were canceled. The tour operator, Tui, had a "no snow you don't have to go" policy but initially refused to provide a full refund, despite the family's pre-departure concerns about a rainy forecast. After a six-month fight, an independent adjudicator ruled that the essential purpose of the trip was defeated and ordered the company to provide full compensation, validating the family's persistent efforts.</p>

          <p>China has announced the conditional resumption of seafood imports from Japan, partially lifting a blanket ban that was imposed in August 2023. The original ban was a response to Japan's release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The new measure will allow imports of aquatic products from most of Japan, but will maintain the prohibition on shipments from ten prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. This move is seen as a potential step toward resetting diplomatic and trade relations between the two nations.</p>
