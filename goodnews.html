          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced its decision to revert to its iconic "Old Timer" logo, scrapping a controversial redesign that sparked widespread customer outrage and criticism from former President Donald Trump. The company emphasized its commitment to traditional country hospitality, stating it listened intently to public feedback regarding the rebranding. This reversal followed a period of intense scrutiny, including a stock dip after the new logo's unveiling and strong condemnation from conservative figures like Donald Trump Jr. The company's stock subsequently rose in after-hours trading, with Trump suggesting the situation could be leveraged for positive publicity if managed strategically.</p>

          <p>Sheffield Wednesday achieved a surprising Carabao Cup victory against Premier League opponents Leeds, winning 3-0 on penalties after a 1-1 draw, amidst ongoing fan protests against owner Dejphon Chansiri. Manager Henrik Pedersen lauded his young, inexperienced squad's "togetherness" and pride, as the club faces financial turmoil and EFL sanctions. Many supporters opted to boycott the game in protest, yet the team's gutsy performance was seen as a powerful display of unity between players and the wider fanbase. This unexpected success provides a much-needed morale boost during a challenging period for the club.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's engagement, announced two weeks after Swift's podcast appearance, is being framed as a "hard launch" of "Brand Tayvis" and a meticulously crafted narrative. The article analyzes their relationship as a modern take on the "smart wife, lovable dumb husband" archetype, which resonates with fans. Swift's engagement announcement on Instagram, using the phrase "Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married," and her song "So High School," reinforce this image. Kelce's unresentful embrace of Swift's success and his "Labrador-ish enthusiasm for fame" are highlighted as key to their appeal and the relationship's "defiant conventionality."</p>

          <p>In China's Shennongjia mountains, dedicated conservation efforts have dramatically increased the population of the endangered golden snub-nosed monkey from below 500 in the 1980s to over 1,600 today. Professor Yang Jingyuan, who has spent his career studying and protecting these primates, highlights the complex social structures and unique behaviors of the monkeys. Once threatened by logging and hunting, the region has seen forest cover recover significantly, and former farmers are now employed as protectors. This success story showcases the positive impact of long-term scientific research and community engagement in environmental preservation.</p>

          <p>Okta, an identity software maker, saw its shares rise after reporting fiscal second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street projections, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year. CEO Todd McKinnon noted that economic conditions were "much better than we thought," leading the company to bump up its fiscal 2026 forecast. Despite some caution from U.S. government customers due to President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, renewals across federal agencies remained strong. Okta anticipates further growth from existing customers and the expanding need for software to manage AI agents, positioning the company for continued success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NFL teams made significant roster cuts, reducing squads from 90 to 53 players, leading to many notable players, including the league's tallest and heaviest, and several former stars, becoming jobless. Among the released are numerous quarterbacks who failed to secure backup roles despite preseason opportunities, such as Dorian Thompson-Robinson and Dresser Winn. Other surprising cuts include running backs Cam Akers and Clyde Edwards-Helaire, and wide receivers Robert Woods and Hunter Renfrow. Many of these players will likely be re-signed to practice squads, but the cuts represent a challenging period of uncertainty for those affected.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has ordered the state legislature to redraw its congressional maps, a development that could potentially create an opportunity for Democrats to gain a House seat. The ruling found that a 2020 bipartisan law "unconstitutionally impaired" a voter-approved 2018 ballot measure designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering. This decision comes amidst a national wave of redistricting battles, where both Republicans and Democrats are actively trying to reshape electoral maps for partisan advantage ahead of the 2026 midterms. The outcome of this legal challenge is uncertain due to potential appeals, but it signifies a win for fair representation advocates.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has reached a settlement in a class action copyright infringement lawsuit, brought by authors who alleged the company trained its AI models on their copyrighted work without permission. The specific terms of this settlement remain undisclosed. This resolution follows a U.S. District Judge's earlier ruling, which indicated that while AI models could legally learn from copyrighted material under "fair use," Anthropic might have violated the law by initially pirating a substantial portion of its source material. The case underscores the intricate legal challenges and ongoing debates surrounding intellectual property rights and content acquisition within the rapidly evolving AI industry.</p>

          <p>Conservative MP George Freeman has been cleared of "cash for questions" lobbying allegations, with the parliamentary standards commissioner deciding there were insufficient grounds for a formal investigation. Freeman had referred himself after claims arose that a company he advised, GHGSat, assisted him in drafting parliamentary questions related to space data and emissions tracking. Despite prior advice against lobbying the UK government on behalf of the company, the commissioner reiterated that rules permit MPs to advocate for public interest sectors, provided registration and declaration guidelines are followed. Freeman expressed his satisfaction with the decision, dismissing the allegations as "unfounded."</p>

Investors are keenly focused not just on a beat, but the *magnitude* of the beat, given high expectations for its Blackwell family of AI chips. Key questions revolve around the ramp-up of its new GB300 chip, its impact on profit margins, and the total cost of ownership benefits for customers. Additionally, clarity is sought on Nvidia's China strategy following revised U.S. export rules and reported pushback within China regarding security and self-reliance concerns.

          <p>EchoStar's stock soared over 70% after AT&T announced an agreement to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses from EchoStar for approximately $23 billion in an all-cash transaction. This deal, expected to close in mid-2026 pending regulatory approval, will significantly boost AT&T's mid-band and low-band spectrum holdings across over 400 U.S. markets. For EchoStar, the transaction is crucial for addressing Federal Communications Commission inquiries regarding its compliance with 5G network buildout requirements, which had been questioned by competitors like SpaceX. The agreement also expands their network services, allowing EchoStar to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator under the Boost Mobile brand. (not investment advice)</p>
