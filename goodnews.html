          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani after initial results showed Mamdani leading with 44% of first-choice votes. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amidst sexual harassment allegations, acknowledged Mamdani's strong campaign, particularly his appeal to young voters. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race proceeds to a ranked-choice count due to no candidate securing over 50% of the vote, with final results expected in mid-July. Cuomo's campaign hinted at a potential independent run in the November general election, potentially complicating the race, while Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, focused on progressive policies like rent freezes and fare elimination. The article notes that the primary winner is likely to have an advantage in the general election in heavily Democratic New York City.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her unfair dismissal case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) after being sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. The court ruled that the ABC terminated Lattouf's contract due to her political opinions, specifically her views on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. Lattouf shared a Human Rights Watch post accusing Israel of war crimes, which Israel denies, leading to her dismissal. The ABC has since apologized, acknowledging they "let down our staff and audiences" in handling the matter, and Lattouf was awarded damages of A$70,000. The case has raised questions about the ABC's independence and its support for culturally diverse staff.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament, historically critical of China, is undergoing a reset in relations led by President Roberta Metsola.

In a letter to the Chinese ambassador to the EU, Metsola expressed her desire to reset relations between the European Parliament and the National People‚Äôs Congress.

          <p>California leaders have reached a tentative agreement on a $321.1 billion budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal addresses a $12 billion budget deficit by borrowing money, tapping into state reserves, and shifting funding. Governor Newsom's signature is contingent on finalizing legislation to cut red tape and expedite housing and infrastructure development. The budget deal reflects resistance to Newsom‚Äôs proposed cuts, with lawmakers restoring cost-of-living adjustments for child-care workers and providing additional funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants. The tentative agreement is a precursor to more challenging financial discussions about additional reductions in the months ahead.</p>

          <p>China is expanding avenues for foreign institutions to use the yuan as international confidence in the U.S. dollar weakens. These efforts aim to challenge the dollar's dominance, particularly as the U.S. dollar index has declined more than 9% this year. The People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng discussed reducing reliance on a single sovereign currency and announced plans to establish a center for digital yuan internationalization. Beijing has also been promoting bilateral trade settlement in yuan and expanding access to futures contracts for foreign institutional investors, but some experts worry about the unpredictability of U.S. policies in recent months.</p>

The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal didn‚Äôt meet the requirements of the Byrd Rule, preventing the inclusion of extraneous budget provisions.

          <p>A US district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The judge granted a partial injunction to the states, ruling that their lawsuit against Trump‚Äôs Department of Transportation would likely succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration as part of the national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program. The Government Accountability Office previously found that the Trump administration violated the law when it withheld the funding.</p>

          <p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who oversaw the hush-money case against President Donald Trump, won Tuesday's Democratic primary as he seeks reelection. Bragg defeated Patrick Timmins to advance to November's general election, where he will face Republican Maud Maron. Bragg's tenure has been marked by high-profile cases, including the Trump case, and efforts to fight gun violence and prosecute hate crimes. His campaign emphasized his commitment to these priorities and his efforts to address crime in Manhattan.</p>

          <p>Rod Stewart is scheduled to play the coveted "legends" slot on Glastonbury's Pyramid stage, though he wishes it wasn't called the "tea time slot". He persuaded organizers to extend his set to an hour-and-a-half after initially being offered 75 minutes. Stewart last played Glastonbury in 2002 but has no memory of the performance. He also recounts a memorable New Year's Eve 1994 gig on Brazil's Copacabana Beach, where he played to more than three million people despite being violently ill before the show.</p>
