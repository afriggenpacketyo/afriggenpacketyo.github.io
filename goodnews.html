          <p>Former President Joe Biden's office announced that he has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, following increasing urinary symptoms. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men, with early stages often showing no symptoms. Screening tests, including PSA blood tests and digital rectal exams, are crucial for early detection and treatment. Treatment options vary depending on the stage and spread of the cancer, ranging from observation to surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate for localized cancer is high, but it decreases when the cancer spreads. </p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's and Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) actions to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The ruling orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president and declares the administration's takeover and staff terminations as "null and void." Judge Beryl Howell emphasized that USIP is an independent entity supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches, and the President's removal power does not extend outside the Executive branch. The decision allows USIP to resume its work in promoting peace and stability worldwide.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached a comprehensive agreement covering fishing, trade, defense, and energy, signaling a significant reset in their relationship after Brexit. The deal includes extending European fishing boats' access to British waters for 12 years in exchange for easing trade frictions. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need to move forward from Brexit debates and find practical solutions, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the agreement as a historic moment. However, the deal has faced criticism from Conservatives and Reform UK, who view it as a surrender to the EU.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given believes that Jack Grealish's future at the club is uncertain due to limited playing time. Grealish, a record signing for City, has struggled to secure regular starts and was an unused substitute in the FA Cup final. Given argues that Grealish is not being utilized effectively and suggests that he may benefit from a move to a club where he can be a central figure. Manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged that discussions about Grealish's future will take place between club officials and the player's representatives.</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump joined her husband, President Donald Trump, in signing the Take It Down Act into law, which criminalizes posting "intimate images" online without consent, including real and AI-generated content.

Melania Trump, who rarely makes public appearances, described the new law as a "national victory" to protect children from online exploitation. While the bill has received bipartisan support, some digital rights groups express concerns that it could lead to censorship of legitimate content.</p>

The company has refused to pay a ransom demand by hackers and is offering a reward for information leading to their arrest.
