          <p>With students now having no living memory of the September 11, 2001 attacks, teachers across the U.S. are developing new ways to educate them about the event's significance. Programs, such as one at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York, connect educators with survivors and first responders to provide firsthand accounts. These teachers aim to convey not only the trauma of the day but also the sense of national unity and resilience that followed. The goal is to ensure the historical and emotional weight of 9/11 is understood by future generations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken provides five practical, science-backed strategies for managing stress, emphasizing that the stress hormone cortisol is a natural part of life that needs balance, not elimination. The recommendations include reframing one's mindset to stop worrying about being stressed and accepting it as a normal response. Other key tips are engaging in regular physical exercise to help the body manage cortisol spikes, prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule, and focusing on self-care through good nutrition and carving out personal time.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region opened with mixed results after U.S. benchmarks reached new record highs, fueled by optimism over potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and positive inflation data. In early trading, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined. The positive sentiment in the U.S. was driven by a cooling producer price index, which pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new closing records, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a slight loss.

          <p>China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet may be poised for a significant international breakthrough, as the CEO of AirAsia's parent company, Capital A, confirmed active discussions to purchase the aircraft. This would make it the first foreign airline to work with the state-owned manufacturer, Comac, on a deal for the C919. The single-aisle jet is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The interest reflects growing economic ties and flight connections between China and Southeast Asian nations.</p>

          <p>Following a successful initial public offering where its stock climbed 14.5% on the first day, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that Klarna is still a worthwhile purchase. He notes that while the "buy now, pay later" company's valuation is over $17 billion, it has not yet reached an "insane" level. Cramer expressed satisfaction with Klarna's growth, improving fundamentals, and automated underwriting standards, despite the company currently being unprofitable as it invests in expansion. He believes the success of competitors like Affirm bodes well for Klarna's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State lawmakers have introduced a bill to significantly reform Measure ULA, the Los Angeles "mansion tax," in an effort to stimulate housing production. The proposal would reduce the tax rate on sales of recently built apartment buildings and commercial properties, which critics argue have been stifled by the current law. The legislation, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, is also part of a political strategy to counter a statewide ballot initiative that seeks to nullify Measure ULA entirely. Proponents of the original measure worry the changes will devastate funding for homeless services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional "stand and stir" television cooking shows are facing a dramatic decline, with commissions on British TV dropping 44% in a year. This shift is attributed to the rise of food content on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, which offer a more authentic, nimble, and direct connection with audiences. Unlike the lengthy and regulated production process of television, social media creators can respond instantly to trends, as exemplified by the "cronut" craze. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift where audiences, particularly younger ones, favor the "rough and ready" feel of online content over polished television productions.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," Jim Cramer observes that the current market environment is reminiscent of the show's early days in the 1990s. He recalls a time when more investors were excited about individual stocks, a sentiment he believes is returning after years dominated by index fund investing. Cramer credits the show with "democratizing" market information for the public. He suggests that with the significant gains seen in major individual stocks today, the focus is rightly shifting back to the rewards of single stock ownership. (not investment advice)</p>

Michael Kratsios, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, stated that the gap between the two nations has closed significantly since 2020. He advocated for a strategy of exporting "cohesive AI tech stacks"—which include chips, algorithms, and applications—to allies.

          <p>Scientists are studying Australia's peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. Researchers hypothesize that the key may lie in the spiders' "dark DNA"—the vast, non-gene portions of the genetic code whose functions are largely unknown. These spiders have three times more dark DNA than humans, and it is believed this genetic material could enable them to adapt and evolve into new species with unique colors and mating dances more rapidly. This research could provide broader insights into how variation arises in the natural world.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House passed a bipartisan measure to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force in Iraq from 1991 and 2003. The vote, supported by 212 Democrats and 49 Republicans, represents a significant effort by Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. Lawmakers argued that the decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to justify military action without new congressional approval. The amendment is attached to the annual defense spending bill and reflects a long-standing debate over presidential war powers.</p>
