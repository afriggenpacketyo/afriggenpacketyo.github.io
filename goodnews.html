          <p>California State Parks officials are implementing a new lottery-style drawing system to improve access to campsites at three of the state's most popular parks: Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls. This change aims to level the playing field for reservations, which previously would vanish within minutes of becoming available online. The system, which is free to enter, will hold drawings seven months in advance and includes a points system to give unsuccessful applicants a better chance in future lotteries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is moving forward with plans to refit a Boeing 747-8 jet, an "unconditional donation" from Qatar, for use as Air Force One. A memorandum of understanding outlines the gift, which President Trump confirmed earlier this year, stating it will be used while new official aircraft are being built. The Pentagon will be responsible for the significant costs of upgrading the plane with necessary security features, raising questions about the use of government funds and the constitutionality of a president accepting such a gift from a foreign state.</p>

          <p>A new artificial intelligence data center is set to be built near Cheyenne, Wyoming, with projected electricity usage exceeding that of all homes in the state combined. The project, a joint venture between Tallgrass and Crusoe, will begin with 1.8 gigawatts of power and could scale up significantly. While praised by officials for its economic benefits, particularly for the natural gas industry, the sheer scale of the data center raises concerns about its impact on the energy grid and the climate.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have announced a new trade deal, narrowly avoiding a threatened increase in U.S. tariffs on European goods. The agreement establishes a new tariff rate of 15% on many EU imports, down from the proposed 30%, and includes a European commitment to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years. While the deal marks a step toward de-escalation, some points are still under negotiation, and the legality of the administration's broader tariff strategy remains challenged in court.</p>
