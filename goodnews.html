          <p>A two-year-old boy was rescued from a luggage screening area at Newark Liberty International Airport after being swept away by a passenger luggage drop-off conveyor belt while his mother was speaking with a JetBlue agent. Port Authority Police Department officers entered the conveyor system and located the child before he reached an x-ray machine. The toddler's grandfather expressed gratitude to the officers, confirming the boy and his mother were unharmed. The airport had recently reopened a runway ahead of schedule, improving operations after previous delays and air traffic control issues. Optimism remains high that airport operations will continue smoothly in the future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millennials are entering midlife facing different challenges than previous generations, including economic instability and a hyper-awareness of mental health. Unlike the traditional midlife crisis stereotype involving sports cars and abandoning family, millennials are more focused on finding opportunities for personal growth, such as new careers or fitness journeys. Many feel a sense of wistfulness and a longing for stability, but they are also more equipped to handle these challenges in healthy ways. External factors like the economy and societal expectations contribute to this unique experience, leading millennials to redefine what it means to navigate midlife.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While transitioning away from fossil fuels is crucial, addressing food production is equally vital for meeting climate goals. Agriculture's expansive footprint drives deforestation, water shortages, and biodiversity loss, necessitating a shift towards producing more food with less land. This requires dietary changes, such as reducing beef consumption, and innovative agricultural practices, including genetic manipulation and bio-fertilizers. Despite progress, food and climate solutions lag behind energy solutions, demanding increased investment and a reevaluation of agricultural approaches to sustainably feed the growing population.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, the opposition party leader, is projected to win South Korea's snap presidential election, potentially shaping the country's trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies on China and North Korea.

Lee is expected to pursue a more left-leaning agenda, focusing on economic revival and tariff negotiations with the U.S. Both Lee and his opponent share goals for economic growth and housing affordability, but differ on strategies to achieve them, with Lee favoring fiscal support and Kim prioritizing private entrepreneurship.</p>

          <p>Germany's Constitutional Court has rejected a challenge by the populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) to the results of February's parliamentary elections. The BSW narrowly missed the 5% threshold required for representation in the Bundestag, arguing that its ballot placement and the failure to carry out a recount violated its right to equal opportunity. The court dismissed these arguments, stating that the party did not sufficiently substantiate the possibility of a violation of its rights. Had the BSW surpassed the 5% hurdle, the new coalition government would not have held a majority.</p>

          <p>Chelsea will not sign Jadon Sancho on a permanent basis and will instead pay a ¬£5m penalty to send the player back to Manchester United. Sancho moved to Stamford Bridge on loan last summer after his relationship with former United manager Erik ten Hag broke down. United, who signed Sancho for ¬£73m from Borussia Dortmund in 2021, are happy for the 25-year-old to leave. Chelsea had agreed an obligation to buy Sancho for a fee of about 25m if they finished higher than 14th in the Premier League, which they did - or pay to get out of the deal.</p>

This agreement supports the plant's continued operation and relicensing, which was at risk due to the expiration of its zero-emission credit.

          <p>There is a debate over whether bringing back manufacturing can help the heartland catch up with 'superstar' cities and promote economic growth in a wider swath of America. While manufacturing is a tradable sector with local multipliers, economists disagree on its potential for widespread prosperity. Proponents argue that manufacturing is a more likely option for struggling communities than attracting tech or finance, while skeptics point to automation and the sector's limited size. Trade policies, such as tariffs, have also been questioned for their effectiveness in revitalizing manufacturing and reducing regional inequality.</p>
