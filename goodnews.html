          <p>Tennis legend Bjorn Borg recently opened up about his "extremely aggressive" prostate cancer diagnosis from 2023, revealing he now takes life "day by day, year by year." The 69-year-old, a winner of 11 Grand Slam titles including five Wimbledons, is in remission after 2024 surgery but faces a continuous battle with "sleeping cancer cells" and undergoes bi-annual tests, acknowledging the significant psychological impact of the disease, which often presents without symptoms. Borg also reflected on his iconic rivalry with John McEnroe, particularly the memorable 1980 Wimbledon final, which he considers his most satisfying match. Their intense on-court competition has since evolved into a strong friendship, with both legends now discussing contemporary tennis rather than past glories, highlighting personal resilience.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in US investment, projected to create 7,600 jobs, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major firms like Blackstone, Microsoft, and Google are pledging significant funds over the next decade, aiming to deepen economic ties between the two nations and support key sectors like life sciences and advanced manufacturing. This comes as some pharmaceutical companies have paused UK investments due to perceived challenges, and domestic businesses face slowing investment amid rising costs. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the commitments as a testament to Britain's economic strength, despite some critics calling the investment "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table."

          <p>US President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK includes a mix of ceremonial duties and critical business discussions, despite tradition not usually extending such an invitation to a second-term president. After spending Wednesday with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, Trump is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers for trade and geopolitical talks, focusing on economic prosperity and global conflicts. The agenda for Thursday includes viewing the Sir Winston Churchill archives, a private meeting, a business reception, and a joint news conference. The visit, while marked by pageantry and royal engagements, also faces protests in London and Windsor, highlighting the complex reception for the US president.</p>

This move intensifies competition with US rival Nvidia, especially as American sanctions limit China's access to advanced semiconductors, pushing Chinese companies towards homegrown solutions. Huawei plans to roll out three new Ascend chip versions by 2028, aiming to double computing capabilities annually and overcome technical limitations through innovative system design and grouping less efficient chips. The company claims its future systems will significantly outperform Nvidia's and Elon Musk's xAI Colossus, signaling China's strong ambition for AI self-reliance and leadership.

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index soared to a fresh record high, closing up 1.15% at 45,303.43, driven by significant gains in real estate and technology sectors. This occurred amid mixed trading across other Asia-Pacific markets following the US Federal Reserve's expected 25 basis point rate cut, which placed the overnight funds rate between 4.00%-4.25%. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell characterized the cut as "risk management," with indications of two more cuts this year, one in 2026, and one in 2027. South Korea's Kospi also rose, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 declined, reflecting varied regional responses to global monetary policy shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European stocks opened higher on Thursday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 gaining 0.5%, as traders assessed the US Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by 25 basis points. The Fed's move, approved by an 11-to-1 vote, positioned the rate between 4.00%-4.25%, signaling less dissent than anticipated. Despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell's cautious framing of the cut as "risk management," dampening hopes for a lengthy cutting path, European banking stocks like Santander and Deutsche Bank saw gains. This reflects a positive, albeit measured, market reaction to the global monetary policy adjustment, with the Bank of England also expected to keep rates steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists at the University of Delaware have discovered a molecule in guava fruit that could help fight liver cancer and have successfully developed a synthetic method to create it. The leaves and bark of the guava plant are known for their anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anti-cancer properties, which this research aims to harness. This breakthrough in natural product total synthesis allows chemists to replicate the molecule using widely available chemicals, potentially leading to more effective and cheaper treatments for liver cancer, a disease with a low 10-year survival rate in the UK. This research, now progressing with the National Cancer Institute, opens new doors for medical advancements against various cancers.</p>

This development intensifies the race for an oral obesity drug, with rival Eli Lilly also developing a competitor, indicating a rapidly evolving pharmaceutical market. If approved by the FDA later this year, the pill will be manufactured entirely in the US, offering patients a needle-free alternative and potentially expanding market access for obesity treatments.

This dominant outing provided a much-needed boost for the Dodgers, whose bullpen had been struggling, and helped them maintain a two-game lead in the National League West. Snell's performance, characterized by excellent fastball command and lethal breaking pitches, demonstrated his potential to be a key player for the team in their quest for a World Series title.</p>
