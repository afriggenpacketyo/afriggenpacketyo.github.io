          <p>China has successfully completed the first test flight of its Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a critical step towards its lunar ambitions by 2030. The test involved a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, where the spacecraft's escape engines were ignited to simulate a launch failure. The return capsule separated cleanly and landed safely using parachutes and an airbag system. This test is a vital safety verification to ensure crew survival during launch emergencies, marking China's first such test since 1998.</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable space rocket on Hokkaido, marking its first successful landing after reaching an altitude of nearly 300 meters. The Japanese automaker aims to achieve suborbital space flight by 2029, utilizing technologies amassed in the development of its various products and automated driving systems. While there are no current plans for commercialization, Honda sees potential in launching satellites to support various services compatible with its other business ventures.

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees with signing bonuses up to $100 million and substantial annual compensation packages. Despite Meta's aggressive poaching efforts, Altman stated that none of OpenAI's top talent has accepted the offers, with Altman noting that Meta views OpenAI as its primary competitor. This move comes as Meta seeks to bolster its artificial intelligence team for its "superintelligence" AI lab, investing heavily in AI research.

Now, most people in a sexual relationship of 6 months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality, though blood donation will have a stricter criteria.

They need to hijack Nato for their own purposes and make maximum use of Nato‚Äôs chain of command and decades of experience in collective defence planning and multinational force integration to prepare for the day when they may need to act without the US.</p>
