          <p>Chinese tourists are returning to Japan in large numbers, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, but with a shift in travel preferences. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, they are now seeking immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The Japan National Tourism Organization is adapting its marketing strategies to target this new trend, particularly families with young children. However, a Japanese manga predicting a major disaster in Japan this July initially discouraged travel, though recent data suggests its impact is waning.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between US Steel and Nippon Steel, claiming it would keep the US steelmaker in Pittsburgh, despite previously opposing the merger. He stated Nippon would invest $14 billion, including $2.2 billion to increase steel production in Pittsburgh's Mon Valley, and promised no layoffs or outsourcing. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain "controlled by the USA," although he did not specify the ownership structure and admitted he had not seen the final details of the deal. He also announced plans to double the current 25% tariff on steel imports to 50%.</p>

          <p>China is upgrading its traditional mining industry by deploying driverless electric vehicles in the Yimin open-pit coal mine in Inner Mongolia. The mine now uses a fleet of 100 photovoltaic-battery-powered, self-driving trucks, representing the world's largest deployment of autonomous electric mining trucks. This initiative addresses a shortage of drivers and improves safety in dangerous driving conditions.

          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 250 million honeybees overturned in northwestern Washington state, releasing millions of bees. Authorities warned people to avoid the area due to the potential for swarming. Bee experts are assisting with the cleanup, aiming to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen. The goal is to save as many bees as possible, recognizing their key role in pollination and food production. Experts attribute the decline of bees and other pollinators to insecticides, parasites, disease, climate change, and lack of diverse food supply.</p>
