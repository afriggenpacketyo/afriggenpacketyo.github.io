          <p>President Trump has expressed interest in taking mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, could benefit investors holding shares in the firms. However, critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren warn it could destabilize the mortgage market and raise housing prices. The White House states it is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency while carefully evaluating any actions, and TD Cowen expects a slow and deliberate approach to any changes in the enterprises.

The reasons for this structure likely include venture capital firms needing liquidity after a period of meager returns. Circle is profitable, with $64.8 million in net income in the latest quarter.
