        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford's vehicle sales increased by 14.2% in the second quarter of 2025, significantly exceeding the auto industry's projected growth of around 1.4%. This surge was driven by strong sales of its F-Series trucks, which had their best second quarter since 2019, and a notable rise in hybrid vehicle purchases. However, the report also highlighted a 31.4% drop in pure electric vehicle sales for the quarter, indicating a shift in consumer preference within its electrified vehicle category. The performance comes amid new tariffs on imported vehicles implemented by the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a record-breaking marathon session lasting over 26 hours, the U.S. Senate is approaching a final vote on President Trump's sweeping domestic policy package. The lengthy "vote-a-rama" involved dozens of amendments and intense, behind-the-scenes negotiations by Republican leadership to secure the support of skeptical party members. With leadership now expressing confidence that they have the necessary votes, the bill is expected to pass the Senate before returning to the House of Representatives for a final vote on the Senate's revisions. Vice President JD Vance was present at the Capitol, prepared to cast a tie-breaking vote if needed.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that what people eat can influence their sleep and dreams, with about 40% of participants reporting that their eating habits affected their sleep. Published in Frontiers in Psychology, the research found that foods like desserts, sweets, and dairy were most often blamed for worse sleep and disturbing dreams. In contrast, fruit and herbal tea were associated with better sleep. The authors theorize that the negative association with dairy might be due to gastrointestinal issues caused by lactose intolerance during sleep, rather than a direct neurological effect.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs), highlighting that savers can find significantly better returns at online banks compared to national averages. Due to the current inverted yield curve, short-term CDs of about one year often offer higher rates than longer-term ones. To capitalize on these high short-term rates while planning for the future, the article suggests strategies like creating a CD ladder, where money is invested in multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates. This approach allows for flexibility while locking in competitive returns. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With over 100 million Americans facing medical debt, this article outlines several potential avenues for relief. A primary option is hospital charity care, a requirement for nonprofit hospitals that can lead to forgiven or discounted bills for patients who meet specific income criteria. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement through a debt relief company can be a path to negotiate lower balances with creditors. As a final resort for overwhelming debt, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can provide comprehensive legal protection and a chance to eliminate or reorganize medical bills.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a major housing bill that overhauls the state's landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Newsom and other housing advocates argue that the 1970s-era law has become a significant bureaucratic obstacle to building much-needed housing. By streamlining CEQA's requirements, the new law aims to accelerate development and address the state's severe housing shortage and homelessness crisis. The governor had made the bill's passage a condition for signing the state budget, pushing it through despite opposition from some environmental organizations.</p>

Examples of responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" provide genuine insight that helps candidates assess if a company is the right fit for their personal values, leading to better long-term career satisfaction.</p>
