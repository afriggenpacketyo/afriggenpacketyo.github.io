          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed global investors at the Milken Institute Global Conference, outlining President Trump's "America First Vision." Bessent emphasized tax cuts, deregulation, and tariffs as key components of the economic agenda, specifically appealing to wealthy investors. While Trump claimed numerous trade deals were in progress, none have been announced since the tariff pause, despite hints of a potential agreement with India. The administration aims to make the U.S. more attractive for investors by reducing government waste and promoting private investment.</p>
