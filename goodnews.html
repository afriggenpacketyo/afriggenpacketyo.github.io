          <p>Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing an all-cash offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that caused WBD's stock to surge over 25%. The potential merger would create a media behemoth, consolidating major film studios and television networks amid an industry-wide transformation driven by streaming. This development comes as Warner Bros. Discovery was already in the process of separating its TV networks from its streaming and studio assets to allow for more strategic flexibility.</p>

          <p>A proposed California law to ban PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," from products like nonstick cookware has ignited a contentious debate. Prominent chefs argue that the pans are safe when used correctly and that alternatives are less effective for home cooks. In contrast, environmental advocates and actor Mark Ruffalo are highlighting the significant public health risks linked to PFAS exposure, urging support for the bill which aims to phase out the chemicals where safer alternatives exist.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients are projected to receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of approximately 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026, based on the latest government inflation data. This would translate to an average monthly benefit increase of about $54 for retired workers. Although this adjustment is slightly higher than the one for 2025, many retirees are concerned that it may be insufficient to cover rising costs for other essential expenses, such as Medicare premiums, which are also expected to climb.

          <p>The United States and Japan have finalized a significant trade agreement wherein Japan will invest $550 billion in American-based projects in exchange for a lower 15% baseline tariff rate. According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the U.S. government will select the projects and will initially split the profits equally with Japan until the investment is repaid. Afterward, the U.S. will receive 90% of the profits, a structure designed to boost domestic manufacturing and infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>GE Vernova's CEO acknowledged that the company's onshore wind business is facing a challenging outlook, with revenue projected to decline in 2026, partly due to the Trump administration's unfavorable policies. In contrast, Boeing's stock received a positive lift after Southwest Airlines announced it was increasing its delivery expectations for the year. Additionally, Boeing has reached a tentative labor agreement with striking workers at its defense business, marking a positive step toward resolving the dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis of Elon Musk's vast fortune indicates that the majority of his wealth is now derived from his private companies, SpaceX and xAI, rather than his publicly traded automaker, Tesla. With SpaceX's valuation potentially reaching $400 billion and xAI's at $200 billion, his stakes in these ventures now eclipse the value of his Tesla shares. This financial shift is being used by Tesla's board as a key justification for a proposed massive new pay package to ensure Musk remains focused on the company. (not investment advice)</p>
