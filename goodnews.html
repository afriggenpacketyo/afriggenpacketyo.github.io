          <h2>Wall Street Rebounds After Initial Tariff-Induced Losses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 18:49:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a period of market volatility triggered by President Trump's imposition of global tariffs, Wall Street experienced a significant recovery, driven primarily by gains in the technology sector, with Microsoft and Nvidia leading the charge. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both surged by 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 1.4%. This resurgence, marking the ninth consecutive day of gains, was fueled by a surprisingly positive jobs report indicating the addition of 177,000 new jobs in April, coupled with renewed optimism surrounding potential US-China trade negotiations. While some analysts suggest that the jobs data alleviates concerns about a looming recession, others caution that the long-term effects of the tariffs remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and has permanently blocked its enforcement. The judge found that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing certain clients and for its progressive employment policies, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The ruling emphasizes that the government cannot use its power to suppress dissenting viewpoints by targeting lawyers for their representation of clients.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of hundreds of scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society announced a plan to publish a special collection of climate change research. This effort aims to ensure that the scientists' work is accessible, as the dismissals suggest the next National Climate Assessment may be less comprehensive. The groups are inviting climate scientists and researchers to submit their work, with a focus on climate change impacts in the United States. The collection is intended to complement, not replace, the legally mandated National Climate Assessment.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased shipping products directly from China to the United States in response to the Trump administration's decision to close a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese goods to enter the country without import fees. The company will now ship all U.S. orders from local warehouses within America. This change comes after Trump labeled the de minimis exemption a "big scam" hurting American small businesses. Temu stated that pricing for U.S. consumers will remain unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model, and the company is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14, coinciding with both the Army's 250th anniversary and President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade will involve approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The event has sparked speculation that Trump is using the Army's birthday as an opportunity to stage the kind of grand military parade he desired during his first term. The cost of the parade is unclear, but it is expected to be significant, requiring involvement from multiple federal agencies.</p>

Verstappen, who arrived late due to the birth of his child, attributed his lack of pace to understeer in the car.
