          <p>Liverpool has finalized the acquisition of striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle United for a British record fee of £125 million, potentially rising to £130 million with add-ons. The 25-year-old Swedish international signed a six-year contract, expressing his motivation to win trophies and make history with the Premier League champions. This transfer is part of Liverpool's unprecedented summer spending spree, which has exceeded £450 million, setting a new Premier League record for a single transfer window. The deal surpasses the previous British record and ranks as one of the most expensive transfers in global football history.</p>

Gauff, the 2023 champion, appeared uncertain and struggled with her forehand throughout the brief one-hour match. Osaka will now face Czech 11th seed Karolina Muchova in the next round.</p>

Szczerek claimed he made a "huge mistake," believing tennis player Kamil Majchrzak was throwing the hat in his direction. After widespread criticism online, he stated it was not his intention to take a souvenir from a child and that he has since returned the hat. The tennis star later met with the young fan, giving him a new cap and other merchandise.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," is reviewed as a solid drama centered on the life of pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr, played by Dwayne Johnson. The movie explores Kerr's personal crisis following his first professional loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties with his girlfriend, played by Emily Blunt. While Johnson's casting is seen as inevitable and his performance is praised for its vulnerability, the review suggests the film doesn't fully explore its emotional depths compared to other sports dramas. However, it is considered an insightful look into the psychological pressures of elite fighting.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has named his six wildcard picks, confirming a team that includes 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. Despite the continuity, Donald warned against expecting a "rinse and repeat" performance, stressing that winning on American soil at Bethpage presents a completely different challenge. He emphasized that he will not necessarily use the same pairings and will adapt his strategy for the away match. Donald also urged his players to embrace the likely raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>European stock markets started the month with gains, led by a strong performance in the defense and healthcare sectors. Defense stocks surged after the UK announced a £10 billion warship export deal with Norway, which will see BAE Systems build Type 26 frigates, boosting its share price. In healthcare, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk saw its shares rise following the release of positive trial data for its weight-loss drug Wegovy. The data suggested superior performance in reducing heart disease risk compared to a rival drug from Eli Lilly. (not investment advice)</p>
