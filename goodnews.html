          <p>Ahead of its tournament in Dallas, LIV Golf is focusing on community outreach and fostering the next generation of players through its 'Potential, Unleashed' initiative. The program partners with local schools and charities to provide educational and athletic opportunities for students in the DFW area, aiming to increase diversity in the sport. Players like Cameron Tringale participated in clinics, emphasizing the goal of breaking down barriers to entry in golf. This community-focused effort runs parallel to the main tournament, which organizers say offers a more relaxed, fan-friendly atmosphere compared to traditional golf events.</p>

The event aims to ensure AI serves the common good, but major US and Chinese AI firms like OpenAI and DeepSeek were notably absent. Amid the deepening tech rivalry, Thailand‚Äôs Ministry of Digital Economy and Society stated it would not take sides between the US and China. Instead, the nation intends to focus on developing its own independent AI ecosystem while engaging with the UN's ethical framework.</p>

          <p>During the World Economic Forum event in Tianjin, prominent economists argued that China must shift its economic focus from production to consumption to achieve long-term prosperity. Professor Jin Keyu stated that despite technological advancements, China's reliance on subsidizing production creates trade imbalances and global friction. The experts called for structural reforms that would elevate internal consumption, particularly in the services sector and smaller cities, as a key metric for local government success. This change is seen as essential not only for sustainable growth but also for harmonizing China's economic relationships with the rest of the world.</p>

          <p>Chongqing, China, is experiencing a massive surge in tourism from Southeast Asia, largely fueled by viral social media clips showcasing its unique, multi-dimensional urban landscape. Online travel platforms report that flight bookings have increased dramatically, with Klook noting a nearly twelve-fold surge in demand for the city in 2025. Tourists are drawn to its 'cyberpunk' architecture, such as a monorail passing through a residential building. In response, local authorities have improved transportation infrastructure and established one-stop service centers to manage the influx of visitors, making the city more accessible and accommodating for the growing number of travelers.</p>

          <p>Tokyo stocks experienced a sharp rally on Friday, with the Nikkei 225 index climbing above the 40,000 mark for the first time in five months. The surge was primarily driven by easing concerns over potential U.S. tariffs, after the White House indicated that President Trump might extend a 90-day pause on new duties. The market was also buoyed by gains in the U.S. tech sector, particularly semiconductor stocks, amid optimism for AI-related demand. This positive market movement reflects investor relief over potentially stabilizing trade relations and a more predictable global economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an understanding to accelerate shipments of rare earth minerals to the U.S., a key development in efforts to de-escalate the ongoing trade war. This agreement provides a framework for implementing a previous deal from Geneva, where Beijing had committed to removing certain non-tariff barriers. China had previously restricted exports of these critical minerals, which are vital for the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. The new accord signals potential progress in resolving trade disputes, although the path to a comprehensive deal remains long and complex.</p>

To acquire the pick, the Lakers traded their 55th pick and cash to the Bulls for the 45th pick, then sent that pick and more cash to the Timberwolves. Thiero, known for his athleticism, is seen by the organization as a player who can provide needed support on the wing alongside Luka Donƒçiƒá. The move demonstrates the Lakers' proactive approach to adding young talent without a first-round pick this year.</p>
