          <p>Retail egg prices in the United States experienced a 12.7% decrease in April, falling to an average of $5.12 per dozen, according to the Consumer Price Index. This marks the first month-to-month decline since October 2024, offering consumers a slight reprieve from record-high prices. However, egg prices remain significantly elevated, sitting 79% higher than the same month a year earlier due to the persistent impact of bird flu outbreaks, which have led to the culling of millions of egg-laying hens. Outbreaks in Ohio and South Dakota in April alone affected over 927,000 hens, continuing to constrain the egg supply.</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. fell to 2.3% in April, according to the Labor Department, marking the lowest level since February 2021. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% for the month, slightly below expectations, while core CPI (excluding food and energy) also increased by 0.2%. Shelter prices were a primary driver of the overall inflation gauge. The market reaction was muted, with stock futures showing little change and Treasury yields mixed.</p>

Despite the overall moderation in price hikes, uncertainty looms due to the potential impact of tariffs, with furniture costs already showing a 1.5% increase. Declines in gasoline and grocery prices, particularly a 12.7% drop in egg prices due to a seasonal respite from avian flu, helped keep inflation in check last month.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has introduced the "Invest America Act," proposing that the federal government provide a $1,000 seed investment in a private, tax-advantaged account for every American child at birth. The accounts would allow contributions from individuals, family, and businesses up to $5,000 annually, with investments placed in a low-cost fund tracking the S&P 500. Distributions after age 18 would be taxed at the capital gains rate. Cruz argues this initiative would give every child a stake in the American free enterprise system, though the proposal comes amid concerns about the U.S. national debt.</p>

Mr. Biden, who is 82, has mostly kept a low profile since leaving the White House in January, but recently appeared on "The View" with Jill Biden to address rumors of cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, slightly less than economists expected, but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Economists are closely watching for signs that Trump's tariffs are impacting consumer prices, though the effect may not be immediately visible due to factors like front-loading purchases and tariff exemptions.

          <p>The U.S. monthly inflation rate slowed in April, even after President Trump announced his sweeping tariffs. The annual inflation rate was 2.3%, a slight decrease from March. While the inflation report covers April, businesses are still determining the impact of the tariffs. Trump has since rolled back most of the tariffs he announced, but consumers are still bracing for higher prices. Federal Reserve officials expect tariffs to impact prices, even if only temporarily.</p>

          <p>Five England players currently involved in the Indian Premier League (IPL) have been selected for the upcoming one-day international series against the West Indies later this month. Jos Buttler, Jacob Bethell, Jamie Overton, Jofra Archer, and Will Jacks are included in the 16-man ODI squad, while Phil Salt is in the T20 squad. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) will review the no-objection certificates (NOC) issued to the players, considering the IPL final now coincides with the third ODI. All 10 English players in the IPL will discuss security arrangements for a potential return to India.</p>
