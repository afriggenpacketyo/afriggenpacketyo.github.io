          <p>Shares of Bitcoin miner and data center operator TeraWulf Inc. rallied after Google increased its stake in the company from 8% to 14%. The deal includes up to $1.4 billion in additional financial backstop from Google to fund the expansion of TeraWulf's Lake Mariner facility in New York, which is being developed to support advanced artificial intelligence infrastructure. This investment follows recent 10-year computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack, which have caused TeraWulf's stock to surge approximately 90% over the last week. The expansion is expected to significantly increase the facility's computing capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, will be observed on Monday, September 1, 2025, marking the unofficial end of summer for many. The holiday originated from the labor movement in the late 19th century, which fought for better working conditions and rights. While federal offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed, most major retailers like Target and Walmart, as well as grocery stores and fast-food chains, are expected to remain open, though some may have limited hours. Costco is a notable exception and will be closed for the day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The jukebox musical "& Juliet," now playing at the Ahmanson Theatre, offers a high-energy, revisionist take on Shakespeare's classic tragedy. The show's premise imagines what would happen if Juliet chose not to die, instead embarking on a journey of self-discovery in Paris. This updated narrative is powered by a string of hit songs from producer Max Martin, originally performed by artists like Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and the Backstreet Boys. With a witty book by David West Read of "Schitt's Creek" fame, the production is praised for its clever integration of pop anthems and its focus on 21st-century themes of empowerment and identity.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Age Considerations When Purchasing Annuities for Retirement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own restrictions, typically capping buyers at around 80 to 85 years old. Annuities provide a guaranteed income stream for retirement, but the timing of the purchase significantly affects costs and payouts. Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s to mid-60s to balance growth potential with favorable rates. However, purchasing an immediate annuity later in life, such as in one's 70s or 80s, can result in higher monthly payments due to shorter life expectancy, though this strategy carries risks related to health and product availability.

          <p>Texas state health officials have announced the end of a major measles outbreak centered in West Texas, which was one of the largest and deadliest in the U.S. in decades. The outbreak is considered over after 42 days—equivalent to two full incubation periods—passed without any new reported cases of transmission. Since January, the state confirmed 762 cases, including nearly 100 hospitalizations and the deaths of two school-aged children. The vast majority of cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals, highlighting the importance of vaccination as officials warn that the threat of measles is not gone, given ongoing outbreaks elsewhere.</p>

          <p>During his latest visit to the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy opted for a more formal, black-on-black ensemble, a notable change from the military-style outfits he has worn since the 2022 invasion. This choice of attire drew positive comments from President Donald Trump, contrasting with a previous meeting where Zelenskyy's garb was a point of contention. The exchange provided a moment of levity during high-stakes talks, with Zelenskyy joking with a reporter about his wardrobe change. The shift in attire is seen by some as a strategic move to adjust his presentation for different diplomatic contexts.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings report, with Wall Street analysts anticipating a return to consistent sales growth. Projections indicate a 1.6% rise in U.S. same-store sales, which would be the third consecutive quarter of positive growth for the home improvement retailer in its domestic market. This positive outlook is attributed to easing year-over-year comparisons and a potential resurgence in larger, discretionary home renovation projects like kitchen and bath remodels. The report will be closely watched for signs of a thaw in the housing market and for management's commentary on consumer spending habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words in the past year, many of which originated from internet culture, social media trends, and Gen Z slang. Among the new entries are terms like "skibidi," a versatile word from a YouTube series, and "delulu," a playful shortening of delusional that has even been used by political leaders. Other notable additions include "tradwife," reflecting a social media trend of embracing traditional gender roles, and "broligarchy," describing a small group of powerful male tech leaders. Lexicographers noted that they only add words they believe will have lasting power in the English language.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with U.S. officials, an analysis of international support highlights the scale of aid provided since Russia's 2022 invasion. According to the Kiel Institute, the United States has committed approximately $130.6 billion, making it the largest single-country donor. However, when combined, European nations and EU institutions have collectively spent more, contributing around $165.7 billion in military, financial, and humanitarian aid. The report clarifies that aid from both the U.S. and Europe has consisted of a mix of grants and loans, countering claims that only European contributions are structured as repayable loans.</p>

          <p>AFC Bournemouth has signed 19-year-old Scottish winger Ben Doak from Liverpool in a deal worth an initial £20 million, with an additional £5 million in potential add-ons. Doak, who has signed a five-year contract, sought the move to secure more regular first-team football after making only 10 appearances for Liverpool since joining from Celtic in 2022. The sale is part of a profitable summer for Liverpool, which has generated significant funds from selling several 'homegrown' or development players. For Bournemouth, Doak is the fourth major signing of a busy summer transfer window.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the medical journal JAMA has found that the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, whose members were all fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June, had a historically low rate of financial conflicts of interest. The annual reported conflict rate for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) declined from over 42% in 2000 to just 5% in 2024. Kennedy had justified the dismissals by citing a 2007 report about conflicts on the panel. The new data suggests that significant progress had been made in reducing such conflicts, with personal income-related ties being below 1% since 2016.</p>
