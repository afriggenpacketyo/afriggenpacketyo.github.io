          <p>An exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is re-examining the cultural and architectural legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete housing blocks common in the former German Democratic Republic. Once promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages, these buildings became symbols of dystopia and social strife following German reunification, associated with unemployment and the rise of extremism. The exhibition uses art to explore this divisive history, reflecting on collective memory, community, and the painful transformations of that era without succumbing to nostalgia for the past.</p>

These factors are creating a complex environment where potential central bank rate cuts are weighed against the risks of escalating global trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The universities of Kent and Greenwich have announced plans to merge, creating what is being called the UK's first "super-university," which will be known as the London and South East University Group. The merger, set for the 2026 academic year, aims to create a financially resilient institution capable of navigating the economic challenges facing the higher education sector, where many universities are in deficit. While the individual university brands and campuses will be retained, the move reflects a trend toward consolidation as institutions grapple with rising costs and shifts in student enrollment.</p>

          <p>The complex identity of New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who was born in Kampala to Indian parents, has sparked debate in the U.S. but is viewed differently in Uganda. In Kampala, where his family has deep roots and where he recently held his wedding, Ugandans of Indian descent are widely considered part of the national fabric, making his self-identification as both "Asian" and "Black or African American" on a past application understandable in that context. The article explores the history of the Indian diaspora in Uganda, contrasting the local acceptance of multi-hyphenated identities with the more rigid racial categories often used in the United States.</p>

Crawford is moving up two weight divisions in an ambitious attempt to become a three-division undisputed champion, a feat that adds to the fight's allure. While Alvarez is the more widely known name and has experience at the higher weight, Crawford's undefeated record and technical skill make him a formidable opponent, setting the stage for a highly anticipated and legacy-defining contest.</p>

          <p>India's Chief Economic Advisor stated that recent cuts to the goods and services tax (GST) are expected to partially offset the negative economic impact from U.S. tariffs. The tax cuts are designed to boost domestic consumption, compensating for potential declines in export demand resulting from the trade penalties imposed by the United States. While the advisor projects a net negative impact of 0.2% to 0.3% on GDP growth, the government believes these domestic fiscal reforms will provide a crucial buffer against prolonged tariff uncertainty.

          <p>Despite a poor run of results with only two Premier League wins since April, underlying statistics suggest Manchester United's performances under manager Ruben Amorim have been improving. The team ranks highest in the league for shots taken and near the lowest for shots faced in their last ten games, indicating strong chance creation and defensive solidity. However, the team has significantly underperformed in both scoring goals and preventing them, suggesting issues with finishing and goalkeeping efficiency rather than tactical setup are to blame for their low point tally.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her post while her lawsuit proceeds.

The judge ruled that the legal standard for removal "for cause" likely pertains to a governor's conduct while in office, marking a significant setback for the administration's efforts to influence monetary policy.</p>

While habitat loss remains the primary threat, this vaccine offers a critical tool to combat the widespread disease, which can cause blindness, infertility, and death, and has been a major factor in the species' decline.</p>
