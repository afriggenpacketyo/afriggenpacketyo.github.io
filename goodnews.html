        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth by lowering energy costs for thousands of businesses. The plan, called the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, intends to cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses by exempting them from some green energy levies. This scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027. Acting shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie criticized the plans, saying the UK needed "a serious approach to energy policy" that "tackles the root cause of our high energy prices". The prime minister said the industrial strategy gave businesses "the long-term certainty and direction" they need to "invest, innovate and create good jobs that put more money in people's pockets".</p>

          <p>Chinese state media is advocating for Beijing to proactively embrace yuan-backed stablecoins to facilitate the internationalization of the yuan. The Securities Times emphasizes the unique advantages and potential risks of stablecoins, urging leadership to consider regulations. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies, combining cryptocurrency efficiency with traditional money reliability. Delaying the adoption of stablecoins could mean missing a golden opportunity for the yuan, particularly as the US has a head start. The unique advantages and potential risks of stablecoins cannot be ignored.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers have voluntarily agreed to expedite and reduce prior authorizations, a process criticized for causing delays and physician burnout. Plans under insurers like CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna will implement changes to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce administrative burdens. Efforts include establishing a common standard for electronic submissions by 2027, with at least 80% of electronic approvals answered in real-time. Individual plans will reduce the types of claims subject to prior authorization requests by 2026. The group said the tweaks will benefit 257 million Americans.</p>

          <p>With early signs indicating a potentially bad year for tick bites, awareness of tick-borne diseases and prevention is crucial. Tick bites occur in every U.S. state, with Lyme disease being the most common illness. Experts advise frequent tick checks, prompt removal, and using repellents to reduce risks. Risks vary by region, with the Northeast and Upper Midwest having high Lyme disease rates, the South facing concerns about ehrlichiosis and Alpha-gal syndrome, and the West experiencing Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Staying informed about local risks and taking preventive measures are essential for staying safe from tick-borne illnesses.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar surged initially as a safe-haven asset after U.S. military strikes on Iran, but analysts warn that these gains may be temporary. Concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, trade wars, and weakening international demand for U.S. assets are expected to regain focus. While fears of a Strait of Hormuz closure contribute to the dollar's strength, analysts suggest the situation is complex. The U.S. Treasury market's muted reaction and ongoing global trade tensions compound these fiscal concerns.

NHS England is implementing a phased approach to manage demand and resources, prioritizing patients with a BMI of 40 or over and specific health conditions. Patients will also receive wrap-around care, including regular check-ups and support with exercise and healthy eating. Some GP practices have issued notices saying very few patients on their lists will qualify for the medicine straight away.

          <p>Researchers in China have found evidence that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may affect the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. The scientists monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays, as well as gamma ray-induced particle disturbances known as quasiparticle bursts. The findings could be significant for the scaling of quantum processors and the design of fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. The proposed detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection. The scientists said they directly observed quasiparticle bursts leading to correlated errors that are induced solely by muons and separated the contributions of muons and gamma rays.</p>
