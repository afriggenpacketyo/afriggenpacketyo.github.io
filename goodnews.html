          <p>A preliminary magnitude 4.1 earthquake struck parts of the southern U.S. on Saturday morning, with the epicenter near Greenback, Tennessee. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling the tremors, though there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The USGS received over 23,000 public reports within the first hour after the quake, and there is a small chance of aftershocks in the coming week. Earthquakes are not uncommon in this region, which is part of the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, but this event served as a reminder to residents about earthquake preparedness.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a new device by Teal Health that offers a more convenient and less dreaded screening experience. The Teal Wand uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample, which is then mailed to a lab for HPV testing. Studies have found that at-home screening is as effective as in-office procedures and is preferred by women, potentially increasing screening rates. The device will be available by prescription for women 25-65 years old who are at average risk, starting next month in California before expanding to other states.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean after 53 years in space. The mission failed shortly after launch due to a malfunction in the launch vehicle's upper stage, stranding the probe in Earth's orbit. Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, reported that the spacecraft had re-entered the atmosphere and no longer exists, marking the end of its decades-long journey. The event serves as a reminder of the ambitious Soviet space program and the challenges of planetary exploration during the Cold War era.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller reflects on his career, emphasizing the importance of instinct over excessive data in making creative and business decisions. Diller argues that relying solely on data can hinder innovation and narrow one's perspective, while instinct allows for a broader understanding and better judgment. He shares anecdotes from his time at ABC, highlighting how successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" were driven by gut feelings rather than extensive research. Diller contrasts this approach with MBA students who are armed with business tools but lack simple human instinct, advocating for a balance between information and intuition.</p>
