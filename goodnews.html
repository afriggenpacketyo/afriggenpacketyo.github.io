          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to ¬£1,000, and may have debts written off due to the scandal involving forced prepayment meter installations. Energy companies will pay over ¬£70 million in compensation and support following a review by Ofgem, which found suppliers fell short of required standards when switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. The scandal arose during the cost of living crisis, prompting investigations into British Gas and other firms forcing entry into homes. Ofgem has implemented a new code of practice with stricter conditions for prepayment meter installations, and enforcement investigations continue for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo.</p>

          <p>Starling Bank reported a 26% drop in annual profit before tax, totaling ¬£223.4 million, citing a ¬£29 million fine from the FCA for financial crime prevention system failures and issues with Covid-era Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) fraud. Revenue increased by 5% to ¬£714 million, a slowdown from the previous year's 50% growth. The BBLS, designed to provide firms with access to cash during the pandemic, had a 100% guarantee to lenders, making the government responsible for covering loan defaults.

          <p>According to Vanguard research, having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing income or asset levels. The survey found that individuals with emergency savings report greater improvements in financial well-being, reducing financial anxiety. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa emphasized that being prepared for unexpected expenses is crucial, as the median cost of an emergency is around $2,000. People with emergency savings spend less time worrying about finances and can handle sudden money stressors without incurring penalties from retirement accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

This eruption, the 23rd in a series since December 2024, occurred within a closed area of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, posing no immediate threat to nearby communities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many online fitness influencers promote the idea that high protein intake is essential for muscle growth, often recommending one gram of protein per pound of body weight. However, experts like Stuart Phillips argue that this recommendation is excessive and not supported by evidence. For muscle gain, the benefits of eating more protein top out at around 0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day, and the actual exercise is more important. The author also highlights that protein mania can push people to consume more animal products, which has negative environmental and ethical implications.</p>
