          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken multiple times in 2025, signaling significant financial growth and investment, particularly in the English WSL and American NWSL leagues. This rapid escalation in player fees is seen as a positive sign for the sport's ecosystem, reflecting increased visibility and marketability. However, the article also raises concerns that the surge in spending is creating a significant financial gap between the elite leagues and others, such as Germany's Bundesliga. This trend could lead to a lack of competitive balance, with a small number of wealthy clubs dominating the sport.</p>

          <p>Following the commencement of the U.S. government shutdown, financial markets across the Asia-Pacific region displayed a mixed and somewhat unperturbed reaction. Japan's Nikkei 225 index saw a decline for the fourth consecutive day, influenced by a business sentiment survey that fell short of expectations. In contrast, markets in South Korea and India posted gains, with the Reserve Bank of India deciding to hold its interest rates steady at 5.5%. The varied performance suggests that investors are assessing the shutdown's impact without immediate widespread panic, while also reacting to local economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

Kerr believes that being overlooked by pundits can work in their favor, allowing the team to focus on their performance without external pressure.

          <p>India's central bank has decided to keep its policy interest rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that aligned with economists' forecasts. The Reserve Bank of India is currently assessing the economic impact of previous rate cuts while navigating moderating inflation and potential growth slowdowns due to global trade uncertainties. The decision to pause was unanimous, with the bank's governor noting that the full effects of a significant rate cut in June have yet to materialize in the economy. This cautious approach reflects a desire for stability in an uncertain external environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is moving to establish a full stock market listing in the United States, a decision that could provide access to larger capital pools and potential inclusion in the S&P 500 index. While the company has stressed that its headquarters and tax residency will remain in the U.K., the move adds to a concerning trend of major firms shifting their primary listings away from the London Stock Exchange. This exodus has fueled debate about the LSE's global competitiveness and its ability to retain its most valuable companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting this week, England has banned price-based promotions, such as "buy one, get one free" deals, on food and drink products that are high in fat, sugar, or salt. The new restrictions apply to supermarkets, large retailers, and online stores and are a key part of the government's strategy to address the nation's rising obesity rates. Although the measure was delayed due to cost-of-living concerns, public health advocates have welcomed its implementation as a long-overdue step. They argue that such promotions encourage over-consumption rather than providing genuine savings to consumers.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a major energy infrastructure milestone, with its total network of subsea oil and gas pipelines now extending beyond 10,000 kilometers. This vast network is crucial for the country's efforts to enhance its energy security by exploring and developing offshore resources, particularly in areas like Bohai Bay. Looking ahead, China plans to expand the network to over 13,000 kilometers by 2030. The pipelines are also designed with future capabilities in mind, including the potential to transport green fuels such as hydrogen.</p>

          <p>In his first year as NATO's Secretary General, former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has been largely defined by his efforts to manage the alliance's relationship with a re-elected U.S. President Donald Trump. Foreign policy experts have generally graded his performance favorably, crediting his diplomatic skills with securing renewed U.S. commitment and persuading member states to increase defense spending. While his approach of flattering Trump has drawn some criticism, it is seen as a necessary strategy to maintain stability. However, the long-term effectiveness of his efforts and his ability to handle direct external threats remain key questions for his tenure.</p>

          <p>The UK government has mandated that all general practitioner practices in England must now offer patients the ability to book appointments online throughout the entire workday, from 8:00 to 18:30. This new requirement is designed to eliminate the frustrating "8am scramble" where patients compete for limited appointments via telephone. By providing a consistent digital option, the policy aims to improve patient convenience and access to care. It is also expected to free up phone lines for those with urgent medical needs or who are unable to use online services.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of their wild-card series, powered by a dominant offensive display. The team matched a franchise postseason record with five home runs, including two each by stars Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, and received a strong seven-inning start from pitcher Blake Snell. However, the win was marred by a shaky performance from the bullpen, which allowed three runs in the eighth inning and turned a comfortable lead into a tense situation, highlighting a potential vulnerability for the team moving forward.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A notable trend is emerging among young Americans, who are increasingly choosing skilled trades over traditional four-year college degrees. This shift is motivated by two primary factors: the high cost of tuition and mounting student loan debt, and a growing concern that artificial intelligence will automate many entry-level white-collar jobs. Careers such as electricians, plumbers, and welders are now seen by many in Gen Z as offering greater job security and a more direct path to financial independence and entrepreneurship, challenging the long-held belief that a college diploma is the only route to success.</p>

          <p>The millions of Americans who rely on Social Security benefits will continue to receive their monthly payments without interruption despite the U.S. government shutdown. The Social Security program is funded through mandatory spending, meaning its budget is not subject to the annual appropriations process that has stalled in Congress. However, while checks will still be issued, other services provided by the Social Security Administration could be disrupted. With a significant portion of its staff furloughed, there may be delays in processing new applications, replacing Medicare cards, or providing benefit verifications.</p>
