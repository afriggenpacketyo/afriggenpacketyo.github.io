          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a nationwide injunction, blocking a recent executive order from President Trump that aimed to terminate birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to non-citizen parents. The ruling prevents the policy from being implemented anywhere in the country while legal challenges proceed. This decision marks a significant judicial check on the administration's immigration policies, centering on the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has historically been understood to grant citizenship to nearly all individuals born on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which they believe could be the oldest comet ever observed, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. Preliminary findings from University of Oxford scientists suggest it originated from the Milky Way's "thick disk," a region of ancient stars. Composed largely of water ice, the object is expected to develop a glowing tail as it approaches the Sun later this year, making it visible with amateur telescopes. This discovery marks the third known interstellar visitor, offering a rare glimpse into a distant part of our galaxy.</p>

          <p>In response to growing concerns that billions of dollars from opioid settlements are being misused, two advocacy organizations have launched a crowdsourced database for the public to report potential waste and fraud. The initiative allows individuals to submit examples of questionable spending by state and local governments, which are then reviewed and published. This effort aims to increase transparency and pressure state attorneys general to ensure the funds, intended to combat the addiction crisis, are not diverted to fill unrelated budget gaps or for non-approved purposes.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has invested $400 million to become the largest shareholder in American miner MP Materials, a significant move in the U.S. effort to reduce its reliance on China for rare earth elements. These materials are critical for defense, technology, and green energy applications. However, an industry executive warns that achieving supply chain independence faces major hurdles, including a lack of midstream processing technology and environmental challenges associated with mining. The goal is to build a domestic capacity that could meet a substantial portion of U.S. strategic needs by the late 2020s.</p>

          <p>China's National Health Commission has banned a popular surgical procedure for Alzheimer's disease, known as lymphatic-venous anastomosis (LVA), citing a lack of scientific evidence for its safety and efficacy. The surgery, which aims to improve the drainage of harmful brain proteins, has been performed in hundreds of Chinese hospitals since 2021. The health authority stated that the therapy is still in an exploratory clinical research phase and has prohibited its use for treating Alzheimer's until high-quality medical studies can validate its benefits and define its risks.</p>

The trend persists despite a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, which a survey found would deter 43% of Norwegian EV drivers. Norway's robust EV market, supported by strong government incentives, has created a unique environment where the brand's appeal currently outweighs political concerns for many buyers.</p>
