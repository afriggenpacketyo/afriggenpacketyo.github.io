The review acknowledges public impatience for change, but relies on economic growth to improve the national mood and address financial constraints.

          <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is reportedly considering a move for some of BP's liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets, adding to the speculation that BP could be a takeover target. ADNOC's potential interest comes as BP faces underperformance relative to its peers, making it an attractive target for other oil majors like Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron. BP is seeking to restore investor confidence through a strategic reset, including increasing oil and gas spending while cutting back on renewables investment. While a full takeover of BP by ADNOC is unlikely, the interest highlights the value of BP's assets and the potential for strategic deals in the energy sector.</p>
