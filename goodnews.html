        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help address declining birth rates in China and other countries. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China grapples with a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce, prompting authorities to explore innovative policies to encourage higher birth rates. The study also highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the primary burden of childcare on women.</p>
