          <p>Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed President Trump's remark that he isn't "the easiest guy to deal with," stating he hopes it's because he is tough on matters concerning Israel's future. Netanyahu invoked the history of Jewish persecution and his role in ensuring the Jewish state's safety, including actions against Iran. Trump's initial comment was followed by praise for Netanyahu's job, indicating a complex but ultimately positive view. Netanyahu emphasized his responsibility to protect Israel, even if it means disagreeing with allies.</p>

Trump praised Kirk's impact in mobilizing young Americans and condemned "far-left radicals" for political violence.

          <p>Over 6,700 conservative Christian women gathered in Dallas, Texas, for the "Share the Arrows" conference, led by commentator Allie Beth Stuckey. The event aimed to inspire women to defend conservative beliefs about Scripture, family, abortion, gender, and sexuality. The conference also served as a rallying cry following the death of Charlie Kirk, who was viewed as a martyr for defending conservative values. Speakers addressed issues such as transgenderism, queer identity, and traditional gender roles.</p>

          <p>Students at Palo Alto High School successfully lobbied the Palo Alto Unified School District to reinstate a sustainability program manager. The position had been cut, which the students found disappointing, and they believe its renewal will help the district meet its sustainability goals. While the board has not officially approved the hiring, the move is seen as a positive step towards restoring the district's commitment to environmental initiatives. Advocates elsewhere are also making their voices heard in the effort for cleaner learning spaces.</p>
