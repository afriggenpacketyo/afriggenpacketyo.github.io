          <p>Reigning champion Tadej Pogačar has won stage seven of the Tour de France, reclaiming the yellow jersey from Mathieu van der Poel. The victory came on the iconic Mur-de-Bretagne climb, where Pogačar sprinted ahead of Jonas Vingegaard to secure the win. British rider Oscar Onley achieved a notable third-place finish, moving him up to seventh in the overall standings. The stage saw 2018 winner Geraint Thomas in a breakaway for much of the day before being caught by the peloton in the hilly final section of the race.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Eligibility for Credit Card Debt Forgiveness for Social Security Recipients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 12:33:29 EDT</div>

          <p>This article examines whether individuals living on Social Security can qualify for credit card debt forgiveness, a process of negotiating a reduced lump-sum payment with creditors. While Social Security income does not disqualify someone, the ability to save for a settlement, which averages 50-70% of the original debt, can be a significant hurdle for those on a fixed income. A key advantage for recipients is that federal law protects Social Security benefits from garnishment by most creditors, which can provide leverage in negotiations. The article suggests weighing this option against alternatives like credit counseling or debt management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article assesses the advantages and disadvantages of using high-yield savings accounts in July 2025, noting that while rates are still high, they may soon decline. Currently offering rates around 4.30%, these accounts provide a significant return compared to traditional savings, but potential Federal Reserve rate cuts could lead banks to preemptively lower these variable rates. A key benefit is the flexibility and access to funds, which is crucial amid economic uncertainty. However, the best rates are typically offered by online-only banks, which may be a drawback for those who prefer traditional branch banking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price soared to a new all-time high, surpassing $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency ETFs. On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion, signaling strong investor confidence. The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and the potential for an increased federal deficit, which can be a positive catalyst for bitcoin. This surge triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further propelling the price upward as traders covered their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing an autonomous AI software engineer named Devin, created by the startup Cognition, marking a significant milestone in AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers, initially handling tasks like updating internal code. This move signals a shift towards agentic AI, which can execute complex, multi-step jobs with minimal human oversight, potentially boosting worker productivity significantly. While raising anxieties about job displacement, Goldman envisions a "hybrid workforce" where humans supervise AI agents to streamline operations.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the interest-earning potential of depositing $10,000 into either a long-term or short-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) in the current market. While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage rates, long-term CDs ultimately generate significantly more interest due to the extended compounding period. For example, a top-rated one-year CD might yield around $440, whereas a five-year CD could earn nearly $2,300 on the same principal. The choice depends on the saver's financial goals and their need for liquidity, as long-term CDs require locking up funds for a longer duration. (not investment advice)</p>

Other states praised for their affordability include Kansas, Indiana, Missouri, and Alabama. The report highlights how some states have managed to keep costs for housing and everyday goods relatively low, making them attractive for both residents and businesses looking to mitigate the effects of inflation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that the national conversation about boosting U.S. birth rates, including debates over IVF, largely overlooks the significant role of male infertility. Despite male factors contributing to roughly half of infertility cases among heterosexual couples, men are often not evaluated, and treatments for them are less likely to be covered by insurance. The piece suggests that a politically viable path to improving fertility rates could involve expanding access to and coverage for male-specific infertility treatments. This approach could offer an alternative to the contentious IVF debate and more equitably distribute the burden of fertility care.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has weighed in on the U.S. Ryder Cup captaincy, suggesting that the American team's "player-led" approach differs significantly from Europe's. His comments come as Keegan Bradley is being considered for a potential playing-captain role, a concept McIlroy finds flawed. McIlroy believes the European team benefits from having a single, empowered figurehead like captain Luke Donald, which provides a clear focal point during high-pressure moments. He contrasted this with the U.S. team in Rome, which he felt lacked a central leader to turn to when they faced early difficulties.</p>
