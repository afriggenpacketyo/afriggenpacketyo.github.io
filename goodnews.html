        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Home Office and Treasury in talks about the upcoming Spending Review, Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has called on the police to embrace change and modernization. Kyle acknowledged financial pressures across society, including demands from doctors and universities, but emphasized the government's commitment to investing in schools and scientific research. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp voiced concerns over potential police budget cuts, while Kyle noted the government has already allocated an additional ¬£1 billion to policing, stressing the need for reform and technological upgrades. Police chiefs have previously warned that outdated technology is causing structural inefficiencies, with Reform UK advocating for reduced government spending across the board.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on how, during the Cold War, China was wary of American efforts to subvert the Communist Party through "peaceful evolution." Mao Zedong cautioned against the influence of Western values, especially after three generations. Now, China is a global economic power, while the U.S. has shifted away from nation-building. The author suggests that under Trump's leadership, the U.S. has lost its ability to influence China's political and social development, marking a significant shift in global power dynamics.</p>

          <p>This poem reflects on the insignificance of grand ambitions when compared to the appreciation of life's simple beauties. The speaker contrasts the desire to explore the cosmos or the ocean's depths with finding joy in the minutiae of everyday existence. References to nature, like gold flares in cottonwood leaves and the smell of pi√±on, highlight the beauty in the ordinary. The poem concludes with an understanding of life's explosive and generative nature, finding contentment in perseverance and simple observations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to find skilled workers to build and maintain airplanes. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic is 54, with a significant portion nearing retirement, leading to a projected shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people to the field, offering competitive wages and on-the-job training, yet challenges remain in filling these critical positions. High-value sectors like aviation are more likely to retain jobs in the U.S., but worker shortages and geographical immobility pose obstacles to meeting demand.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the journey of a story about an American football team in Chongqing, China, from a magazine article to Hollywood development and eventual Chinese production. The author reflects on the initial optimism surrounding US-China relations when the story was first published, leading to interest from Hollywood studios. However, as relations soured and China's film industry grew, the story was eventually adapted by a Chinese studio, reflecting a shift in cultural influence. The author observes that the Chinese adaptation, while borrowing the premise, tells a different story that reflects a more nationalistic perspective.</p>

          <p>A network of women in Latin America has transformed safe abortion practices by sharing information and providing support for self-managed abortions. Originating with the discovery of misoprostol's use for abortion in Brazil, activists spread knowledge and established hotlines and accompaniment networks. These efforts provided women with access to safe abortions despite legal restrictions, challenging traditional medical models. The movement culminated in the legalization of abortion in Argentina, demonstrating the power of grassroots activism and the importance of both legal and self-managed options for reproductive healthcare.</p>
