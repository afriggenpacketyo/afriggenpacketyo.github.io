          <p>The UK and the EU have reached a post-Brexit agreement regarding Gibraltar's status, aiming to avoid checks on people and goods crossing the Gibraltar-Spain border. Passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the system used for Eurostar passengers at St Pancras station. Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized that the agreement protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Chief Minister Fabian Picardo welcomed the deal as one that safeguards future generations of British Gibraltarians. The agreement seeks to resolve the territory's status and border issues that have been ongoing since Brexit, ensuring continued ease of movement for the thousands who cross the border daily. The agreement represents a significant step forward in EU-UK relations after Brexit.</p>

          <p>President Trump has hailed progress in trade talks with China, suggesting a reversal of damage caused by his own trade war. Two days of negotiations resulted in what leaders are calling a framework agreement intended to solidify the terms of a truce reached in Geneva last month. This development signals a potential de-escalation in trade tensions between the two countries, although details of the agreement and its long-term implications remain to be seen. The progress reported could have significant effects on global markets and economic stability.</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old man from New Jersey sustained minor injuries after being gored by a bison in Yellowstone National Park. This incident marks the second bison confrontation in a month, highlighting the dangers of disregarding warnings to keep a safe distance from the animals. Park officials require visitors to stay more than 25 yards away from large animals like bison, elk, and moose, and at least 100 yards away from bears, wolves, and cougars. Bison can be aggressive when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal, emphasizing the importance of respecting their space.</p>

          <p>Gold has become the second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' growing appetite for the precious metal, according to a European Central Bank report. Central banks' gold stockpiles are nearing levels last seen in the 1960s, making it second only to the U.S. dollar in value as a reserve holding. Emerging and developing countries find gold increasingly attractive due to concerns about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies. However, there are signs that central bank purchases may cool in the coming months, despite the ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty that has fueled the gold rally (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>This week's 125th US Open will feature the longest par-three hole in major championship history, measuring 301 yards. The eighth hole at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania has sparked debate, with some players calling it "ridiculous" and "silly." John Bodenhamer of the USGA aims to challenge players to use every club in their bag at a course known for being America's sternest test of golf. The psychology of par is expected to play a significant role, with players needing to adjust their approach to a hole typically played with a wood club.</p>

          <p>Meta has launched a new AI "world model" designed to enhance the understanding of 3D environments and physical object movements. The open-source AI model, V-JEPA 2, aims to enable AI systems to learn, plan, and make decisions in a more human-like manner. For example, the model can recognize that a ball rolling off a table will fall, or that an object hidden out of view hasn't vanished. This development is part of Meta's broader focus on artificial intelligence, as the company competes with players like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google.</p>

          <p>New findings from Vanguard indicate that having emergency savings of at least $2,000 is linked to a 21% higher level of financial well-being. Respondents with no emergency savings reported lower productivity due to increased financial stress. Maintaining an emergency savings account can help individuals avoid debt and minimize the disruption caused by unplanned expenses. Experts recommend setting a goal of stashing at least $1,000 as quickly as possible and treating emergency savings as a monthly bill.</p>

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-European government won a parliamentary vote of confidence, days after a stinging presidential election defeat. The vote came after right-wing nationalist Karol Nawrocki, backed by the opposition Law and Justice party, narrowly beat Tusk's candidate in the presidential election. Tusk is seeking to reassert his authority and rally support for his coalition, which aims to reverse judicial reforms and address issues like abortion rights. The confidence vote signals continued support for Tusk's government despite recent setbacks.</p>
