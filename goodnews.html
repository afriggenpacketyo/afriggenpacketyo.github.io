        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled against the Trump administration's policy that denied entry to individuals seeking asylum at the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss stated that the President lacks the constitutional or federal immigration law authority to implement such a ban, which was enacted on Trump's first day in office. Immigrant rights groups, who filed the lawsuit, argued the proclamation endangered thousands fleeing persecution. This significant decision reaffirms the 1980 U.S. asylum law, preventing the executive branch from unilaterally altering the established immigration system.</p>

          <p>Mercosur, South America's largest trade bloc, and the four-nation European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have signed a comprehensive free trade agreement after a decade of negotiations. This deal creates a free trade area encompassing nearly 300 million people and a combined GDP exceeding $4.3 trillion, aiming to boost bilateral trade by improving market access for over 97% of exports. The agreement, which covers goods, services, investment, and intellectual property, still requires parliamentary approval from member countries. This significant pact follows a similar, unratified deal between Mercosur and the European Union, marking a new chapter in global trade relations.</p>

The agreement also stipulates that Vietnam will grant the U.S. "total access" to its markets with zero tariffs on American products. Additionally, a steeper 40% tariff will apply to goods trans-shipped through Vietnam, addressing concerns about Chinese products avoiding tariffs. This deal follows Vietnam becoming a major manufacturing hub and is expected to impact share prices of companies with operations there. (not investment advice)</p>
