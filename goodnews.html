          <p>Located in the hills outside Rome, the Vatican Observatory has worked for over a century to reconcile the domains of faith and science. Established in 1891, the institution serves as a center for astronomical research, aiming to demonstrate the Catholic Church's support for scientific inquiry. The article highlights how scientists and students at the observatory view their study of the heavens as a powerful means to unite people across different beliefs. This effort seeks to move past historical conflicts, such as the Galileo affair, by fostering dialogue and shared discovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has voted to advance a significant piece of Republican legislation, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," after a prolonged period of negotiation with four conservative holdouts. The senators, including Ron Johnson who switched his vote at the last minute, agreed to proceed after securing a promise for a future vote on an amendment to alter Medicaid funding. While this procedural vote marks a victory for GOP leadership and former President Trump, the bill's final passage remains uncertain as some Republicans have not committed their ultimate support. Democrats have initiated a lengthy reading of the 1,000-page bill, potentially delaying the final vote.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Gen Z Is Leading a New Sexual Revolution by Redefining Norms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:00:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article, adapted from a forthcoming book, argues that Generation Z is spearheading a new sexual revolution, challenging older narratives about their sex lives. It pushes back against both the "hookup culture" panic of the 2000s and the current "sex recession" theory, suggesting that while Gen Z may be having less partnered sex, they are more politically engaged with issues of sexuality and identity than previous generations. The piece explores how this generation, shaped by the post-Roe landscape and online discourse, is actively redefining concepts like virginity and gender roles, making them perhaps the most sexually progressive generation in history.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year career for the country's workhorse space vehicle. The liquid-fuel rocket, a joint development by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, has been a cornerstone of Japan's space program. The H2A series is now being succeeded by the new H3 rocket, which is designed to be more cost-effective and competitive in the global launch market. This final mission represents a significant milestone as Japan transitions to its next generation of space transportation technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to avert a major rebellion from its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the initial rollout was mishandled and that concerns from over 120 MPs led to a stronger final package. Key changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit rises with inflation. Rebel MPs have indicated they will now support the bill, highlighting a moment of internal party pressure successfully influencing government policy.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla's stock has seen a monumental rise, turning a $10,000 investment into nearly $3 million. The article traces the company's evolution from a niche electric sports car maker to a global automotive giant with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. However, the company now faces significant headwinds, including sluggish sales in 2025, an aging vehicle lineup, and increased competition. CEO Elon Musk is pivoting the company's narrative toward future technologies like autonomous driving and humanoid robots, though Wall Street remains skeptical, and the stock has underperformed this year.
