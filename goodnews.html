          <p>Hurricane Erin has intensified into a Category 3 storm in the Caribbean, with forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicting it will reach Category 4 strength. While the storm is not projected to make landfall on the continental U.S., its powerful winds are impacting nearby islands, leading to warnings of potential flooding and landslides. Tropical storm watches are in effect for several islands, and U.S. authorities have deployed FEMA personnel to Puerto Rico as a precautionary measure. The storm is the fifth named storm of what is expected to be a busy Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Samsung is narrowing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its market share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's share declined. This shift is largely attributed to the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors and command higher prices. While Apple still leads the U.S. market, its recent stagnation in design and delayed entry into the foldable market have created an opening for Samsung's wider range of products. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable phone by 2026 to compete. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colleagues are fondly remembering Ted Clark, a veteran NPR journalist and editor who passed away at the age of 79. Clark, who had a distinguished career covering the White House and State Department before helping lead the International Desk, is being celebrated for his gentle demeanor, patience, and unwavering support for his fellow reporters. Friends and former colleagues recalled his exceptional ability to nurture talent and his deep sense of reverence and humanity, exemplified by his Peabody Award-winning reporting on children affected by civil war in Mozambique. His legacy is marked by both his journalistic integrity and his profound kindness.</p>

          <p>Following the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, key European leaders have issued a joint statement reaffirming their strong support for Ukraine. The leaders of Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, along with EU officials, insisted that Russia cannot have veto power over Ukraine's future membership in NATO or the European Union. The coalition also stated that there could be no limitations on Ukraine's military as part of any peace deal. The statement signals Europe's intent to maintain pressure on Russia through sanctions until a just and lasting peace is achieved.</p>

She achieved the 5k milestone just four weeks after undergoing heart surgery, demonstrating remarkable determination and resilience. Chambers began running at age 88 and has since become a beloved local legend, inspiring her community and even running alongside Olympian Dame Kelly Holmes. Despite her achievements, she remains humble, hoping her story encourages others to take up running. Her cardiologist, who performed her recent surgery, was present to cheer her on at the event.</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American archaeology student from Newcastle University, discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first excavation in Northumberland, England. The artifact, believed to be a high-status item, was found near the route of Dere Street, a major Roman road that remained in use long after the empire's fall. The discovery was made at a site where a similar object was found in 2021, leading experts to believe the pair may have been deliberately buried for ceremonial or religious purposes. The piece will undergo further analysis and may eventually be displayed in a local museum.</p>

          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic drop in violent crime, with homicides falling to levels not seen in 50 years. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that combines focused deterrence with social support, rather than a return to zero-tolerance policing. Led by Mayor Brandon Scott, the plan targets individuals most at risk of committing or becoming victims of gun violence, offering them services like housing and job training while also enforcing strict legal consequences for those who refuse help. This multi-faceted approach, involving community leaders, social workers, and law enforcement, has shown impressive results, though recent federal funding cuts threaten its continuity.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that Americans, on average, believe the ideal age to begin saving for retirement is 27, with a target retirement age of 58. However, certified financial planners emphasize the significant benefits of starting even earlier, highlighting the power of compound interest over a longer period. While a three-decade savings window is considered workable, starting in one's early 20s can dramatically increase the final nest egg. Data shows younger generations like Gen Z and millennials are already starting to save earlier than their Gen X and baby boomer predecessors, potentially putting them on a better financial footing for retirement.

          <p>The recent summit in Alaska between President Trump and Vladimir Putin concluded with positive rhetoric but no concrete deal to end the war in Ukraine, setting the stage for crucial follow-on negotiations. While both leaders described the talks as productive, Putin's implicit demands for territorial concessions and sanctions relief remain significant hurdles. The article suggests that for any potential ceasefire to be effective, it must be backed by stringent verification mechanisms and a non-negotiable stance on Ukrainian sovereignty. The outcome of this diplomatic pause will depend on whether the U.S. and its allies can maintain a unified front and leverage sanctions effectively.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the ability for social learning in communication may date back millions of years to the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. Researchers observing wild chimpanzees in Uganda found that young chimps acquire their specific patterns of combining vocal sounds and physical gestures primarily from their mothers and maternal relatives, not from their fathers. Because a chimp's early life is spent almost exclusively with its mother, this maternal influence points to learned behavior rather than genetic inheritance. This mirrors how human infants learn from their primary caregivers, suggesting a deep evolutionary root for social communication.</p>

This groundbreaking effort aims to conserve the iconic plant by identifying future habitats, limiting development, and reducing wildfire risks. The plan, however, has faced controversy from some local officials and residents in high desert communities, who argue the regulations are costly and stifle growth by requiring permits and fees for removing the trees. Proponents hail it as a vital, forward-looking step to save a species that is currently abundant but projected to lose much of its range.</p>
