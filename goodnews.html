          <p>Germany is experiencing a golden age in basketball, with recent Eurobasket and World Championship titles. However, the rise of Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) provisions in US colleges poses a significant challenge to domestic German basketball, as top young talents are increasingly opting to play in the US. The financial incentives offered by American collegiate sports, now akin to professional European leagues, threaten to alter the development structure for European players. German league officials are advocating for compensation for player training, highlighting the need for international agreements to address this evolving landscape and protect local talent pipelines.</p>

          <p>The sun's 11-year solar cycle is set to peak in 2025, bringing more intense solar flares and raising concerns about potential disruptions to global power grids and internet infrastructure. A 2021 study highlighted the vulnerability of internet communication, particularly unprotected satellites and undersea cable repeaters, to severe solar storms. The article recounts historical events like the 1859 Carrington Event and the 1989 Quebec power outage, illustrating the potential for widespread, long-term outages. Suggestions include shifting infrastructure south, using shorter connections, and implementing additional overhead cables to enhance resilience against future solar activity.</p>

          <p>China's government has introduced a comprehensive 19-point plan aimed at stimulating domestic service consumption and driving economic growth. The measures include relaxing market access and increasing supply across sectors like culture, sports, and healthcare. Authorities also pledged to extend museum hours, attract international sports events, and reduce bureaucracy for foreign and private investment in high-end medical care. Additionally, the plan seeks to expand visa-free access for foreign visitors and encourage financial institutions to provide more lending and interest subsidies for consumer loans, signaling a strong pivot towards internal demand.

          <p>China Eastern Airlines has commenced ticket sales for its new Shanghai-Buenos Aires route, marketing it as the "world's longest direct flight" and the first commercial route connecting antipodal cities. The journey, scheduled for up to 29 hours on the return leg, includes a two-hour stop in Auckland, New Zealand, allowing passengers to disembark. The airline claims an unusual southerly flight path near Antarctica will shave hours off the total travel time. While branded "direct," the stopover distinguishes it from nonstop record holders like Singapore Airlines' New York route, highlighting marketing nuances in long-haul aviation.</p>

          <p>British pharmaceutical giant GSK announced a commitment to invest at least $30 billion in US research and development (R&D) and manufacturing over the next five years. This significant investment, including $1.2 billion for advanced manufacturing and AI technologies, coincides with President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK. The article notes this move aligns with a broader trend of global pharma firms increasing US investments under pressure from the Trump administration to bolster domestic manufacturing and reduce drug prices.
