        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's cricket captain, Pat Cummins, is facing a difficult recovery from a back injury that could see him miss the first Ashes Test against England in Perth. Teammate Nathan Lyon stated that while a return for the opener is unlikely, it is "realistic" that the fast bowler could be fit for the second Test in Brisbane. Cummins, 32, is considered a crucial part of the team, and his absence would be a significant setback for Australia's campaign. Selectors remain hopeful he will play a major part in the five-match series, giving him additional time to prove his fitness before subsequent games.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chef Roy Choi, known for his Korean-Mexican fusion cuisine, is advocating for a more vegetable-forward diet in his latest cookbook, "The Choi of Cooking." He suggests three key strategies to make vegetables more appealing: prepping produce in advance restaurant-style, creating flavorful homemade sauces to enhance dishes, and judiciously using MSG to add a savory umami flavor. Choi argues that these techniques make healthy cooking more convenient and satisfying, helping people move away from processed foods. His approach aims to make vegetables a crave-worthy component of meals rather than a bland obligation.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham is preparing for the highly anticipated El Clasico match against Barcelona, which serves as a crucial stage for him to reaffirm his form. After being left out of the recent England squad, the midfielder is keen to deliver a statement performance, especially with a potential on-field rivalry against Barcelona's English forward, Marcus Rashford. Having recovered from shoulder surgery, Bellingham has been gradually regaining his top form, recently scoring a winning goal in the Champions League. Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso is reportedly focused on restoring Bellingham to his effective, box-arriving role.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: Claims of Widespread German Christmas Market Cancellations Are False</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 04:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Viral social media claims that Germany has canceled hundreds of its famous Christmas markets for 2025 are false, according to a fact-check investigation. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like low revenue or renovations, major markets in cities like Berlin, Dresden, and Cologne are proceeding as planned. The false narrative appears to originate from a single, unverified article that cited unaffordable security costs and misrepresented the status of markets in specific towns. In reality, despite rising security expenses following past attacks, there is no evidence of widespread cancellations across the country.</p>

          <p>As daylight hours shorten with the end of daylight saving time, many people, particularly in northern latitudes like Scotland, face challenges with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Experts recommend several coping strategies, including using therapeutic light lamps to counteract the lack of natural light and adopting new "light routines" that encourage outdoor activity. A project at the University of Glasgow is providing "Wintering Well" boxes with these tools to residents of the Orkney Islands. The initiative also emphasizes a psychological shift towards embracing winter and redesigning indoor spaces to be more welcoming and well-lit.</p>

          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina decided to back the AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022 after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski, long before the company achieved its multi-billion dollar valuation. Reina was impressed by Staniszewski's technical expertise and vision for creating natural-sounding AI voices, a niche that was largely ignored by other venture capitalists at the time. ElevenLabs, which specializes in text-to-speech and voice cloning, has since grown exponentially, recently allowing employees to sell shares at a $6.6 billion valuation. Reina's investment strategy focuses on identifying technically proficient founders in overlooked, pre-seed stage industries.</p>

          <p>Authorities have uncovered and dismantled the first known illegal factory producing weight loss drugs in the United Kingdom, located in Northampton. The operation resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight loss medicine by a law enforcement agency globally. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confiscated thousands of unlicensed Retatrutide and Tirzepatide pens, raw ingredients, and manufacturing equipment. Officials warned the public about the severe dangers of purchasing such unauthorized products online, which are untested and potentially deadly, while profiting organized criminal networks.</p>
