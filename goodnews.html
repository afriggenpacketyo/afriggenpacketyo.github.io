          <p>This article reports on Japanese mathematician Masaki Kashiwara, the first Japanese recipient of the Abel Prize, who speaks about his lifelong love for mathematics and the beauty he finds in new discoveries. Kashiwara expresses concern about Japan's math education system, which he believes may discourage students due to its emphasis on memorization. He highlights the importance of fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation for mathematics, while also noting the potential he sees in China's proactive approach to attracting specialists in the field.</p>

          <p>The first blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease will be available in the US starting in late June, developed by Japanese company Fujirebio Holdings. The test, cleared by the FDA, detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, and will initially be available at specialized research institutes and hospitals. This non-invasive test offers a quicker and more affordable alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially improving access to new Alzheimer's treatments.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 00:00:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the media's focus on young men supposedly driving the rise of the far right, arguing that the more significant trend is the leftward shift among young women. While a gender gap exists in support for far-right parties, it's primarily due to young women increasingly embracing progressive values. The article criticizes the male gaze in media, which prioritizes men's views and reinforces far-right narratives. It suggests that center-left parties should focus on the priorities of female voters, such as climate action and social welfare, to transform the political debate and mobilize young women.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 00:00:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing appeal of Chengdu, an inland city in southwestern China, as an alternative to the country's hypercompetitive coastal megacities. Chengdu's population has surged, and its real estate market is booming, reflecting a disillusionment among young people who are seeking a more relaxed lifestyle and affordable living. The city's thriving entertainment sector, vibrant LGBTQ community, and proximity to giant panda reserves further contribute to its attractiveness. As China's economy faces uncertainties, Chengdu's focus on the service sector and quality of life is drawing in more residents.</p>

          <p>A new test has been developed that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumours from weeks to just hours, which researchers say. Surgeons have described the "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing as a "game changer" and say it could improve care and treatment for thousands of patients. The method has been developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with clinicians at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH).</p>
