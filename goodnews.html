          <p>For over two centuries, the U.S. Constitution has been a foundational yet adaptable document, designed by its framers to be amended by future generations. Historian Jill Lepore's latest book emphasizes that the founders expected constant revision and that the initial ratification was narrowly supported. Key changes, such as the Bill of Rights and the post-Civil War amendments abolishing slavery, demonstrate its intended flexibility. The article also explores modern concerns that the system of checks and balances is faltering, with the Supreme Court becoming more powerful than originally envisioned.</p>

          <p>Americans are expected to spend a record $13.1 billion on Halloween this year, but they will be paying more for their spooky celebrations. Rising costs are affecting everything from candy to costumes, with cocoa prices more than doubling due to poor harvests in West Africa, impacting chocolate prices. Additionally, tariffs on Chinese imports are increasing the cost of costumes and decorations. In response, many consumers, particularly Gen Z, are turning to budget-friendly strategies like creating DIY decorations and reusing items from previous years to manage their spending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed companies involved in the rare earth mineral supply chain experienced significant gains, driven by investor optimism about domestic production. This market rally follows recent Chinese export restrictions and a new agreement between the U.S. and Australia to develop a joint supply chain independent of China. The Trump administration has signaled its intent to support the domestic industry with measures like price floors to combat market manipulation. Investors anticipate further government backing for American miners to secure a stable supply of these critical technology and defense materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of steel manufacturer Cleveland-Cliffs jumped over 20% after the company announced it is exploring the possibility of mining rare earths. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated that geological surveys have indicated the presence of these critical minerals at two of the company's sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This move aligns with the U.S. government's strategy to reduce reliance on China for rare earths, which are essential for manufacturing in sectors like defense and electric vehicles. The market's strong positive reaction reflects investor speculation about potential government support for such domestic ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have signed a formal agreement to bolster the supply chain for critical minerals and rare earths, independent of China. The framework includes plans for projects valued at up to $8.5 billion, with an initial joint investment of over $3 billion in the next six months. This strategic partnership aims to counter China's dominance in the sector, particularly after Beijing announced new export controls on these materials. The minerals are vital for high-tech manufacturing, including defense systems, semiconductors, and electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple's stock price surged to a record close on Monday, driven by a new report showing robust early sales for the iPhone 17. According to Counterpoint research, sales of the new model in its first ten days in the U.S. and China were 14% higher than the previous year's iPhone 16. Analysts highlighted the value of the base model, which offers significant upgrades for the same price. The strong consumer demand prompted investment bank Loop Capital to upgrade Apple's stock to a buy, suggesting that Wall Street may still be underestimating the new iPhone's potential market performance.

Funded primarily by private donations, the program is based on global evidence showing that such direct aid helps families afford essentials like rent, food, and baby supplies.

However, the article also notes that there can be exceptions, such as executing a conversion earlier in the year during a market downturn to convert assets at a lower value and potentially reduce the upfront tax bill.
