          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four people, including a 17-year-old, in connection with recent cyberattacks on retailers M&S and the Co-op. The attacks, which began in mid-April, involved data theft and ransomware, causing significant operational disruption and an estimated £300 million in lost profits for M&S. The arrests were made on suspicion of computer misuse, blackmail, and organized crime activities, with police seizing numerous electronic devices. This action is described as a significant step in an ongoing international investigation to bring those responsible to justice.</p>

          <p>Chocolate maker Ferrero has agreed to purchase cereal company WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, causing WK Kellogg's stock to surge by 30%. The acquisition marks another step in the consolidation of the packaged foods industry, as traditional cereal brands face declining sales. For the Italian-owned Ferrero, this move deepens its expansion into the U.S. market, following other major acquisitions like Nestle's U.S. candy business. The deal is expected to close in the latter half of the year, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S., through a $400 million stock purchase. This investment aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earths, which are critical components for military technology like F-35 jets and drones, reducing reliance on China. The deal will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing and magnet production, including a new manufacturing facility. The move is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to secure critical mineral independence.</p>

          <p>Chicago Sky star Angel Reese has been announced as one of the cover athletes for the NBA 2K26 video game, an honor that has previously been given to only a few WNBA players. The announcement, which coincided with the launch of her signature Reebok shoe, has generated significant discussion and some backlash from fans who believed Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark was a more expected choice. The debate continues a public narrative that has linked the two players since their 2023 NCAA championship matchup. A 2K executive stated Reese was chosen for being bold, confident, and a visionary.</p>

          <h2>Vietnam to Significantly Increase Alcohol Taxes to Address Public Health Concerns</h2>

          <p>Vietnam's government has approved a plan to raise the special consumption tax on alcohol from 65% to 90% by 2031, aiming to curb what it sees as harmful drinking habits. The move comes as the country grapples with high rates of alcohol consumption, which is cited as the second-leading cause of death. While public health advocates like the WHO praise the policy, the alcohol industry has raised concerns, pointing to already declining sales and the risk of pushing consumers toward a dangerous unregulated market. The tax hike is also seen as a way to fund Vietnam's expanding public healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Nepal is experiencing a significant surge in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, with the number of EVs increasing from 250 in 2020 to over 13,000 in 2024. This shift is driven by government policies that favor EVs with lower taxes compared to gasoline cars, and growing public awareness of severe air pollution in cities like Kathmandu. The government has set ambitious targets, aiming for 90% of new private vehicles sold by 2030 to be electric. The transition is seen as a key strategy to reduce the nation's carbon emissions and improve public health, leveraging its abundant hydropower resources for clean energy.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' shares rose significantly after the company reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and provided a strong forecast for summer travel. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while consumer booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, demand has stabilized, particularly for premium seats and corporate travel. The airline's second-quarter performance exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by strong sales from higher-priced cabins and its lucrative American Express partnership. Despite trimming some capacity, the airline's positive outlook provided a boost to the entire airline sector.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear" by Brian Anderson, details the history of the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a massive and innovative sound system from the early 1970s. The system was an ambitious attempt to provide perfect, uniform audio for the entire audience by placing a gigantic array of speakers and amps directly behind the band. While utopian in concept, the wall was a logistical nightmare, weighing as much as a dozen elephants and proving incredibly complex and expensive to transport and operate. The book argues this technological hubris ultimately contributed to the band's temporary hiatus in 1974.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a method for savers to protect their money from inflation, with top accounts currently offering rates that exceed the inflation rate. The article notes a significant difference between national average CD yields and the higher rates available, particularly from online banks which have lower overhead costs. Currently, short-term CDs, such as those with 6-month or 1-year terms, are offering more competitive rates than longer-term options, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. Savers are advised to compare rates from different institutions to maximize their returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At OPEC's recent seminar, key discussions centered on three main topics: the energy transition, the oil market outlook, and production capacity. Ministers advocated for a pragmatic approach to the green transition that includes continued investment in oil and gas to ensure energy security and avoid supply shortages. OPEC's latest outlook projects that oil demand will continue to grow through 2050, with oil and gas remaining over 50% of the global energy mix. Consequently, officials renewed calls for massive investment, estimated at $18.2 trillion by 2050, to meet future demand and offset declines from mature fields.</p>

          <p>Following a comment by President Trump about the Liberian president's "good English," this article outlines the unique historical ties between Liberia and the United States. Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, and English is its official language, explaining the American-style accent common there. The nation's capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and its flag was designed to resemble the American flag. These connections are a result of the American Colonization Society's efforts to resettle freed Black Americans in West Africa during the colonial era.</p>

          <p>North Carolina has been named America's Top State for Business for 2025 by CNBC, praised for its strong economy, skilled workforce, and business-friendly environment. The state has successfully attracted major investments, including a new jet factory and Amazon data centers, fueled by healthy GDP growth and a net in-migration of college-educated workers. However, the report also highlights challenges, ranking the state poorly for quality of life and worker protections. The state also faces economic headwinds from potential federal budget cuts and the financial impact of recent hurricane damage.</p>

As Kyiv prepares to loosen export restrictions, Ukrainian companies hope to leverage their unique battlefield experience to attract investment and form joint ventures, potentially producing drones outside Ukraine to protect manufacturing from attack. While European nations are also developing their own drone capabilities, Ukrainian firms argue their deep understanding of modern warfare tactics and countermeasures provides a strategic advantage that can benefit the continent's rearmament efforts.</p>
