          <p>A U.S. court has sentenced Qingzhou Wang, a principal executive of the Wuhan-based company Amarvel Biotech, to 25 years in prison for trafficking chemicals used to produce fentanyl. Wang and a marketing manager were convicted in New York for fentanyl precursor importation and money laundering, marking the first time the U.S. has charged Chinese companies for trafficking these chemicals directly into the country rather than to Mexico. The Drug Enforcement Administration described the company as a "pipeline of poison," highlighting the U.S. government's increasing focus on Chinese suppliers in the fight against the fentanyl crisis. The case had previously drawn strong condemnation from Beijing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call, though Beijing has not officially confirmed the agreement. The deal would reportedly involve selling TikTok's U.S. business to a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, allowing the app to continue operating in the country while licensing algorithm technology from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A key point of contention remains the ownership and control of the powerful algorithm that serves content to 170 million American users. Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern that the deal may not fully sever the app's ties to potential Chinese government influence.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the system will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters for the next several days. Its current projected track shows it moving north of the Caribbean islands and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the storm could pass east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify, potentially bringing some impacts to the island.</p>

Inspired after her own grandfather was targeted, Manoj created "Shield Seniors," a website and app designed to educate older adults on how to identify and report online fraud. She gives presentations at community centers, teaching seniors about the increasing sophistication of scams, many of which now use artificial intelligence. Her app utilizes AI to help users analyze messages for potential threats, providing a crucial tool for a vulnerable population that lost billions to such schemes last year.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Exporters Use Nanning Trade Fair to Target Southeast Asian Markets Amid Slowing Western Demand</h2>

          <p>Chinese companies are increasingly using an annual trade fair in Nanning as a strategic platform to pivot towards Southeast Asian markets. Faced with saturating and slowing demand from traditional markets in Europe and America, many exporters see the region's rapidly growing economies and large, young consumer base as a significant opportunity for expansion. An electric scooter manufacturer from Jiangxi province exemplified this trend, stating that Southeast Asia offers "huge potential" for growth. This shift highlights a broader strategic realignment in global trade as Chinese firms actively seek new avenues for their products and diversify their international footprints.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, supermodel David Gandy reflected on his career, the pay disparity between male and female models, and his concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence on the fashion industry. Gandy, who became a household name through his work with Dolce & Gabbana, stated he was inspired by female supermodels and sought to "even things up" for male models. He is now among over 2,000 models calling on the UK government to regulate generative AI, fearing it could make models, photographers, and other artists redundant. The 45-year-old also spoke about fiercely guarding his family's privacy and his life away from the camera.</p>

          <p>A recent surge of investment in the UK by American tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google is fueling discussion about whether this "bromance" can revitalize the British economy. The deals, highlighted during President Trump's state visit, position the UK as a potential AI superpower, with U.S. tech leaders expressing great enthusiasm for the country's research capabilities. However, critics like former Deputy PM Nick Clegg argue that the UK is merely taking "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table" and exporting its best ideas. The trend suggests a strategic alignment with the U.S. on tech policy, which could transform the UK into a global tech laboratory but also raises questions about economic dependency.

          <p>The Los Angeles comedy show "Pupusas and Punchlines," held in a Salvadoran restaurant, provides a vital platform for Latinx and other underrepresented comedians. Created by producer Justin Alexio, the weekly event combines food and culture, allowing performers to connect with an audience over shared experiences of immigration and identity in a supportive environment. In a competitive scene where Latinx comics often struggle for stage time, the show has become a sold-out success, helping performers grow their social media presence and build community. The atmosphere allows for jokes and topics that might not land in more mainstream comedy clubs, fostering a unique connection between the comics and the local audience.</p>
