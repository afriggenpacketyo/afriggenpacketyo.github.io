          <p>Following the United States' strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany issued a joint statement emphasizing their commitment to regional peace and stability and affirming support for Israel's security. The leaders, Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer, and Friedrich Merz, called on Iran to engage in negotiations aimed at reaching an agreement that addresses concerns about its nuclear program. They also urged Iran to refrain from actions that could further destabilize the region, emphasizing the importance of diplomatic solutions to de-escalate tensions. The joint statement underscores the international community's continued focus on preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The statement shows that these nations are working towards a peaceful resolution. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following US military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, American leaders, including President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have urged Iran to engage diplomatically rather than retaliate. Trump emphasized the need for peace, warning of dire consequences for Iran if it continues on its current path. Hegseth clarified that the strikes were intentionally limited to nuclear facilities and were not aimed at regime change, with Vance adding that the US is at war with Iran's nuclear program, not Iran itself. US officials are sending direct messages to Iran, offering opportunities for peaceful negotiations, and are prepared for potential Iranian responses. This is a calculated attempt to de-escalate the conflict. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by lowering energy costs for businesses. The plan, described by Prime Minister Starmer as a turning point for the British economy, includes scrapping green levies to reduce energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK firms. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027, exempting manufacturers from levies on bills, while the most energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges. The strategy also focuses on upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and increasing research and development spending to ¬£22.6bn per year by 2029-30. This initiative aims to create over one million new well-paid jobs over the next decade. </p>

          <p>A woman installed a fence on her property after months of her neighbor's children disturbing her yard, which resolved the issues with the children. However, the neighbors are now complaining that the fence makes it difficult to park their cars in their driveway. The neighbors asked if the woman could move the fence further onto her property, but this would impact her own ability to park two cars in her driveway. The woman is seeking advice on whether she would be unreasonable to decline their request, as the fence is on her property. </p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is ready to meet with Iran following the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, but warned that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move. Rubio emphasized that the U.S. has no current plans for further attacks on Iran unless "they mess around." He urged Iran to pursue diplomacy, stating that the U.S. is prepared to do a deal that's good for them, the Iranian people, and good for the world. Rubio also noted that closing the strait would have a lot more impact on the rest of the world, particularly on China. </p>
