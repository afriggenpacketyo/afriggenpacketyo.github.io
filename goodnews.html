          <p>President Trump announced that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, which would involve a sale to American investors like Oracle. While Trump expressed confidence on Truth Social, Chinese state media offered a more reserved confirmation, stating Beijing welcomes negotiations based on market rules. A key point of contention remains the ownership of TikTok's powerful content algorithm. The leaders also agreed to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea, signaling progress on broader trade discussions despite ongoing concerns from some U.S. lawmakers about the deal's security implications.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm is currently projected to remain over open waters and poses no immediate threat to land. Forecasters anticipate that Gabrielle will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday as it tracks north of the Caribbean. While its path is expected to keep it away from the U.S. mainland, the system could pass east of Bermuda early next week, potentially bringing some impacts to the island as it continues to intensify.</p>

          <p>Chinese manufacturing and export companies are increasingly turning their focus toward Southeast Asia as a primary growth market, using a trade fair in Nanning as a key testing ground. Faced with saturated and slowing demand from traditional markets in Europe and the United States, these firms are attracted to Southeast Asia's rapidly growing economies and large, youthful consumer base. Exporters, such as an electric scooter manufacturer from Jiangxi, see the region as offering immense untapped potential for expansion. This strategic shift reflects a broader realignment in global trade patterns as Chinese businesses seek new avenues for growth and market diversification.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, citing procedural flaws and improper language in the complaint. Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page filing was excessively long and resembled a "political document rather than a serious legal filing." The lawsuit alleged that several articles and a book by the newspaper's reporters were intended to undermine his 2024 presidential campaign. While the judge did not rule on the legal merits, he gave Trump's lawyers 28 days to submit a revised, more concise, and professionally drafted complaint.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, supermodel David Gandy reflected on his nearly 25-year career and expressed significant concerns about the rise of artificial intelligence in the fashion industry. He is part of a group of over 2,000 models calling on the UK government for regulations to protect human likenesses from being used by generative AI. Gandy worries that AI-generated models, already being used in campaigns, threaten the livelihoods of not just models but also photographers, makeup artists, and other creative professionals. He also raised concerns about the potential negative mental health impact of AI-generated imagery on young people.</p>

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy has confirmed that a 'Peaky Blinders' film is forthcoming from Netflix, though he remains tight-lipped about the plot to maintain surprise for the audience. Reflecting on his iconic role as Tommy Shelby, which he played for six series, Murphy described the experience as a defining privilege but emphasized that he is nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed. The Oscar-winning actor is currently promoting his new film, 'Steve,' in which he plays a headteacher at a reform school for troubled boys. He credits the success of 'Peaky Blinders' to its writing and its timing.</p>
