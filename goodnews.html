The chain will also switch from high fructose corn syrup to real sugar in its ketchup. These changes are part of a broader effort to 'Make America Healthy Again,' as the dyes have been linked to neurological problems in some children. </p>

          <p>China attracted a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite President Trump‚Äôs tariff war. This contrasts with market concerns over soaring Treasury yields and Moody‚Äôs downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift reflects a broader trend of investors moving away from US dollar assets since the trade war's inception. Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker US dollar, peak US bond yields, and China's economic recovery are factors favoring emerging markets. </p>

          <p>China cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in seven months, as a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions offer room for monetary easing. The People's Bank of China trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders reduced their deposit rates, paving the way to lower key lending rates. Capital Economics forecasts further rate cuts by year-end.

The measure moved forward in a 66-32 vote after gaining the support of some Democratic holdouts. Sen.
