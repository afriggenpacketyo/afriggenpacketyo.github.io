          <p>Panama has unveiled its "Vision 2025–2035" strategy to modernize the Panama Canal, focusing on new infrastructure projects to maintain its global competitiveness. The plan includes a new reservoir, a liquefied petroleum gas pipeline, and expanded container terminals. Canal administrator Ricardo Vazquez Morales highlighted the need to accommodate rising energy exports from the U.S. to Asia. However, the announcement avoided addressing questions regarding potential Chinese ownership or influence in these critical infrastructure developments, a topic of geopolitical concern.</p>

          <p>Shares of Webtoon Entertainment experienced a significant surge of nearly 39% after the company announced an expanded partnership with Disney to create a new digital comics platform. The deal will bring over 35,000 comics from Disney's Marvel, Star Wars, and other properties onto a single subscription service. As part of the agreement, Disney will also acquire a 2% equity stake in Webtoon. Analysts view the move as a major validation of Webtoon's platform, potentially diversifying its revenue and attracting other major intellectual property holders. (not investment advice)</p>

The announcement coincides with President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK, where he and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to sign a new technology collaboration deal.

          <h2>President Trump Revives Debate on Shifting Corporate Earnings Reports from Quarterly to Semiannual</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 15:37:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has renewed his call for the SEC to eliminate the requirement for public companies to issue quarterly earnings reports, suggesting a shift to a semiannual schedule. Proponents, including prominent figures like Warren Buffett, argue this change would reduce costs and encourage long-term strategic thinking over short-term market reactions. Conversely, critics believe less frequent reporting would reduce transparency for investors, particularly smaller retail investors who rely on these regular updates. The SEC has indicated it is prioritizing the review of this proposal to potentially ease regulatory burdens on companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, has withdrawn a controversial provision from a State Department reform bill that would have given the Secretary of State broad authority to revoke the passports of U.S. citizens. The measure would have allowed passport revocation for individuals determined to have provided "material support" to terrorist organizations. Civil liberties advocates heavily criticized the proposal, arguing it was intended to target pro-Palestinian activists and represented a significant overreach of government power. The committee decided to remove the provision to avoid overshadowing the bill's other bipartisan reform efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mortgage purchase rates have been declining, interest rates for refinancing remain relatively high, making it costly for many homeowners to tap into their home equity through a traditional cash-out refinance. As an alternative, financial experts suggest considering a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan. These options allow homeowners to borrow against their equity without altering their existing low-rate primary mortgage. A HELOC offers a variable-rate revolving line of credit, while a home equity loan provides a lump-sum payment with a fixed interest rate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that President Trump's credible threat to let TikTok "go dark" in the U.S. was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent explained that while the commercial terms were largely settled months ago, China stalled negotiations after the U.S. imposed new tariffs. Trump's willingness to sacrifice the popular app over national security concerns ultimately "turned the tide," leading to the current agreement being finalized. The White House has extended the divestiture deadline to December 16 to allow the deal to be completed.</p>

          <p>One of the busiest Chick-fil-A restaurants in Memphis, located at 1980 Union Avenue, is scheduled to reopen on September 18 after being closed for renovations since late May. The location was temporarily shut down to receive significant upgrades and install new features to better serve its high volume of customers. The reopening comes as the fast-food chain is promoting its seasonal fall menu items. For residents in the area, the next-closest Chick-fil-A locations have been several miles away in the city's suburbs, making the return of the Union Avenue store highly anticipated.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, prospective homebuyers are advised to approach the volatile mortgage market strategically. Experts recommend that buyers lock in a mortgage rate they can currently afford, as there is no guarantee that rates will continue to fall. It is also crucial to shop around with multiple lenders, as their responses to a Fed cut will vary. Finally, buyers should explore all options for securing a lower rate, such as adjustable-rate mortgages or purchasing mortgage points, to maximize their financial advantage in the current climate.
