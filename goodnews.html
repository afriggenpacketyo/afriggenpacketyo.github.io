        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to reputational damage linked to Elon Musk's political activities and increased competition from both traditional automakers and Chinese electric vehicle companies. Despite overall battery electric car sales rising in Europe, Tesla's sales have declined nearly 40% over the first four months of the year. European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve, while investors have raised concerns about Musk's dedication to Tesla due to his involvement with government advisory roles. The company is working to address these challenges, with Musk reaffirming his commitment to leading Tesla for the next five years.</p>

          <p>Japan has approved a $6.3 billion spending package to support businesses and households affected by U.S. tariffs, joining other nations implementing aid plans. The funds will assist small and medium-sized businesses and subsidize household energy costs, as the automotive sector, a key part of the Japanese economy, faces significant impact from U.S. tariffs. The stimulus package comes as Japan grapples with growing government debt and public concerns over rising consumer prices, while trade negotiations with the U.S. continue with no immediate concessions secured. The Japanese government hopes to reach an agreement during a Japan-U.S. meeting in mid-June.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that rice plants can pass on acquired traits related to cold tolerance to future generations without genetic mutations. The research, published in *Cell*, supports the long-dismissed theory of Lamarckism, which posits that organisms can inherit traits acquired during their lifetime. The team found that rice varieties from northeastern China exhibited stable, non-genetic adaptations, driven by DNA methylation changes, positioning Lamarckism as a contributing factor in evolution. This discovery may require a reconciliation of epigenetics with core evolutionary principles.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers have declined for a second consecutive day due to concerns about a price war and increased regulatory scrutiny. BYD's shares fell significantly after announcing price cuts on several electric and plug-in hybrid models, while other automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motor Co, and Li Auto also experienced declines. China's commerce ministry is reportedly investigating the practice of marking cars as sold to meet sales targets, which are then resold on the secondhand market. Analysts expect BYD's vehicle margins to face pressure in the short term due to the price reductions, but anticipate the company will offset the impact through larger sales and lower battery costs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly moving their gold offshore, with Singapore emerging as a preferred destination due to its perceived safety and stability. Storage facilities like "The Reserve" have seen significant increases in orders to store gold and silver, driven by concerns over economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Wealthy individuals are opting for physical gold bars over paper assets to mitigate counterparty and geopolitical risks, with Singapore being viewed as the "Geneva of the East."</p>

          <p>Following a series of attacks on livestock, Scotland's natural heritage agency is drawing up new powers to allow the shooting of young ravens in Orkney. Farmers have reported that the birds have killed and injured lambs, sheep, and calves, causing distress and financial losses. NatureScot officials agreed that current controls are ineffective and plan to introduce an area licensing scheme by winter, allowing for more flexible shooting permissions over a wider area and longer period.</p>

          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh became the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing a 60-mile trek over multiple days to raise awareness about shark conservation ahead of the 50th anniversary of the film "Jaws." Pugh swam in the frigid waters for about 24 hours over 12 days, battling challenging weather conditions to promote the protection of sharks, which he believes have been unfairly maligned. He aims to change public perception and advocate for measures to protect the at-risk animals, noting that about 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day.</p>

          <h2>Tripadvisor Finds Increase in Fake Reviews on Website</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 01:26:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake, a figure more than double that of 2022. This increase is attributed to the company's more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and its improved detection system. Tripadvisor's three-pronged process, which relies on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, has helped to identify and remove fake submissions. The company is constantly working to improve its technology to detect fake reviews, focusing on patterns and behaviors rather than just the content of the reviews.</p>
