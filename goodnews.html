        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite criticism and low approval ratings, Donald Trump's core supporters remain unwavering in their support, viewing his presidency as "amazing" and "fantastic." Interviews with Trump fans at a rally in Michigan revealed strong belief in his leadership, particularly regarding the economy, immigration, and national security. Supporters expressed admiration for Trump's ally Elon Musk and his efforts to streamline government. They see short-term economic challenges as necessary for long-term gains and trust Trump's commitment to making America great again. They also support his immigration policies, even if they are considered draconian by some.</p>

          <h2>The Case for Reindustrializing America</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 06:00:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent poll indicates that 80% of Americans believe the country would benefit from increased manufacturing, despite only 25% wanting to work in factories themselves. This discrepancy highlights the appeal of reindustrialization for overall societal improvement. Economists have long warned that the decline of manufacturing leads to social and economic decay. Manufacturing jobs offer higher wage potential and greater leverage for workers compared to many service jobs. Reindustrialization could improve trade negotiations, economic sovereignty, and social programs, and the left should consider industrial policies to win back working-class voters.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 05:56:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, according to flash data from Eurostat, failing to meet expectations of a decrease. Core inflation rose to 2.7%, and services inflation increased to 3.9%. Economists suggest the rise in services inflation is due to Easter timing effects, which are expected to reverse in the coming month. This steady inflation rate keeps the door open for further interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank (ECB). ECB President Christine Lagarde indicated the bank would remain data-dependent when making interest rate decisions.</p>

          <p>Slow TV, featuring long, unnarrated live streams of nature, has gained popularity as a calming alternative to fast-paced media. Shows like the 'Great Elk Trek' in Sweden attract millions of viewers who appreciate the calmness and opportunity for reflection. Zoos and wildlife projects also use live streams to allow people to observe animals and learn about nature. Educators use these streams as tools to teach children about the environment and social interaction. Researchers suggest that watching nature livestreams can foster a deeper connection with nature and inspire conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>EasyJet has apologized to a mother who was charged for carrying extra hand luggage containing breast milk and a pump on a flight from Bristol to Belfast. Daisy Crawford said she had researched the rules before flying and faced no issues on her outbound flight.

EasyJet stated they allow customers an additional free bag for a breast pump and milk. Crawford described the experience as "embarrassing" and said staff showed "no understanding."</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has urged caution regarding the potential outlawing of the AfD party, despite its designation as extremist by German intelligence. Scholz emphasized that the issue "must not be rushed" and requires careful consideration. While the extremist label allows closer scrutiny of the AfD, it does not automatically trigger a ban. Scholz called for "respect" as an antidote to far-right populism and said further consequences for the party require additional discussion.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, Canada's new prime minister, and President Donald Trump are expected to meet at the White House soon. Despite past tensions between Trump and Canada, there are indications that Trump views Carney more favorably than his predecessor. Trump is drawn to Carney's Ivy League background and success as an international banker. Carney's measured and organized approach contrasts with Trump's impulsiveness. Carney aims to balance economic knowledge, strategy, and personal diplomacy in dealing with Trump, while maintaining Canada's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Eig, author of ‚ÄúKing: A Life,‚Äù reflects on the relevance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s message in today's political climate. Eig argues that Dr. King's ‚ÄúLetter From Birmingham Jail‚Äù offers a path forward for those who disapprove of the Trump administration's tactics and prefer mercy for the marginalized. He highlights Dr. King's belief in the power of love to overcome cruelty and reform unjust systems. Eig suggests that Dr. King would call on elected leaders to change unjust policies, engage in economic boycotts, and lean on the moral authority of clergy to seize the moral high ground.</p>

The family notes that Bernstein often faced pressure to modify or curtail his artistic activity but chose to play music to promote beauty and understanding. The proceeds from upcoming Kennedy Center performances will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>

Over the years, BONB has gotten more deluxe, spreading from one bridge to others, and the different bridges try to outdo each other.</p>

          <p>In Nevada, six in 10 Asian Americans voted for Trump over Harris in November. While economic issues are a factor, many Asian Americans are against illegal immigration and DEI initiatives. Many feel as though, when colleges go through this vetting process, that the ethnicity of the students should not be released, so that there is absolute parity in that discussion. For some Asian Americans with recent ties to immigration, those very experiences have drawn them to Trump's rhetoric.</p>
