          <p>In his new memoir, actor Michael J. Fox recounts the grueling period in 1985 when he worked on both the sitcom "Family Ties" and the film "Back to the Future" at the same time. He describes enduring 20-hour workdays, filming the TV show during the day and the movie at night, which left him with almost no personal time or sleep. The article highlights the immense physical and mental strain he was under, relying on drivers to get him home while he slept in the car. Fox also reveals that the film's crew, concerned for his safety, intervened to prevent him from performing a particularly dangerous stunt involving a car.</p>

          <p>A minor ground collision occurred at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport when a United Airlines plane clipped the tail of another stationary United aircraft while taxiing to its gate. The incident involved Flight 2652 arriving from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with 113 passengers on board. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and all passengers were able to deplane normally after a delay. This event adds to a series of recent runway incidents across the U.S., contributing to ongoing concerns about aviation safety and ground control procedures at major airports, although the damage in this case was minimal.</p>

          <p>Efforts are underway to repair the damaged external power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has relied on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs, a development hailed as crucial for nuclear safety. The plant, Europe's largest, is under Russian control but requires a stable power source to cool its shutdown reactors and prevent a potential nuclear incident. This marks the 42nd time power lines to the plant have needed restoration since Russia's full-scale invasion began.</p>

          <p>Professionals are increasingly using AI tools to create polished headshots for their LinkedIn profiles and resumes, seeking an affordable alternative to costly professional photography. Services like InstaHeadshots and HeadshotPro can generate dozens of images for under $50, offering a significant advantage in a competitive job market where a strong digital presence is crucial. While some users report a notable increase in recruiter outreach after updating their photos, the trend raises ethical questions about authenticity. Career experts caution that poorly executed AI headshots can appear inauthentic and potentially harm a candidate's chances, though distinguishing them from real photos is becoming more difficult.</p>

          <p>The prestigious Grand Sumo Tournament is being held in London, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that it has taken place outside of Japan. The event, hosted at the Royal Albert Hall, features over 40 professional wrestlers competing in 100 bouts over five days. Organizers undertook significant logistical challenges to ensure cultural and religious authenticity, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. The tournament aims to introduce the highly ritualized Japanese national sport to a wider Western audience, complete with English commentary to explain its complex rules.</p>

One such group, Mental Health Is Real Wealth in Los Angeles, provides a forum where Black men can share their struggles without judgment, addressing pressures from systemic racism, economic disparities, and societal expectations of masculinity. Experts note that Black men are less likely to seek professional help and often face culturally incompetent care when they do. These groups serve as a crucial gateway to healing, helping participants break generational cycles and foster emotional expression in a supportive environment.</p>

The phrase is used by young people to express surprise, speechlessness, or to make an ironic comment, often when they are unsure how to respond in a conversation. Selected through an online vote organized by the publisher PONS Langenscheidt, the term reflects the significant influence of English on modern German youth slang and a trend toward linguistic brevity. The grammatically unconventional phrase, which originated in internet meme culture, beat out other contenders like "goonen" in a vote that saw two million participants.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge recommends that parents delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, ideally until age 16, to promote better mental health outcomes. To prepare them, she advises starting conversations about responsible technology use as early as late elementary school. Key lessons include teaching the importance of privacy, understanding that online content is permanent, and valuing time spent on real-world interactions. Twenge also stresses the need for firm rules, such as using parental controls, banning phones from bedrooms overnight, and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone to build healthy habits early.</p>

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment philosophy, Warren Buffett categorizes assets into three types: currency-denominated, non-productive, and productive. He expresses skepticism towards gold, a classic non-productive asset, arguing that its value relies solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future, rather than on any intrinsic ability to generate output. Buffett illustrates that all the world's gold would fit into a small cube that produces nothing, contrasting it with productive assets like farms or businesses, which generate tangible value over time. He concludes that his focus remains on acquiring assets that deliver real returns. (not investment advice)</p>
