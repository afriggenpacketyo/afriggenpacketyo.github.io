        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has taken firm control of the second Test against England, largely thanks to a monumental score of 269 by captain Shubman Gill. His performance anchored India's first-innings total of 587, putting immense pressure on the hosts at Edgbaston. In response, England's top order collapsed, leaving them at a precarious 77-3 by the close of day two. After their comeback victory in the first Test, England now faces a formidable challenge to avoid a series-leveling defeat against a resurgent Indian team whose bowlers found significant movement.</p>

Now working as a university teacher in Chengdu, she earns about $30,000 annually but says she is 'living large' due to the low cost of living and benefits like a rent stipend and free health insurance. Working only 18 hours a week, she is able to save up to $1,000 a month, a feat she could not achieve in the U.S. Her story highlights the stark contrast in lifestyle and financial pressures between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Williams driver Alex Albon reflects on his strong performance this season, which he attributes to having a competitive car and a new benchmark in teammate Carlos Sainz. While others see his game as elevated, Albon believes his execution remains consistent, but the improved car provides more opportunities for points in every race. He discusses how a car's suitability for a driver is a critical, often overlooked factor in Formula 1 performance. Looking ahead, Albon is realistic about Williams' journey, targeting consistent podium contention by 2027 and a potential championship fight by 2028.</p>

          <h2>Comparing the Costs of a $150,000 Home Equity Loan and a HELOC</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 13:55:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average home equity near $300,000, many homeowners are considering borrowing against their property. This article analyzes the current costs of a $150,000 home equity loan versus a home equity line of credit (HELOC). While current average interest rates are nearly identical for both products, the key difference lies in their structure; home equity loans have fixed rates, while HELOCs have variable rates that can change over time. The analysis shows how small fluctuations in interest rates can alter monthly payments, highlighting the need for borrowers to consider long-term affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly two-thirds of Germans believe the rule allowing 14-year-olds to drink beer or wine with a guardian should be abolished. The poll also found that just over half of respondents support raising the legal purchasing age for beer and wine from 16 to 18. This sentiment comes as German doctors' associations continue to advocate for policies to curb alcohol consumption, citing health risks, especially for developing adolescents. German politicians are also considering the ban, reflecting growing public and professional concern over youth drinking habits in the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market began the second half of the year with record-setting performance, as both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs in a holiday-shortened week. The tech sector led the charge, with Nvidia's market capitalization soaring to over $3.9 trillion. This rally follows a volatile second quarter where the market recovered from an early April sell-off. Economic data presented a mixed picture, with a stronger-than-expected jobs report potentially complicating arguments for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a key issue for the Trump administration.

These restrictions were imposed in May, requiring licenses for such exports as part of a broader effort to limit China's access to advanced semiconductor technology.
