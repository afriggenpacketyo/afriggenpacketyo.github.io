          <p>Mookie Betts is expected to return to the Dodgers' lineup after recovering from a fractured toe, while Tyler Glasnow is experiencing body discomfort following a bullpen session, delaying his return from shoulder inflammation. Glasnow's setback adds to the team's pitching woes, as other injured pitchers like Blake Snell and Roki Sasaki are also working towards their comebacks. Michael Kopech is nearing activation after a rehab assignment, and Kirby Yates is progressing in his recovery from a hamstring strain. The Dodgers hope to bolster their pitching staff soon amidst these ongoing injury challenges. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. The Education Department spokesperson stated that this decision aims to protect Social Security recipients who often rely on fixed incomes. This action reverses the administration's previous announcement to resume collection activity on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. The reprieve provides older student borrowers with more time to become current on their loans and avoid reduced benefit checks. </p>
