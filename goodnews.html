          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting an image on Instagram that was interpreted by some Trump administration officials as a call for violence against President Trump. The image, featuring seashells arranged as "86 47," was seen by some as referencing Trump's status as the 47th president and the slang term "eighty-six," meaning to eject or remove. Comey later deleted the post, claiming he didn't realize the association with violence. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the issue is under investigation, while Trump himself called the post a "terrible thing" and suggested it meant assassination. </p>

          <p>Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewelry store in Tokyo can be extradited to Japan following a landmark ruling. Kaine Wright and Joe Chappell are accused of stealing items worth ¬£679,000 from a Harry Winston store in 2015 by posing as customers. The case now passes to the home secretary to decide whether they should be sent to Japan, marking the first time Japan has successfully received fugitives from the UK without an extradition treaty. The men had raised concerns over prison conditions in Japan, but the court found extradition compatible with their human rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that his negative comments about Taylor Swift last year have negatively impacted her popularity. He posted on Truth Social that Swift is "no longer 'HOT'" since he said "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT," days after she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. This follows a history of political disagreements, as Swift has endorsed Trump's opponents in the past, leading to Trump questioning her liberal views. The article notes that Swift has maintained a lower public profile recently, coinciding with the end of her Eras tour and her boyfriend Travis Kelce's football season.</p>

The decision aligns Moody's with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, which had previously downgraded the U.S. The rating agency noted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to address large annual fiscal deficits. The downgrade is expected to marginally increase the yield investors demand for U.S. Treasury debt and could dampen sentiment toward U.S. assets (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Council members voted to increase the minimum wage for tourism workers to $30 per hour by 2028, despite advice from city lawyers to delay the vote due to potential violations of the state's open meeting law. The council proceeded despite concerns that the public agenda lacked sufficient notice for the proposed changes. A second vote was held on Friday to address the legal concerns. The decision to move forward has raised questions about political motivations and potential benefits to a labor union.</p>

          <p>A man cycling through Victoria Park in east Belfast spotted a 4ft starry smooth-hound shark swimming in the Connswater River, a rare but not entirely unusual occurrence. Marine biologist Dr Patrick Collins explained that this type of shark mainly eats crabs and small crustaceans, likely finding food in the river. The sighting, described as "quite a surprise," highlights the occasional presence of marine life in urban waterways. The shark was seen swimming in the river for about 30 minutes before disappearing upstream.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria took senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. The announcement lacked specifics, causing officials to scramble to understand the implications and scope of the rollback. The new Syrian government has been lobbying for sanctions relief, citing its inability to rebuild and pay civil service salaries. While some work was underway for an incremental lifting of sanctions, the president's broad announcement caught many off guard, leading to discussions on how to implement the decision.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been actively engaged in peace brokering across the globe, from the Gulf to Ukraine, suggesting a shift towards mercantilism and trade-based diplomacy. He signed deals in Saudi Arabia, lifted sanctions on Syria, and claimed credit for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Trump's approach prioritizes American interests and often bypasses traditional diplomatic channels, leading to both decisive actions and potential inconsistencies. This week's events reveal Trump's desire to clear diplomatic issues to focus on China, but the limitations of his "art of a deal" strategy remain apparent.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court extended its injunction temporarily barring the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The court said the government did not provide migrants with enough time or information to contest their cases, emphasizing the detainees' weighty interests. The case was remanded to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the process necessary to satisfy the Constitution.

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's request to remove a temporary block on deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The justices acted on an emergency appeal from lawyers for Venezuelan men accused of being gang members. The court had already imposed a temporary halt on deportations from a north Texas detention facility. The decision was met with criticism from President Trump, who claimed it prevents him from removing criminals. The case stems from a lawsuit challenging Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice charged a Mexican cartel member Friday, using a new terrorism designation for the first time. Maria Del Rosario Navarro-Sanchez is accused of providing grenades to Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci√≥n (CJNG). President Trump signed an executive order designating CJNG and seven other cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. The indictment alleges that Navarro-Sanchez trafficked firearms and humans, smuggled bulk cash, and trafficked drugs on behalf of the cartel. Federal law makes it a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison to provide material support to cartels.</p>

          <p>President Trump went on a social media posting spree after returning from a four-day trip to the Middle East, targeting critics such as Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. He criticized Springsteen for speaking out against his administration and questioned Swift's popularity since he stated his dislike for her. The president's behavior seemed like a comedown after basking in the lavish praise and opulent splendor of his Middle East tour. The remarks by Mr. Springsteen, who campaigned for Kamala Harris, got a lot of attention at a time when many public figures in American life have avoided criticizing a president who campaigned on enacting retribution and has in many ways delivered on that promise.</p>
