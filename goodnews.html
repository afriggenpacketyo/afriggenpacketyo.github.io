          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as high winds swept across dry farmlands, creating a wall of dust that significantly reduced visibility. The National Weather Service reported near-zero visibility on major interstates, causing travel disruptions and airport ground stops. Showers mixed with the dust, leading to reports of "mud rain" in some areas. Cooler, drier weather is expected over the weekend, followed by a return to a rainy pattern next week, but the most significant storm threat remains east of I-55.</p>

          <p>Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government as he stepped down as chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Lindner stated that voters wanted less state intervention and more freedom, but the new government is delivering the opposite. He warned that the government's fiscal policy could have negative economic consequences and affect future elections. Lindner was fired as finance minister in November, leading the FDP to withdraw from the previous coalition, triggering an early election.
