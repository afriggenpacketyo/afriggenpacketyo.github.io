          <p>President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte have announced a significant new arms deal to support Ukraine, which will be funded by European allies. The agreement involves NATO countries like Germany, Finland, and Denmark purchasing billions of dollars worth of U.S.-manufactured weapons for rapid distribution to Ukrainian forces. Rutte described the deal as a "really big" and logical step, highlighting it as an example of European nations increasing their defense contributions. This development was announced shortly after President Trump set a 50-day deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal, underscoring a dual strategy of diplomatic pressure and military support.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. senators is sponsoring the "She Drives Act" to address the higher risk of injury and death for women in car crashes. The legislation would require federal crashworthiness tests to use advanced dummies that better reflect the general population, including a model simulating an average-sized woman. Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows women are 73% more likely to be seriously injured and 17% more likely to die in a crash than men, a disparity attributed partly to safety systems designed around male-centric test dummies. The Department of Transportation has acknowledged delays and committed to accelerating the process.</p>

          <p>Citing a new bullish call from Citi, Jim Cramer's Investing Club is purchasing additional shares of the industrial company Dover. Citi analysts raised their price target for the stock and named it their new "Top Pick," anticipating accelerating growth in its niche, high-margin businesses. Despite this endorsement, the stock saw a minor dip, potentially due to broader market concerns over threatened tariffs against the European Union. The company is expected to navigate any potential disruptions through cost mitigation and strategic actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comparison of monthly vehicle operating costs reveals that Tesla owners can save between $360 and $900 annually on fuel compared to drivers of a Nissan Altima. Based on driving 1,000 miles per month, the cost to charge a Tesla is estimated at $35 to $60, while fueling an Altima costs between $90 and $110. The most significant savings come from home charging, where costs can be three times cheaper per mile than gasoline, although this varies based on local electricity rates. Public charging networks like Tesla's Superchargers are more expensive but still offer a cost-effective alternative to traditional fuel for many drivers.</p>

          <h2>Bitcoin Rally Driven by Institutional Demand, Suggesting Greater Stability</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's recent surge to record highs appears to be driven more by sustained institutional investment than by short-term speculation, according to market data. Strong inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have attracted over $3.4 billion in July alone, point to growing corporate and institutional adoption. Furthermore, analysis of the derivatives market shows that while open interest in bitcoin futures is at a record high, funding rates remain subdued, indicating less reliance on risky leverage. This shift suggests the current rally may be more stable and durable than previous ones, as institutional flows are typically longer-term in nature. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of bitcoin has surged past $120,000 to a new all-time high, fueled by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation. The U.S. House of Representatives is set to begin deliberations on a series of bills, dubbed "Crypto Week," aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. This potential for regulatory clarity, supported by the Trump administration, has boosted investor confidence and attracted substantial capital from institutional and corporate buyers. Analysts suggest this institutional backing could propel bitcoin's price even higher in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers potential interest rate cuts later this year, financial experts are offering advice on choosing the right certificate of deposit (CD) term. Some analysts suggest that short-term CDs remain the best option, as banks are offering competitive rates in anticipation of future rate drops. However, other experts argue that locking in a longer-term CD now could be advantageous, as it would secure a high yield before rates potentially fall. For those unsure, a CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading deposits across multiple terms, is recommended to balance access to funds with the benefits of higher long-term yields.

          <p>The United States will send advanced Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine, with European allies footing the bill, to help counter Russian aerial attacks. The Patriot system, a mobile surface-to-air platform, is highly effective against tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, drones, and aircraft. While the exact number of units is unconfirmed, the deployment will significantly enhance Ukraine's ability to protect its cities and critical infrastructure from Russian bombardment. This move comes as Germany has also been advocating for increased air defense support for Ukraine, though it has declined to send its own long-range Taurus missiles.</p>

          <p>General Motors and LG Energy Solution are upgrading their joint-venture battery plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells for electric vehicles. This move is aimed at significantly lowering the cost of EV batteries, as LFP technology does not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel, which are used in standard lithium-ion batteries. The company stated this will help diversify its EV portfolio, which currently includes 12 models, and make electric vehicles more affordable. Commercial production of the new, lower-cost LFP cells is expected to begin by late 2027, complementing GM's existing battery technologies.</p>

          <p>A court in the Netherlands has ordered the confiscation of $112 million in illegal assets from Jos Leijdekkers, a notorious drug lord nicknamed "Chubby Jos." The court determined that Leijdekkers, who is one of Europe's most-wanted fugitives, amassed the fortune through extensive cocaine trafficking and illicit gold purchases. Leijdekkers was tried in absentia and was previously sentenced to 24 years in prison for organizing cocaine shipments and ordering a murder. Authorities believe he is currently hiding in Sierra Leone, where images have surfaced allegedly showing him with high-level political figures, sparking speculation about his connections.</p>

          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements surged by 60% in June compared to the previous year, reaching their highest level since 2009. This significant increase follows reports that Beijing has been relaxing its strict export controls on these critical minerals. Analysts suggest this may be an early sign of a thaw in trade tensions, possibly resulting from behind-the-scenes agreements with the United States. The move comes after China's Ministry of Commerce indicated it would improve the export approval process for Western countries, signaling a potential shift in its strategic materials policy.</p>

          <p>Poor visibility and hazy skies across Iowa are being caused by dense fog, not smoke from distant wildfires, according to the National Weather Service. A dense fog advisory was issued for southeastern Iowa, where recent heavy rainfall combined with light winds has created ideal conditions for fog formation. While other states are experiencing air quality alerts due to fires in the Grand Canyon and Canada, Iowa's situation is a localized weather phenomenon. Meteorologists expect the fog to dissipate by mid-morning but caution that it could return with future rainfall, advising drivers to use low-beam headlights and allow extra stopping distance.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters through a mutual model. This proposal is part of an effort to create a "fresh vision" for the state-owned service and transform its culture in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, which saw hundreds of postmasters wrongly convicted. The consultation will also explore what services the Post Office should offer, with a focus on banking, as major lenders close high street branches. The government stated it believes the current network size of 11,500 branches is broadly correct.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's social media post threatening to revoke Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship, legal experts have affirmed that such an action would be unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment establishes that all persons born in the United States are citizens, and the president has no authority to unilaterally strip citizenship from a native-born American. The feud between Trump and O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland, spans nearly two decades and was reignited by her criticism of his administration's policies. While naturalized citizens can have their status revoked under specific circumstances like fraud, the power does not extend to native-born citizens.</p>
