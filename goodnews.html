          <p>Sunday's NFL action saw the Dallas Cowboys extend their winning streak against the New York Giants to nine games with a thrilling 40-37 overtime victory, secured by a Brandon Aubrey field goal. The Cincinnati Bengals also clinched a 31-27 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but their celebration was tempered by a toe injury to star quarterback Joe Burrow, who did not return to the game. Other notable results included the Seattle Seahawks defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-17, the Detroit Lions dominating the Chicago Bears 52-21, and the Buffalo Bills overcoming the New York Jets 30-10. The New England Patriots secured a 33-27 win against the Miami Dolphins, marking Mike Vrabel's first victory as their coach, while the San Francisco 49ers beat the New Orleans Saints 26-21.</p>

          <h2>Limestone Application in Agriculture Offers Breakthrough for Carbon Emission Reduction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 17:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified a promising method to combat agricultural carbon emissions by spreading crushed limestone across farmlands. A Yale-led study, published in Nature Water, reveals that limestone reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form bicarbonate ions, which are then washed into waterways and transform into calcium carbonate, effectively storing carbon for millions of years. This discovery is significant because agriculture accounts for approximately 10% of global annual carbon emissions, making this inexpensive and sustainable solution a vital tool. While it doesn't prevent emissions from being produced, it offers a long-term sequestration mechanism. Experts stress that modifying liming practices should be a priority, contributing to broader efforts to remove carbon from the atmosphere, as halting emissions alone is deemed insufficient to meet climate targets.</p>

          <p>Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a highly influential voice in foreign policy and former chairman of both the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, has declared his intention not to seek reelection in 2026 after serving 11 terms. McCaul expressed a desire for a "new challenge" within the national security and foreign policy arena, aiming to continue his work in strengthening America and global safety. Throughout his distinguished career, he has been a staunch advocate for US support to Ukraine and spearheaded a multi-year investigation into the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. His decision signals a notable shift for Texas Republicans, particularly as the state navigates a mid-decade redistricting effort and other prominent party members also choose to retire from their current seats.</p>

Consumers are strongly advised to cease using the product immediately, unplug it, and register for the recall through Epoca International LLC's website. The refund process mandates submitting three photographs: one showing "RECALL" written on the fridge door, another of the model/serial number label, and a third demonstrating the cut power cord, ensuring the product cannot be reused.</p>

While he was initially understood to be enrolled in the NYU Stern School of Business, inside sources now indicate that his move to the D.C. campus, which integrates specialized coursework with internships focused on government and public policy, suggests a potential pivot towards a more politically aligned career. This choice allows him to stay geographically close to his parents and aligns with his previous involvement in his father's campaigns, intensifying public interest in his prospective role in upcoming political initiatives.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially announced the termination of its negotiations with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com concerning the potential sale of its general merchandise subsidiary, Argos. This decision was made after JD.com presented a "materially revised set of terms and commitments" that Sainsbury’s determined were no longer aligned with the best interests of its shareholders. Despite the halted talks, Sainsbury’s reiterated its financial outlook, maintaining its expectation to deliver a retail underlying operating profit of around £1 billion for the financial year 2025-2026, signaling confidence in its independent operational strategy. This development brings an end to a period of market speculation surrounding the future of Argos, a well-known UK retailer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has secured the 100m gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, a landmark achievement that heralds a new era for Jamaican men's sprinting, making him the first Jamaican man to claim a global 100m title since Usain Bolt's last victory nine years prior. The 24-year-old, who trains under Bolt's former coach Glen Mills, triumphed with a personal best time of 9.77 seconds, overcoming previous setbacks, including a disappointing last-place finish at the Paris 2024 Olympics. His emphatic victory, witnessed and celebrated by an ecstatic Usain Bolt, effectively silenced his critics and realized his long-anticipated potential. This win, alongside other national successes in the championships, signifies a powerful resurgence for Jamaica in the highly competitive men's sprint events.</p>
