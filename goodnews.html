        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Los Angeles museum exhibit titled "Monuments" showcases decommissioned Confederate monuments alongside contemporary art, aiming to challenge the racist ideologies they represent. The exhibit features a melted-down bronze statue of General Robert E. Lee and a graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, displayed near a replica of the "General Lee" car from The Dukes of Hazzard. Curator Hamza Walker emphasizes that these figures fought for white supremacy, countering narratives that attempt to sanitize their legacy. The exhibition seeks to confront the historical revisionism that downplays the role of slavery in the Civil War, and most of the monuments will be returned to their original cities after the show, except for Kara Walker's sculpture which needs a new home. The article also highlights the toxic representation of history and efforts to purify it. </p>

          <p>A significant Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage caused widespread disruptions, impacting major websites and applications. The outage, which began in AWS' main US-East-1 region, affected services including Disney+, Lyft, The New York Times, and Amazon's own operations. The issue stemmed from DNS problems with DynamoDB, a database service critical to many AWS applications. AWS worked to restore service, noting early signs of recovery in some regions and while the company cited an operational issue, cybersecurity experts believe the outage was likely due to a technical fault affecting one of Amazon's main data centers. </p>

          <p>A new study reveals that microchips implanted in the eyes of legally blind patients, combined with special glasses, have helped some regain their ability to read. The treatment involves inserting a tiny implant under the retina, which then works with glasses containing a video camera that projects images via near-infrared light. While the improvement is significant, it requires concentration and has limitations, geographic atrophy, a leading cause of blindness in older people, had previously no treatment to improve patient's abilities to read or recognize faces. The PRIMA implant is not yet licensed for widespread use.</p>

NioCorp led the sector's gains, with other companies like Energy Fuels and USA Rare Earth also rising, and this comes as the Trump administration works to build up its own domestic rare earth supply chain.
