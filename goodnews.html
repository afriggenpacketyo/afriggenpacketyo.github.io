          <p>President Trump announced the broad outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since the implementation of new tariffs. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports and reduce non-tariff barriers. Specifics are still being finalized, but the deal includes keeping a 10% tariff on UK imports, adjusting tariffs on UK autos, creating a $5 billion export opportunity for U.S. farmers, and committing both countries to enhancing industrial and agricultural market access. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer highlighted the deal as an incredible platform for the future, while Trump indicated this could be a template for future trade deals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US and the UK have reached an agreement on tariffs for some goods traded between the two countries, reducing or removing tariffs on UK exports like cars, steel, and aluminum. While President Trump characterized it as a "major trade deal," it is not a free-trade agreement requiring congressional approval, but rather an agreement reversing or cutting some tariffs on specific goods. The deal cuts car tariffs to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, scraps tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and continues negotiations on pharmaceuticals and digital services. The UK government stated that this deal would strip back paperwork for British firms trying to export to the US.</p>
