          <p>China's top economic planner acknowledges room for improving the business environment, suggesting stronger support for the private sector may be forthcoming. An article by Wu Hongliang in the People's Daily calls for enhanced protection of property rights, regulation of law enforcement impacting businesses, and improved government services. This signals Beijing's intent to stabilize market sentiment and revitalize investor confidence, building on a recent law ensuring equal treatment for non-state firms. The move reflects an ongoing effort to balance state control with private enterprise growth.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has successfully dismantled a vast telecommunications network in the New York tri-state area, which posed a significant threat to the city's telecom systems and the ongoing UN General Assembly meetings. The operation uncovered 300 SIM servers with over 100,000 SIM cards, capable of sending millions of texts per minute and potentially disabling cell phone towers. This sophisticated, well-funded network was linked to foreign governments and organized crime, including drug cartels and human trafficking rings. The investigation is ongoing, with potential arrests expected.</p>

          <p>German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil defended the 2026 budget, pledging €126.7 billion for infrastructure, schools, and hospitals, refuting claims it merely fills gaps. The OECD, however, slightly lowered Germany's economic growth forecast for 2025 and 2026, citing weak global demand and high energy costs. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bahn confirmed Evelyn Palla as its first female CEO, effective October 1, a move praised by some but opposed by a railway union over another executive appointment. The article highlights both economic challenges and leadership changes in key sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Medical Consensus Refutes Trump's Claim of Tylenol-Autism Link, Reaffirming Drug Safety in Pregnancy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's assertion that Tylenol (paracetamol) causes autism in children has been widely refuted by medical bodies and scientific evidence. International medical organizations, including the American and UK Royal Colleges of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, continue to recommend acetaminophen as the safest pain and fever treatment during pregnancy. While some studies have shown a potential association, further research has found no causal link, and experts emphasize the drug's safety. The article clarifies that autism is a complex neurodivergence with no single cause, largely attributed to genetic and environmental factors.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to his late-night talk show after Disney suspended him for jokes about conservative influencer Charlie Kirk's death. Disney stated the suspension was due to "ill-timed and insensitive" comments, but reinstated the show after intense public protest, consumer subscription cancellations, and widespread celebrity support against perceived censorship. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman had previously threatened ABC's broadcast license over Kimmel's remarks, sparking a national debate on free speech.

          <p>A UCLA survey indicates that Los Angeles residents largely support building more apartments, even in their own single-family neighborhoods, overturning the long-held "NIMBY" (Not In My Backyard) perception. Contrary to Mayor Karen Bass's initial approach, 64% support apartments on single-family streets, and 59% in their own neighborhoods. The article argues that city leaders should leverage this consensus to expand affordable housing initiatives like Executive Directive 1, which has shown market-rate housing can become affordable by cutting red tape. This suggests a significant shift in public opinion on a critical urban issue.</p>
