          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 01:24:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brad Marchand's double-overtime goal secured a 5-4 victory for the Florida Panthers over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 2, leveling the Stanley Cup Final series. The game, marked by numerous penalties and high-pressure moments, saw both teams trading goals, including a late tying goal by Corey Perry for the Oilers to force overtime. Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar goaltending, with 42 saves, was crucial for the Panthers, while Marchand's two goals and contributions from Sam Bennett and others fueled their offense. The series now shifts to Sunrise for Game 3, with the Panthers regaining home-ice advantage. The game was characterized by intense play from star players like Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who contributed assists for the Oilers. The final score was reflective of the high-stakes environment and the back-and-forth nature of the match. Optimism is moderate given the win, but the series is far from over.</p>

          <h2>Achieving Longevity Requires Societal Change, Not Just Personal Optimization, Expert Argues</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public health scientist Devi Sridhar argues that achieving a long and healthy life requires more than just individual efforts like diet and exercise, emphasizing the importance of public policy, infrastructure, and community. While personal optimization is often touted as the key to longevity, Sridhar points out that life expectancy is stagnating or declining in many high-income countries due to factors largely outside individual control, such as air quality and mental health conditions. She highlights that societies where people live longer normalize healthy lives through government and cultural support, such as affordable nutritious food and active cities. Sridhar advocates for collective responsibility and policies that prioritize the conditions for good health for all, suggesting that the true path to longevity lies in societal changes rather than individual self-help.</p>

          <p>Flamenco, the passionate dance, song, and music of the Roma people of southern Spain, has found a vibrant home in New Mexico, particularly in Albuquerque. The city hosts a world-famous flamenco festival and boasts the only American university offering graduate and undergraduate degrees in flamenco dance. New Mexico's flamenco scene is unique because it is homegrown, tracing its Hispanic roots back over 400 years to Spanish settlers. While respecting traditional Spanish flamenco, New Mexico's flamenco incorporates its own history, resistance, celebration, and liberation, creating a distinct regional flavor.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to host the second round of trade talks between the US and China, marking a diplomatic achievement for the country. The first round of talks, held in Geneva, led to a temporary suspension of tariffs but was followed by accusations of broken agreements. The UK's role as host is seen as advantageous due to its neutral geopolitical position and ongoing efforts to reset its relationship with China. This opportunity could also benefit the UK's pursuit of its own trade agreement with the US, potentially leading to the reduction or elimination of tariffs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow U.S. colleges to directly pay athletes, marking a significant shift in the landscape of college sports. The settlement, stemming from the House v. NCAA case, permits each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provides $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players who were previously barred from revenue sharing. This move is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment, program budgets, and the overall structure of the NCAA. While celebrated by some as a long-overdue recognition of athletes' contributions, concerns remain regarding roster limits, Olympic sports funding, and potential legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a multibillion-dollar settlement in the House v. NCAA case, ushering in a new era for college sports where athletes can be directly compensated by their schools. The settlement allows NCAA Division I colleges to pay athletes, capped initially at $20.5 million per school, and allocates over $2 billion to former athletes who were previously prohibited from earning money. This decision marks a significant shift from the tradition of amateurism that has long governed college athletics. The new framework also introduces roster limits and a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements, aiming to address concerns about fair market value and potential legal challenges.</p>
