          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, further halting the Trump administration's plans to significantly cut jobs and reorganize major federal agencies under the DOGE initiative, which is backed by Elon Musk. The judge, Susan Illston, emphasized that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress is responsible for creating, funding, and assigning duties to federal agencies. The Trump administration has appealed the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and is expected to seek a block on the injunction's enforcement, arguing that the President should have executive authority. This ruling protects federal employees and maintains the agencies' ability to fulfill their statutory obligations.</p>

While traffic is expected to be heavy, especially during the Memorial Day weekend, authorities are urging drivers to exercise caution due to ongoing road work.

          <p>South Africa's Police Minister Senzo Mchunu has released crime statistics to counter claims of a "white genocide," revealing that the majority of farm murder victims between January and March were Black.

Mchunu emphasized that the history of farm murders has been distorted, and the UN Human Rights Office condemned the casual use of the term "genocide" in this context, pointing to the inappropriateness given South Africa's history.</p>

This decision follows a statement from the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah √ñcalan, suggesting the war had become obsolete, however the details of his talks with the Turkish government remain a mystery. The Turkish government now has an opportunity to consolidate peace by addressing Kurdish grievances and offering amnesty to PKK fighters, though failure to seize this moment could risk a resurgence of the conflict.</p>

The new review identified only about 20 books that require further evaluation by a Department of Defense panel. This reversal follows a Pentagon memo standardizing search terms for DEI-related materials, leading to the return of nearly all originally pulled books to circulation. The Navy's initial search used broader terms, resulting in the removal of titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."</p>

          <p>As interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) decline, experts advise careful consideration of their uses this summer. While HELOCs offer flexibility, using them for non-essential expenses like vacations is discouraged due to the risk of long-term debt. Prudent uses include consolidating high-interest credit card debt, tackling home improvements, and potentially covering college costs if other options are less favorable. Using a HELOC to buy a new house before selling the old one requires a solid repayment plan to avoid accumulating additional debt. Using a HELOC to fund a summer vacation is not investment advice.</p>
