          <p>Elon Musk announced plans to significantly scale back his political spending, stating he doesn't currently see a reason to invest in politics after contributing at least $277 million to Republican causes in the 2024 cycle. Speaking at the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk didn't entirely rule out future political spending, saying he would consider it if he saw a reason. He has faced scrutiny for his leadership in government cuts as part of his informal role overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency. The article also mentions benefits for Musk's companies, including Starlink's approval for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia.</p>

While parents often focus on vegetables, fruits, and healthy fats, beans are a nutritional powerhouse that can significantly benefit children's health.

          <p>Home Depot's Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. More than half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources, reducing reliance on China. McPhail added that keeping prices stable could also help its business and that it's a great opportunity for the company to take market share. Home Depot missed Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations for the first time since May 2020, but beat sales estimates.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) outlined new regulatory guidance for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, setting stricter approval standards for healthy Americans. For adults 65 and older, and for people as young as 6 months who have certain underlying health conditions, the FDA said it will accept immunogenicity data. But for healthy people between 6 months and 64 years old who don't have risk factors, the agency plans to require stronger evidence for vaccines from randomized, controlled trials. The new guidance comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, overhauls the nation's health agencies.</p>
