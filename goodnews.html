          <p>The 27th season of Comedy Central's "South Park" is experiencing a significant ratings surge, largely attributed to its satirical portrayals of political figures like Donald Trump and Kristi Noem. The season's second episode attracted 6.2 million viewers in its first three days, a 49% increase from the premiere, making it the most-watched episode since 2018. This success comes after the show's creators secured a $1.5 billion deal with Paramount and amid political tensions involving the network's parent company.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected jobs report and a cool inflation reading, economists increasingly predict the Federal Reserve will implement a quarter-point interest rate cut at its September meeting. Despite months of pressure from President Trump, the Fed has held rates steady, but a slowdown in the labor market may now prompt action to prevent an economic downturn. Futures markets reflect this sentiment, with investors pricing in a nearly 96% chance of a rate cut. The central bank faces a difficult balance, weighing concerns of potential tariff-induced inflation against the need to support employment and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

In addition to the Leoni deal, Liverpool is also in ongoing negotiations with Crystal Palace for their captain and England center-back, Marc Guehi. The potential acquisitions are part of a significant summer spending spree for the club, which has already seen bids for other high-profile players as they build their squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining about 2%, as investors shifted focus away from megacap technology companies. This market rotation is fueled by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower borrowing costs are particularly beneficial for smaller companies that rely on capital for operations and expansion. In contrast, the CNBC Magnificent 7 Index, which tracks major tech firms, saw a slight decline. Analysts suggest this "rate cut rotation" could continue to benefit small caps, which have lagged behind the broader market over the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its grocery business by rolling out same-day delivery of fresh foods, including meat, eggs, and produce, to more than 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The company plans to extend the service to at least 2,300 locations by year's end, escalating its competition with rivals like Walmart and Instacart, whose stocks fell on the news. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25 and is part of Amazon's broader strategy to integrate its grocery offerings, including Whole Foods, more closely. Amazon found that the service encourages first-time grocery shoppers who then return to shop more frequently.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to include nearly all grocery items, such as milk, meat, and frozen foods, effective immediately. Previously, the discount applied mainly to fresh produce and general merchandise, with broader food discounts limited to the holiday season. The move, which the company said was one of its most requested benefits, comes as concerns about rising prices due to tariffs grow. The expanded discount could help the retail giant retain its 1.6 million U.S. employees and encourage them to do more of their own shopping at Walmart, boosting the company's own sales.</p>

          <p>The Habit Burger & Grill is escalating its "burger wars" marketing by trolling rival In-N-Out with a billboard near Los Angeles International Airport. The sign, located across from an In-N-Out, has been updated to show that In-N-Out dropped from #2 to #4 in USA Today's fast-food burger rankings, while Habit took the top spot. The campaign also takes a jab at In-N-Out's expansion to Tennessee and its CEO's departure from California, with Habit's CMO stating, "We remain proudly Californian and we’re not going anywhere." This provocative strategy highlights the fierce competition between the two Irvine-based, but culturally distinct, burger chains.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners' equity has reached a new record, with approximately 48 million mortgage holders possessing tappable equity. The average homeowner now holds around $213,000 in accessible value, contributing to a total of $11.6 trillion in usable equity nationwide. The article explains how homeowners can calculate their available equity by subtracting their mortgage balance from their home's current market value. It also cautions that while borrowing options like home equity loans and HELOCs are available, they are not risk-free, as the home serves as collateral and failure to repay could lead to foreclosure.</p>

          <p>According to Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman, highly technical skills are not the most crucial asset for success in the age of artificial intelligence. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of soft skills, particularly critical thinking, which he has advised his own high-school-aged child to develop. Garman believes that as AI handles more administrative tasks, employers will prioritize workers who are creative, adaptable, and capable of nuanced judgment. He argues that the ability to learn new things and think critically will be more valuable than any specific technical skill, as human intellect is still needed to generate new ideas and refine AI output.</p>
