          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei stock index closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, rising for a fourth consecutive day. The rally was primarily fueled by easing investor concerns over steep US tariffs on China and diminishing tensions in the Middle East. The market was particularly encouraged by the White House's indication that it might extend a pause on new tariffs. Despite the strong performance, some analysts caution that the gains may not reflect stable economic fundamentals and that the market remains on unstable footing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Guangdong province is launching a domestic version of the renowned Canton Fair to help its export-oriented companies pivot toward the internal market. This initiative is a response to weak external demand and growing global trade uncertainties, aiming to channel high-quality export products to Chinese consumers. However, industry insiders express skepticism, pointing out that numerous domestic trade events already exist. They argue the core challenges are sluggish consumer demand and payment delays, which a new fair may not effectively address. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent series of technical outages and a fatal midair collision have renewed the debate over how to reform the U.S. air traffic control system. While the Trump administration previously advocated for privatization, the current focus appears to be on a multibillion-dollar investment to modernize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The article explores the arguments for and against removing air traffic control from direct government oversight, examining Canada's privatized model as an example while noting concerns that such a system would be ill-suited for America's complex airspace.</p>

          <p>The Council of Europe and the Ukrainian government have signed an agreement to establish a special tribunal to prosecute Russia's senior leadership for the "crime of aggression." This new legal body, likely to be based in The Hague, is designed to close a jurisdictional gap, as the International Criminal Court cannot currently prosecute Russian officials for the act of waging war itself. While it is highly unlikely that defendants like Vladimir Putin will appear in person, the tribunal is seen as a crucial mechanism for gathering evidence and establishing legal accountability.</p>
