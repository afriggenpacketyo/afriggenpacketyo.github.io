          <h2>Trump Praises China's "Big Steps" in Controlling Fentanyl Flow</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 16:48:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that China is making significant progress in curbing the flow of fentanyl into the United States, a notable shift from his previous rhetoric. This positive assessment comes as high-level trade negotiations between the two countries are ongoing. Previously, Trump had used the fentanyl issue as a justification for imposing and increasing tariffs on Chinese imports, declaring that the penalties would remain until the drug trafficking was seriously limited. His current comments suggest a potential de-escalation of tensions on this specific front.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation, which has already passed the Senate, would create clear rules and consumer protections for the $250 billion market, potentially making stablecoins a more mainstream payment method. Supported by the crypto industry and the Trump administration, the bill would allow banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, which proponents say can facilitate faster and cheaper transactions.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines has reported second-quarter earnings that beat estimates and issued a new, more confident forecast for 2025, citing a less uncertain global environment and recovering travel demand. CEO Scott Kirby noted that demand is picking up after a weaker-than-expected start to the year, particularly for domestic flights. The airline now projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the full year, a more optimistic outlook than the recessionary scenario it had previously outlined. The positive forecast comes despite challenges like operational constraints at its Newark hub. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin and Ether, surged following a procedural vote in the House that advanced key crypto regulation bills, including the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act.

President Trump also signaled his support, stating he had met with lawmakers to ensure the bills would move forward, further boosting confidence in the sector and causing related stocks like Circle and Coinbase to rally.

Despite a late effort from England that created a potentially tense finish, India held its nerve to complete its second-highest successful chase in the format. For England, Sophia Dunkley's 83 runs was a standout performance, but a sloppy fielding effort contributed to the team's defeat in this crucial series.</p>

While RFK Jr. has praised these efforts, his own national strategy appears to rely on states creating a patchwork of regulations to pressure food companies into voluntary changes.
