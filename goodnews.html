          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, declared victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who conceded before ranked-choice votes were counted.

Mamdani, who would be the city's first Muslim mayor and youngest in a century, focused on a progressive platform, but the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count with final results expected on July 15. </p>

He did not directly address specific trade tensions or conflicts, but highlighted the importance of staying on the right path in international economic relations. Adam Tooze of Columbia University noted that this signals a pluralization of global economic rules. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is attending the NATO Summit in The Hague with a surprisingly cordial tone, after previously criticizing the alliance. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump for securing increased defense spending commitments from European members and for brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. While progress has been made on defense spending, Trump cast doubt on the U.S.'s commitment to Article 5, the mutual defense clause, despite assurances from U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker. Rutte urged partners to focus on strengthening their defenses rather than worrying about U.S. commitment. </p>

          <p>A Chinese-led study suggests that a global interconnected solar-wind energy system could meet the world's energy demands by 2050 at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The study proposes creating a network that utilizes regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents. Researchers acknowledge that establishing such a system requires navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises, such as the Ukraine war. Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease decarbonization, and enhance resilience against conflict and climate extremes. </p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports that more people are buying electric cars and installing heat pumps, but further increases are needed to meet climate goals. The committee advises the government to ensure households benefit from the transition to cleaner technologies through lower bills. While emissions within the UK's borders have fallen by more than half since 1990, transport and buildings remain the biggest emitters. The CCC sees positive signs, including a near doubling of electric cars and growing heat pump sales, but emphasizes the need to make electricity cheaper. </p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The lawsuit, led by attorneys general in California, Colorado, and Washington, was likely to succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program. The Government Accountability Office previously found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding. </p>
