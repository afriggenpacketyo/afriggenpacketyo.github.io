          <p>A newly discovered dinosaur species, named Enigmacursor, will be displayed at the Natural History Museum in London, marking the first new dinosaur exhibit since 2014. The labrador-sized dinosaur lived approximately 150 million years ago and was initially misclassified as a Nanosaurus. Scientists identified unique features in its leg bones, leading to its reclassification as a distinct species. This discovery helps scientists understand the diversity of dinosaurs during the Late Jurassic period and the evolution of larger dinosaur species, filling gaps in the current understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossilized remains are the most complete of any in the world for early small dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>Lab-grown meat, also known as cultivated meat, is gaining attention as a potential solution to the environmental problems associated with traditional meat production, but its benefits are debated. Companies like Ivy Farm Technologies are developing lab-grown meat products, such as burgers and sausages, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and land use. While advocates claim it can meet the growing demand for meat more sustainably, critics argue that its environmental benefits are not yet proven and that reducing meat consumption is a better approach. The science involves growing animal cells in vats, but the process requires energy and resources, making its climate impact uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starbucks is implementing new pricing strategies for beverage add-ins, including matcha and syrups, to standardize costs across its stores. The company will charge 80 cents for any combination of syrups or sauces added to unflavored drinks but will not charge for substitutions in pre-flavored drinks. Additionally, Starbucks will charge $1 for adding matcha powder to non-matcha drinks and 50 cents for dried fruit. These changes align with CEO Brian Niccol's efforts to enhance customer service and improve the Starbucks experience. Starbucks is also testing a feature in its app to provide real-time pricing updates during the ordering process.</p>

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has dismissed all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 people across multiple cities. The decision follows a 2022 Assembly Bill that narrowed the legal definition of gang activity in California. The Peace & Justice Law Center argued that the injunctions were racially biased, targeting alleged Latino criminal organizations while ignoring white supremacist gangs. Gang injunctions, which restrict suspected gang members' activities, have faced increasing legal challenges and criticism for being overly broad and discriminatory. Spitzer indicated that his office could seek new injunctions under the revised definition if necessary.</p>

          <p>The winning design for a memorial honoring Queen Elizabeth II in London will include a bridge with a translucent balustrade reminiscent of her wedding tiara. Designed by Foster + Partners, the memorial will also feature statues of the Queen and Prince Philip. The design includes two gates, two gardens dedicated to the Commonwealth and UK communities, and a unifying path. The project, publicly funded at an estimated $62 million, is set to be formally announced in April 2026, coinciding with what would have been Queen Elizabeth's 100th birthday month.</p>
