          <p>President Trump publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates by a full percentage point, despite a strong jobs report indicating a resilient economy. Trump argued that such a cut would provide "rocket fuel" for the economy, echoing his frequent calls for lower rates to stimulate growth. However, markets anticipate little chance of a rate decrease following the Federal Open Market Committee's upcoming meeting. The president also reiterated his concerns that other global central banks have been cutting rates while the Fed has remained stagnant, potentially putting the U.S. at a disadvantage.

          <p>Hiring in the U.S. slowed in May, with 139,000 jobs added, as businesses expressed concerns over President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies.

Federal government employment also declined due to the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to cut spending.

          <p>Air quality conditions are improving across the United States as smoke from Canadian wildfires diminishes after prompting air quality alerts earlier in the week. The Air Quality Index indicates primarily moderate air quality in the Midwest and Northeast, with some areas still facing unhealthy air for sensitive groups. While some air quality alerts remain in effect, the smoke is becoming less intense. Over 200 fires continue to burn in Canada, leading to the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents.</p>

          <p>Financial regulators are cracking down on "finfluencers" who provide unauthorized financial advice on social media, resulting in arrests and the removal of hundreds of posts and websites. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is leading an international effort to address illegal financial promotions, often packaged as lavish lifestyle endorsements. The crackdown aims to protect consumers from misleading or harmful financial advice. The FCA is also considering lifting the ban on offering crypto exchange traded notes to retail investors.
