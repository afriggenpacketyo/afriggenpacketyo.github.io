          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need to monitor risks in Seoul's housing market and rising household debt. Despite holding the rate, the central bank upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2%, signaling modest economic improvement. The decision comes as the nation navigates its trade relationship with the U.S., which recently saw lowered tariffs on South Korean exports following significant investment pledges. Analysts suggest that with inflation near the target, the bank may consider a rate cut in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

While South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Nikkei 225 saw modest gains, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 declined. The market report also highlights strong earnings from Australian airline Qantas and a major capital raise by Lynas Rare Earths.

          <p>A controversial immigration facility in the Florida Everglades, known as "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have no detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The announcement follows a federal judge's order to wind down operations at the temporary center, which was the subject of multiple lawsuits. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams denied a request from the Trump administration and Florida officials to stay her order, rejecting their arguments that the facility was necessary due to overcrowding elsewhere. The state had constructed the facility in just eight days, and top officials had testified it was expected to cost approximately $400 million.</p>

The winning numbers for Wednesday's drawing were 9, 12, 22, 41, 61, with a Powerball of 25. A single winner would have the option of a lump-sum cash payment of approximately $383.7 million before taxes or an annuity paid over 30 years.

          <p>In a civil trial where she is accused of assaulting a security guard, rapper Cardi B's defense was bolstered by testimony from a receptionist and a doctor. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, is seeking $24 million, alleging the rapper scratched and spat on her during a 2018 confrontation outside a doctor's office. However, the receptionist testified that she saw the guard corner the pregnant rapper and that she herself sustained a cut on her forehead during the fracas, which she believes was caused by Ellis. Cardi B reiterated that while heated words were exchanged, she never physically touched the guard.</p>

          <p>JD Property, the real estate arm of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, is reportedly collaborating with Swiss firm Partners Group and Hillhouse-backed EZA Hill Property to establish a US$1 billion Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) in Singapore. According to sources, the REIT could be listed on the Singapore Exchange as early as next year and is expected to include industrial and logistics assets in Singapore recently acquired by the consortium. If successful, this would mark one of the largest new REIT listings in Singapore in over a year, highlighting growing investor confidence and the increasing influence of Chinese capital in Southeast Asia.

          <p>A tense verbal confrontation occurred between tennis players Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko following their second-round match at the US Open, which Townsend won. After the customary handshake, the two exchanged words, with Townsend later stating that Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open champion, insulted her education and class. Ostapenko took to social media to accuse Townsend of being disrespectful during the match, including not apologizing for a net cord ball at a crucial moment. This incident is not the first time Ostapenko has been involved in a contentious on-court interaction with an opponent.</p>

          <p>According to a new NATO report, all 32 member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, the report also reveals that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious target of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but emphasized the need to convert these funds into tangible military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, forecasting continued strong sales growth driven by demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Despite the positive overall results, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue of $41.1 billion fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The company's overall revenue grew 56% year-over-year to $46.74 billion, marking the ninth straight quarter of over 50% growth. Nvidia's finance chief stated the company anticipates AI infrastructure spending to reach between $3 and $4 trillion by the end of the decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated there is a "real possibility" of bringing the company's advanced Blackwell AI processor to the Chinese market, contingent on U.S. government approval. Huang's comments came after the White House previously struck a deal allowing limited sales of the older H20 chip to China, and he continues to advocate for American tech companies' access to the crucial market. He estimated that China represents a $50 billion opportunity for Nvidia this year and predicted the market could grow by 50% annually. Any version of the Blackwell chip sold in China would need to be modified to comply with U.S. export regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is rolling out the final phase of its expanded childcare plan, offering working parents in England 30 hours a week of funded care for children aged nine months to three years. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged eligible parents to apply for the program, which aims to alleviate the high cost of childcare. However, the expansion has raised concerns about the availability of sufficient staffing and places to meet the increased demand. While the program is intended to make care more affordable, some providers still charge for extras like meals and supplies to cover funding shortfalls.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Cracker Barrel has reversed its decision to adopt a new, minimalist logo less than ten days after its announcement, following a significant backlash from conservative customers. The controversy was fueled by claims that the redesign was a sign of the company abandoning its traditional, rural American identity for a "woke" corporate aesthetic. This article argues that Cracker Barrel has always been a corporate simulation of authentic rural life, designed to capitalize on nostalgia. The brief and unpopular rebranding effort, much like the company's original concept, was simply another corporate attempt to appeal to a target demographic.</p>
