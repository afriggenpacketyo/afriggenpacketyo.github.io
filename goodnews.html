          <p>In a humorous essay, author David Sedaris reflects on the awkwardness and social pressure of modern tipping, particularly with the rise of digital payment screens that prompt for specific percentages. He humorously recounts an experience at an airport breakfast spot where he felt compelled to tip 22% for minimal service, contrasting it with more physically demanding tasks that go unrewarded. The piece satirizes the guilt and internal monologues that accompany these small financial decisions, touching on themes of work, value, and social obligation.</p>

          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that building a personal brand is a crucial tool for career success, especially for those who are naturally less outspoken. She suggests that a personal brand, which is essentially what you are known for professionally, allows introverts to shape their own narrative and showcase their talents. Chan recommends taking small, consistent steps, like networking or posting online, to build visibility and overcome the fear of self-promotion, emphasizing that this can lead to significant opportunities.</p>

          <p>A new biography of novelist Muriel Spark prompts a re-examination of her work, arguing that her reputation as a comic writer obscures her significance as a major religious author. The article posits that Spark, a Roman Catholic convert, used narrative techniques like omniscience and irony to explore themes of divine judgment, free will, and the nature of God. Her fiction, particularly influenced by the Book of Job, often plays with the relationship between an all-knowing creator and flawed human characters, communicating her complex theology through literary form rather than explicit discussion.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old and his family from Ohio quit their jobs and moved to Taiwan for over a year after saving $60,000, aiming to give their young son extended time with his grandparents. The career break allowed them to immerse themselves in the culture, focus on personal health, and reassess their professional priorities, realizing they could live happily on less. The transformative experience, which also included the birth of their second child, highlighted the importance of prioritizing family and personal well-being over a conventional career path.</p>

          <p>As generative AI provides sophisticated tools for cybercriminals, companies are fighting back by integrating autonomous AI agents into their cybersecurity operations. These "agentic teammates" can automate routine tasks like threat detection, analysis, and response, freeing up human analysts to focus on more complex challenges and helping to address the industry's talent shortage. While experts see this as an essential evolution to counter AI-powered attacks, they emphasize a "trust but verify" approach, viewing the technology as an augmentation for human workers rather than a replacement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," uses the framework of a historical witch story to examine why female power is often perceived as a threat. Set in the 18th century, the plot follows five enigmatic sisters who are accused of transforming into dogs, a rumor that incites fear and rage in their village. The review notes that while the novel sometimes states its themes too directly, its lush, violent prose and engagement with literary tropes create a compelling narrative about how collective suspicion can curdle into persecution.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars rookie kicker Cam Little made a remarkable 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. While the kick will not count as an official NFL record because it occurred in the preseason, the feat was celebrated enthusiastically by his teammates. The successful attempt, which would have been good from nearly 75 yards, showcases Little's powerful leg and potential as a strategic weapon for the team, particularly in end-of-game situations. The current official NFL record is a 66-yard field goal by Justin Tucker.</p>

The country is gaining popularity due to its surprising affordability, with low costs for rent and healthcare, and its stunning natural beauty, from the Albanian Alps to the Ionian coast. A significant advantage is that Americans can stay for up to a year without a visa, making it an ideal place to "test drive" expat life while enjoying a welcoming culture and a growing international community.</p>
