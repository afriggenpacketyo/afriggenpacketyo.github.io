          <p>Britain's MI6 spy agency has named Blaise Metreweli as its first female chief, succeeding Richard Moore. Metreweli, the current head of technology and innovation at MI6, will assume her new role in the autumn, marking a historic milestone for the agency. She joined government service in 1999 and has held director-level roles in MI6's domestic sister agency, MI5, spending most of her career in the Middle East and Europe. She takes over MI6 at a time when the UK faces unprecedented challenges from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and non-state entities. Her appointment signifies a shift towards greater diversity and inclusion within the intelligence community. </p>

The trend reflects a growing emphasis on recovery and wellness in fitness. </p>
