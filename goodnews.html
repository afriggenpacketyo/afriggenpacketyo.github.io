          <p>Securing a pay raise is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and should be viewed as an ongoing process, according to a negotiation expert. The article advises that timing is crucial, suggesting that mid-year check-ins are more effective than annual reviews, when budgets are often already set. To be successful, employees should be prepared for a multi-week process involving several meetings, patient follow-ups, and clear documentation to hold both parties accountable.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a 9.01% stake in Tripadvisor, intending to engage with the company's management and board to unlock shareholder value.

Starboard's involvement could lead to operational improvements, a sale of assets, or even a full acquisition of the company. (not investment advice)</p>

In her book "Rich Girl Nation," she explains that this spending on depreciating assets like hair and nails can be an insidious force in women's financial lives. Tassin advocates for a "hot girl detox," urging women to analyze these costs and redirect the saved money toward wealth-building activities like paying off debt and investing.</p>
