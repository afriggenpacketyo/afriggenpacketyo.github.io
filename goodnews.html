          <p>A federal judge in Colorado temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder. The judge, citing potential irreparable harm, issued the order after the family was taken into custody by ICE. Soliman's family, Egyptian citizens, entered the U.S. in 2022 and sought asylum. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of relatives violates democratic justice principles, referencing the right to file habeas petitions under the U.S. Constitution. The judge scheduled a hearing for June 13. </p>

          <p>The 2025 NBA Finals between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers marks a generational shift, featuring teams primarily composed of Gen Z players. The Thunder, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and the Pacers, led by Tyrese Haliburton, represent a new blueprint for the league, moving away from super teams. Both teams built their rosters through strategic draft picks and trades, connecting with younger fans through social media. This matchup signifies a passing of the torch in a league traditionally dominated by veterans. </p>

The UK drugs regulator advises women to use contraception while taking these medicines and for a period afterward. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. Weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese. </p>
