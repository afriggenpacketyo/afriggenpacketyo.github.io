          <p>Extreme heatwaves in Europe are changing the way people plan their holidays, with many opting for milder destinations or traveling during cooler months. A significant percentage of Europeans have adjusted their travel plans due to climate change, with some choosing destinations with milder weather. This shift is impacting traditional summer tourism hotspots in the Mediterranean, as travelers seek alternative locations or times to travel. The trend may lead to a leveling of tourism peaks and increased investment in year-round tourism options.</p>

          <p>"Trans Los Angeles" is a feature film composed of three non-overlapping vignettes sharing a wide-ranging set of experiences that Angelenos face daily. The movie tells stories that get to the heart of the struggle and beauty of being human in L.A., and the trans experience in general. Director Kase Peña moved to L.A. nearly a decade ago and was inspired to make her film after noticing a lack of representation for trans stories that reflected the realities of her community. For Peña, being transgender is about having the freedom to be who you are, not about passing.</p>
