        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazilian club Fluminense has unexpectedly reached the Club World Cup final, where they will face Chelsea. The team's success is attributed to manager Renato Gaúcho's tactics and the veteran leadership of 40-year-old defender Thiago Silva, who previously played for Chelsea. Despite being underdogs throughout the tournament, Fluminense has demonstrated strong defensive solidity, conceding few goals. The final represents a special occasion for Silva, who won the Champions League with Chelsea and now seeks a major international title with the club where his youth career began, creating a compelling narrative for the championship match.</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank has surprisingly decided to hold its policy rate at 3.85%, defying market expectations of a 25-basis-point cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it requires more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably on track to its target of 2.5%. While recent monthly inflation data was slightly stronger than anticipated, it remains near a four-year low. The decision, which caused the Australian dollar to strengthen, was met with disappointment from the government, which highlighted the progress made in curbing inflation amid a period of slowing economic growth.

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels defeated the Texas Rangers 6-5 after Nolan Schanuel drew a bases-loaded, walk-off walk in the bottom of the ninth inning. A key moment earlier in the game came when veteran catcher Travis d’Arnaud hit a two-run home run against his former battery mate, Jacob deGrom. D'Arnaud later hit a crucial game-tying double in the sixth inning, setting the stage for the dramatic finish. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the Angels, who had previously suffered a series of close, one-run losses and showed their resilience by fighting until the final out.</p>

          <p>A new malaria treatment, the first specifically formulated for babies and very young children, has been approved for use and is expected to be rolled out in Africa within weeks. Developed by Novartis in partnership with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, the drug addresses a critical treatment gap for infants weighing under 4.5kg, who were previously treated with modified doses of drugs for older children. Malaria caused nearly 600,000 deaths in 2023, with about three-quarters of them being children under five in Africa. This breakthrough is being hailed as a major public health advancement in the fight against the deadly disease.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is in the United Kingdom for a three-day state visit focused on critical political discussions with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The agenda is topped by the contentious issue of stopping migrant crossings in the English Channel and advancing plans for a post-ceasefire security force for Ukraine. The visit, which includes royal pageantry at Windsor Castle, is the first state visit by an EU leader since Brexit and symbolizes the U.K.'s effort to reset relations with the bloc. Both leaders aim to strengthen cooperation on smashing smuggling gangs and providing support for Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Gains Popularity Among Chinese Students as U.S. Appeal Wanes</h2>

          <p>Singapore is becoming an increasingly popular destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as the United States loses some of its appeal. Many Chinese students cite difficulties adjusting to cultural differences and growing safety concerns as reasons for shifting their preference away from American universities. Singapore offers a multicultural environment with a significant Chinese influence, a high degree of economic openness, and a reputation for safety. Industry insiders predict that Singapore's top universities will see a rise in applications from China, reflecting a broader trend of students seeking alternative, high-quality international education options.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reportedly begun phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at some U.S. airports. Sources confirm the change is being implemented at airports including Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia, though travelers at other major hubs have also reported not having to remove footwear. This move alters a post-9/11 security protocol that has been in place nationwide since 2006, following the attempted "shoe bomber" incident in 2001. The TSA stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining strong security.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict "renovictions," a practice where landlords evict tenants under the pretext of a substantial remodel to charge higher rents to new occupants. The new amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance will prevent landlords from evicting for renovations unless they have a formal order from a government agency citing code violations. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated during legitimate remodels, either through financial compensation or by providing comparable temporary housing. This policy aims to protect renters from displacement while creating a clear process for necessary property upgrades.</p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa in an effort to revive its tourism sector. This policy has led to a noticeable increase in foreign visitors, with tour operators reporting a surge in bookings, particularly from European countries that were recently added to the list. The move is designed to stimulate the economy and enhance China's soft power after a sharp decline in international visitors following the pandemic. Travel companies are optimistic, noting that business is up significantly compared to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will terminate its partnership with the e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit. The suit alleged that the university and the firm misled students by misrepresenting a cybersecurity boot camp, suggesting it had closer ties to the prestigious campus and its faculty than it actually did. As part of the settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn did not admit wrongdoing but agreed to new transparency rules and will refund $2.4 million in tuition to hundreds of students. The decision marks a significant development in the scrutiny of partnerships between universities and third-party online program managers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have laid off tens of thousands of employees in August. The VA announced that it is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, thus eliminating the need for mass layoffs. The original plan aimed to cut staff to 2019 levels, a reduction of over 80,000 jobs. VA Secretary Doug Collins stated that a department-wide review showed the agency is "headed in the right direction."</p>
