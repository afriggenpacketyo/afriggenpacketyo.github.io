          <h2>Consumer Inflation Fears Ease Amid Reduced Tariff Threats, Fed Survey Indicates (not investment advice)</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent New York Federal Reserve survey indicates that Americans' fears about inflation decreased in May, coinciding with President Trump's decision to ease some tariff threats. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 3.2%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease from April, while the three-year and five-year forecasts also saw slight declines. This shift in attitude aligns with Trump's initial imposition of tariffs followed by a 90-day negotiating window. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett highlighted that inflation has decreased despite rising tariff revenue. The survey also revealed positive movement in employment, with fewer respondents expecting to lose their jobs, and increased confidence in the stock market. The survey provides insights into consumer expectations regarding inflation and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, stated that he has forgiven Zia Yusuf after Yusuf criticized one of the party's MPs and subsequently resigned as chairman. Yusuf stepped down after calling MP Sarah Pochin's call for a burka ban 'dumb,' but later reversed his decision to leave the party entirely. Farage said Yusuf 'lost his rag' and made 'intemperate comment or two,' but regretted his actions. Yusuf will now lead the party's Doge unit, focusing on cutting wasteful spending in councils controlled by Reform UK. The incident began when Pochin questioned the Prime Minister about banning the burka, leading to Yusuf's critical remarks.</p>
