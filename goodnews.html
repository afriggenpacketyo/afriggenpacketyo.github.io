          <p>President Trump has confirmed he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. This meeting follows a period of increased pressure from the Trump administration on Moscow, including threats of significant "secondary tariffs" on Russia's trade partners if a ceasefire is not reached. The announcement comes after a U.S. envoy's meeting with Putin was described as "highly productive," shifting the tone from recent disappointment over the lack of diplomatic progress. The terms of any potential peace deal, particularly regarding territorial control, remain a central point of negotiation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Seoul has introduced a new initiative called "warm-hearted convenience stores" to address growing rates of loneliness and social isolation among its residents. These centers provide a welcoming, cafe-like atmosphere where visitors can get free food, like ramen, and connect with social workers and other people. The program has been unexpectedly popular, particularly with young people and the elderly, reflecting a societal shift toward single-person households and the erosion of traditional family structures. This effort is part of a broader government strategy to tackle the "lonely deaths" phenomenon and support a population struggling with the pressures of modern urban life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary directed by Amy Berg, "It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley," provides a deeply personal and honest portrait of the late musician, who died in 1997 at age 30. The film moves beyond the myth of a doom-laden figure, instead focusing on his complex interior life through archival footage and intimate interviews with his mother, former partners, and bandmates. It traces his creative development in New York's East Village, his struggles with sudden fame after the release of his only album, "Grace," and the circumstances surrounding his accidental death. The documentary is praised for dimensionalizing Buckley as a person rather than just an icon.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace deal at the White House, formally ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Hosted by President Trump, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised the agreement as the start of a new chapter of peace. A key component of the deal is the establishment of a transit corridor through the South Caucasus, connecting parts of Azerbaijan, with the U.S. granted exclusive development rights. The agreement signals a significant shift in regional geopolitics and a waning of Russia's traditional influence in the area.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is remembered for his calm leadership during the 1970 flight, which suffered an in-flight explosion but returned its crew safely to Earth, becoming known as a "successful failure." He was also part of the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, during which the crew captured the iconic "Earthrise" photograph. Lovell's career as a naval aviator and test pilot was foundational to his unflappable performance during the Apollo 13 crisis, which was later immortalized in a popular film.</p>

          <p>The recent death of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell at age 97 highlights the dwindling number of astronauts who have traveled to the Moon. Now, only five members of the pioneering Apollo program are still alive, including Buzz Aldrin and David Scott, who walked on the lunar surface. This comes as a new space race is underway, with NASA's Artemis program aiming to return humans to the Moon this decade, facing competition from China and private companies. The article reflects on the legacies of the remaining astronauts and the challenges facing the next generation of lunar explorers over 50 years later.</p>

          <p>Independent Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe has admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." Lowe posted a picture of their boat on social media, announcing he had alerted authorities and called for mass deportations. It was later revealed that the boat contained a crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. After learning of his error, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity, while the rowers described the incident as "hilarious."</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance with President Trump at the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. This commitment, particularly to buying U.S. chips, eased investor fears about the potential impact of tariffs on the company's profitability. President Trump suggested that Apple's domestic investments would exempt it from future tariffs on imported components, boosting market confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in certain U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from their 2022 peaks, with declines of nearly 15% and 19% respectively. This cooling is attributed to a growing housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and "sticky high" prices, with cities like Milwaukee and New York seeing prices climb significantly since 2022.</p>

          <p>Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials rose after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the second quarter, driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is essential for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and robotics, and the company's output increased 119% over the previous year. The positive results have boosted investor confidence, especially following a recent $400 million investment from the Department of Defense, which made the federal government MP's largest shareholder.

          <p>The U.S. government is providing significant bipartisan support to bolster the domestic mining industry, aiming to reduce reliance on foreign-sourced critical minerals. An example is a former coal mine in Beulah, North Dakota, which will be transformed into a nickel processing plant with the help of a $114 million Department of Energy grant. This initiative, supported by policies from both the Biden and Trump administrations, seeks to secure supply chains for materials like nickel, which are vital for electric vehicle batteries and defense technology. The Pentagon is also directly investing to encourage the discovery of new mineral sources within the U.S.</p>
