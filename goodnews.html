          <p>Elon Musk stated at the Qatar Economic Forum that he intends to decrease his political spending in the future, a notable shift for a prominent backer of President Trump.

While he didn't rule out future political donations entirely, he currently sees no reason to continue spending at the same level. This announcement could impact Republican fundraising efforts for upcoming elections. (not investment advice)</p>
