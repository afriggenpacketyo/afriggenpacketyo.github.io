          <p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is facing lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny in Africa over data privacy violations, with Nigerian authorities issuing substantial fines for regulatory breaches and a lawsuit being prepared against Majorel, a Meta content moderation contractor, in Ghana. The lawsuits allege discriminatory practices, unauthorized data sharing, and inadequate psychological support for content moderators, prompting calls for stronger regulatory frameworks to hold tech companies accountable. African countries are seeking to assert digital sovereignty and generate regulatory revenue, while concerns persist about governments using digital regulation to suppress dissent, and the outcomes of these legal battles could set precedents for data protection across the continent. This article highlights the growing tension between tech giants and African regulators regarding data privacy and digital rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, even as the luxury sector faces a broader slowdown. While sales declined in the company's specialist watchmakers segment, overall full-year sales rose, with Japan leading annual growth due to strong domestic and tourist spending, and the company remains cautious about ongoing global uncertainties. Analysts note that Richemont faces headwinds from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations, but the company's pricing power could provide a buffer, (not investment advice). The article highlights the resilience of luxury spending among the wealthiest consumers despite macroeconomic challenges.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to resolve major disputes over President Trump's domestic policy bill, which includes extending tax cuts, increasing military and border security spending, and cutting Medicaid and clean energy subsidies, and conservative members are pushing for deeper spending cuts while blue-state Republicans are demanding a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. House Speaker Mike Johnson is committed to bringing the bill to a vote before Memorial Day, but faces challenges in securing enough support from both factions, and the outcome remains uncertain as negotiations continue. The article highlights the internal divisions within the Republican party and the difficulties in passing key legislation.</p>

          <p>Paula Kerger, the CEO of PBS, discusses the challenges the public broadcaster faces amid threats to federal funding and scrutiny from Congress, emphasizing the importance of PBS's mission to connect America with educational and cultural programming, particularly in rural areas. Kerger highlights that federal grants make up a significant portion of the budget for local PBS stations, and she defends PBS against accusations of bias, noting that a large portion of its content is dedicated to children's programming. Kerger remains hopeful that the current challenges will lead to a broader conversation about the value of public media and its role in serving the public interest, and she underscores PBS's commitment to innovation and its role as an incubator for new ideas. </p>

          <p>President Trump criticized former FBI Director James Comey over an Instagram post that contained an image some Trump allies interpreted as a threat, with the post featuring "8647" written in seashells, which some viewed as a call for violence against Trump. Comey said he did not intend any violence or threat, and he removed the post, but Trump dismissed Comey's explanation and suggested he knew exactly what the message meant, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the U.S. Secret Service is investigating Comey's post. This article highlights the ongoing animosity between Trump and Comey and the charged political climate surrounding social media posts. </p>

          <p>House Republicans' tax bill includes a temporary $4,000 deduction for older adults, framed as a "bonus" to help retirees keep more money, as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. The proposal offers an additional deduction to adults ages 65 and over, phasing out at higher income levels, but its impact is limited, potentially cutting taxes by less than $500 per year for a median-income retiree, (not investment advice).

Novogratz told CNBC that a process that should take 45 to 90 days stretched out to 1,320 days. He said it took nine rounds of comments with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The billionaire crypto mogul will finally ring the opening bell at the Nasdaq Friday under the ticker GLXY with his company trading on U.S. public markets for the first time in a direct listing.</p>

          <p>Experts say it's just not feasible. "Some parts that have been offshored will still be cheaper to manufacture in those locations rather than the USA at scale even with some of the imposed tariffs," said Martin French, a longtime supplier executive and partner at Berylls Strategy Advisors USA. On top of that, the increased costs of a 100% U.S.-made vehicle could price many consumers out of the new vehicle market. That could in turn lead to less demand and likely lower production.</p>
