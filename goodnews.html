          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, postponing the termination until at least a November hearing. In her decision, the judge stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the terminations were "preordained" actions that did not fully consider current country conditions. The judge also found it likely the decisions were motivated by racial animus, citing various statements by the administration.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has extended deportation protections for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program. In a sharply worded order, Judge Trina Thompson ruled that the administration's decision to end their status was likely motivated by racial animus. The judge referenced President Trump's campaign rhetoric, stating the immigrants were being told to "atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood." The ruling keeps the protections in place while the case proceeds, preventing their imminent deportation.</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the White House's revised tariff schedule, which offered relief to some nations. Cambodia's Prime Minister celebrated a rate cut from a threatened 49% to 19%, while Thailand's finance minister called its 19% tariff reflective of a close partnership. Taiwan faces a 20% temporary tariff pending further negotiations, and Malaysia also saw its rate reduced. Japan, having already secured a 15% rate, expressed that the new tariffs reduce uncertainty, though it continues to push for further reductions on its auto sector.</p>

          <p>In the NFL's preseason Hall of Fame Game, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance, throwing for 120 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Los Angeles Chargers to a 34-7 win over the Detroit Lions. The game, which featured primarily backup and roster-hopeful players, also saw impressive plays from rookie cornerback Nikko Reed. Lance, competing for the backup quarterback position, looked sharp and polished in his extended playing time. The game began with a moment of silence for the victims of the recent shooting at the NFL's headquarters.</p>

While AWS continues to lead the cloud infrastructure market, it faces growing competition from Microsoft and Google, both of which reported higher cloud growth rates. CEO Andy Jassy noted that AWS remains significantly larger than its next closest competitor and continues to face supply constraints for AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump says will be his "gift to the country." The estimated $200 million building will be funded by the president and other "patriot donors" and is intended to provide a permanent, suitable venue for large-scale events, which currently require tents on the South Lawn. The new structure will replace the current East Wing and marks the first major structural change to the executive mansion since 1948. Construction is planned to be completed before the end of Trump's term in 2029.</p>

          <p>The design software company Figma made a blockbuster debut on the stock market, with its shares soaring 250% on the first day of trading. The successful IPO created a massive paper windfall for its early venture capital backers, including Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia, who collectively hold a stake now valued at roughly $24 billion. The outcome was a fortunate turn for the company, which was set to be acquired by Adobe for $20 billion before the deal collapsed due to regulatory pressure. Figma's success signals a potential reopening of the tech IPO market after a prolonged slump.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new research, the modern potato's ancestor is unexpectedly the tomato. A study published in the journal Cell proposes that the potato evolved around 9 million years ago through a hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuber-producing wild potato species from Chile. Scientists say the ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to create starchy tubers, while the wild potato provided a gene that controls their growth. This discovery, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, finally solves the long-puzzling mystery of the popular vegetable's origin.</p>

          <p>Apple announced strong fiscal third-quarter results, with revenue growing 10% to $94.04 billion, outpacing estimates and driven by record iPhone sales. Despite the solid performance, the company's stock saw only a modest increase as investors were left wanting more details on its artificial intelligence strategy. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed that AI is a profound technology and that the company is significantly increasing its investment, but offered little new information on the roadmap for 'Apple Intelligence.' The results highlight Apple's current strength but also the market's intense focus on its future in AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A monument honoring Robert Smalls, the enslaved man who commandeered a Confederate ship to win his freedom and later became a U.S. Congressman, is being created for the South Carolina State House grounds. This will be the first statue dedicated to an individual African American at the state capitol, which is currently surrounded by monuments to White men, many with Confederate ties. The project, made possible by a bipartisan push from state lawmakers, is seen by historians as a crucial step to "complete the incomplete and unfinished story" of the state's history.</p>
