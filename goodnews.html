          <p>A U.S. District Judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from implementing significant job cuts and reorganizations across 20 federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Departments of State and Treasury. The lawsuit, brought by federal employee unions, argues that the administration's actions, led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), exceed its legal authority and require Congressional approval. The judge sided with the plaintiffs, stating that the administration's actions appear to be exceeding its authority and the restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days while the case is considered. The administration defends its actions as necessary to cut bureaucratic bloat and save taxpayer money, but unions and Democratic lawmakers view them as unlawful and disruptive.</p>

Baraka, who is running for governor of New Jersey, was taken into custody after demanding to be let through a security gate at the Delaney Hall ICE facility, where protesters and members of Congress were gathered. His administration had previously filed a lawsuit to block the facility's opening, arguing that it lacked proper permits.

          <p>House Republicans introduced the initial components of a $4 trillion tax cut plan, aiming to make key provisions of President Trump's 2017 tax cut permanent while introducing temporary, more generous tax breaks for the next few years. The legislation seeks to lock in place the larger standard deduction and lower individual income tax rates from 2017, while temporarily increasing the standard deduction and child tax credit. The bill does not address the cap on state and local tax deductions or Trump's campaign pledges to exempt certain income forms from taxes, and Democrats have criticized the plan for favoring the wealthy at the expense of programs for the poor.</p>

          <p>Hawaii has reached a $700 million settlement with pharmaceutical companies over its lawsuit concerning the blood thinner Plavix. The lawsuit alleged that the companies failed to update their labels despite knowing that about 30% of patients, particularly non-Caucasians, might have a diminished response to the drug. The settlement divides the funds equally between Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi, with payments due by June 9. While the companies did not admit wrongdoing, they stated they were pleased to resolve the litigation and reaffirmed Plavix's effectiveness as a first-line therapy for cardiovascular disease.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her continued detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa after she co-authored an opinion piece critical of Israel's war. Judge Sessions stated that the government's case rested solely on the op-ed, and there was no evidence of violence or advocacy of violence. Tufts University expressed pleasure at Ozturk's release and affirmed that her op-ed did not violate university policy.</p>

The UK offers a 25% tax rebate, making it cheaper to produce films compared to the US, where tax incentives operate on a state level. Numerous blockbusters, including "Barbie," "Jurassic World: Dominion," and "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny," have utilized UK locations and studios for filming.

The conciliatory tone comes after months of heightened trade tensions, with tariffs reaching up to 145% on Chinese imports.
