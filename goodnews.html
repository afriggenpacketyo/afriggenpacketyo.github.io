        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Skomer Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has recorded a record high of 43,626 puffins, a stark contrast to the rapid decline in global puffin populations. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales attributes this success to the island's isolation, which protects the birds from predators like rats, cats, and foxes, as well as human impact. Skomer also hosts 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills, monitored annually by the WTSWW. Globally, puffins are listed as vulnerable to extinction due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change, highlighting the importance of Skomer's conservation success.</p>

The 24-year-old is the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since 2017, joining Wajima as the only wrestler to reach this rank from university. He secured the promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, meeting the benchmark of consecutive championships as an ozeki. Onosato will face Mongolian yokozuna Hoshoryu at the July Nagoya meet, and his stablemaster hopes he will lead by example and become a role model for other wrestlers.</p>

          <p>Ilham Ahmed, a chair of the foreign relations department of the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, argues that Syria's new interim Constitution fails to reflect the country's diversity and protect the rights of minorities and women. Ahmed advocates for a new constitutional process that guarantees power sharing, safeguards political freedoms, and decentralizes governance. She highlights the model of multiethnic direct democracy in her region, Rojava, where ethnic groups are legally protected and women play a leading role in policymaking.

          <p>China has released a plan to upgrade its information technology (IT) manufacturers and enhance self-sufficiency in technologies like semiconductors, batteries, and AI, aiming to circumvent U.S. tech restrictions. The plan calls for deeper AI integration and the development of specialized service providers by 2027, with a goal of having over 85% of manufacturers using computer numerical control in key processes. By 2030, China intends to establish a core industrial database to enable breakthroughs and move up the global value chain.

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law mandating that 300 to 400 major companies participate in a carbon emissions trading system, set to begin in fiscal year 2026. The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies will receive maximum emission allowances and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold, incentivizing emissions reduction. While intended to lower emissions, the costs of decarbonization efforts may be passed on to consumers through price increases.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is unusual because existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself. This is a rare occurrence in tech IPOs, with Facebook being a notable exception in 2012. Circle did not provide a reason for this decision, but the high amount of insider sales likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. The company is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, but private investors are eager for exits after a multiyear drought in IPOs.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have solved a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, addressing issues of turbulence and vibration at high speeds. Researchers found that track irregularities and electromagnetic resonance could cause violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h, making the ride 'extremely unpleasant.' However, they developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, improving ride comfort. The study, based on supercomputer simulations and prototype tests, could potentially salvage vacuum-tube maglev technology and address challenges faced by Elon Musk‚Äôs Hyperloop concept.</p>
