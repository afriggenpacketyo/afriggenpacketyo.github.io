          <p>A federal judge has dismissed criminal charges against former Atlanta police officer Sung Kim in the 2019 death of Jimmy Atchison, citing "textbook self-defense." Judge Michael Brown stated that the evidence overwhelmingly supported Kim's claim of self-defense during the arrest operation. Kim, who was part of the FBI Atlanta Violent Crime Task Force, shot Atchison after Atchison made a sudden movement toward him while hiding in a closet. The judge based the dismissal on Supremacy Clause immunity and self-defense immunity. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a policy shift regarding winter fuel payments, indicating that more people will qualify for the allowance this year. This decision reverses a previous policy that limited the payment to those on pension credit, a move that drew criticism for excluding millions of pensioners.

          <p>Oklahoma has implemented a successful public, universal pre-K program, offering free education to all 4-year-olds regardless of income. This program addresses both educational and workforce needs, providing children with an extra year of school readiness and offering affordable child care for working parents. Key to Oklahoma's success was a legislative fix that closed a loophole in kindergarten funding, coupled with a voluntary 4-year-old program. Other states can learn from Oklahoma's approach by focusing on how to implement universal pre-K in a way that sustains the private child care industry and develops an appropriate curriculum.
