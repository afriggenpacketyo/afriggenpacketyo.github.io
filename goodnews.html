          <p>The Indian government has approved Apple supplier Foxconn's $433 million joint venture with HCL Group to build a semiconductor plant in Uttar Pradesh, aiming to boost its chip industry. The plant will manufacture display driver chips used in mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, and PCs, with operations expected to begin by 2027. This move aligns with Apple suppliers increasingly shifting to India amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The facility aims to produce up to 20,000 wafers and 36 million display driver chips per month as part of India's "Semiconductor Mission."</p>

          <p>Germany's foreign minister indicated that Berlin supports the U.S.'s call for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. This commitment comes as Germany aims to strengthen its armed forces and take on greater responsibility within NATO and the European Union. While some countries deem the 5% target unrealistic, discussions are ongoing regarding potential compromises, such as increasing classic military spending to 3.5% and investing the remaining 1.5% in defense-related infrastructure. The German Chancellor declared intentions to transform the Bundeswehr into the "strongest conventional army in Europe."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that India has offered to drop all tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. as part of ongoing trade agreement negotiations, though Delhi has not yet commented on these remarks. Trump also mentioned discouraging Apple CEO Tim Cook from expanding production in India, instead urging increased production in the United States. This development occurs amidst existing trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Indian goods, and India's recent efforts to negotiate trade deals with other nations like the UK and the European Free Trade Association. Trump and Modi have previously aimed to more than double trade to $500 billion.</p>

While the Chancellor highlighted the strength and potential of the UK economy, analysts caution that this growth rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased employer taxes. Business investment saw a nearly 6% increase, though some economists remain skeptical about sustained growth, citing the impact of tariffs and domestic business taxes.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of its stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices amid a supply shortfall. This measure follows an earlier release of 321,000 tons and aims to stabilize prices, which had reached near-record highs. Concerns remain about reducing the stockpile to around 300,000 tons, potentially impacting the government's ability to respond to future harvest issues.

          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 274,000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs due to a potential brake issue that could cause a loss of brake function. The front brake lines may contact the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, leading to a brake fluid leak.
