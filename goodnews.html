          <h2>China Partially Lifts Ban on Japanese Seafood Imports as Nations Seek to Reset Ties</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has conditionally lifted its nearly two-year-old ban on seafood imports from certain regions of Japan, a measure initially imposed over the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The easing of restrictions, which still excludes ten prefectures including Fukushima, is seen as a diplomatic step by Beijing to mend strained relations with its neighbor. The decision was made based on monitoring that found no abnormalities in the discharged water and Japan's commitment to product safety. This move comes as both nations navigate complex geopolitical dynamics, including growing trade uncertainty with the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has reversed its plan to implement a digital services tax on major technology companies, a day before the first payments were due. The decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada in response to the tax, which would have primarily affected American tech giants. Ottawa stated the move was made in anticipation of a new comprehensive trade deal, allowing negotiations to resume. The 3% levy was intended to address a taxation gap but was criticized by the U.S. as discriminatory and unfairly retroactive. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has taken effect, reducing the tariff on British car exports from 25% to 10% and prompting a surge in shipments from brands like Mini and Aston Martin. The deal, which applies to a quota of 100,000 cars annually, is expected to unleash pent-up demand after manufacturers paused exports due to the higher levy. However, British farmers have voiced strong criticism, arguing that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip to secure the automotive concessions. They point to the removal of tariffs on American ethanol and limited access for British beef as evidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pride parades around the world, from New York City to Budapest, marked the end of Pride Month with a mix of celebration and protest. While many waved rainbow flags, others held signs demonstrating against increasing political attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, particularly in the U.S. and Hungary. In New York, the theme was "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," commemorating the Stonewall Riots and challenging recent policies targeting transgender people. In Budapest, tens of thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events, marching to assert their visibility and rights in the face of a conservative crackdown.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Glastonbury Festival has concluded after five days of music, featuring epic shows from Olivia Rodrigo and Pulp, and a tear-jerking comeback by Lewis Capaldi. Capaldi returned to the Pyramid Stage to finish the set he had to abandon two years prior due to his Tourette's syndrome, a moment met with immense crowd support. The festival was also notable for its numerous surprise sets from major artists like Lorde and Haim, often overshadowing the official headliners. Celebrity sightings, unique fan traditions like bringing spoons for an Alanis Morissette song, and a poignant tribute to The Prodigy's late frontman Keith Flint were other highlights.</p>
