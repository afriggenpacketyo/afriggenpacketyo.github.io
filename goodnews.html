          <h2>Trump Announces Framework for U.K. Trade Deal Amidst Tariff Negotiations</h2>

          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer announced a preliminary trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K., aiming to increase market access and reduce trade barriers. The deal maintains a 10% tariff on U.K. imports but provides exemptions for the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually. Commerce Secretary Lutnick estimates the deal will generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S., with Rolls Royce engines exempt from tariffs. The agreement is viewed as a symbolic victory for both nations, though some analysts believe its substantive benefits will be limited, as the U.S. still maintains a trade surplus in goods with the U.K.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% in April, surpassing market expectations despite the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the U.S. However, exports to the United States decreased by 21%. Imports to China fell by 0.2% year on year, while China's trade surplus decreased to US$96.18 billion. President Trump had announced tariffs of up to 145% on various Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory duties from China on American goods. The data indicates that while trade tensions impact specific markets, China's overall export sector demonstrates resilience.</p>

          <h2>Miner Says Addiction to China‚Äôs Tungsten Is Over, Regardless of Export Resumption</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Developed nations that produce tungsten products, including those in the defense sector, are recognizing the need to diversify their raw material supply sources. This shift comes after China added tungsten to its export restriction list, causing panic within the industry which has relied on Chinese raw materials for three decades. The CEO of Almonty Industries notes that US defense contractors face a 2027 deadline to cease using Chinese tungsten. Tungsten is crucial for various applications, including cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy technologies.</p>

          <p>An Arizona court allowed the use of an AI-generated likeness of a murder victim, Christopher Pelkey, during the sentencing of his killer. The video, which included a disclaimer about its AI origin, delivered a message of forgiveness. While the judge praised the video, legal experts are debating the ethical implications of using AI in legal proceedings, with some raising concerns about potential manipulation. The defense lawyer suggested the court‚Äôs reliance on the AI video could be grounds for appeal. This case marks a novel use of AI in the justice system.</p>
