          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump has stated that an "open channel of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin led to the reunification of eight Ukrainian children with their families. She revealed that Putin responded to a "peace letter" she sent concerning children displaced by the war, which was initiated as part of her BE BEST advocacy campaign. According to Ukrainian officials, nearly 20,000 children have been forcibly deported to Russia since 2022, and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin over these actions.</p>

          <p>FIFA is reportedly redrafting its regulations concerning domestic league games held abroad and is seeking legal advice on whether it can implement an outright ban on the practice. The move comes after UEFA cited the current FIFA framework in its decision to approve European league matches in Miami and Perth. World football's governing body is aiming to create more robust rules to prevent a global "free-for-all," a concern that has grown since La Liga and Serie A scheduled games in the U.S. and Australia. The new regulations are expected to be ready early next year.</p>

          <p>The Chinese central government has issued new guidelines for local authorities on the use of artificial intelligence, warning them not to provide AI models with access to sensitive data or state secrets. The document outlines approved applications for AI, such as public consultations, infrastructure monitoring, and drafting documents, to improve government efficiency. It also mandates that all AI models undergo a complete safety evaluation before deployment and that government employees receive training on AI ethics and security. This initiative aims to streamline bureaucracy while maintaining strict control over state information.</p>

          <p>Chinese pharmaceutical companies are increasing their investment in Africa, establishing facilities to produce essential medicines like insulin and antimalarials. Projects in Nigeria and the Ivory Coast are part of China's "Health Silk Road" initiative, aimed at addressing the continent's heavy reliance on imported drugs. Africa currently imports approximately 70% of its essential medicines despite bearing a quarter of the world's disease burden. These ventures are intended to fill critical manufacturing gaps and respond to high demand for generic and chronic illness treatments.</p>

          <p>German politicians are debating whether to criminalize verbal sexual harassment in public spaces, a behavior commonly known as catcalling. Currently, such actions are not explicitly covered under the country's sexual offenses legislation, and legal experts note that they are rarely prosecuted under existing insult laws. Proponents, led by the Social Democrats, argue that this behavior constitutes a form of violence that intimidates victims and restricts their freedom in public. The debate reflects a broader European trend, with countries like Belgium, France, and Portugal having already passed similar legislation.</p>
