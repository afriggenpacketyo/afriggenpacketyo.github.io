          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX facility in South Texas, known as Starbase, is on track to become an official city following a vote by local residents, primarily SpaceX employees.

This move has sparked both support and criticism, with concerns raised about Musk's increased control over the area and potential impacts on public access to a popular beach and state park.
