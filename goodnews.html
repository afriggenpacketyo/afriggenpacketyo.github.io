          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new, landmark target of reducing the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030. This significant pledge follows intense public anger over the pollution of rivers and coastlines, and comes after official data showed a 60% increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024, the highest on record. The government's plan also includes measures to ban plastic-containing wet wipes and cut phosphorus pollution, although it coincides with scrutiny of water companies paying large executive bonuses while consumer bills rise to fund infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a performance in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped several feet. The incident occurred while she was singing her hit song "Roar" high above the audience at the Chase Center. Perry quickly recovered from the apparent shock and continued her performance without further interruption, later remarking, "Not today, Satan," as the song concluded. The event highlights the inherent risks associated with the complex aerial stunts that are common in modern large-scale concert productions.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy delivered a thrilling and unusual third round at the Open Championship, delighting home crowds with a score of 66 that moved him to eight under par. His day was marked by a strange incident on the 11th hole where his swing unearthed another golf ball buried in the rough, contributing to a bogey. However, he immediately followed this with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th, producing one of the loudest roars of the tournament and keeping his hopes for a title challenge alive heading into the final day.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler has taken firm control of the Open Championship, building a four-shot lead heading into the final day of the tournament at Royal Portrush. His steady, unflappable performance, resulting in a 14-under-par score, has created an air of inevitability around his potential victory. While competitors like Matt Fitzpatrick briefly challenged, Scheffler's remarkable consistency and key par saves on the back nine widened the gap. His dominance has been so pronounced that bookmakers have him at extremely short odds to secure his third major title of the year.</p>

          <p>Germany is deepening its security and political cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a trio known as the "E3" in response to significant geopolitical shifts. This pivot includes a new comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, focusing on security and arms collaboration. The alliance is driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty over future US commitments to NATO, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasizing the need for Europe to become more self-reliant in its defense, viewing the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK as a potential supplement to US protection.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler is in a commanding position to win his first Open Championship, holding a four-shot lead after the third round at Royal Portrush. A steady, bogey-free round of 67 took him to 14 under par, ahead of his closest challenger, Li Haotong of China. While home favorite Rory McIlroy produced an exciting charge to move up the leaderboard, Scheffler's consistent and error-free play has made him the clear favorite to claim the Claret Jug, which would be his third major championship victory of the season.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly nearing a move to FC Barcelona after a deal in principle was reached between the clubs. The transfer, expected to be an initial loan with an option to buy, comes after Rashford fell out of favor at Old Trafford and has not played for the club since last December. Barcelona has been seeking to strengthen its attack after missing out on other targets, and despite Rashford's inconsistent form, the club appears to see potential in the 27-year-old England international. The move offers a fresh start for the player and a low-risk opportunity for the Spanish champions.</p>

          <p>Eighty-one years ago, on July 20, 1944, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler with a bomb at his Wolf's Lair headquarters in an event known as "Operation Valkyrie." The plot, organized by a group of conservative military and civilian officials, ultimately failed when Hitler survived the blast with minor injuries, leading to the swift execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. While the plotters' motives and democratic credentials have been debated by historians, the event endures as a powerful and revered symbol of German resistance against the Nazi regime.</p>
