          <p>Director Chloé Zhao premiered her new film "Hamnet" at the Telluride Film Festival, an adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's novel about William Shakespeare's family and the death of their son. The film, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, received a very positive reception. In an interview, Zhao discussed her personal journey, including the "painful fire" of the critical reaction to her Marvel film "Eternals," and how her experiences with grief and personal challenges informed her more intimate, character-driven approach to "Hamnet." She reflected on moving from chasing horizons to a more introspective phase in her life and career.</p>

          <p>The community of Kerrville, Texas, gathered for its high school's opening football game, seeking a sense of normalcy and healing after suffering from severe flash flooding in July. The Tivy Antlers' home stadium, which had served as a volunteer hub and memorial site in the wake of the disaster, became a symbol of resilience. The traditional Friday night football game provided a much-needed communal event for residents still recovering from the widespread damage. The event underscores the cultural importance of high school sports in bringing Texas communities together during difficult times.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old mother sought advice from Dave Ramsey after financing a $27,000 car for her daughter, who failed to refinance the loan and accumulated toll tickets under the mother's name. The mother was considering using a home equity line of credit or other funds to pay off the car. Ramsey strongly advised against this, stating that her actions had hurt, not helped, her daughter by putting her in a vehicle she couldn't afford. Co-host Rachel Cruze suggested selling the car, taking out a small loan to cover any negative equity, and helping the daughter buy a more affordable $5,000 vehicle. (not investment advice)</p>

Will Jacks was the star performer, scoring a brilliant 72 from 41 balls to help the Invincibles post a total of 168-5. Despite a late rally from the Rockets, led by Marcus Stoinis' 64, their chase fell short. Australian leg-spinner Nathan Sowter played a crucial role for the Invincibles, taking three key wickets for just three runs to dismantle the Rockets' batting lineup.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order to halt the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala. The emergency order came just as planes were reportedly being prepared for takeoff in Texas. Lawyers for the children argued the deportations were illegal, as the minors had not been given the opportunity to pursue asylum claims or other legal protections as required by U.S. law. The judge's order will remain in effect for 14 days, preventing the children from being removed while the legal challenges are considered.</p>

          <p>Gordon Ramsay revealed on social media that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and had a basal cell carcinoma surgically removed from the side of his face. The celebrity chef shared photos of the bandage and stitch marks, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. This is the second time Ramsay has used a personal health scare to promote public safety, following a bicycle accident last year where he advocated for wearing helmets. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer and has a very high cure rate when detected early.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The deal is expected to support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership will create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, significantly strengthening NATO's northern flank against potential threats. The agreement was hailed as a major success for the British defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the U.S.</p>
