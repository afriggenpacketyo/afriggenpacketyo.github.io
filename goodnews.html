        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emma Raducanu was defeated by Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals at Queen's Club, despite showing promise on the grass court. Zheng's powerful groundstrokes and serve proved challenging for Raducanu, who struggled with back spasms during the match. Raducanu initially gained a double break in the second set but couldn't maintain her lead as Zheng rallied to win. While the loss is a setback, Raducanu can draw confidence from her performance on the grass and recognize the gap she needs to bridge to compete with top players. There is a moderately optimistic outlook for Raducanu's future performances.</p>

          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced his departure to Meta as part of a $14.3 billion investment deal, where Meta will acquire a 49% stake in the AI startup. Jason Droege, Scale AI's chief strategy officer, will take over as CEO, and a small number of Scale AI employees will also join Meta. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg aims to strengthen the company's AI efforts amid competition from OpenAI and Google. Wang's move is seen as a strategic decision to bolster Meta's AI initiatives, although Scale AI assures customers that the deal will not impact their business or data. The shift in leadership and investment signals a moderately optimistic outlook for Meta's AI endeavors.</p>

          <p>Aiden Markram's unbeaten century has positioned South Africa close to a historic victory against Australia in the World Test Championship final. After Australia was dismissed for 207, Markram and Temba Bavuma formed an unbroken 143-run partnership. South Africa needs 69 more runs to secure the win, potentially ending their wait for a major men's final victory. The match's outcome hinges on Australia's bowlers' ability to mount a remarkable comeback. With South Africa on the verge of a significant win, there is a high optimism score.</p>

          <p>The FDA has expanded its approval of Moderna's RSV vaccine, mRESVIA, to include adults under 60 at increased risk of the disease. This decision follows a clinical trial demonstrating the vaccine's ability to boost immune responses in younger adults. While the FDA has approved the vaccine for this age group, the CDC must still recommend it. Recent changes to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee have raised questions about the future of vaccine recommendations.
