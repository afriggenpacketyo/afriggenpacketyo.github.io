          <p>Andy Farrell, the head coach of the British and Irish Lions, is being praised for his ability to build connections and foster a winning environment through tactics and systems. Players like Johnny Sexton highlight Farrell's inclusive approach, where everyone's ideas are valued, creating a special atmosphere in the Lions camp. His capacity to provide clarity and confidence has earned him unanimous backing from decision-makers, positioning him to tackle the daunting challenge of the upcoming tour to Australia. Farrell's track record demonstrates his consistent success in overcoming challenges, making him a promising leader for the Lions. The pre-tour game against Argentina in Dublin marks the start of an important new chapter for Farrell. </p>

          <p>Recent exchanges between Israel and Iran have spotlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, drawing attention to the potential of a similar system in the U.S. Known as the Golden Dome, this multi-layered missile defense system aims to protect the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles through a network of satellites, sensors, and interceptors. Despite concerns about its cost and potential to escalate arms races, defense companies are eager to contribute to the project. The formation of a Golden Dome Caucus in the House of Representatives and a substantial allocation in the fiscal 2026 defense spending bill signal ongoing support for the initiative.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trade Minister Douglas Alexander suggests that public support for international aid spending has waned, even if financial constraints were not a factor. This comes as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has cut the international aid budget to increase defense spending, a move criticized by charities. Alexander, a former international development secretary, acknowledges the importance of investing in a stable and safe world, but notes a decline in public consent for aid. A recent survey indicates support for cutting aid to boost defense spending, though some argue that public backing for aid remains strong and essential for national security. The government's new trade strategy will focus on services and removing trade barriers. </p>

          <p>Experts are urging for increased vision screenings in schools to detect lazy eyes (amblyopia) early, as some councils face constraints that limit their ability to offer this service. The British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) advocates for screenings in all schools in England, similar to Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, emphasizing that treatment is most effective before age seven. Parents share concerns about missed opportunities for early intervention, highlighting the challenges of detecting the condition at home. School-based screenings have proven effective in identifying children who need further checks, ensuring timely access to treatment and preventing potential long-term vision problems. </p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits. Testing on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits demonstrated the coating's effectiveness in delaying rot by almost a week or more, at a low cost of 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. The new strategy matches the effectiveness of existing preservation methods while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity. This innovation offers a promising, eco-friendly solution to reduce food waste, addressing a significant global issue where around a third of all food produced is wasted. </p>

Marcella Chow from JP Morgan Asset Management notes that rice significantly influences Japan's core inflation, and government measures to reduce rice prices could stimulate household spending.

Despite some high-attendance games, many matches have drawn fewer than 5,300 spectators, prompting FIFA to slash ticket prices.

          <p>As the 50th anniversary of "Jaws" is celebrated, reports of shark encounters are grabbing headlines, though experts say this doesn't necessarily indicate a rise in shark populations. Activist Julie Andersen explains that increased sightings are due to more people in the water, better technology, and shifting ocean conditions. She also noted that places like California and Cape Cod are seeing rebounding white shark populations, indicating healthier oceans. Andersen provides tips for staying safe during a shark encounter, such as staying calm, making eye contact, and avoiding erratic movements. </p>

Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade and suspending prohibitive tariffs.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden criticized "ongoing efforts to erase history" during a Juneteenth Celebration Service at a historic African Methodist Episcopal Church in Galveston, Texas, appearing to reference President Trump. Biden highlighted his role in making Juneteenth a federal holiday and chided attempts to erase history from textbooks and classrooms. He also pointed to his administration's efforts to rename military bases named after Confederate military officers, contrasting it with the Trump administration's push to restore the bases' old names. Several speakers recognized Biden's role in making Juneteenth a national holiday. </p>

          <p>Border Patrol agents discovered an uncompleted narcotics smuggling tunnel connecting a residence in Tijuana to a warehouse in Otay Mesa, San Diego County. The half-mile-long tunnel was equipped with electrical wiring, lighting, ventilation systems, and a track system. U.S. and Mexican authorities believe the passage was intended for large-scale contraband transportation. The tunnel's entrance was hidden under recently placed tile in Nueva Tijuana. </p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, citing the potential for "large-scale irreparable harm." The ruling challenges the Department of Transportation's imposition of immigration enforcement conditions on grant applications. Judge McConnell found no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the congressionally approved purposes of the Department of Transportation. </p>

          <p>At a high-level summit, China and its Central Asian partners voiced shared security concerns, presenting a united front amid global turbulence. The close ties between Beijing and the five Central Asian countries have raised questions about Russia's regional dominance, given its preoccupation with the Ukraine war. While the Kremlin dismisses these concerns, diplomatic observers note Moscow's limited capacity to counterbalance China's growing influence. Beijing is avoiding directly challenging Russia's role as Central Asia's key security guarantor. </p>
