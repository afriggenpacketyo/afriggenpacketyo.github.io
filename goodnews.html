          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged over 16% after the U.S. and South Korea finalized a trade deal setting a 15% tariff on exports. The company, which acquired Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, is expected to play a key role in revitalizing American shipbuilding efforts. The stock rally also follows a strong second-quarter performance, where operating profits reversed previous losses, and the announcement of new orders and global expansion initiatives. The deal is seen as a major boost for the company's entry into the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. imposing 25% duties, India has not rushed to secure a trade deal, prioritizing the protection of its domestic sectors. Indian officials have been firm in resisting U.S. demands for greater market access, particularly for agricultural products, to safeguard the interests of local farmers. Analysts suggest India can afford this stance because its exports to the U.S. are a small part of its economy and it is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy by negotiating deals with other partners like the U.K. and the EU. This diversification provides India with leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Filipina-Australian artist Loribelle Spirovski has won the People's Choice Award at the Archibald Prize, Australia's most notable portrait competition. Her winning piece is a portrait of musician William Barton, which she painted with her fingers because a nerve injury made it painful to hold a brush. Spirovski said the experience was a beautiful reprieve after a difficult few years and expressed gratitude for the public's response to her work. Born in the Philippines, her art is influenced by the contrasting cultures of her heritage and her adopted home of Australia.</p>

          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field in California's Fresno County, but the pilot was able to eject safely before impact. The incident occurred near Naval Air Station Lemoore, which confirmed the aircraft was attached to its VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" training squadron. No other personnel were injured in the crash, though the event did spark a small grass fire that was contained by firefighters. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation by naval authorities. The successful ejection of the pilot prevented a more tragic outcome.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened its first permanent office in Wellington, New Zealand, in a move described as an "historic moment" by FBI Director Kash Patel. The new post aims to strengthen intelligence and law enforcement cooperation among the Five Eyes nations. Key priorities for the office include countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific, combating cybercrime and ransomware operations, and disrupting international narcotics trafficking. New Zealand officials welcomed the enhanced partnership, stating it sends a clear message that criminals cannot hide behind international borders.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and South Korea have reached a trade agreement that sets a blanket tariff of 15% on South Korean exports, a reduction from the 25% rate previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the deal, Seoul has committed to a $350 billion investment fund for key U.S. industries and will purchase $100 billion in American energy products. However, the two nations appear to interpret the terms of the investment differently, particularly regarding profit distribution. The deal successfully protected South Korea's sensitive agricultural sectors but maintains 50% tariffs on its steel and aluminum exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a controversial bill into law that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The new law, AB 379, allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. The bill faced initial opposition from some Democrats over concerns about its potential impact on victims and a provision criminalizing loitering. A compromise was reached to target older offenders, and the final law also establishes a support fund for survivors.</p>

In a public statement, the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now. A source close to Harris indicated that while she seriously considered the run, her heart wasn't in it, and she believes she can have a greater national impact. This decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific, prompting warnings and advisories for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and several countries in Asia and South America. While the most severe warnings were later downgraded, coastal areas experienced small to moderate waves, minor flooding, and strong currents, leading to evacuations and beach closures. The event, one of the strongest quakes ever recorded, caused some flooding in Russia but no major damage or grave injuries were reported initially. The risk of aftershocks remains a concern.</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against prosecutors and investigators involved in the fatal "Rust" movie set shooting case. Baldwin had sued for malicious prosecution and civil rights violations, alleging he was targeted for political gain after the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The judge dismissed the case without prejudice due to a lack of significant action, giving Baldwin's legal team 30 days to refile. Baldwin's attorney stated they have been in good-faith settlement discussions and will refile if those talks fail.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to the UK government for the expansion of Heathrow Airport. The Arora Group's plan rivals the one from the airport's current owners and features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and disruptive need to divert the M25 motorway. The company claims its "Heathrow West" plan would reduce risk and spiraling costs, estimating the project at under £25 billion. This marks the first time competing bids have been invited for the airport's expansion, introducing a new dynamic to the long-debated infrastructure project.</p>

Ohtani looked uncomfortable on the mound during a hot and humid night, prompting a visit from the manager and trainer before his exit. Manager Dave Roberts expressed relief that the issue was not a more serious injury and expects Ohtani to make his next scheduled start.</p>
