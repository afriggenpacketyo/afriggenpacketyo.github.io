          <p>A grassroots football league in Jiangsu province, China, known as the Su Super League, has gained immense popularity, attracting millions of online viewers and thousands of fans to stadiums. The league features 13 city-based teams with players from diverse backgrounds and has become a commercial success, stimulating consumption in various sectors, including match tickets and local products. This enthusiasm contrasts with the disappointment often felt by Chinese soccer fans towards the national team. The league's unexpected and sustained impact has significantly boosted the local economy, demonstrating the potential of grassroots sports to drive commercial activity. The league's success is a welcome development for the region, providing a source of pride and economic stimulus.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard to resolve the conflict. The Department of Homeland Security had previously threatened to revoke Harvard's student visa system certification, citing concerns about campus antisemitism, but the judge sided with Harvard, arguing that the school was being politically targeted. This legal battle has significant implications for Harvard, where a substantial portion of the student body comes from outside the United States, and other universities have faced similar pressure regarding their handling of pro-Palestinian protests.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that visits by foreign tourists to locations related to manga and anime in Japan have significantly boosted local economies. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists, representing 8.1% of all inbound visitors, visited these sites, a substantial increase from 2016. Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, marking a 53% increase from 2016. This trend, known as "seichi junrei" or "holy pilgrimage," has become a popular activity for fans, who visit places that inspired or were the real-life settings for popular works, and local governments need to address overtourism issues affecting the lives of those who live near the popular locations.</p>

          <p>Faced with soaring rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., which operates pork rice bowl eateries, recently opened its first ramen noodle restaurant in Tokyo and plans to expand with three more locations. Yoshinoya Holdings Co., parent company of a major beef bowl restaurant chain, is also strengthening its ramen noodle business, citing ingredient cost balance and market saturation for beef bowls. As consumers seek alternatives to rice, sales of frozen udon noodles and packaged udon noodle soup have grown, while western-style breakfast foods like bread and cereal have also gained popularity.</p>

          <p>A mysterious human skull, discovered in the 1930s and known as "dragon man," has been identified as a Denisovan after years of failed attempts to extract DNA. Researchers successfully extracted DNA from dental calculus, which protected the genetic material from degradation. Comparisons revealed that the skull belonged to a Denisovan, an ancient human group that coexisted with modern humans and Neanderthals. The discovery of the "dragon man" skull provides an intact specimen of this group.</p>

The team plans to collaborate with organizations such as the California Community Foundation and the L.A. County Federation of Labor to provide further support.

While some companies have relaxed dress codes, allowing for more casual attire, stylists suggest that shorts are still considered a "grey area," particularly in client-facing roles. The type of shorts also matters, with tailored, formal shorts being more acceptable than beach, sports, or denim shorts, and people may perceive shorts differently on men and women.</p>
