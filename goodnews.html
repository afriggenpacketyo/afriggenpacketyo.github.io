          <p>NFL quarterback Lamar Jackson, also owner of the Maryland Colts horse racing franchise in the National Thoroughbred League, aims to achieve championship success in both football and horse racing. Jackson purchased the Maryland Colts in 2024, locating the team in Baltimore, mirroring the city's Super Bowl-winning NFL team's moniker. He emphasizes meaningful investments with long-term goals, focusing on creating opportunities for Baltimore's youth beyond sports. Jackson's move is part of a trend among NFL quarterbacks seeking equity in sports teams, but he currently has no plans to expand beyond the Colts, instead focusing on creating a positive impact on the city of Baltimore.</p>

The trip was marked by opulent receptions and announcements of business deals for U.S. companies, with the White House claiming deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Key developments included a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing longstanding U.S. policies, and suggestions of progress in nuclear talks with Iran.

They argue that Duke Kunshan University (DKU) creates a direct pathway between U.S. innovation and China's military-industrial complex. DKU, founded in 2013, offers students dual degrees from both Duke and Wuhan University, with opportunities to study at Duke's campus in North Carolina. The lawmakers worry that exchange programs provide Chinese students access to federally funded U.S. research, which could be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

          <p>The UK political landscape is experiencing significant shifts, with the Reform party gaining traction and challenging the dominance of Labour and Conservative parties. Recent polls indicate a decline in Labour's support, with Reform leading in the Midlands and the South outside of London. The dividing lines of age are also blurring, with Reform's support growing across all demographic groups, particularly among the young. Prime Minister Starmer's approval ratings have declined, and pollsters are employing MRP techniques to predict constituency-level race outcomes, reflecting the increasing complexity of the UK political environment.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a new temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as part of their tax bill. This "bonus" is aimed at helping retirees retain more of their income and is presented as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. The proposal would provide an additional $4,000 deduction for individuals aged 65 and over, applicable to tax years 2025 through 2028, with a phase-out for higher-income earners. While it would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, it is less generous than a tax credit, which reduces tax liability dollar for dollar.</p>

Despite overall growth, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region.

          <p>President Trump's denunciation of "activist judges" echoes a historical trend of U.S. presidents criticizing the judiciary when disagreeing with their decisions. The term "judicial activism," coined in 1947, describes judges who base rulings on policy views rather than legal interpretation. Presidents from both Democratic and Republican parties have accused courts of exceeding their constitutional role. While the Constitution enshrines an independent judiciary, presidents have often voiced frustration when court rulings obstruct their agendas.</p>

Clinical psychologist Elsa Lau emphasizes that being in a space where people cheer for you because they see a part of themselves in you can make those feelings more real. Queer organizers recommend narrowing down what you're looking for, whether it's shared hobbies, racial identity, or values. It's also beneficial to trust the process and create your own space if existing options don't feel right, remembering that community can take many forms, both online and offline.</p>

This shift was driven by concerns over the U.S. economy and asset performance due to tariff shocks.
