          <p>As global temperatures rise and heat waves intensify, cities are appointing "heat officers" to build resilience through urban greening and cool zones. Cities like Athens, Dhaka, Freetown, and Santiago are implementing strategies to protect residents from extreme heat. Chief heat officers analyze local conditions, create plans, and implement measures like heat-repellent sidewalks and reforestation. These efforts aim to proactively address the growing threat of extreme heat and its impact on public health and urban environments.</p>
