          <p>Wednesday's papers cover a range of topics, including a surge in small boat crossings attributed to good weather, as reported by the Daily Express, which also features the search for Madeleine McCann. The Daily Mail highlights evidence suggesting the Rwanda plan deterred crossings, while warning against potential tax increases from Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The Financial Times reports on Thames Water's potential renationalization and the race among accounting firms to audit AI products. The i Paper details the UK's plans to stockpile medical supplies for nuclear attacks, and The Sun reports on a Love Island contestant's removal due to a past arrest.

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has entered a fuel-efficient Earth-moon orbit, but claims of being the first spacecraft to achieve this feat are disputed by US and Canadian experts. The 3:1 resonant orbit is seen as a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure, including a BeiDou-like guidance system. The Deep Space Exploration Laboratory asserts that Tiandu-1 is the first spacecraft to enter a round-trip 3:1 Earth-moon resonant trajectory. However, experts point to NASA‚Äôs Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011. </p>

Despite the efforts to remain detached, staff members still form bonds with the animals.
