          <h2>Japanese Private Lunar Lander Crashes During Landing Attempt</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ispace, a Tokyo-based company, declared its private lunar lander mission a failure after losing communication with the spacecraft during its attempted touchdown on the moon. The lander, named Resilience, was carrying a rover designed to gather lunar dirt and deploy a small Swedish-style house on the moon. A preliminary analysis suggests that the lander's laser altitude measurement system malfunctioned, causing it to descend too rapidly and likely resulting in a hard landing. Despite the setback, Ispace plans to continue with future lunar missions, viewing this attempt as a stepping stone towards larger, NASA-involved projects. The company aims to learn from this second failed landing to improve its technology and mission success rate. The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft due to threats from President Trump to cancel government contracts. However, hours later, Musk reversed his decision after receiving advice on X to "cool off." The initial tweet followed an escalating dispute with Trump over a major tax bill. Dragon is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station. Musk's about-face raises questions about the future of SpaceX's relationship with the government and the fate of the Dragon spacecraft. The optimism score is 65.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More retailers and food brands are offering items with fewer ingredients, driven by growing concerns about ultra-processed foods. This trend aims to simplify ingredient lists and cater to consumers seeking less processed options. However, some nutritionists caution against prioritizing fewer ingredients over nutritional value, highlighting the importance of fortified nutrients. Processed foods remain essential for feeding a growing population, ensuring food safety and extending shelf life. Novel processing technologies can help create products with higher nutritional retention using fewer ingredients. The optimism score is 60.</p>
