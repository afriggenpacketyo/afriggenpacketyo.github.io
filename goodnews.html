          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Angela Rayner had proposed tax increases to Rachel Reeves, the UK's shadow chancellor, to raise ¬£3-4 billion annually, prior to the formulation of departmental spending plans. These proposals, which included increasing corporation tax on banks and extending the freeze on the threshold for the 45% tax rate, were ultimately not implemented by Reeves, who instead pursued welfare cuts. Conservative Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride criticized the memo, suggesting it reflected the Labour Party's inclination towards raising taxes, while a government spokesperson declined to comment on the leak. The memo highlights internal debates within the Labour party regarding fiscal policy. (not investment advice)</p>

His unique case has drawn the attention of researchers aiming to develop a universal antivenom. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions annually, causing tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Current antivenoms are specific to certain venoms and derived from animals, but scientists hope Friede's antibodies can be synthesized into a treatment effective against various snake venoms, improving global access to life-saving medicine.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that its online services will face disruptions until July due to a cyber-attack that occurred over the Easter weekend.

CEO Stuart Machin stated that the company is managing a sophisticated and targeted cyber-attack, which initially affected click-and-collect and contactless payments.

          <p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will waive basic water utility charges for households over four months this summer to encourage residents to use air conditioning without concern for costs amid increasingly extreme heat. The supplementary budget bill, totaling 36.8 billion yen, aims to protect residents' lives and daily living as real wages decline due to surging prices. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit, saving around 5,000 yen on their water bills, though metered water usage will still be charged. This initiative responds to the rising number of heatstroke cases in Tokyo due to climate change.</p>

While many surveys show a gender gap in support of far-right parties, it is young women who stand out as the more politically interesting demographic, as they are turning in ever greater numbers towards the left. Mudde suggests that center-left parties should focus on the priorities and values of female voters rather than chasing an outdated interpretation of the working-class voter.</p>
