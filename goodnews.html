          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released on bail and returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE for six weeks. Ozturk thanked her community and supporters, expressing faith in the American justice system. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated due to an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Supporters, including Sen. Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, celebrated her release, denouncing the Trump administration's actions as an attempt to silence dissent.</p>

          <p>Amidst escalating conflict between India and Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration grew concerned about a potential nuclear escalation. Vice President JD Vance initially downplayed U.S. involvement, but the administration quickly intervened after reports of intense dogfights and explosions near Pakistan's nuclear arsenal headquarters. Vance contacted Prime Minister Modi, while Marco Rubio spoke with General Munir, emphasizing the urgency of de-escalation. President Trump announced a ceasefire between the two countries, though India did not acknowledge any U.S. involvement in the resolution.</p>
