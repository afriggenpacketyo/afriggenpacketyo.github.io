          <p>European stock markets saw gains on Wednesday, led by a more than 6% surge in shares of Inditex, the owner of Zara, after the company reported a significant acceleration in its new collections' sales. This positive corporate news helped buoy investor sentiment, alongside a strong performance from pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. Markets are also closely monitoring upcoming U.S. inflation data, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates, and reports of President Trump's call for new tariffs on China and India.

The positive sentiment persisted despite mixed economic data from China, where consumer prices fell more than expected, indicating ongoing deflationary pressures that investors are weighing against potential government stimulus measures.

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural and social legacy of the 'Plattenbau,' the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of East German urban architecture. The exhibition, titled 'Wohnkomplex,' examines these buildings not just as architectural heritage but as symbols of socialist utopias that later became stages for painful societal transformation after German reunification. Through various artworks, the show delves into collective memories of life in these complexes, addressing themes of community, belonging, and the rise of extremism in the 1990s.</p>

          <h2>Universities of Kent and Greenwich Announce Merger to Form Regional 'Super-University'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge by 2026, creating what is being described as the UK's first 'super-university,' which will operate under the name London and South East University Group. The move is intended to create a more resilient and financially viable institution capable of weathering the economic challenges facing the higher education sector. While the universities will retain their individual identities and campuses, they will be governed by a single vice-chancellor, a model that regulators and the government have welcomed as an innovative approach to ensuring stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has faced scrutiny in the U.S. over his multi-hyphenated identity, in his birthplace of Kampala, Uganda, his African heritage is considered straightforward. The article explores how Ugandans of Indian descent, like Mamdani's family, are an integral part of the nation's fabric, with their culture deeply woven into society despite a history of strife. In Uganda, 'African' is seen as a continental, not racial, identity, making the controversy surrounding Mamdani's university application seem foreign and reminiscent of 'birther' conspiracy theories against Barack Obama.</p>

          <p>The upcoming fight between Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Terence Crawford is being hailed as a once-in-a-generation super-fight with significant legacy implications for both boxers. The article breaks down the matchup, noting that while Alvarez is the bigger name and more experienced at the 168lb weight class, Crawford's undefeated record and technical skill make him a formidable opponent. A key factor will be how Crawford handles moving up two weight divisions, a challenging feat that adds to the intrigue of a contest where a loss could tarnish either fighter's career.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced it will invest US$1.1 billion to build a fleet of domestically developed 'Ghost Shark' autonomous underwater attack drones, with the first batch set for delivery next year. Defense Minister Richard Marles described the technology as the most advanced of its kind in the world, providing Australia with a leading edge in autonomous underwater military capabilities. The long-range, stealthy drones are intended to complement Australia's future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines and bolster its naval capacity amid China's growing military presence in the Pacific.</p>

          <p>Despite a poor run of results with only two Premier League wins since April, underlying statistics suggest Manchester United's performances under manager Ruben Amorim have been better than their point tally indicates. The team ranks highest in shots taken and among the best for fewest shots conceded in their last 10 games, excluding penalties. However, the analysis points to significant underperformance by players in both finishing chances and preventing goals, suggesting that player inefficiency, rather than tactical failure, is the primary cause of their struggles.</p>

The offense was powered by four home runs, including two from Teoscar Hernández, as the team continues to build momentum with only 17 games remaining in the regular season.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has granted a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, ruling that the move likely violates the Federal Reserve Act. The judge stated that the 'for cause' provision for removing a governor does not typically apply to conduct that occurred before they took office, referencing the mortgage fraud allegations cited by the administration. This decision represents a significant legal setback for the White House and is seen as a defense of the central bank's independence from political interference.</p>
