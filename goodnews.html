        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has characterized the ongoing transfer situation with striker Alexander Isak as a "lose-lose situation," stating he hasn't spoken to the player in a week. Isak desires to join Liverpool, but Newcastle rejected a £110m bid and denied the player's claim of broken promises regarding his departure. The 25-year-old Swedish international is now training separately from the first team and will miss upcoming matches. Howe remains uncertain about the forward's future before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>Washington state's first In-N-Out Burger opened in Ridgefield, drawing hundreds of customers who lined up overnight, some waiting hours for the popular fast-food. The opening fulfilled a long-held wish for many California natives living in Washington, with the company even opening two hours early due to demand. In-N-Out's CEO, Lynsi Snyder, attended the ribbon-cutting, having recently made headlines for her comments about leaving California, which sparked debate about the state's business environment. The company, founded in 1948, continues to expand its presence across the Western US.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare case of the plague in South Lake Tahoe has raised questions about the ancient disease, which is rarely contracted today. Experts explain that while the plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, still exists primarily in wild rodent populations, medical advancements have made it treatable with antibiotics. Most human cases occur in rural areas from infected flea bites or contact with rodents. Public health officials emphasize that with timely treatment, there is little to fear, and the disease is not a top priority for eradication efforts due to its controlled status.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes California Governor Gavin Newsom's use of viral, Trump-esque memes as a plausible political strategy against President Trump. The author suggests these memes, while unseemly, effectively target the subconscious and offer plausible deniability as parody. Newsom is seen as borrowing from Trump's playbook of braggadocio and online combat, which resonated with voters in the past. While acknowledging Newsom's potential drawbacks as a candidate, the article posits that his willingness to "fight" could appeal to Democratic voters.</p>

          <p>This article reviews R.F. Kuang's new dark academia thriller, "Katabasis," which transports readers to hell. Despite initial skepticism about the well-trodden trope of journeys to the underworld, the review praises Kuang's intelligent and textured approach, drawing on her deep knowledge of chthonic myths. The protagonist, Alice Law, embarks on a flawed and greedy quest to retrieve her mentor's soul, leading to an intriguing evolution of her character. The novel is described as more mature and subtly humorous than Kuang's previous works, offering a scholar's unique perspective on hell.</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Shucked," a hilarious country-themed musical now on tour at the Hollywood Pantages, praising its ability to deliver widespread delight. The production, with a book by Robert Horn, uses two narrators to tell a "farm to fable" story about Cob County, whose livelihood depends on corn. The review highlights Jack O'Brien's invigorating direction, Scott Pask's bucolic set, and the sunshiny score by Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally.

          <p>This article reviews David Baron's book, "The Martians," which delves into the early 20th-century fascination with intelligent life on Mars. The book explores how respected scientists and media, alongside fringe theorists, projected human fantasies onto the red planet, fueled by figures like Percival Lowell and Nikola Tesla. Baron's work, praised for its clarity and narrative drive, examines the social currents that led to "Mars fever," including the theory of evolution and the rise of tabloid journalism. The review concludes that while the "canals" were ultimately disproven, this era of imagination inspired generations toward space exploration.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Los Angeles labor groups are pushing for a "New Deal" to secure commitments for working people. They demand multi-billion dollar investments in 50,000 housing units, a ban on short-term rentals like Airbnb, greater transparency in venue agreements, and protections for immigrant workers. Unions argue that past mega-events have often displaced low-income residents and left host cities indebted. Olympic organizers, however, contend the Games will bring positive economic impact and job opportunities to the region.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to roll back government incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) and his public disdain for them, the US EV market continues to evolve. This article highlights Ford's significant $5 billion investment in a new EV platform aimed at producing a $30,000 electric pickup truck by 2027. While US EV sales have slowed and face challenges like charging infrastructure and cost, global markets are rapidly shifting towards electric. Ford's move signals a strategic bet on the long-term viability and affordability of EVs, driven by global demand and cost-effectiveness.</p>

          <p>China's electricity consumption in July surpassed 1 trillion kilowatt-hours, setting a new record equivalent to the annual usage of all ASEAN nations combined. This surge was primarily driven by scorching heatwaves and a 20.2% year-on-year growth in electricity use within the primary industry, including agriculture and fisheries. The data, released by China’s National Energy Administration, reflects the country's immense energy demands and the impact of environmental factors on consumption patterns, even as industrial output growth slowed slightly.</p>

          <p>The US real estate market is showing slight improvement, with existing home sales rising 2% in July, though still below pre-pandemic levels. A significant bright spot is the increase in homes for sale, reaching the highest inventory in five years, offering buyers more options. While nationwide prices are minimally up, many large metro areas are experiencing softening prices, and mortgage rates have inched down. Experts predict rates will remain near current levels through the year, with potential for further slight drops in 2026, easing the "lock-in effect" for some homeowners.</p>
