          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball, passed away at 89 due to pneumonia; he was known for his charismatic presence and pivotal role with the Yomiuri Giants during Japan's economic boom in the 1960s and 70s. Nagashima, nicknamed "Mr. Giants," captivated fans with his exceptional fielding and game-changing batting, and he was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988. Beyond his playing career, he managed the Giants and was set to manage Japan's Olympic team in 2004 before a stroke sidelined him. His legacy extends beyond sports, as his phrases became part of Japan's cultural lexicon, and he received the People's Honor Award in 2013. The impact of his baseball career is reflected in his numerous awards and accolades. </p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election following the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol, who faced rebellion charges for imposing martial law. Pre-election polls suggest Lee Jae-myung, a liberal candidate, is likely to win due to public dissatisfaction with conservatives; Kim Moon-soo, the main conservative candidate, has struggled to gain traction with moderate voters. The new president will immediately assume office for a five-year term, facing challenges such as a slowing economy and strained relations with North Korea. Lee advocates for patience with Trump's tariff policy, while Kim seeks a quick meeting with the U.S. president. </p>

          <p>One of Big Bear's famed bald eagle eaglets, Sunny, has successfully taken its first flight from the nest, marking a significant milestone for Jackie and Shadow's offspring. The eaglet's flight occurred after days of practicing and flapping its wings, with viewers of the Big Bear Eagle Nest Cam eagerly anticipating the event. While Sunny has left the nest, her sister Gizmo remains, and it is expected that Sunny will return to the habitat for one to three months. The eaglets, both determined to be female, will eventually venture out on their own by fall, reaching maturity around 5 years old. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision marks a policy shift, as the administration had previously announced it would resume collection activity on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. The government has the authority to seize borrowers' tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits, potentially reducing checks by up to 15%. The pause provides older borrowers with defaulted student loans more time to become current and avoid benefit reductions. </p>

The men were convicted in 2022 for theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction after they released 19 sharks and a giant grouper, believing it was an illegal fishing line. Despite avoiding prison time, the felony convictions restricted their voting rights, firearm ownership, and international travel.
