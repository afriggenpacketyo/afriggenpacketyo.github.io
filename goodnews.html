          <p>China Eastern Airlines is set to begin a new 25-hour flight route connecting Shanghai, China, with Buenos Aires, Argentina, marking a significant expansion of air travel between Asia and South America. The route, which includes a single transit stop in Auckland, New Zealand, will be the most direct connection and is expected to cut travel time by up to five hours. This new service is designed to bypass traditional layovers in the congested hubs of the United States or Europe. The move reflects strengthening trade and political ties between China and Latin American nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, pushing it to December 16, as a framework deal nears completion. The agreement would see an investor consortium, including Oracle and Silver Lake, acquire approximately 80% of the new U.S.-based entity. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the framework, stating that commercial terms have been largely settled for months but were delayed by trade tensions. The deal aims to resolve national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data through the popular app.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates that California's summer wave of COVID-19 infections may be leveling off, offering some cautious optimism for public health officials. While coronavirus levels in wastewater remain high, key indicators like the hospitalization rate have shown a slight decline statewide. In major areas like Los Angeles County, the test positivity rate is also decreasing, suggesting a slowdown in community transmission. However, officials note it is still too early to definitively declare that the seasonal peak has passed, as some metrics continue to fluctuate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-point interest rate cut this week as it balances a softening labor market against inflation concerns. The decision comes amid significant political pressure from the White House, with President Trump's new appointee, Stephen Miran, likely to dissent in favor of a larger cut. While the initial rate reduction is anticipated by markets, the Fed's forecast for the remainder of the year, detailed in its "dot plot," will be closely watched for signals of future policy. The meeting highlights growing divisions within the committee and the increasing politicization of the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle company, Waymo, has secured a permit to test its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The rollout will occur in phases, starting with employee testing with human safety drivers on board before transitioning to a fully driverless commercial service for the public. This expansion marks a significant step for Waymo, which already operates in surrounding areas but did not have clearance for airport pickups and drop-offs. The move positions Waymo to compete with other services and advances the integration of autonomous vehicles into major transportation hubs.</p>

          <p>Arsenal secured a 2-0 victory against Athletic Club in their Champions League opener, thanks to crucial second-half contributions from substitutes Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard. Both players scored and provided an assist for each other after coming off the bench, validating manager Mikel Arteta's strategy. Arteta praised the impact of his "finishers," a term he borrowed from rugby, emphasizing that players not in the starting lineup will be vital to the team's success this season. The win provides a strong start for the Gunners in the prestigious European competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In anticipation of an expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to its lowest point since late 2022. The rate fell to 6.13%, a significant single-day decrease, as investors in mortgage-backed bonds appeared to position themselves for the Fed's announcement. However, some financial experts caution that this trend may reverse after the central bank's decision, a pattern observed in previous rate-cut cycles. The market's reaction will depend heavily on the Fed's forward-looking statements about the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a prolonged period of decreasing activity, the sun is "slowly waking up," according to a new NASA study that has surprised scientists. Research indicates a reversal of a decades-long decline, with solar activity ramping up since 2008, contrary to predictions of a continued quiet phase. This uptick could lead to more significant space weather events like solar flares and storms, which have the potential to impact technology on Earth, including power grids and GPS systems. NASA is launching new missions to better track and predict these space weather patterns.</p>

Washington has expressed worries that the company acts as a proxy for Beijing's strategic interests.

          <p>A controversial legislative provision that would have given the Secretary of State broad authority to revoke the passports of U.S. citizens has been withdrawn by its sponsor, Representative Brian Mast. The measure, part of a larger State Department reform bill, would have allowed passport revocation for individuals determined to have provided "material support" to terrorist organizations. Civil liberties advocates heavily criticized the proposal, fearing it would be used to target pro-Palestinian activists and suppress free speech. The provision was removed to prevent it from overshadowing the rest of the bill's intended reforms.</p>
