        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a royal expert, Kate Middleton has achieved royal success by adhering to royal rules and avoiding the rebellious path of Princess Diana. Unlike Diana, who entered the royal family at a young age, Kate was more mature when she married Prince William, which allowed her to better navigate the scrutiny and expectations of royal life. Kate's composed and dutiful approach, supported by a strong family and Prince William, contrasts with Diana's struggles with press intrusion and lack of palace support. The article emphasizes that the monarchy's future looks promising, partly due to Kate's ability to balance public duty with personal life, in a way that Diana struggled to do.</p>
