The band delivered a dazzling and immersive spectacle, featuring their greatest hits and an unexpected Whitney Houston cover, captivating the audience with vibrant stagecraft. Frontman Chris Martin fostered an incredible sense of unity, making the crowd an integral part of the performance through LED wristbands and playful banter. This successful, albeit bittersweet, final London date precedes a planned hiatus and Martin's announcement that their next album will be their last, after which they intend to focus solely on touring.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 20:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health study found that women who experienced stalking or obtained restraining orders face a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Analyzing 20 years of data from over 66,000 nurses, researchers observed a 41% increased risk for those stalked and a 70% increased risk for those with restraining orders. The study, published in Circulation, highlights that these experiences of violence are independent risk factors, even after accounting for diet and exercise. This research suggests that medical screenings for heart health should consider incorporating questions about stalking and protective orders to improve women's health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Autumn promises a series of captivating celestial events for stargazers, beginning with Saturn reaching its closest and brightest point to Earth on September 21st, making its iconic rings visible with a telescope. Following this, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will offer prime viewing conditions around October 22nd, coinciding with the new moon for minimal light pollution. As astronomical autumn officially commences on September 22nd, the progressively longer nights will provide ample opportunities to observe these natural wonders. Enthusiasts are encouraged to seek out dark skies away from urban illumination to fully appreciate these upcoming astronomical spectacles.</p>

          <p>Three Austrian nuns in their 80s, Sister Bernadette (88), Sister Regina (86), and Sister Rita (82), have controversially returned to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent after being moved to a care home against their will. With the help of former students and a locksmith, they regained access to the building, which church authorities deem unsuitable for their care. The nuns, who spent decades teaching at the convent's school, express profound happiness to be back, despite initial lack of electricity and water. This act of defiance underscores their deep connection to their home and community, with supporters rallying to provide aid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" suggests the sequel struggles to recapture the satirical brilliance of its 1984 predecessor, "This Is Spinal Tap." While seeing Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls reunite offers low-wattage smiles, the inclusion of power cameos like Paul McCartney and Elton John diminishes the original's outsider comedy. The film is criticized for coasting on nostalgia and rehashing old gags, such as the drummer mortality problem, without fresh comedic insight. Despite agreeable silliness in early scenes depicting their solo lives, the overall consensus is that some classics are better left untouched, as the sequel fails to hit "11."</p>

Cook emphasized that domestic manufacturing creates economic hubs and bolsters local businesses, citing Corning's long-standing relationship with Apple since the first iPhone in 2007. Corning CEO Wendell Weeks noted the plant's evolution since 1952, underscoring its role as a world-leading site for specialized glass production. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and significantly increase high-density housing near transit hubs. The bill, now headed to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk, allows for buildings up to nine stories adjacent to certain transit stops and six to seven stories within a half-mile radius, including single-family neighborhoods. Proponents argue these drastic measures are essential to address the state's affordability crisis, while critics claim it's an overreach that strips local authorities of control. The bill's passage was bolstered by a deal with a powerful labor group, adding union hiring to certain projects.</p>
