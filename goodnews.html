          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings in Minnesota saw the failure of a proposal to ban the "tush push," a play popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Green Bay Packers' proposal fell short of the required 75% majority, with the Eagles and several other teams voting against the ban. The Eagles celebrated the decision, posting "push on" graphics and highlights of the play on social media. The Packers had argued that the play was unsafe and lacked skill, but the NFL had previously stated that no injuries had been reported from its use.</p>

The policy is a safety measure to allow crew members to respond quickly to potential fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. Passengers will not be allowed to use portable charging devices while they are stored in a bag or overhead bin. The FAA prohibits spare lithium-ion batteries in checked bags, but Southwest's policy further restricts their use during flight.</p>

          <p>Freedom Debt Relief offers debt settlement services, negotiating with creditors to reduce debt in exchange for lump-sum payments. The process involves a free evaluation, dedicated account setup, negotiation, and approval/payment. Eligibility requires at least $7,500 in unsecured debt and demonstrable financial hardship. Fees range from 15% to 25% of the total debt enrolled, with a program timeline of 24 to 48 months. While it can reduce debt and offer an alternative to bankruptcy, it can also damage credit scores and involve considerable costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has successfully cleaned up its streams by implementing a simple solution: providing clean drinking water for cows and keeping them out of the streams. Farmer Grant Victor fenced off his cattle from Horse Creek, creating a protective riparian buffer. This resulted in the creek no longer being on the state's list of most contaminated waterways. Practices like these have helped restore about 100 Oklahoman streams once polluted by runoff from farmland, more than any other state, according to the EPA.</p>
