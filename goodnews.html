          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 06:01:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has issued a stark warning to parents about the critical importance of school attendance at the start of the new term. Citing BBC analysis, she highlighted that students missing school in the first week are significantly more likely to become persistently absent, which negatively impacts their long-term life prospects. This call to action comes as attendance rates, while improving, have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, prompting the government to implement support hubs and maintain fines as a deterrent for unauthorized absences. The government is urging a collaborative effort between schools and parents to ensure children get a strong start to the academic year.</p>

          <p>In a significant development for China's commercial space sector, Beijing-based CAS Space has launched two tiny satellites for ThumbSat, a Mexican startup. This mission marks Mexico's first commercial venture into low Earth orbit and represents a rare entry for China into the North American commercial launch market. The two femtosatellites, each weighing under 100 grams, aim to demonstrate that small satellites can be meaningful and will engage students through low-cost receiving stations. The launch is being hailed by CAS Space as a milestone that showcases its cost-effective and reliable rocket technology to a global audience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Britain experiences hotter summers, the demand for home air conditioning is increasing, sparking a debate about its environmental, financial, and health impacts. While providing comfort and improving productivity, air conditioning units consume significant electricity and often use hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are potent greenhouse gases. Experts advise purchasing energy-efficient models and ensuring proper disposal to mitigate environmental harm. While concerns about air conditioning spreading illness exist, they are minimal if units are well-maintained, shifting the focus to balancing immediate comfort with long-term sustainability.</p>

          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China's President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have signaled a significant move toward de-escalating tensions. During their first meeting in seven years, both leaders emphasized partnership over rivalry and a commitment to maintaining peace and stability. Modi announced the resumption of direct flights, which were suspended after deadly border clashes in 2020. The meeting, which also includes Russian President Vladimir Putin, is seen as an effort by the nations to find common ground amid ongoing trade disputes with the United States.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is highlighted as a company with significant growth potential, potentially becoming the next $2 trillion giant. The article argues that its central role in producing cutting-edge chips for AI and other technology sectors gives it a durable market position. Despite a 44% revenue growth rate, its stock trades at a valuation comparable to the broader S&P 500, suggesting it may be undervalued. Management projects a 45% compound annual growth rate for its AI-related revenue over the next five years, fueled by ongoing data center buildouts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha has turned the green tea powder into a prized commodity, leading to significant shortages and price hikes, even in its native Japan. Fueled by its reputation as a superfood on social media and a post-pandemic tourism boom, exports have quadrupled in a decade. This has strained Japan's aging farming communities, which struggle to produce the labor-intensive tencha leaves used for high-quality matcha. Retailers are now rationing supplies and facing record-high auction prices, while major distributors like Ito En are creating new divisions just to manage the intense competition for sourcing the powder.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made female billionaire, attributes her entrepreneurial drive to a frugal upbringing that motivated her to find ways to make money from a young age. Her early ventures included trading and selling Pokémon cards on the playground before progressing to selling virtual items for online games and developing bots. This passion for computers, fueled by video games, led her to drop out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship. Guo's journey culminated in the multi-billion dollar acquisition of her AI company, Scale AI, by Meta.</p>

          <p>In an innovative approach to wildlife management, biologists are using drones to haze gray wolves and prevent livestock attacks in Northern California. The drones are equipped with speakers that blast a variety of sounds, including AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," gunshots, and dialogue from actors like Scarlett Johansson, to scare the predators away from cattle. This nonlethal method, developed by the USDA, has shown initial success in interrupting wolf hunts at night. While the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, it represents a creative technological solution to the growing conflict between ranchers and recovering wolf populations.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. tariffs imposed on Indian goods are providing a new impetus for India and China to repair their strained economic and political relationship. With both nations facing economic pressure from Washington, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit is seen as a potential turning point. Despite deep-seated mistrust and unresolved border disputes, the shared challenge of American protectionism may encourage the world's two most populous countries to seek greater cooperation. This could involve easing trade restrictions and resuming investments that were halted after previous border conflicts.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion for the upcoming Monday drawing after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's draw.

While nine tickets nationwide won $1 million each by matching the five white balls, the grand prize has continued to grow since it was last won in May.
