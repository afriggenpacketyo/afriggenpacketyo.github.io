        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for 14 days. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's justification for deployment was "untethered to the facts" and likely exceeded his constitutional authority, citing the tradition of resisting military intrusion into civil affairs. The judge noted that protests in Portland were not "significantly violent or disruptive" enough to warrant such a measure. This legal challenge underscores the delicate balance between federal and state power, and the role of the courts in upholding constitutional law over perceived martial law.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Long queues, traditionally seen as an inconvenience, are becoming a desirable social activity, particularly in the UK. People are willingly waiting for hours for exclusive product launches or experiential marketing events, driven by the excitement of anticipation, the chance to meet new people, and the allure of "freebies." Psychologists explain that the anticipation of a reward releases dopamine, creating a pleasurable feeling, while brands capitalize on this by offering unique experiences and limited-edition items. This trend, often amplified by social media content creation, reflects a shift in consumer behavior where the queuing experience itself holds significant value beyond the final purchase.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest U.S. Lutheran denomination, installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a historic moment for the predominantly white church. Curry, 53, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the ELCA's first woman leader, and hopes his presence will encourage more leaders of color. His six-year term begins as the ELCA, which has seen declining membership, navigates challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, including theological disputes over LGBTQ+ inclusion. Curry's unique path to leadership, growing up Catholic and entering Lutheran ministry through a program for diverse settings, highlights efforts to foster new congregations.</p>

          <p>Lithuania's Vilnius Airport experienced a temporary closure of its airspace in the early hours of Sunday, reportedly due to the sighting of hot air balloons. Flights were redirected to other airports, including Riga and Kaunas, as a result of the incident. This article is the latest in a series of recent European airport closures attributed to drone sightings, indicating a growing concern for airspace security. Additionally, Lithuania, a NATO member and Ukraine supporter, has recently imposed a no-fly zone along its border with Belarus, an ally of Russia, to swiftly respond to potential airspace violations, underscoring heightened regional security sensitivities.</p>

          <p>UCLA, previously winless, achieved a stunning 42-37 victory over No. 7 Penn State, largely thanks to tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel, who became the playcaller just four days prior. Neuheisel's offensive plan led to points on the Bruins' first five drives, with quarterback Nico Iamaleava accounting for five touchdowns. The team, which had recently seen its coach and coordinators depart, showed renewed belief and execution. This unexpected win, which saw Neuheisel hoisted by his players, marks a potential turning point for UCLA, demonstrating how strategic changes and a new mindset can lead to remarkable athletic success against formidable odds.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Freshers' Flu: The Immune Challenges Faced by New University Students</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 19:05:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Freshers' flu," a common cold-like illness, rapidly spreads among new university students due to a "mixing pot" of respiratory viruses from diverse backgrounds. Immunologists explain that late nights, poor diet, stress, and alcohol consumption during freshers' week significantly weaken the immune system, making students more susceptible. The stress of adapting to a new environment triggers cortisol release, suppressing immune responses, while lack of sleep further compromises defenses. Despite the widespread nature of the illness, experts advise students to prioritize rest and seek medical help if symptoms persist or worsen, emphasizing the importance of recovery for overall well-being during this transitional period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted a Trump administration initiative that would have transferred immigrant children to adult detention centers upon turning 18. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras issued a restraining order, ruling that automatically detaining these individuals violates a 2021 court order requiring their release to the "least restrictive setting available." This decision adds to a series of legal challenges against Trump's immigration policies, which also include accusations of reviving family separations to coerce immigrants into self-deportation and offering $2,500 stipends for voluntary departure. Advocates argue these policies pressure children to abandon legal claims and return to danger.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old staunch conservative, has been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on her third attempt, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. A protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi aims to revive his "Abenomics" economic vision and ease constitutional restrictions on Japan's Self-Defence Forces. Despite a past as a heavy metal drummer and TV host, she built a reputation as an outspoken conservative, though she has recently softened her stance on issues like married women's maiden names and same-sex marriage. Her policy proposals are rooted in personal experiences, focusing on women's health, childcare, and support for Japan's aging society.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to celebrate the potential Gaza ceasefire, crediting U.S. President Donald Trump for brokering the deal. Protesters expressed hope for the return of hostages, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for allegedly prolonging the war and succumbing to extremist demands. The U.S. plan proposes a ceasefire, hostage release, Israeli withdrawal, and a technocratic Palestinian committee to govern Gaza, with Israel returning Palestinian detainees. While the mood was hopeful, some remained skeptical that Netanyahu would allow the deal to finalize. The rally underscored the deep division within Israel regarding the war's handling and the urgency of bringing the hostages home.</p>

          <p>Hearts, currently leading the Scottish Premiership by five points, are fueling title aspirations among their fans after a strong start to the season, including a dramatic derby win. Head coach Derek McInnes acknowledges the fans' excitement, despite his professional caution against premature title talk. The club's optimism is bolstered by a £10 million investment from owner Tony Bloom, who previously stated Hearts could challenge for second place. While some draw parallels to Aberdeen's past collapse, pundits like Kevin Thomson believe fans have every right to be optimistic, especially with traditional giants Rangers and Celtic not yet at their peak.</p>

Despite some early mishaps, Lammens secured a clean sheet and made two significant saves, showcasing agility and confidence that his predecessors reportedly lacked. Coach Ruben Amorim explained the delay in Lammens' debut was for adaptation to the new country and pressure. The team secured its third home win in a row, offering a glimmer of hope for a positive turnaround, though Amorim acknowledges the need for consistent performance, especially in upcoming away fixtures.</p>
