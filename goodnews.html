          <p>China has successfully completed a massive 1,856-kilometer green belt, effectively containing the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts in Inner Mongolia. This significant environmental project aims to combat desertification across a vast area of nearly 95,000 square kilometers. Engineers utilized a method involving straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by the planting of drought-resistant trees like sacsaoul. This achievement is part of China's broader 'green great wall' initiative to build a robust ecological barrier and control sand-related environmental issues.</p>

          <p>AI server manufacturer Super Micro has announced plans to significantly increase its investment and manufacturing capabilities in Europe. CEO Charles Liang stated that the decision is driven by rapidly growing demand for the company's servers, which are crucial for developing and implementing large artificial intelligence models. While the company already has facilities in the Netherlands, it is exploring further expansion to capitalize on the global AI boom. The move aligns with recent calls from tech leaders like Nvidia's CEO for Europe to bolster its computing infrastructure to remain competitive.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Hong Kong is Positioned to Fill a Global Development Role as U.S. Steps Back</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is in a unique position to become a hub for global public goods as the United States appears to be reducing its role in international development. The author points to the dismantling of U.S. development agencies and an 'America first' mentality as creating a vacuum that China is poised to fill. With Beijing taking a more proactive stance, particularly with initiatives like the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) launched in Hong Kong, the city can leverage its cosmopolitan status. This shift could provide Hong Kong with a new path to global prominence.</p>

          <p>Mandonna 'Donna' Kashanian, an Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, has been released from ICE detention after Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise intervened on her behalf. Kashanian was detained last month from her New Orleans home despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. Following a surge of community support and advocacy from local representatives, Scalise asked the Department of Homeland Security to review her case. Her release highlights a rare instance of high-level political intervention in a controversial immigration enforcement case.</p>
