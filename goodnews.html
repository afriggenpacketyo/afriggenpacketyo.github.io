          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second consecutive term, signaling a desire for policy stability amid global economic uncertainties. The S&P/ASX 200 index reversed earlier gains, while the Australian dollar strengthened slightly against the US dollar. Across Asia, the offshore Chinese yuan and the New Taiwanese dollar also saw gains against the greenback. Meanwhile, discussions between representatives of Gautam Adani and the Trump administration regarding bribery charges have accelerated, potentially leading to a resolution soon.

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the earliest roses were likely yellow, contrasting with the prevalent image of red and pink roses. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to reconstruct ancestral traits. The team concluded that the common ancestor of Rosa exhibited single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets, challenging the traditional association of roses with red and pink hues.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming the third spot. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to the sharp increases in previous years when many development projects resumed after COVID-19 suspensions. Despite the drop, Japan views ODA as a critical diplomatic tool in the Indo-Pacific region amid China's growing influence.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey revealed that the lack of trash bins in public areas is the biggest inconvenience for visitors to Japan. While the issue has improved slightly, many tourists still struggle to dispose of trash and must carry it back to their accommodations. The removal of public trash bins is attributed to safety concerns following terror attacks, but the lack of bins has led to increased littering in tourist spots, according to this Kyodo News article.</p>
