However, after criticism from Maryland's congressional delegation and firefighters, FEMA reinstated the classes, acknowledging that certain courses provide effective training.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, which includes scaling back Mayor Karen Bass' public safety initiatives in an effort to avoid city worker layoffs. The council reduced funding for LAPD recruitment, leading to a smaller police force than in recent years, and also cut back on proposed new hires for the Fire Department. The budget aims to address a nearly $1-billion shortfall and includes measures such as tapping into the budget stabilization fund and increasing parking ticket costs. Some council members dissented, citing concerns about the impact on public safety.</p>
