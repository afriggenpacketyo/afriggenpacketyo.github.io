In her letter to First Minister John Swinney, Forbes cited a desire to spend more time with her young family and not miss their "precious early years." She affirmed her continued support for the First Minister and the Scottish National Party's goals, including the pursuit of independence. Forbes will continue to serve as an MSP for her Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency for the remainder of her term.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in developing its domestic aviation supply chain, aiming to reduce its reliance on foreign technology. A key project is the CJ-1000A, a jet engine being developed by the Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) to power its homegrown C919 airliner. An official from the Chinese Academy of Engineering recently gave a positive update, stating the project is progressing as planned, which would mark a major achievement in the country's technological ambitions. This effort is part of a broader strategy to establish China as a major player in all aspects of civil aviation, from components to complete aircraft.</p>

          <p>While the market for sports drinks and electrolyte powders exceeds $10 billion annually, medical and sports science experts suggest most people do not need them for routine hydration. Electrolytes, which are minerals like sodium and potassium lost in sweat, are crucial for bodily functions but are typically replenished through a balanced diet. Experts point out that the body is highly effective at regulating its own electrolyte levels. Unless a person is engaged in prolonged, intense exercise or experiencing rapid fluid loss from illness, drinking plain water and eating a varied diet is generally sufficient for staying properly hydrated.</p>

          <p>An NPR story recounts the experience of Eileen Freiberg-Dale, who was struggling to care for her husband after he suffered a traumatic brain injury. Overwhelmed with new responsibilities, including managing their business and his intensive care, she found herself crying in her yard while trying to rake a large pile of leaves. At that moment, a friend of 15 years, Jonathan Lilienfeld, appeared with his own rake and leaf bags. He gently told her to go inside and rest while he took care of the entire yard, a simple gesture that she recalls as a heroic act of rescue during one of the hardest times of her life.</p>

          <p>The Ann Arbor District Library in Michigan has found immense success with its "Summer Game," an interactive program that has attracted over 16,000 active players, more than half of whom are adults. The game evolved from a simple reading challenge into a "library-using game," where participants earn points by solving puzzles, exploring local history, and discovering the library's diverse offerings beyond books, such as tools and art. Inspired by corporate loyalty programs, the game's popularity highlights how libraries can innovate to engage their communities in new ways. The library has made the game's code open-source for other institutions to use.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced an additional £100 million in funding to intensify efforts against illegal people-smuggling operations in the English Channel. The investment will support the National Crime Agency with up to 300 more officers and new technology to track and dismantle the criminal gangs responsible. This move comes as the number of people crossing in small boats has reached a record high for this point in the year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the funding would enhance the UK's ability to "bring the gangs down," though political opponents have dismissed the measure as insufficient.</p>

          <p>The unofficial annual summer retreat for China's senior political leadership appears to have begun in the seaside resort of Beidaihe. The start of the gathering was signaled by the public appearance of Cai Qi, a high-ranking Communist Party official, at a meeting with technology and research experts at the resort. During this period, which typically lasts around two weeks, top leaders reduce their public appearances as they engage in informal policy discussions. Security measures, including a ban on drones, have been implemented in the area, indicating the presence of the political elite.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Humans Share Hibernation-Related Genes, Hinting at New Medical Treatments</h2>

          <p>Recent scientific studies suggest that the genetic "superpowers" enabling animals to hibernate are also present in human DNA, potentially paving the way for new medical breakthroughs. Researchers focused on a gene cluster known as the FTO locus, which is a strong genetic risk factor for obesity in humans but plays a key role in regulating metabolism and fat storage in hibernating animals. This discovery implies that humans possess the underlying genetic framework for resilience against conditions like muscle decay and metabolic disease. Scientists believe that by learning to control these genetic switches, we could develop novel treatments for diabetes and Alzheimer's.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United Shows Signs of Tactical Evolution Under New Manager During Pre-Season</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 02:58:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's pre-season tour under new manager Ruben Amorim has revealed notable changes in tactics and team environment, though it remains to be seen if this signals a true recovery. Amorim has implemented a more relaxed, responsibility-focused atmosphere, a contrast to his predecessor's prescriptive style, while introducing new tactical frameworks, including a fluid three-man defense. The team's performance in friendlies has shown glimpses of improvement, with new signings adding creativity to the attack. However, the manager remains aware that these early positive signs will mean nothing if the team cannot deliver results when the Premier League season begins.</p>

          <p>World number two and recent Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek has been unexpectedly knocked out of the Canadian Open in the fourth round. She was defeated by Denmark's Clara Tauson in straight sets, 7-6, 6-3. Swiatek's early exit follows those of other top seeds, including Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula, opening up the field in Montreal. Meanwhile, four-time major winner Naomi Osaka advanced decisively, losing only one game in her match. Tauson, who expressed growing confidence on the tour, will now face American Madison Keys in the quarter-finals.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Man City's Hiring of Pep Lijnders Signals Major Tactical Shift</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article from the BBC suggests Manchester City's most significant summer signing may not be a player, but rather Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former right-hand man at Liverpool. The hiring of Lijnders, a proponent of high-octane, transition-focused football, indicates that manager Pep Guardiola may be planning a major tactical evolution. The analysis posits that Guardiola recognizes modern football is shifting away from his classic positional play towards a more direct, dynamic style. Recent player signings who excel at carrying the ball, rather than intricate passing, further support the theory that City is preparing for a new approach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a gesture aimed at easing tensions, South Korea's military has begun dismantling loudspeakers used to broadcast anti-Pyongyang propaganda across the border into North Korea. The move is part of President Lee Jae-myung's broader effort to improve relations and restore trust with the North. The propaganda broadcasts from both sides have long been a source of irritation and conflict. Although Pyongyang recently rejected an offer for dialogue from Seoul, this practical de-escalation measure is intended to help reduce military friction, provided it does not compromise South Korea's defense readiness.</p>
