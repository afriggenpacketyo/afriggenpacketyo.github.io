          <p>The Japanese government is set to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower the elevated prices of rice. This move aims to address the rice shortage in stores, which has caused prices to double compared to the previous year. The released rice will be sold to smaller supermarket operators, specialty shops, and major retailers, with the farm ministry beginning to accept applications. The government hopes this action will quickly provide consumers with lower-priced rice.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased as the fentanyl crisis eases, with fatal overdoses among those under 35 dropping from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Researchers attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold by dealers, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a trend of less risky drug and alcohol use among teens. However, concerns remain for those with severe addiction, and potential cuts to addiction services could jeopardize this progress.</p>
