          <p>Undrafted rookie Myles Price has made an immediate impact as the Minnesota Vikings' kick and punt returner. Now five games into his NFL career, he describes his mindset of trying to score a touchdown every time he touches the ball. Price, who never scored a return touchdown in college, focuses on meticulously studying punters and tracking the ball's trajectory to position himself for a successful catch and run. He emphasizes maintaining poised feet and an empty mind to execute his role effectively on special teams.</p>

          <p>With the New York Yankees facing elimination in the American League Division Series, former center fielder Bernie Williams advises the team to focus on the present moment, one pitch at a time. Drawing from his own experience in a 2001 comeback, he suggests the team must remember the sting of their recent losses to avoid repeating mistakes. Williams also contrasted the current management style of Aaron Boone, who relies heavily on analytics from the front office, with that of his former manager Joe Torre, who he believes had more autonomy in decision-making.</p>

          <p>A youth-led movement in Morocco, known as GenZ 212, has been organizing the country's largest anti-government protests in years, demanding political reform and improved public services. The group operates anonymously and coordinates its actions primarily through the online chat platform Discord, which they say is more secure and less familiar to local police. Organizers use the platform to hold democratic votes on protest strategies and share locations shortly before demonstrations begin, showcasing a new model of decentralized, digital-first activism to maintain momentum while protecting their identities.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team maintained its winning start to the Women's World Cup with a tense, four-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Guwahati. Chasing a modest target of 179, England's batters struggled against spin, collapsing to 103-6 and facing a potential major upset. However, a resilient, unbeaten knock of 79 from captain Heather Knight, supported by Charlie Dean, guided the team to victory. The performance highlighted England's vulnerability against spin bowling on tricky pitches, despite their strong bowling attack having earlier restricted Bangladesh.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of drivers affected by the mis-selling of car finance, with estimated average payouts of around £700 per person. The investigation covers 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024, focusing on unfair discretionary commission arrangements, which incentivized dealers to charge higher interest rates. The total compensation from lenders could reach £8.2 billion, as the regulator aims to provide a free and accessible scheme for consumers to receive fair redress for being overcharged.

          <p>Legendary Spanish left-back Jordi Alba has announced he will retire from professional football at the conclusion of Inter Miami's current MLS season. The decision comes as a surprise, as the 36-year-old had signed a multi-year contract extension with the club just five months ago. Alba, who joined former Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets in Miami in 2023, was a key member of the dominant Barcelona and Spain teams of the 2010s, known for his attacking prowess and connection with Messi.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As consumer debt and default rates rise, it is important for borrowers to understand their rights during the debt collection process, which are protected under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). These rights include freedom from harassment, meaning collectors cannot use abusive language or call at unreasonable hours. Borrowers also have the right to demand and dispute information, forcing collectors to provide verification of the debt. Finally, consumers have the right to control communication and can demand in writing that a collector cease all contact.</p>

          <p>Doris Grünwald and Jessica Baumgartner, two women who were accidentally switched at birth in a Graz hospital in 1990, have finally met 35 years later. The discovery began when one of the women found her blood type did not match her parents' during a blood donation. After years of searching, the other family was located when the second woman was informed about the case during her pregnancy. The families have now connected, describing the experience as emotionally overwhelming but also a relief that has brought them certainty and expanded their families.</p>

          <h2>Candy Companies Offer Fewer Chocolate-Based Treats Amid Surging Cocoa Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 12:14:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers may notice that new Halloween candy offerings this year are lighter on chocolate, a trend driven by a global cocoa bean shortage that has caused prices to skyrocket. Major manufacturers like Hershey's and Ferrara are introducing alternative flavors such as pumpkin spice, cinnamon, and salted caramel, or swapping chocolate coatings for vanilla cream. This "cocoa cutting" allows companies to innovate and appeal to consumer demand for novelty while also mitigating the financial risk of relying on the volatile cocoa market. The industry is also leaning more heavily on non-chocolate options like gummies.</p>
