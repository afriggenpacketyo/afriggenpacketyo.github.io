          <p>Former Wasps fly-half Jacob Umaga, who earned a cap for England in 2021, has been called up by Samoa for the first time. The 26-year-old now plays for Italian side Benetton Treviso, and a change in World Rugby rules in 2022 allows players to represent a second nation after a three-year absence from Test rugby. Umaga was born in Halifax, his father Mike being a Samoa international, and legendary New Zealand center Tana Umaga is Jacob's uncle.

The Imola race returned in 2020 due to pandemic-related restrictions, but the increasing demand for new locations is putting pressure on European races.

The inscription indicates the mission's explicit goal was to find the "elixir of life."
