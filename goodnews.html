          <p>California State Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin introduced legislation, SB 627, to prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings during public interactions. The "No Secret Police Act" would also mandate officers to display identifying information. Exemptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers wearing medical masks during natural disasters, with clear riot gear also permitted.

          <p>A Senate panel is navigating compromises on Medicaid and taxes in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," aiming to finalize the package by July 4. The Senate Finance Committee, overseeing tax policy and Medicaid, is addressing divisive cuts to Medicaid and an increase to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. While House Speaker Mike Johnson urged minimal changes, the Senate intends to leave its mark on the bill. The committee aims to make Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, cut "Green New Deal" spending, and target spending waste while protecting vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>A LendingTree survey revealed that 67% of newlyweds took on debt to pay for their wedding. While some may view wedding debt as frivolous, experts suggest it can be "good debt" if approached strategically. Using a credit card with a 0% introductory offer is recommended for charging purchases, provided the debt can be repaid within the introductory period. Personal lines of credit may be a wiser option for larger expenses due to lower interest rates. Regardless of the type of debt, experts advise creating a repayment plan to avoid financial strain after the wedding. (not investment advice)</p>
