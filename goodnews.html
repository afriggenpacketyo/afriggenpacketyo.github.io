          <p>Professor Mohd Rizal Arshad, a prominent Malaysian deep-sea robotics scientist, has relocated to China to further his work on underwater prototypes. Joining Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University's school of robotics, he was drawn by China's strong ecosystem for quickly moving research into industrial applications, its direct engagement with businesses, and convenient access to necessary components. Rizal envisions the ocean as a crucial future source for drinking water, food, minerals, and various forms of power, such as wave energy. This move underscores China's burgeoning global leadership in deep-sea science and its ability to attract top international talent for advanced research.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh government is proposing modifications to its contentious tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, which currently mandate properties be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower business rates. The new proposals suggest an average of 182 days let over multiple years, and would permit up to 14 days of charitable donations to count towards the target. While the government states it has considered feedback, industry bodies and Welsh language groups contend the changes are inadequate, asserting they do not resolve the housing crisis or the significant challenges confronting tourism businesses. A public consultation on these proposals is ongoing until November 20.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 03:57:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe experienced a significant 40% plunge in July, continuing a seven-month streak of declines, while its Chinese electric vehicle rival, BYD, recorded a remarkable 225% surge in new registrations. This downturn for Tesla occurred even as the overall European market for battery electric cars saw an increase. The article attributes Tesla's struggles to intense competition, reputational issues stemming from Elon Musk's public statements, and an aging vehicle lineup, with analysts noting the company's focus on AI and robotics rather than car refreshes. Chinese brands, spearheaded by BYD, are rapidly expanding across Europe with competitive pricing, gaining a record market share and affecting several established automakers.

          <p>This article provides Fantasy Premier League (FPL) advice for Gameweek Three, concentrating on strategic player choices within a £100m budget for a "Free Hit" team. Notable recommendations feature Chelsea's Robert Sanchez as goalkeeper and Marc Cucurella in defense, complemented by Nottingham Forest's Nikola Milenkovic and Brentford's Sepp van den Berg. For midfield, Mohamed Salah is endorsed as captain for Liverpool's tough fixture against Arsenal, while Bruno Fernandes is suggested for Manchester United despite their recent woes, and Newcastle's Harvey Barnes is highlighted as a potential differential. Strikers Chris Wood of Nottingham Forest, Joao Pedro of Chelsea, and Jean-Philippe Mateta of Crystal Palace are also identified for their scoring potential.</p>

          <p>Photographer Ray Giubilo achieved a "one-in-a-million" image at the US Open, which seventh-seed Jasmine Paolini lauded as potentially "the picture of the year." This whimsical and half-terrifying, half-sublime photo, taken during Paolini's first-round encounter, was a complete fluke, captured when the player was off balance during her forehand stroke. Giubilo, a seasoned tennis photographer with 37 years in the field, instantly recognized the shot's exceptional quality. The article underscores the combination of patience, creative vision, and impeccable technical ability essential for such a unique capture, noting that subsequent attempts to replicate the exact moment proved unsuccessful.</p>

          <p>European markets opened higher, buoyed by strong performance from U.S.-listed Nvidia, which reported a 50% sales growth forecast, signaling continued resilience in the AI boom. However, Nvidia's shares dipped after data center revenue missed estimates and concerns about China sales arose. French spirits giant Pernod Ricard saw a sales decline due to weak Chinese sentiment and U.S. tariffs. British renewable energy firm Drax plunged 11% following a UK regulatory investigation into its biomass sourcing statements and financial reports. The article also noted a 7.4% rise in EU new car registrations in July, with BYD's EV sales surging while Tesla's declined. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of British-made cars to the United States increased by 6.8% in July, ending a three-month period of decline, following the introduction of a new UK-US tariff agreement. This deal reduced the proposed 25% import tax on UK cars to 10% for the initial 100,000 vehicles exported annually. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) emphasized the US's position as the largest single national market for British-built cars, highlighting the tariff deal's significance amidst broader challenges in UK car manufacturing. Analysts attribute the sector's overall slump to factors such as elevated labor costs, intensified international competition, and the effects of Brexit. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this impressive growth, Nvidia's shares experienced a slight dip after its data center revenue marginally missed analyst expectations and the company acknowledged "geopolitical issues," including navigating the Trump administration's shifting policies on AI development and sales to China.

          <p>The news of Taylor Swift's engagement elicited a significant emotional response from fans, underscoring the phenomenon of "parasocial relationships" where individuals develop one-sided friendly or romantic feelings for celebrities. Psychologist Sonia Jaeger characterizes these as "my friend who doesn't know me," explaining that increased access to celebrities' private lives via social media cultivates an illusion of intimacy. While such relationships can provide a sense of connection and community, especially in online spaces, experts like Arthur C. Brooks stress that they are unable to substitute reciprocal, real-life friendships, likening them to "fast food" that tastes good but lacks nutritional content for emotional needs.</p>

          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has incurred a substantial fine of almost £31,500 ($42,500) for his conduct during an unexpected first-round exit from the tournament. Medvedev's on-court meltdown, which notably included smashing a racket, was reportedly triggered by a photographer entering the court during his match against Benjamin Bonzi. The fine consists of $30,000 for unsportsmanlike behavior and an additional $12,500 for racket abuse, leading the Russian to forfeit approximately 40% of his first-round prize money.

The article commends Aronofsky's affectionate depiction of pre-millennial New York, populated by vividly drawn characters and propelled by an energetic soundtrack.

These specially modified toy rabbits are designed to emit heat, a specific scent, and natural movements, effectively mimicking real marsh rabbits to attract pythons. Placed within monitored pens, they trigger an alert when a python is detected, enabling contractors to swiftly remove the snake. This initiative builds upon previous, more costly attempts using live rabbits and is part of broader efforts to manage the estimated tens to hundreds of thousands of pythons that have few natural predators.

Earlier, USC had been reluctant due to uncertainties surrounding the College Football Playoff format and the logistical demands of its new Big Ten travel schedule. The current primary point of contention is the game's annual date, as USC aims to move it earlier in the season to better balance its conference commitments, a change Notre Dame might oppose given its scheduling flexibility.</p>
