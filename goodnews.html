          <p>GameStop has made its first foray into the cryptocurrency market by purchasing 4,710 bitcoins, valued at $512.6 million, following a trend popularized by MicroStrategy. The video game retailer's shares dipped slightly after the announcement, even though the company had a substantial cash reserve of $4.76 billion as of February 1. CEO Ryan Cohen aims to revitalize the business by cutting costs and streamlining operations, while this move into cryptocurrencies is part of his broader strategy. GameStop's decision reflects a growing interest in alternative stores of value like bitcoin, particularly amid easing trade tensions and concerns about U.S. sovereign debt.

          <p>The AI industrial trade has regained momentum, with GE Vernova shares reaching an all-time high, outperforming peers like Eaton and Vertiv. Investors initially panicked over a cheaper, faster AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek, but optimism has returned with positive trade updates and strong earnings from tech giants. GE Vernova's potential for revenue and order growth is higher compared to its competitors, supported by a larger backlog. Recent deals, including a $14.2 billion gas turbines agreement with Saudi Arabia and Trump's support for the U.S. nuclear power industry, have further boosted GE Vernova's stock.</p>

          <p>CNBC has selected "Hope for Cynics" by Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki as the top business book to read in June. The book explores the question of whether it is foolish to believe that people remain fundamentally decent, arguing that optimism is supported by science and leads to better outcomes. Zaki challenges the notion that intelligence and success require cynicism, citing research indicating that cynics are often sicker, poorer, and more wrong. The book suggests that a mindset shift towards "hopeful skepticism" can be learned and aligned with success.</p>
