          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that imposes a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese goods imported into the United States. The agreement also includes a 40% tariff on products that originate in other countries and are transshipped through Vietnam, a measure aimed at preventing circumvention of trade barriers. In exchange, the deal reportedly grants U.S. products tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets, a move that could impact various sectors, including apparel companies reliant on Vietnamese manufacturing.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates later this year, financial experts suggest that now is an opportune time to open a certificate of deposit (CD). By locking in a CD, savers can secure currently available high rates of 4-5% before they decline, ensuring a predictable and significant return on their money. This strategy allows individuals to protect their savings from future rate cuts and provides a stable growth period to consider their next financial moves in an uncertain economic climate.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for NYC mayor, has proposed creating a network of municipally owned grocery stores to combat high food costs, an idea with little precedent in a major U.S. city. The plan aims to sell food at wholesale prices by operating on a non-profit basis, but it faces significant hurdles, including the grocery industry's slim profit margins and complex supply chain logistics. While the proposal has public support, its implementation would be a high-stakes experiment in public policy and food affordability.</p>
