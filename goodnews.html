          <h2>Oil Prices Plunge After Trump Allows China to Continue Iranian Oil Purchases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 10:52:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline after President Trump announced that China could continue purchasing oil from Iran, signaling a potential easing of the US pressure campaign following a ceasefire with Israel. Brent crude fell by 4.66% to $68.15 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil decreased by 4.64% to $65.33 a barrel. This decision reverses previous threats to penalize any country buying Iranian oil and comes as investors believe the risk of major supply disruptions in the Middle East is decreasing. The market had previously seen prices rise when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites, fearing retaliation that could disrupt oil exports.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's dedication to controlling inflation, stating that policymakers will likely maintain current policies until the impact of tariffs on prices becomes clearer. Powell described the economy as robust with a strong labor market, but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. His cautious approach contrasts with President Trump's criticism and calls for lower interest rates. Powell's remarks will be delivered to congressional committees this week, where he is expected to face questions about the Fed's monetary policy and its response to economic uncertainties.

          <p>Purchasing a $400,000 annuity at age 70 can provide monthly income ranging from $2,400 to $2,900, influenced by factors like gender, life expectancy, and interest rates. Women typically receive slightly lower monthly payments due to longer life expectancies, while joint life annuities offer continued payments to a surviving spouse but with reduced monthly amounts. Annuity payouts are also influenced by current interest rates, with higher rates generally translating into stronger payouts. A fixed immediate annuity provides a guaranteed monthly check, while inflation-adjusted and variable annuities offer different features and risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, applied for 646 roles before finally landing a job as a trainee accountant. After 18 months of job hunting, she questioned the value of her university degree. Research indicates record-high competition for graduate roles, with 1.2 million applications for 17,000 vacancies last year. Morgan believes that artificial intelligence used in resume screening may have hindered her initial applications. Despite the challenges, she eventually secured a job and will start in September.</p>
