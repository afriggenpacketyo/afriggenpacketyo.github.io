          <p>Jin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), reflects on the bank's first decade, highlighting its role in financing infrastructure projects across Asia and worldwide. Established in 2016, the AIIB aimed to supplement existing multilateral development banks in promoting sustainable development. Over the past 10 years, the AIIB has financed over US$60 billion in infrastructure, including support for healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Jin acknowledges the massive funding gap for infrastructure needs in Asian countries, estimated at around three to four trillion US dollars per year, emphasizing that no single MDB can fill this gap alone. </p>

          <p>Caitlin Clark's shooting slump continued as the Indiana Fever lost to the Las Vegas Aces, 89-81, despite leading for much of the game. Clark scored 19 points, but struggled from three-point range, going 1-of-10, which combined with her previous game makes her 1-of-17 from beyond the arc in her last two games. A'ja Wilson led the Aces with 24 points, supported by Jackie Young and Chelsea Gray, who contributed significantly in the fourth quarter. The Fever were outscored 31-20 in the final quarter, leading to their defeat despite strong performances from Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchell.</p>

          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at lowering energy costs for UK businesses. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for over 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from green levies. About 500 of the most energy-intensive firms will also have their network charges reduced, increasing their discount from 60% to 90% from 2026. The plan also includes measures to expedite the connection of new factories and projects to the energy grid and aims to support the creation of over one million new well-paid jobs over the next decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route for crude oil. This appeal comes after Iran's foreign minister warned that the Islamic Republic reserves all options to defend its sovereignty following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. Closing the strait could have severe consequences for the global economy, as it facilitates the transit of approximately 20 million barrels of crude oil per day. Rubio stated that such a move would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as it would halt its own oil exports to China.</p>
