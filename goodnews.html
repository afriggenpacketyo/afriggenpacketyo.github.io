          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest is set for its grand final in Basel, featuring a diverse mix of 27 countries. Sweden, represented by KAJ, is the favorite with their sauna-themed song, but novelty acts rarely win. Other top contenders include Austria's JJ with a pop-opera ballad about unreciprocated love, France's Louane with a torch song about grief, and the Netherlands' Claude with an Afropop-chanson dedicated to his mother, who brought the family out of the Democratic Republic of Congo when he was nine years old. Finland's Erika Vikman brings a Eurodance song about female pleasure to the stage, and the UK's Remember Monday is hoping to make a splash with a musical theatre performance.</p>

          <p>A cyclist in Belfast's Victoria Park was surprised to spot a 4ft starry smooth-hound shark swimming in the Connswater River. Marine biologist Dr. Patrick Collins said that these sharks are not often seen in cities, but they have been recorded in urban areas. The shark was likely feeding on crabs in the river. The Connswater River rises in the Castlereagh hills and runs northwards through east Belfast, getting wider until it reaches the sea at Belfast Lough.</p>

England will have six teams in next season's Champions League, with a bonus spot awarded due to English teams' strong European performances. Chelsea must win their final game against Nottingham Forest to secure their place, while Aston Villa likely needs to win against Manchester United and hope for slip-ups from their rivals.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin fisherman discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat that sank in 1923, in Lake Michigan. The ship, built in 1881, was once one of the largest and most powerful on the Great Lakes. It had been buried in the sand for decades before storms recently exposed it. Historians are racing to locate shipwrecks in the Great Lakes before quagga mussels destroy them. The J.C. Ames had a 670-horsepower engine.</p>

Despite the downgrade, Moody's changed its outlook on the U.S. from negative to stable, acknowledging the country's economic strengths and the role of the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency.</p>

          <p>A new study from the CDC estimates that hundreds of lives could be saved each year by broader use of life jackets and more fences around swimming pools. The CDC's modeling found that 51 drowning deaths likely could have been prevented by better pool fencing, and 297 could have been prevented by victims wearing a life jacket during a boating accident in 2022. The study was one of the last produced by some of the agency's injury prevention experts before they were eliminated by layoffs this year.</p>
