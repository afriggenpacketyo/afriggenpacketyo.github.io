          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults suggests parents follow five simple rules to raise successful kids, emphasizing instincts over influencers and culture over clickbait. Parents should trust their intuition and cultural traditions, tailored to their child's unique interests. The psychiatrist advises focusing on enjoyment rather than strict development milestones and encourages parents to be their authentic selves, showing a range of emotions. This approach aims to reduce parental anxiety and promote a joyful, supportive environment for children's growth.</p>

          <p>Sharon Horgan, the Bafta award-winning actor, writer, producer, and director, revealed that she found confidence after the second series of her hit show 'Bad Sisters' was released.

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, beating his McLaren teammate Lando Norris. Piastri's performance suggests that a recent rule change aimed at restricting front wing flexing has had minimal impact on McLaren's performance. Norris admitted to making errors on his final run, preventing him from surpassing Piastri's time. Max Verstappen acknowledged struggling with Turn One, ultimately falling short of the pace needed for pole position. Piastri said the rule change had limited impact on McLaren and the way they prepared their car for the race.</p>
