          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues related to ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement contrasts with President Trump's view that the yen's weakness contributes to the U.S.'s trade deficit with Japan, suggesting currency issues may not be a key point in tariff talks. Kato expressed concerns about the global economic impact of Trump's tariffs, emphasizing the inappropriateness of using tariffs to address trade imbalances. Both sides reaffirmed that exchange rates should be market-determined, avoiding discussions on desired exchange rate levels.</p>
