          <p>The Dalai Lama has publicly detailed his succession plan, asserting that the process will be handled exclusively by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, which he established. This move aims to prevent interference from the Chinese government, which claims authority over the selection of his reincarnation. In his statement, the 90-year-old spiritual leader reinforced that the tradition will continue after his death and that his successor should be chosen according to traditional Tibetan Buddhist procedures. Beijing responded by reiterating its stance that the selection must occur within China and receive its approval.</p>

          <p>The latest version of a major domestic policy bill passed by the Senate includes an increased tax credit for semiconductor manufacturers, raising it from 25% to 35%. This provision aims to incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to expand advanced chip manufacturing within the United States, building on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The move is part of Washington's broader strategy to onshore critical technology supply chains and reduce reliance on Asia.

Colwill has shown increased fight and responsibility, notably in a recent Club World Cup match where his aggressive play was pivotal in securing a win. While the 22-year-old academy product is still developing, his determination reflects the club's strategy of fostering leadership from within its youth ranks. The club's ownership believes this approach will cultivate a stronger, more cohesive team spirit, even as some argue for more established stars.</p>

          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, opening a certificate of deposit (CD) in July could be a strategic way to secure high returns on savings. By locking in a fixed rate, savers can protect their money from future rate declines that would affect variable-rate accounts. Current CD rates, some exceeding 4.5%, can generate significant, predictable interest on a substantial deposit like $20,000. This approach also provides a stable place for funds while allowing savers time to assess the uncertain economic landscape and plan their next financial moves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, has proposed a novel plan to combat high food prices by creating a network of city-owned grocery stores. The plan envisions one non-profit store in each borough, selling food at wholesale cost to fight "price gouging" by corporate chains. While the idea has public support, it is largely unprecedented for a city of New York's size, drawing on examples from small rural towns that have faced their own food access crises.

The man's remains, found buried in a ceramic pot, showed he lived a hard life with evidence of arthritis likely from using a pottery wheel. Genetic analysis of his DNA indicated he had brown hair and eyes and that about 20% of his ancestry traced back to the Fertile Crescent, providing direct genetic evidence of population mixing between North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
