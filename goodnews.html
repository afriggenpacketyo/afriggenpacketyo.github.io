          <p>Nintendo shares have surged this year, adding billions to the company's value, driven by the release of the Switch 2 console. The new console is the successor to the original Switch and has seen strong sales since its launch, selling millions of units in its first few days. Investors are optimistic that the Switch 2 will replicate the success of its predecessor, which has sold over 152 million units. Nintendo's strategy of leveraging strong franchises like Super Mario and Zelda has also contributed to its success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty payments as the U.S. imposes tariffs on various goods. This involves modifying products' materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into different harmonized system codes with lower tariff rates. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions for certain products allow companies to benefit from these strategic design choices. One motorhome manufacturer planned to work with experts to implement tariff mitigation strategies, including tariff engineering and deferrals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia has lifted its ban on plasma donation for gay and bisexual men, becoming the first country to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation. The new rules will begin taking effect next month and are estimated to expand the donation pool significantly. While most people in a monogamous sexual relationship will be eligible to donate blood, those who have had anal sex with new or multiple partners will need to wait three months to donate blood, though they are still eligible to donate plasma. The new approach to blood donations will be implemented sometime in 2026.</p>
