          <p>Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer stated that international law is central to the Starmer government's foreign policy, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a warm relationship with the United States, even at the expense of short-term political gains. He highlighted that adhering to international law is essential for securing trade deals and addressing fundamental problems like migration. Hermer defended Starmer's approach, noting the UK's recent trade agreements with the US, India, and the EU, which he attributes to the country's reputation as a trustworthy partner. He also addressed past controversies, including remarks comparing calls to depart from international law to arguments made in 1930s Germany, while reaffirming the government's commitment to legal compliance both domestically and internationally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to bring record-high temperatures across the eastern United States, with more than 150 million Americans under extreme heat alerts. The National Weather Service warns of dangerous conditions from the Midwest to the East Coast, citing light winds and a lack of overnight cooling as major concerns. Meteorologists attribute the heat wave to a heat dome, an area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity. Experts advise staying indoors with air conditioning, avoiding strenuous outdoor activities, and staying hydrated to prevent heat-related illnesses, as climate change makes such extreme events more frequent and longer-lasting.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's dominance in rare earth elements is significantly bolstered by supplies from Myanmar, which accounts for a substantial portion of China's rare earth imports. Myanmar is a key source of heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium, essential for high-tech manufacturing. China has effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar, raising concerns about environmental and human rights abuses. This dynamic has given China a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain, increasing its leverage in the global market.</p>

          <p>An RBN Energy executive stated that it is unlikely Iran will close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions. The analyst suggests that closing the strait would harm Iran's own interests, as it exports a significant amount of oil through the passage. He also noted that the market seems to agree, as oil prices dropped despite initial concerns. The analyst also warned about the U.S.'s restrictions on ethane trade to China, stating that they pose serious issues for exporters and damage the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy supplier.
