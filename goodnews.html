          <p>The Boston Red Sox have reported concerns about doxxing to the Newton Police after trading Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants, which has led to fan backlash on social media. The Red Sox signed third baseman Alex Bregman, and Devers refused to play first base. Police stated that they were notified by representatives from the Red Sox organization but are not investigating any online threats. General Manager Breslow suggested that the team might perform better without Devers, while the Giants assumed the remaining $250 million of Devers' contract.</p>

          <p>The Senate's proposed tax bill includes a provision for a $1,000 baby bonus deposited into "Trump accounts" for children born between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2028. These accounts, similar to 529 college savings plans, offer tax-deferred growth and qualified withdrawals taxed as long-term capital gains. To be eligible, the child must be a U.S. citizen at birth, and both parents must have Social Security numbers, with the Treasury Secretary establishing accounts if parents don't. While proponents argue these accounts promote wealth-building, critics suggest they are overly complicated compared to universal savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans have introduced a "no tax on tips" proposal as part of their multitrillion-dollar tax cut package, aiming to fulfill a campaign pledge by President Trump. This measure is similar to a House GOP provision, offering a tax deduction on qualified tips, defined as cash, charged, or shared tips, available from 2025 through 2028 for both employees and independent contractors. However, the Senate version caps the deduction at $25,000 per year and gradually reduces its value for individuals earning over $150,000 ($300,000 for married couples), unlike the House bill, which has no cap and a hard income limit of $160,000. The tax break would only apply to tipped workers in occupations that "customarily and regularly" received tips before December 31, 2024, with the Treasury Secretary tasked with publishing a list of eligible occupations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans struggle with medical debt due to high healthcare costs, deductibles, and unexpected bills. Effective relief options include negotiating directly with providers, applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care, and utilizing a medical bill advocate to identify errors. Debt consolidation or management programs can help manage medical debt mixed with credit card debt, while debt settlement should be considered a last resort. Starting the process early and exploring available options increases the likelihood of avoiding lasting financial damage.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to decriminalize abortion for women in England and Wales, marking a significant change to abortion legislation. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill removes the threat of investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment for late-term abortion. The new clause will not change any law regarding the provision of abortion services within a healthcare setting, including but not limited to the time limit, telemedicine, the grounds for abortion, or the requirement for two doctors' approval. Campaigners have welcomed the decision, while the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) expressed horror at the vote.</p>

The growth in streaming is attributed to free ad-supported streaming TV offerings, the rise of YouTube, and the transformation of traditional media companies into streaming-first entities.
