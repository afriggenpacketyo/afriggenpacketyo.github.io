          <p>Approximately 900 hikers, guides, and staff were successfully rescued from the Chinese side of Mount Everest after a severe snowstorm left them stranded at over 4,900 meters during a national holiday. The storm caused some hikers to suffer hypothermia, necessitating assistance from rescue teams with essential supplies, including food, medicine, heating, and oxygen. The scenic area has been temporarily closed following the incident, and early-season snowstorms also affected other parts of western China, leading to one fatality and further evacuations. This article highlights the inherent dangers of high-altitude mountaineering and the critical importance of effective rescue operations in extreme weather conditions.</p>

          <p>US scientist Dr. Fred Ramsdell learned he had won the Nobel Prize for medicine while on an off-grid hiking trip, after his wife received a flurry of text messages alerting them to the news. Ramsdell, whose phone was on airplane mode and who was unreachable by the Nobel committee for 20 hours, initially disbelieved the news, thinking it was a trick. He shares the 11 million Swedish kronor prize for his research into how the immune system attacks hostile infections, alongside two other scientists. This article humorously recounts the challenges the Nobel Assembly faced in contacting him, adding to a history of comical laureate notifications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully demonstrated that enzyme-converted kidneys can function in recipients, potentially improving access to organs and significantly reducing lengthy transplant waiting lists. The study, published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, highlighted that a converted kidney functioned for at least two days without hyperacute rejection in a brain-dead recipient. This innovative approach addresses the critical shortage of donated organs and challenges in organ allocation, offering a more efficient use of the human organ pool. This article suggests a significant advancement in transplant medicine that could revolutionize organ availability.</p>
