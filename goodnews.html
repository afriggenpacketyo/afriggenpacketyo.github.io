          <p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expected to voice their concerns about "unilateral tariff measures" at their meeting in Malaysia. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim noted that the global trading system is strained by the imposition of U.S. tariffs. ASEAN trade ministers previously decided against retaliating, a decision characterized as prudent to avoid escalating trade tensions. The leaders warn that these tariffs pose complex challenges to ASEAN's economic growth, stability, and integration, reaffirming their commitment to a multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core.</p>

          <p>Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the Robertson family and star of the reality show "Duck Dynasty," has died at the age of 79. He founded Duck Commander, a company that makes duck-call instruments used in hunting, in 1973 in Louisiana. The show, which ran from 2012 to 2017, gained immense popularity but also faced controversy, including a brief suspension for Robertson due to comments deemed offensive. Robertson's family expressed gratitude for the impact he had on many lives through his faith and desire to share the "Good News of Jesus."</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to reduce soaring prices, aiming to reach approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This action follows criticism of the government's perceived ineffectiveness in managing escalating rice prices amidst broader inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. This shift is intended to exert greater influence over prices and address public concerns about the cost of the nation's staple food.</p>

Tripadvisor utilizes a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to combat fake reviews. The company is also developing technology to detect patterns and abnormalities like submission spikes and IP address masking attempts, as well as posing as fake review brokers to catch paid reviewers.</p>

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, suggests that China should lower its annual GDP growth target for the next five years to around 4%. This recommendation considers potential protracted rivalry with the United States and the necessity to address deep-rooted structural issues within China. Xu emphasized that focusing on employment expansion and debt ratio control is crucial. This is as the market estimates annual growth of around 4.5 percent from 2026-30, he said the potential growth rate and growth target figure should be around 4 percent in the next five to 10 years, owing to China‚Äôs shrinking population, its falling savings and production rate, and other headwinds.</p>
