          <p>Broadcom reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, driven by strong growth in its semiconductor solutions and software businesses. The company's success is largely attributed to its custom chips for artificial intelligence, with AI revenue reaching $4.4 billion during the quarter. Broadcom anticipates continued growth in AI chip sales, projecting $5.1 billion in the third quarter, and expects this trend to continue through fiscal year 2026. The company's hyperscale partners are investing heavily in AI infrastructure, contributing to Broadcom's positive outlook (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws protect all employees equally, regardless of their race, gender, or sexual orientation. The justices rejected the notion that "majority group" members must provide more evidence of discrimination to win lawsuits. The ruling revives a lawsuit brought by a heterosexual woman who claimed she was discriminated against by her lesbian supervisor. This decision clarifies that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against any individual based on protected characteristics, ensuring a consistent standard for all discrimination claims.</p>

          <p>Sanford Solny, a disbarred lawyer accused of stealing homes by preying on financially struggling homeowners, has been found guilty. Prosecutors stated that Solny exploited vulnerable homeowners. He now faces a potential prison sentence of up to seven years. The verdict sends a message that those who exploit homeowners will be held accountable, but the fact that such a crime could be committed in the first place is a reflection of a darker reality.</p>
