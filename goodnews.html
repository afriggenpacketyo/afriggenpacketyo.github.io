          <h2>Ford CEO Cites Rare Earth Shortage as Reason for Factory Shutdown</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley attributed a temporary factory shutdown to a shortage of rare earth minerals, crucial components in automobile production, particularly for features like windshield wipers and seat belts. About 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals come from China, which has recently imposed export controls. Following trade discussions, the U.S. and China reached an agreement for Beijing to resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S. Ford is awaiting approval of applications with China's Ministry of Commerce to export more rare earths.</p>

          <p>As gold prices reach record highs, investors are considering strategic moves in the precious metals market. For beginners, the recommendation is to invest now rather than waiting for a dip that may not materialize, exploring fractional gold options to make the investment more accessible. Veteran investors are advised to hold steady, considering buying more to reach the recommended 10% portfolio allocation, and remembering the initial reasons for investing in gold, such as inflation protection. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to tailor strategies to individual budgets and retirement plans (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment saw an unexpected improvement in June, fueled by optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs. This surge in positive attitudes ended six months of declining sentiment. Year-ahead inflation expectations also decreased, although they remain significantly higher than current inflation levels. The improvement was observed across various demographics, including age, income, political affiliation, and geographic location. However, retailers like Walmart and Best Buy have voiced concerns about potential price increases due to remaining tariffs, and the OECD projects U.S. inflation to rise by the end of 2025 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu was defeated by Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals at Queen's, with the world number five winning 6-2, 6-4. Raducanu took a medical timeout after the first set due to back spasms, which have been a recurring issue. Despite a strong start in the second set, she couldn't maintain her lead against Zheng. Raducanu expressed that she felt the effects of playing five matches in a short period and needs to rest her back.</p>

Raducanu is probably feeling that so she need to let the back rest and see how it goes from there.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing $100,000 in home equity are weighing the costs of home equity loans versus HELOCs. Currently, rates and monthly payments for both are similar, but HELOC rates are variable and could decrease if interest rates are cut. Home equity loans provide a lump sum with immediate repayment, while HELOCs offer a revolving line of credit with interest-only payments during the draw period. Consulting a home equity lending expert can help homeowners navigate these options and determine affordability (not investment advice).</p>
