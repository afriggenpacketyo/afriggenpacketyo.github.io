          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency, is facing criticism from Republicans after projecting that Republican legislation would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade. Established in 1974, the CBO provides objective budgetary analysis to Congress, acting as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. While its cost estimates are advisory, the CBO's work is often complex, involving economists and budget analysts to calculate the budgetary impacts of proposed bills. Critics point to past inaccuracies, but defenders emphasize the difficulty of predicting future economic conditions.</p>
