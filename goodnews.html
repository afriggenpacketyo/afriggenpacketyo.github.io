          <p>Many UK newspapers are leading with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spending Review, particularly the ¬£39 billion investment in affordable housing. The Financial Times highlights this as a significant boost to social housing, while the Daily Mirror emphasizes the potential to alleviate the housing crisis. The i Paper notes Deputy PM Angela Rayner's role in advocating for the extended housing program. The Times reports the NHS may still struggle to meet waiting list targets despite a ¬£30 billion boost, and the Daily Mail criticizes the Chancellor over job losses since the last budget. The Daily Express calls for Reeves to reverse inheritance tax changes for farmers. The Guardian leads with sanctions on Israeli ministers, and the Telegraph covers Mauritius's debt repayment using funds from the UK government. </p>

This decision was influenced by the Dodgers' limited pitching resources and their focus on the next game in the series. The Padres' Dylan Cease dominated, striking out 11 Dodgers batters. </p>

          <p>Former Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, known for abolishing the death penalty in Mongolia, urged Japanese lawmakers to take the same step, despite public support for executions. He suggested the Japanese government should disclose more information about the death penalty to facilitate an open debate. Elbegdorj described the death penalty as going against the spirit of democracy and noted the danger of wrongly convicting people. He pointed to a decrease in violent crimes in Mongolia after the abolition of capital punishment. </p>
