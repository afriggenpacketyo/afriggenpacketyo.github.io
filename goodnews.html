        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss voters are heading to the polls for a second time to decide on the introduction of electronic identity cards, after rejecting a similar proposal in 2021 due to data protection concerns and private company involvement. The revised proposal ensures the new system remains entirely optional, publicly managed, and stores data on user smartphones rather than centrally, aiming to alleviate privacy fears. Supporters argue the e-IDs will significantly streamline various bureaucratic procedures, from telephone contracts to age verification, making online interactions much easier. However, opponents, who forced this referendum, still fear potential data tracking and marketing use, despite the government's recommendation for a "yes" vote and recent polls indicating increased voter acceptance.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United, despite boasting a physically imposing squad and hiring specialist set-piece coach Martin Mark from Midtjylland, has surprisingly struggled to convert set-piece opportunities into goals this season. Manager Eddie Howe acknowledges the issue, taking responsibility for the team's inability to capitalize on their height advantage and extensive tactical work, which led to success in previous seasons. The article highlights a notable shift in their approach, including a significant increase in long throws into the box, reflecting a wider trend in football. However, their conversion rate from dead-ball situations remains low compared to opponents like Arsenal, who top the league in expected goals from set-pieces, indicating Newcastle has considerable work to do to improve their score.</p>

Key players like Max Muncy and Will Smith are battling injuries, with their availability for the postseason opener uncertain, while Tommy Edman returned as a designated hitter due to an ankle issue. The article highlights the biggest uncertainties revolving around the pitching staff, particularly the bullpen, where manager Dave Roberts has indicated potential roles for Tanner Scott, Roki Sasaki, and Emmet Sheehan. The team is also considering options like Tyler Glasnow and rookie Ben Casparius for relief, as they aim to finalize a balanced roster to maximize their chances in the playoffs.</p>

This new, prominent monument marks a significant shift from the town's previous, easily overlooked plaque, acknowledging a dark chapter amid labor tensions. The article notes the town's growing recognition of its past, supported by local students and museums, even as Sweetwater County, where Rock Springs is located, renews contracts with ICE, reflecting a complex stance on immigration. Descendants of the massacre victims, many only recently learning of their family ties, have joined the commemorations, highlighting the ongoing effort to shed light on this violent history.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour Party leader, expressed confidence that his government can "pull this round" ahead of their annual conference in Liverpool, despite opinion polls suggesting Labour trails Reform UK. Facing mounting speculation of a leadership challenge from figures like Andy Burnham, Starmer renewed his attacks on Nigel Farage, accusing Reform of seeking to "tear this country apart" with divisive policies, particularly concerning immigration. He criticized Reform's proposal to abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain, arguing it would unfairly impact long-term contributors to British society, while Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood suggested tightening ILR rules. The conference is positioned as a crucial opportunity for Labour to present a patriotic alternative to "toxic divide and decline."</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has reacted with equanimity to the news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway fully divested its stake in the company earlier this year, stating that "buying and selling is completely normal." BYD executives thanked Buffett and Charlie Munger for their 17 years of investment and support, noting that Berkshire made a significant profit. Despite BYD's calm public stance, its shares fell over 6% in Hong Kong following the news, amid signs of cooling growth, including a cut in its 2025 sales target and its first quarterly profit decline in three years. Meanwhile, Berkshire continues to expand its holdings in Japanese trading houses, with stakes in Mitsui and Mitsubishi now exceeding 10%. (not investment advice)</p>

Hardy, who completed 21 missions across Europe as the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, also served with distinction in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, flying 45 and 70 combat missions respectively. Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. remembered him for his "courage, resilience, tremendous skill and dogged perseverance against racism, prejudice and other evils." Despite encountering systemic racism in the U.S., he was proud of his military service and considered his extensive education, including a bachelor's and master's degree, his greatest achievement, earning numerous honors like the Congressional Gold Medal.</p>

          <p>China's Sanxingdui Museum is actively exploring the use of immersive technology to showcase its ancient artifacts overseas, as many of its most iconic treasures are designated top national treasures forbidden from leaving the country. Yu Jian, the museum's deputy director, announced plans for an international exhibition next year, pending state approval, emphasizing how technology can overcome this hurdle. This article highlights the museum's strategy to bridge geographical distances by actively promoting digital exhibitions, high-quality replicas, and photo displays to be presented in museums worldwide. This innovative approach aims to share the rich history and profound cultural significance of Sanxingdui's archaeological finds with a global audience, leveraging modern technology to transcend physical limitations.</p>

          <p>Europe is on the brink of a seismic Ryder Cup away victory, leading the U.S. 11½-4½, despite facing a ferociously hostile crowd at Bethpage, New York. Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry secured a vital fourballs win, enduring crude personal insults and disruptions from home fans, which European captain Luke Donald deemed "crossing the line." The article details instances of fan misconduct, including an MC's expletive chant directed at McIlroy and a fist fight breaking out among spectators, leading to increased security and warnings. Despite the chaotic and intense atmosphere, McIlroy and Lowry's composure and exceptional golf performance have propelled Europe within three points of retaining the cup, aiming to seal the score on Sunday.</p>

          <p>The UK has successfully cultivated its first rice crop in east England, an ambitious trial led by ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and supported by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The crop, including varieties from Brazil and Italy, thrived during the hottest summer on record, suggesting rice could become a viable commercial crop in Britain if average temperatures continue to rise by 2-4°C. This article highlights the project's dual aim: adapting food production to climate change and tackling greenhouse gas emissions from peat soils in the Fens. By re-wetting peatlands for rice cultivation, the initiative seeks to lock away carbon dioxide, offering a potential model for sustainable farming that also addresses the significant environmental impact of the UK food system.</p>

          <h2>Indian Researchers Win Ig Nobel Prize for Study on Smelly Shoes and Shoe Rack Design</h2>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have won an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes impact the experience of using a shoe rack. Inspired by cluttered hostel corridors, their research confirmed that shoe odor, primarily caused by the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius, was the main reason for footwear being left outside. Their inventive scientific endeavor involved surveying students and conducting experiments to measure odor levels, leading to the development of a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack. This innovative design aims to sterilize shoes and eliminate odor in just 2-3 minutes, transforming a common domestic problem into a practical and delightfully oddball scientific solution that "makes people laugh, then think."</p>
