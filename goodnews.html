          <p>The article reports on the results of the Canadian federal election in 2025. Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured enough seats to form a government but failed to achieve a majority in the House of Commons. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh both lost their seats. The Liberals won key provinces like Ontario and Quebec, while the Conservatives dominated in Alberta. The article also highlights the rise in support for both major parties at the expense of smaller parties. Optimism is moderate as a government has been formed, but the lack of a majority suggests potential instability.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, prompting a response from the university asserting that there is no legal basis for such an action. Harvard argues that losing its tax-exempt status would severely impact its ability to carry out its educational mission, including providing financial aid and conducting critical research. The university spokesperson also mentioned that the government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission.</p>

          <p>This article discusses potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction as part of President Trump's tax package. The $10,000 limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, enacted in 2017, is set to expire after 2025. Lawmakers from high-tax states are pushing for a repeal or increase of the cap, which could benefit higher earners. Trump himself has expressed support for reforming the SALT deduction.
