          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 03:36:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK experienced a slight slowdown in average wage growth to 4.7% in the three months to August, down from 4.8% in July, while the unemployment rate marginally rose to 4.8%. Data from the Office for National Statistics suggests a stabilizing labor market after a period of volatility, with job vacancies falling for the 39th consecutive period. Despite private sector earnings growth being the lowest in four years, it remains ahead of inflation. Economists suggest that persistent wage growth might delay interest rate cuts by the Bank of England, though a gradual easing is anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declined to commit to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, stating "We’ll have to see" after signing a historic peace agreement ending two years of fighting in Gaza. His focus is on rebuilding Gaza post-conflict and ensuring the successful implementation of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage release. Trump's remarks came during a trip that included a global peace summit and a speech in Jerusalem, where he called for a new era of harmony in the Middle East. The agreement remains fragile, with unresolved issues concerning Gaza's postwar governance and Hamas disarmament.</p>

The flight saw the Starship upper stage reach the edge of space, while its Super Heavy booster returned for a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The upper stage then splashed down as planned in the Indian Ocean. This successful mission, following previous test failures, marks a major advancement for NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon by mid-2027 using a modified Starship.</p>

          <p>Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen secured his first postseason save in a tense 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers, despite a shaky performance that included walks and near hit-by-pitches. After a challenging season and recent playoff struggles, Treinen found some much-needed luck when a high pitch was chased for the final out. Manager Dave Roberts' continued confidence in him paid off, allowing Treinen to contribute positively to the team. This individual turnaround marks a significant moment for the pitcher and the Dodgers' bullpen.</p>

          <p>Cameron McGerr, a 16-year-old from Scotland, is campaigning for mandatory CPR training in schools after losing both his parents to heart conditions. He believes that knowing CPR earlier could have enabled him to help his father during a cardiac arrest, potentially saving his life. Having already introduced the training at his own school, Cameron's "Pulse of Life" campaign seeks to equip all Scottish pupils with these vital skills. Health groups support this initiative, noting that increased CPR confidence could significantly improve out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates.</p>

          <p>England's national football team faces a notable shortage of reliable strikers behind captain Harry Kane, a concern highlighted after injuries sidelined both Kane and his only out-and-out backup, Ollie Watkins. Only seven English players classified as out-and-out strikers have appeared in the Premier League this season, with Liam Delap being the sole player under 26. Under-21s manager Lee Carsley also expressed the need for more orthodox number nines. With England nearing World Cup qualification, the race for Kane's deputy is intensifying, posing a selection challenge for manager Thomas Tuchel.</p>

          <p>Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is intensifying his call for a targeted prostate cancer screening program in the UK, asserting its affordability, deliverability, and potential to save "countless lives." His advocacy comes as the UK National Screening Committee re-evaluates its previous decision not to recommend routine screening. Prostate Cancer Research, for which Sunak is an ambassador, proposes a program focusing on men aged 45-69 with a family history or Black men, estimating an annual cost of £25 million. While some medical experts express caution regarding potential overtreatment, Sunak argues improved MRI technology makes screening more reliable now.</p>

This initiative, a collaboration between the DVLA and NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), seeks to replicate the success of the organ donor register prompt. Hospitals require 5,000 daily donations, and the NHS continues to face blood shortages, especially for O negative blood.</p>
