          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 00:58:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese parliament has passed a law enabling preemptive cyberdefense measures, allowing the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers during peacetime to protect key infrastructure sectors. The "active cyberdefense" law mandates operators in sectors like electricity and railways to report cyber breaches. While the government is prohibited from surveilling message content, it can analyze IP addresses used in communications passing through Japan. This reflects Japan's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a decrease in exports amidst uncertainties stemming from U.S. trade policies. While domestic demand showed resilience, the overall GDP data fell short of expectations, with exports particularly affected by competition from China. Despite these challenges, Japan's top trade negotiator remains cautiously optimistic about reaching a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. and anticipates that the Bank of Japan will maintain its current monetary policy stance.</p>

          <p>Nissan is considering sharing its global plants, including the UK plant in Sunderland, with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as part of a business shakeup. The move comes as the company faces challenges including weak sales and leadership changes, prompting a cost-saving effort involving layoffs and factory closures. While Nissan has announced new car launches in Sunderland, it remains open to bringing Dongfeng into its global production ecosystem. The company recently reported an annual loss and faces pressure from tariffs.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in fishing ropes, prompting fishermen to adopt new technologies. Traditional crab fishing practices have led to numerous whale injuries and deaths, leading to regulations and shortened seasons. Fisherman Brand Little is using a high-tech pop-up system to retrieve his catch with less rope, preventing whale entanglements. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is regulating the crab fishing season to balance economic interests with protecting marine life.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Fossils of Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, show mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. Scientists found that horses undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges occurring in both directions.</p>
