          <p>Scientists are working to save Florida's dying coral reefs by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles, a species known for its rapid growth and resilience. The Florida Keys have lost 90% of their coral cover in the last 40 years due to climate change, prompting this restoration effort. The corals, spawned to maximize genetic diversity, will be planted at seven offshore sites and monitored for survival and growth.

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, a move that could end 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. The idea has drawn support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believe the firms could function better without federal oversight. However, critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren warn that privatization could disrupt the mortgage market and increase housing prices. The decision could have significant implications for homebuyers and investors, depending on how the government decides to end the conservatorship and whether it offers some form of guarantee.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study traces the sensitivity of human teeth back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her team discovered that the anatomy of these ancient fish scales is similar to that of vertebrate teeth, suggesting a shared evolutionary origin for sensing capabilities. The armor of ancient fish likely allowed them to sense their surroundings, an ability inherited by our teeth, explaining why we experience toothaches and sensitivity to temperature. This research provides insights into skeletal evolution and the reasons behind common dental discomfort.</p>

Tech companies are experimenting with AI shopping features, but they must convince consumers that their privacy is protected and that the results are accurate.
