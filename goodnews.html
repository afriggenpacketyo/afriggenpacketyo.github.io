          <p>The Wimbledon 2025 draw has set up an intriguing first-round match between British players Emma Raducanu and teenage wildcard Mimi Xu. Raducanu, ranked 38th, narrowly missed being seeded and faces a challenging path, potentially meeting world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round. The tournament features 23 British players in the singles draws, the highest number since 1984. Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and seven-time winner Novak Djokovic are also set for their campaigns beginning Monday.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reportedly agreed on a framework for a trade deal, a development confirmed by officials from both nations. While President Trump initially announced a signed deal, it was later clarified as a framework to implement a previous agreement from Geneva. The accord appears to center on easing U.S. access to rare earth minerals, crucial for high-tech manufacturing, in exchange for the U.S. canceling certain restrictive measures against China. The agreement aims to de-escalate the ongoing trade dispute that has impacted both economies.</p>

Pollock, who plays number eight, has had a remarkable season, earning the Premiership's breakthrough player award and a senior England debut.

          <p>Following significant outcry from health experts and lawmakers, the Trump administration has restored federal funding for HIV prevention and surveillance programs. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health confirmed it received nearly $20 million from the CDC, a slight increase from the previous year. The initial freeze was criticized as a reckless move that put lives at risk by threatening to dismantle essential prevention networks. Advocates had warned that the cuts could lead to a substantial increase in new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths nationwide.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's decision to order strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, known as Operation Midnight Hammer, was fully consistent with his "America First" doctrine. The author, who was in Israel during the initial conflict, frames the policy not as isolationism but as a pragmatic, Jacksonian realism that avoids nation-building while remaining willing to strike decisively to protect core U.S. interests. The article asserts that the action successfully devastated a key threat without American casualties, making it a major foreign policy achievement supported by the vast majority of MAGA Republicans.</p>

The article posits that voters across the political spectrum crave authenticity and economic populism, which establishment Democrats are failing to provide. It concludes that the party must embrace new, charismatic candidates who can genuinely connect with working-class concerns to remain relevant.</p>

          <p>Charlie English's new book, "The CIA Book Club," chronicles how the CIA used literature as a weapon against Soviet domination during the Cold War, focusing primarily on Poland's resistance. The book details the smuggling of forbidden texts like George Orwell's "1984" behind the Iron Curtain to inspire and sustain a culture of freedom. The review praises the book's thrilling narrative, which follows the efforts of underground publishers and activists who fought Communist propaganda. While the book excels as an oral history of Polish resistance, the reviewer notes it could have better explored the program's impact across the entire Eastern Bloc.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen has released "Tracks II: The Lost Albums," a massive 83-song box set of unreleased material that reframes his career, particularly his transition to 1980s superstardom and his experimental 1990s period. The collection organizes the songs into seven distinct "lost" albums, revealing a more ambivalent and artistically restless side of the musician. The review suggests the project aims to correct the record, showing Springsteen was not just a stadium rocker but a skeptical songwriter who explored diverse genres like synth-pop and country. This archival project adds significant depth to the lore of one of rock's most iconic figures.</p>

          <p>The recent conflict between Israel and Iran has highlighted the vulnerability of global energy supplies, reinforcing the argument that a transition to renewable energy is crucial for national security. Experts note that reliance on fossil fuels, often imported through volatile regions like the Strait of Hormuz, exposes nations to price shocks and supply disruptions. Homegrown renewables like wind and solar can provide a stable, affordable power source, shielding economies from geopolitical risks. While the green transition presents its own challenges, such as mineral dependencies, it is seen as a key strategy for building more resilient energy systems.</p>
