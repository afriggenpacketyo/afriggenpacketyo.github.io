          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in their neighborhoods, citing concerns about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstruction of natural light. Some projects have been scrapped due to this opposition, highlighting a conflict between tech companies and local communities. Municipalities are beginning to implement regulations to address these concerns and foster trust between businesses and residents. The Japan Data Center Council emphasizes the importance of information disclosure and community engagement.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays, as well as the consumer goods trade-in program. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, exceeding analysts' expectations, while industrial output growth slowed slightly. Fixed-asset investment expanded, but property investment continued to contract. The urban unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since November, and the trade-in program has generated significant sales this year.</p>
