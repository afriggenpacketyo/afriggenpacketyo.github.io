        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to conventional wisdom that looming tariffs will harm the stock market, this analysis argues that multiple positive factors are providing strong support. These tailwinds include excellent corporate earnings, the economic stimulus from President Trump's "big beautiful bill" which benefits consumers, and significant tax relief for businesses that encourages spending and investment. Additionally, massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the electric grid, a renaissance in the U.S. energy sector, and a robust IPO market are creating jobs and wealth. The article suggests these fundamental strengths will likely outweigh the drama surrounding trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ predicts that the technology will cross the threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the company produces both small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and larger, industrial-grade superconducting systems. SpinQ's founder, Xiang Jingen, compares the current state of quantum computing to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, acknowledging that significant development is still required for broad application. The company has already sold its range of quantum products to over 50 countries, positioning itself as a key player in the race to commercialize this transformative technology.</p>

          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler has won his first British Open, securing the victory with a dominant performance at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. The 29-year-old finished four strokes ahead of his closest competitor, Harris English, ending the tournament at 17-under par. This marks Scheffler's second major championship win of 2025 and his fourth major title overall, placing him in an elite group with Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Tiger Woods as the only players to win The Open, the Masters, and the PGA Championship before turning 30. The victory leaves him only a U.S. Open title away from completing the career Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry will be held into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners at the Orgreave coking plant, a pivotal event during the year-long miners' strike. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had unanswered questions for over 40 years about the incident, which left over 100 people injured. The inquiry will examine the events of the day and the subsequent failed prosecutions of 95 miners, which collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the decision to finally investigate the controversial episode.</p>

          <p>Mezcal, once overshadowed by tequila, has emerged as a globally sought-after spirit, driving a boom for family-owned distilleries in Oaxaca, Mexico. The handcrafted spirit, made from roasted agave, has seen a dramatic increase in production over the past decade, transforming the lives of multi-generational mezcaleros who preserve traditional, labor-intensive methods. Families like the Hernandez brothers, who once struggled to sell their product for less than a dollar per liter, now run thriving businesses exporting thousands of bottles daily. This surge in popularity, fueled by a growing appreciation for artisanal products, has turned mezcal into a half-billion-dollar industry, attracting international investment from companies like Bacardi.</p>

Designed to guide students to answers through Socratic questioning rather than providing them directly, the tool assists with homework, writing, and lesson planning. A unique feature allows teachers to monitor student interactions with the AI, which has raised some privacy concerns among students. However, this oversight has also proven to be a critical safety net, as the system can flag conversations indicating emotional distress or self-harm, enabling timely intervention from school counselors and potentially saving lives.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's recent victory at The Open has solidified his position as the most dominant force in men's golf since Tiger Woods, prompting widespread comparisons between the two. In the last four seasons, Scheffler has won four majors and secured 13 PGA Tour victories, a run that mirrors the early success of Woods. While Scheffler himself calls the comparisons "silly," his peers and analysts point to his machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments as "Tiger-like." A key factor in his recent dominance has been a significant improvement in his putting after switching to a claw grip, transforming a previous weakness into a reliable strength.</p>

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin issued a lighthearted warning to his audience in Wisconsin before the band's "Jumbotron Song," advising them to do their makeup because the cameras would soon be on them. This comes after a recent concert where the jumbotron captured a man and woman, later identified as the CEO and HR head of tech company Astronomer, cuddling in the crowd, who then quickly separated. The viral moment led to an internal investigation and the CEO's resignation. Martin's pre-song banter appeared to be a subtle acknowledgment of the incident that has since spawned numerous internet memes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert and researcher argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or sadness with phrases like "you're okay," can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. Cultivating self-connection builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and supports authentic confidence and mental health. The author provides practical tips, such as validating emotions, modeling self-awareness, and looking for the needs behind a child's behavior, to help parents strengthen this essential life skill.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded Better Angels, a nonprofit aiming to prove that affordable and homeless housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. With a $300 million investment fund, the initiative is bidding on several large projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to provide its own equity and use conventional loans to build faster and at a fraction of the cost of typical government-funded projects. While its proposed rents are higher than those in subsidized housing, the model aims to attract private capital to the affordable housing sector. The goal is to create a new, scalable solution to the housing crisis by making it a viable market for for-profit developers.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to create a new water ombudsman to serve as a single point of contact for consumer complaints regarding issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and pollution. This initiative is part of a larger overhaul of the water industry, which faces intense public scrutiny over rising bills and record-high sewage discharges into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has vowed to halve sewage spills by 2030. The new watchdog will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes, bringing the water sector's consumer protection in line with other utilities like energy and telecommunications.</p>
