        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, the article argues that AI is not yet capable of replacing human workers in most industries. A recent survey revealed that many businesses that laid off employees expecting AI to take over their roles now regret the decision. The technology is still immature, expensive to implement effectively, and raises concerns about data privacy. While AI offers enhanced search capabilities and can assist with certain tasks, it lacks the reliability and decision-making abilities required for core business operations, suggesting that widespread job replacement by AI remains a long way off.</p>
