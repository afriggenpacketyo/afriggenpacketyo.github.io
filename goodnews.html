          <p>A Harvard graduate student, Fangzhou Jiang, expressed concerns about the uncertainty faced by international students due to the Trump administration's actions targeting international enrollment. Jiang described a "devastating" atmosphere on campus, with students worried about their ability to remain in the United States. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration's attempts to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, providing temporary relief. The Trump administration has also frozen federal funding to Harvard and expressed interest in revoking the university's tax-exempt status, escalating tensions further. The student remains confident that the university will be able to provide measures to help international students finish their education at Harvard.</p>

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate eased to 2.1% in May, according to preliminary data from Destatis, nearing the European Central Bank's 2% target but slightly exceeding analyst estimates. Core inflation dipped slightly, while services inflation eased sharply, and energy prices fell for the second consecutive month. Despite ongoing uncertainty about Germany's economic outlook due to domestic and global issues, the consumer price index has been closing in on the ECB's target. The ECB is scheduled to make its next interest rate decision on June 5, with traders anticipating a quarter-point interest rate reduction, potentially impacting the broader European economy.

          <p>Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of a nearly 3,000-year-old Mayan city in northern Guatemala, revealing pyramids and monuments indicating its importance as a ceremonial site. The city, named "Los Abuelos," dates back to the Middle Preclassic period and is believed to have been one of the most ancient and important ceremonial centers of the Mayan civilization. The site features remarkable architectural planning, including pyramids, monuments sculpted with unique iconography, and a unique canal system. This discovery provides new insights into the ceremonial and socio-political organization of pre-Hispanic Peten, enhancing our understanding of Mayan civilization.</p>

          <p>Erica Benner, a political philosopher, challenges the popular view of Machiavelli as a proponent of ruthless pragmatism, suggesting that his famous work, *The Prince*, is a satirical critique of authoritarian power. She argues that Machiavelli was a republican who believed in shared power and warned against the dangers of inequality and partisanship. Benner suggests that Machiavelli's writings offer insights into contemporary politics, particularly regarding the fragility of democracies and the importance of appearance over truth. Machiavelli‚Äôs work encourages a study of human nature to develop a human morality that fosters coexistence.</p>

          <p>Christina Ramberg's art explores the contradictions of femininity through paintings that focus on the artifice of the female body and the ways women construct themselves. Her work, which emerged in the late 1960s, features torsos in corsets, feet in high heels, and intricately arranged hairstyles, often cropped and depersonalized. Ramberg's paintings delve into the interplay between unruly and taming forces, reflecting the consumer products that divide women's bodies into conquerable parts. The artist's exploration of hidden desires and the constraints of the domestic realm offers a unique perspective on the complexities of female identity and self-presentation.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan effort is underway in the US to make childbirth free by requiring private insurance companies to fully cover all childbirth-related expenses without co-pays or deductibles. The Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies Act, introduced in the Senate, has garnered support from both Republican and Democratic senators, as well as organizations on opposite sides of reproductive health debates. This legislation aims to alleviate the financial burden of giving birth, which averages nearly $3,000 out-of-pocket for privately insured families.

          <p>Japan's government announced that China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, which were previously banned following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Chinese authorities are expected to issue a public notice easing the ban, which has been in place since August 2023. The reopening of registration for Japanese facilities that process and preserve marine products is anticipated soon, potentially boosting Japan's seafood industry. This development marks a significant step in normalizing trade relations between the two countries.</p>
