          <p>Sir Tom Farmer, the Edinburgh-born entrepreneur who founded the Kwik Fit garage chain, has died peacefully at his home at the age of 84. Farmer established Kwik Fit in 1971 and grew it into the world's largest independent tire and automotive chain, eventually selling it to Ford for ¬£1 billion in 1999. Beyond his business achievements, Sir Tom was also known for his philanthropy, public service, and dedication to the communities where he lived, including owning a majority stake in Hibernian FC for over two decades. His career significantly impacted both Scottish and UK life, and he was knighted in 1997.</p>

          <h2>Tesla's Price Cuts Could Reshape the EV Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 07:02:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's recent price cuts are creating significant ripples in the electric vehicle market, potentially accelerating EV adoption by making models like the Model Y more competitive with mid-level gas-powered SUVs. This shift is also impacting the used EV market, where prices are dropping, and putting pressure on traditional automakers to rethink their EV strategies. Tesla appears to be prioritizing market share over short-term profits, aligning with Elon Musk's long-term vision of making EVs accessible to a wider audience and building a larger ecosystem around software subscriptions and charging solutions. This strategy could lead to significant changes in the industry as other companies struggle to compete on price alone.</p>

          <h2>New Bill Aims to Ease Research Restrictions on Cannabis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 07:00:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances in the United States. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the bill, which would allow research to catch up with increasing cannabis consumption by repealing sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that restrict federal funding for research on schedule I substances. Experts suggest that the bill, if passed, could help policymakers craft more effective and informed legislation regarding cannabis, addressing questions about medical use, appropriate doses, and long-term impacts of different consumption methods.</p>

          <p>European officials are analyzing the recently announced trade deal between the United States and Britain for clues on how President Trump may pressure them to adopt stricter policies regarding China. The agreement includes language on forced labor, data security, economic security, and investment bans, interpreted as allusions to China's role in supply chains. The deal seeks to align Britain with US requirements on steel and aluminum supply chains, potentially impacting Chinese ownership in the industry. Experts suggest that this China-focused approach may become a recurring theme as countries seek to avoid tariffs.</p>

          <h2>Two Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Now</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett, who is planning to retire this year, has delivered a return of over 5,000,000% to long-term investors through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Two Berkshire-backed stocks, Amazon and BYD, are considered excellent buys due to their deep economic moats. Amazon's size creates a positive feedback loop, while BYD's edge comes from vertical integration, allowing it to control its supply chain and scale up production. While Amazon could face some challenges from the Trump administration's new tariffs on imported goods, its 3rd party business model can shift the impact mostly to sellers on the marketplace.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 on a failed mission to Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean. The spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War space race, had been orbiting Earth for 53 years after a rocket booster malfunctioned. Its return serves as a reminder of the Soviet Union's ambitious space program and its focus on Venus, while the United States focused on the moon and Mars. The article highlights the technological challenges of exploring Venus and the legacy of the Soviet Venera program, which achieved several firsts in planetary exploration.</p>
