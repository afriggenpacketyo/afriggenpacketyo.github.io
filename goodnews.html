          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 08:29:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is debating whether to reverse its decision to cut winter fuel payments for over nine million pensioners, a move initiated last year by Chancellor Rachel Reeves to save ¬£1.4 billion. This policy change, restricting payments to those qualifying for pension credit, is now under review due to concerns about its political impact, particularly after recent local election losses. While abandoning the policy entirely is less likely, adjusting income thresholds for eligibility is being considered, with an announcement potentially coming during the upcoming spending review. The situation highlights the government's struggle to balance fiscal responsibility with political considerations amidst growing public concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted a stop-work order on Equinor's Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm in New York, allowing construction to resume. The project, which will deliver electricity directly to New York City, had been halted due to concerns raised by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum about the project's approval process. Governor Kathy Hochul stated that the decision came after discussions with Equinor and White House officials, with Burgum noting Hochul's willingness to address pipeline capacity. This decision signals a compromise between renewable energy and natural gas interests, despite Trump's previous opposition to wind energy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is considering subsidizing electricity for industrial companies to alleviate high energy costs, a move welcomed by industry leaders but criticized by experts who fear it could destabilize the market and hinder climate goals. The proposed plan involves lowering electricity taxes, surcharges, and grid fees to reduce prices by 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. While proponents argue it will help German industries compete with the US and China, critics contend it may reduce incentives for energy efficiency and contradict the needs of a renewable energy system. The EU's state aid rules and the potential for unintended consequences are also raising concerns.</p>

          <p>Shares of CATL, the world‚Äôs largest electric car battery maker, surged in its Hong Kong trading debut, but U.S. onshore investors were barred from participating due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. The exclusion of American investors from this major IPO underscores the deepening financial decoupling between the two nations, as CATL has been labeled a Chinese military company and faces tariffs. While most large American institutions can still trade through offshore accounts, the move signals a potential trend of limiting U.S. investor access to Chinese tech companies.</p>

The company missed first-quarter earnings expectations but beat sales estimates, with McPhail noting improving sales trends throughout the quarter.</p>
