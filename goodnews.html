          <p>An excerpt from Tim Curry's forthcoming memoir, "Vagabond," reflects on his life as a performer and the nature of identity, particularly after his iconic role in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." Curry recounts a surreal experience of being called an imposter at a screening of the film, highlighting the disconnect between his public persona and his private self. He embraces the label of a "vagabond," describing it as a restless, adaptive way of life shaped by an itinerant upbringing and a career of playing varied roles, while also touching on the 2012 stroke that profoundly changed his life.</p>

          <p>Following over a week of intense and deadly fighting, Pakistan and the Taliban-led government of Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace after clashes along their shared border resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. The conflict had escalated after the Taliban accused Pakistan of conducting attacks in Kabul. Under the new deal, both parties have committed to ending hostile actions and refraining from targeting security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Following a recent policy speech by Taiwanese President William Lai, whom Beijing has labeled a "troublemaker," there have been no major military exercises conducted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) near the island. According to Taiwanese defense figures, PLA activity in the week after the speech was relatively low, with daily sorties ranging from seven to twenty-seven. This is a notable decrease compared to previous large-scale drills, such as one in April that involved 76 sorties, which Beijing described as a "serious warning" to pro-independence forces in Taiwan.</p>

She also highlights feeling safer in public spaces in Spain due to stricter gun laws, the absence of pervasive tipping culture, and less extreme political polarization. Finally, she appreciates the reduced societal pressure to follow a traditional life timeline of marriage and children, which she felt strongly in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a plan to create 400,000 additional jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030, aiming to double the workforce in renewables, nuclear, and other green industries. The strategy prioritizes training for roles like plumbers, electricians, and welders and includes establishing five new "technical excellence colleges" to develop necessary skills. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative is crucial for lowering energy bills long-term and creating well-paid, secure jobs in industrial heartlands, though the opposition criticized the current high cost of electricity under existing net-zero policies.</p>

          <p>A commentary praises two federal district court judges for blocking President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago, challenging his administration's justifications as factually unsupported. Judge Karin Immergut in Portland found the rationale for sending troops was "untethered to the facts," while Judge April Perry in Chicago found no credible evidence of a rebellion that would necessitate military intervention. The article contrasts their actions with what it describes as the Supreme Court's deference to Trump, urging the high court to be more critical of the executive's claims.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he did not confirm any decision ahead of the November Budget, he acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The potential tax cut comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs, with Miliband reiterating a pledge to reduce average bills by £300 by 2030 through a transition to home-grown clean energy.</p>

This sustained growth, he argued, would establish a solid foundation for the nation to achieve its 2035 goal of "socialist modernization."

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, beneficiaries are advised to carefully compare their coverage options, as plans and costs can change significantly year-to-year. Experts suggest that while the ongoing government shutdown should not halt the process, it may cause delays in accessing information from official channels like the 1-800-Medicare hotline. It is crucial for individuals to review their Medicare Advantage or Part D prescription drug plans to ensure their doctors and medications will still be covered at an affordable cost in the coming year, and to wait until the government reopens before finalizing decisions.</p>
