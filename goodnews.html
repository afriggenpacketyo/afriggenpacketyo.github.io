          <h2>Federal Judge Upholds Colorado Law Restricting Gun Sales to Those 21 and Older</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 10:27:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has upheld a Colorado law that bans individuals under 21 from purchasing firearms, siding with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit's view that age-based restrictions on gun purchases do not violate the Second Amendment. The lawsuit against Gov. Jared Polis was filed by Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and two individuals seeking to buy firearms, but the judge agreed that the issue falls under a "safe harbor" exclusion, exempting it from constitutional scrutiny. Exceptions to the law are made for members of the U.S. Military and peace officers making purchases while on duty and in accordance with their agency's policies. This decision contrasts with a ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which struck down a similar federal restriction. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of south Wales, predicting potential rainfall of 10-15mm in less than an hour in some areas.

The weather agency cautioned that the heavy showers could disrupt transport, potentially causing delays to driving and train services, and may lead to short-term power outages and damage to buildings from lightning strikes.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's recent meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington was largely overshadowed by the public spat between Trump and Elon Musk. Despite the distraction, the visit was considered a success for Merz, who managed to address key issues such as strengthening U.S.-German relations, tariffs impacting German industries, and U.S. support for Ukraine. Merz also gifted Trump his grandfather's birth certificate to highlight the president's family connection to Germany, and emphasized Germany's commitment to increased defense spending. The sensitive topic of Germany's far-right party, the Alternative fuer Deutschland, was seemingly avoided during the meeting. The optimism score is 75.</p>
