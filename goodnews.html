          <p>Pixar is releasing "Elio," an original animated film, amid challenges in the animation industry, where sequels have been more successful than original stories since the pandemic. Despite critical acclaim, some of Pixar's original movies have struggled at the box office, leading to a commitment to balance original stories with sequels. Pixar plans to release three movies every two years, with one original for every sequel, and executives emphasize the importance of original stories for the industry's future. The studio aims to create lasting stories that contribute to various aspects of the Disney empire, including streaming and merchandise.</p>

          <p>Mark Walter, the chairman of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is reportedly set to acquire a majority ownership stake in the Los Angeles Lakers, valuing the franchise at $10 billion. The sale would mark a new record for NBA valuations, and Jeanie Buss will retain a minority stake and her position as governor of the team. Walter's ownership group, TWGC Global, purchased the Dodgers in 2012 and has since overseen a period of sustained success. The move signals a potential shift in the Lakers' organizational approach, with expectations of increased investment in infrastructure and personnel.</p>

          <p>President Trump has granted a further 90-day extension for the sale of TikTok in the US, pushing the deadline to September 17. The video-sharing app has faced scrutiny over national security concerns, with a law requiring its ban unless sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Trump, who previously vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of the law for a third time. The White House said the extension would ensure the deal is closed, safeguarding American users' data.</p>

Swimming has been shown to boost moods, and the pressure of the water combined with the release of gravity has unique benefits for our brains. The author suggests building parks with swimming pools as one way to keep urban workers from fleeing to the suburbs.
