          <p>Canada has announced it will rescind its planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies, a move aimed at restarting stalled trade talks with the United States. The decision came after President Trump threatened to terminate all trade negotiations, calling the tax a "blatant attack." The 3% tax would have affected revenues of tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta, and was set to be collected just as Canada announced its reversal. This climbdown is seen as a crucial step toward de-escalating trade tensions and focusing on a new comprehensive economic partnership between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than a standard flu shot in a late-stage trial. These positive results are a significant milestone, paving the way for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone flu vaccine and its combination flu-and-COVID-19 shot. The company had previously withdrawn its application for the combination vaccine but plans to resubmit it with the new efficacy data later this year. If approved, the combination shot could simplify vaccination, reduce healthcare system burdens, and position Moderna as a leader in the market.</p>

During prayer celebrations, he stated that a framework would exist to discuss its continuation, a shift from previous suggestions that he might be the final Dalai Lama. The succession is a point of major contention with China, which views him as a separatist and intends to control the selection of his successor. The Dalai Lama has previously indicated that his reincarnation could be found outside of Tibet, possibly in India, and has urged followers to reject any candidate chosen by Beijing.</p>

This agreement represents a long-term investment in a transformative technology that aims to generate zero-carbon electricity by replicating the process that powers the sun.

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate fell unexpectedly to 2.0% in June, according to preliminary data, bringing Europe's largest economy in line with the European Central Bank's target for the first time in years. This development provides positive news for the ECB, suggesting that its monetary policy has been effective in taming price pressures across the eurozone. However, analysts caution that persistent service inflation and volatile energy prices remain potential risks to this disinflationary trend. The data may support the case for one final interest rate cut by the ECB later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the agreement notably excludes steel and aluminum, which remain subject to a 25% tariff that could double if a separate deal is not reached by a July 9 deadline.

          <p>A new historical analysis argues that while the U.S. has often viewed itself as a democratic guide for Latin America, the region's own political traditions may now offer lessons for the United States. In his book "America, Am√©rica," historian Greg Grandin explores how many Latin American independence movements and constitutions were deeply rooted in collective social ideals, such as abolishing slavery and guaranteeing social welfare, concepts not central to the U.S. Constitution. As the U.S. grapples with its own democratic instability and the rise of authoritarian politics, the region's long history of social movements grounded in the common good provides an alternative model.</p>
