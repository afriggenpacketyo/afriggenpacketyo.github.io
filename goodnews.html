          <p>China aims to include civil aviation, particularly the certification of the C919 aircraft, in discussions at the upcoming summit with European Union leaders in July, according to sources. High-level negotiations on safety evaluation could expedite the airliner's ratification, potentially influenced by a rumored large Airbus order from Beijing. The summit presents an opportunity for leaders to review progress and strengthen consensus at working levels to benefit real work. Direct talks between top leaders could be helpful for certification, and consensus can enhance and benefit real work, which would be seen as a win for China.</p>

          <p>Asia is increasingly reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, with ASEAN committing to boost local currency use in trade and investment.

Investors and officials recognize the dollar's potential use as leverage in trade negotiations, leading to re-evaluation of U.S. dollar portfolios. De-dollarization is viewed as an ongoing, slow process, but is gaining momentum as Asian economies seek to reduce reliance on the greenback to reduce FX risks. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump had previously declared their relationship over, stating he had no interest in mending ties with Musk, but Musk's recent statement may signal a shift in their dynamic.</p>

Despite the recovery of international tourism, travel between the two countries lags, partly due to anxieties among Japanese citizens about visiting China. Relations are complicated by historical issues, territorial disputes, and China's import ban on Japanese seafood after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant water release.

Both works will be performed at the Bachfest in Leipzig, fitting the festival's theme of "Transformation."

          <p>A Taiwanese YouTuber, Holger Chen Chih-han, is live-streaming his visit to Shanghai, urging fellow Taiwanese to experience life in mainland China firsthand. Chen, once a critic of Beijing, now describes Shanghai as a "super first-rate city" and aims to challenge entrenched political narratives in Taiwan. He said his perceptions shifted after observing mainland China through social media, revealing a gap between online reality and official messaging in Taiwan. Chen's tour seeks to provide an unfiltered glimpse into mainland Chinese society, and he encourages Taiwanese people to visit Shanghai and see the city for themselves.</p>
