          <p>Australian stocks experienced a decline following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian prime minister has secured a second consecutive term. Meanwhile, most other Asian markets remained closed for holidays, and India's benchmark indices saw gains. Additionally, representatives for Gautam Adani reportedly engaged in talks with the Trump administration regarding the criminal charges against him in an overseas bribery probe. In Indonesia, economic growth slowed to 4.87% year-on-year in the first quarter, falling short of economists' expectations.</p>

          <p>The finance ministers of ASEAN nations, Japan, China, and South Korea cautioned about the potential global economic fallout from protectionist trade policies, following the U.S. announcement of higher import tariffs. They highlighted that escalating trade protectionism could fragment global trade, affecting investment and capital flows. Separately, Japan and India are expected to deepen defense cooperation amid China's growing military presence. Japan also stated it would not use its U.S. bond holdings as leverage in trade talks, and the country's 2024 development aid is projected to rank fourth in the OECD.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genomic study by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the familiar association of roses with the color red. The study examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that the common ancestor of roses probably had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are known as the 'queen of flowers' and have been regarded as a symbol of love and beauty from antiquity to modern times.</p>

          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, and has developed an edge in disseminating, commercializing, and manufacturing tech. They point to the rise of Chinese AI models like DeepSeek, which are approaching or surpassing U.S. versions in some benchmarks, and the global popularity of Chinese apps like TikTok and Temu. The authors emphasize the need for the United States to openly share more of its AI technologies and research, innovate faster, and double down on diffusing AI throughout the economy to compete effectively with China.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was mainly due to the yen's depreciation and a contrast with the sharp increases in 2022 and 2023. Despite the decline, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence, although it faces a tight fiscal situation.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey revealed that the biggest inconvenience for visitors to Japan is the lack of trash bins in public areas, including train stations. Many visitors reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodation due to the scarcity of bins. While the figure improved from the previous year, the issue remains a concern. The removal of trash bins in public spaces is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks, but it has led to increased littering in tourist spots.</p>
