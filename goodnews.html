          <p>Taylor Swift has announced her upcoming 12th studio album, titled "The Life of a Showgirl," scheduled for release on October 3. Appearing on the "New Heights" podcast with Travis and Jason Kelce, Swift revealed the album was created with producers Max Martin and Shellback during the European leg of her Eras Tour. She described the 12-track album as focused and joyful, exploring the behind-the-scenes aspects of her life during the tour. Travis Kelce, who has heard the album, described it as more upbeat and pop-oriented compared to her recent work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at MIT have utilized generative artificial intelligence to design two entirely new potential antibiotics capable of killing drug-resistant superbugs like gonorrhoea and MRSA. The AI analyzed millions of chemical compounds to learn how molecular structures affect bacteria, then generated novel designs from scratch. These new drugs proved effective in laboratory and animal tests, though they still require years of refinement and clinical trials before human use. The breakthrough suggests that AI could herald a new era in antibiotic discovery, addressing the growing global threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

          <p>A-level results in the UK show a slight increase in top grades, with 28.3% of entries marked A* or A, while a record number of 18-year-olds have been accepted into their first-choice university. This year's student cohort is considered smaller but academically stronger due to the post-pandemic return to standard grading. The most selective universities saw the steepest growth in acceptances, potentially to offset a decline in higher-paying international students. However, a widening regional gap in England remains a concern, with London students achieving significantly more top grades than those in the North East.</p>

          <p>Swiss eco-adventurer Raphael Domjan has broken the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane, reaching 9,521 meters (31,237 feet) in a flight over Switzerland. The SolarStratos plane, made of lightweight carbon fiber, utilized warm air thermals to surpass the 15-year-old record. During the flight, Domjan crossed paths with a commercial airliner, a moment his team described as a powerful symbol for the future of decarbonized aviation. The mission's ultimate goal is to achieve the first manned solar-powered flight into the stratosphere, demonstrating the potential of renewable energy in aviation.</p>

          <p>A years-long federal investigation that began with a minor car accident in a small Tennessee town has resulted in indictments against five leaders of the United Cartels, a major Mexican drug organization. The initial incident led investigators through wiretaps and surveillance to a large drug trafficking network, culminating in the seizure of 850 kilograms of methamphetamine hidden in a tractor-trailer. The U.S. government is now offering rewards up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of the cartel leaders. The case highlights the extensive reach of cartels into American communities.</p>

          <h2>Rabbits with Hornlike Growths in Colorado Caused by Common, Harmless Virus</h2>

          <p>Recent sightings of cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, with large, hornlike warts on their faces have caused public alarm, but wildlife officials assure there is no danger. The growths are caused by the Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless disease spread by ticks and fleas in the summer. The virus, which cannot be transmitted to humans or other animals, is believed to have inspired the folklore of the jackalope. The growths typically do not harm the rabbits unless they obstruct their ability to see or eat, and their immune systems can eventually fight off the virus.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 13-year-old pupil from Glasgow, has been named one of TIME magazine's 'Girls of the Year' for inventing a solar-powered heated blanket to help homeless people. She developed the idea at a school engineering club, and the concept was turned into a working prototype by the firm Thales. Thirty-five of the blankets have been distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, which is run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was also turned into one of the company's iconic mini-figures, recognized for turning her imagination into real-world impact.</p>

          <p>A woman from Manhattan, New York, discovered a 2.30-carat colorless diamond during a visit to Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park. Micherre Fox had embarked on a month-long hunt at the park, which is the only place in the world where the public can search for diamonds at their original volcanic source. She found the gem on her last day and plans to use it for her engagement ring, fulfilling a personal goal to find her own diamond as a symbol of hard work and commitment. The park confirmed it was the third-largest diamond found there this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to a new estimate from the Senior Citizens League. This would be a slight increase from the 2.5% boost implemented in 2025. The official COLA, which is designed to help benefits keep pace with inflation, will be announced by the Social Security Administration in October after reviewing inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively stable, some economists worry that a modest COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cisco reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that slightly surpassed analysts' expectations, with revenue growing 7.6% year over year. The networking giant also issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming quarter and full fiscal year, signaling strong continued demand. CEO Chuck Robbins highlighted significant growth in AI-related infrastructure orders, which reached $800 million in the quarter and over $2 billion for the fiscal year, more than doubling the company's goal. The positive results indicate that Cisco is successfully capitalizing on the investment boom in artificial intelligence infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a break from tradition, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will be the first to allow corporate naming rights for its venues. The agreement between the LA28 organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) abandons the long-standing "clean venue" policy that prohibited commercial names. This change will generate additional revenue to help cover the privately funded event's $7.1 billion budget and will simplify logistics by allowing well-known venues to retain their existing names. While venue exteriors can feature sponsor branding, the actual fields of play will remain commercial-free.</p>

          <p>Over the past month, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have repeatedly hit record highs as investors processed quarterly earnings and shifting expectations for Federal Reserve policy. Among the top performers in the CNBC Investing Club's portfolio was GE Vernova, which surged 17.6% after a strong earnings report and raised guidance driven by demand from AI data centers. Conversely, Eli Lilly was the biggest laggard, falling 16.7% following disappointing results from a late-stage trial for its weight loss pill.
