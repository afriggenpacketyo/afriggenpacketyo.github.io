          <p>Universal has submitted planning documents for a new theme park in Bedford, UK, that could include rides up to 115 meters (377ft) high, potentially making them the tallest in Europe. The company is seeking a special development order to bypass local planning procedures and aims to compete with other major European attractions by building taller rides on a constrained land area. The proposal includes hotels, extensive parking, and significant transport infrastructure upgrades, such as a new A421 junction and an expanded Wixams train station, with a target opening date of 2031. The park anticipates 8.5 million annual visitors and the creation of 8,500 local jobs upon opening.</p>

          <p>The band Wet Leg is preparing to release their sophomore album, "Moisturizer," marking a significant evolution in both their sound and visual style since their Grammy-winning debut. Lead singer Rhian Teasdale discusses her shift away from a more covered-up, bohemian look, reflecting a newfound comfort and a desire for more authentic self-expression. The new album is described as more sonically expressive and raw, heavily influenced by Teasdale's experience of falling deeply in love and moving beyond heteronormative songwriting themes. The band, which rose meteorically from the Isle of Wight, is excited to tour the new material, which they feel was made to be played live.</p>

          <p>Cape Verde is celebrating its 50th anniversary of independence, reflecting on five decades of significant progress, particularly in education and healthcare. Once plagued by high illiteracy, the nation now boasts a literacy rate of about 97%, and its healthcare system has expanded from just two hospitals to a network serving all islands. Despite these gains, challenges such as youth unemployment and migration persist, with about 6% of the young population leaving between 2009 and 2021. Nevertheless, Cape Verde is recognized as one of Africa's most stable and developed countries, with a high life expectancy and strong development indicators.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated he is confident about his future with the team amidst speculation linking four-time world champion Max Verstappen to a potential move from Red Bull. Although Russell's contract is up at the end of the season, he expressed that the likelihood of him not being at Mercedes next year is "exceptionally low." Team boss Toto Wolff has acknowledged speaking with Verstappen's representatives but indicated Russell's return is more probable. Russell emphasized his strong performance, including a recent win and his record against former teammate Lewis Hamilton, as the basis for his security in his position.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market continued to show resilience in June, with employers adding 147,000 jobs, surpassing economists' expectations. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was largely driven by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, which accounted for about half of the total gains. While the report indicates a solid job market, economists anticipate a slowdown in the second half of the year due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade and fiscal policy, including potential impacts from tariffs.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of current interest rates shows that a high-yield savings account would nominally earn slightly more than a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) on a $10,000 deposit over periods of 18 months to three years. However, this calculation assumes that the variable rate on the savings account remains constant. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates soon, the fixed rate of a CD could prove more profitable in the long run. Savers must weigh the higher potential earnings and liquidity of a savings account against the guaranteed, stable return of a CD in a shifting rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. tech IPO market showed signs of life in June, with five offerings, including a sixfold surge in crypto company Circle's stock, sparking optimism among venture capitalists after a multi-year drought. Since early 2022, rising interest rates and regulatory scrutiny had stifled the exit market, creating a "backlog of liquidity" and pressure on VCs to return capital to investors. While the recent activity is encouraging, the market remains cautious, as many high-profile private companies are still on the sidelines and geopolitical uncertainty persists. The performance of this new crop of public companies will be closely watched. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer views the strong June jobs report as a validation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's decision to hold off on interest rate cuts, despite pressure from President Trump. With better-than-expected payroll growth and a lower unemployment rate, Cramer argues there is no data to justify an immediate rate cut. He also noted that the stock market has become overbought, suggesting it may be a good time for investors to consider trimming profits from high-performing stocks. Cramer specifically mentioned Broadcom and some bank stocks like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo as potential candidates for profit-taking. (not investment advice)</p>
