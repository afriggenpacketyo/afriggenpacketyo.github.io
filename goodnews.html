          <h2>German Defense Firm Renk Seeks Auto Sector Talent Amid Scaling Up</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tank parts maker Renk is looking to hire workers from the struggling auto sector as it scales up production amid rising geopolitical tensions and military spending. Germany's historic fiscal package enabled a steep increase in defense spending, and Renk's stock has risen over 300% this year. The company is collaborating with the automotive industry, which faces difficulties due to a sluggish economy and increased competition. The move is seen as an opportunity to address overcapacity in the auto industry while bolstering the defense sector, potentially creating jobs and upgrading Germany as a production location.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that an emergency law does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, but if unsuccessful, businesses who have paid tariffs will receive refunds with interest. The ruling gave the White House 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs, although most are currently suspended anyway.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by increased demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota stated it would not pass on the tariff costs to consumers, analysts believe the company will face pressure to do so if the higher tariffs remain long-term. The automaker expects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year through March due to the tariff measures and a stronger yen (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that increased purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit, potentially serving as a bargaining chip in tariff negotiations with the United States. While acknowledging that tariff negotiations and security matters are based on different standards, the negotiator indicated the possibility of including defense purchases in the talks. Japan has requested the removal of higher tariffs on key automotive components and steel, but the U.S. has resisted complete removal. Japan is hoping to schedule a summit between its Prime Minister and President Donald Trump to discuss the issue (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked reciprocal tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Donald Trump on scores of countries in April.

          <p>California avocado growers report that Mexican imports have surprisingly helped their sales by allowing for a year-round supply, fostering increased demand for avocados in the United States. The amount of avocados available per person has tripled since 2000, with avocado toast and guacamole becoming regular offerings nationwide. Despite potential risks from wildfires, growers are replanting avocado trees, confident that Americans' hunger for the fruit will continue to grow. California farmers account for nearly all of the country's domestic avocado production, growing the fruit from April through September, while Mexican imports arrive year-round to meet nationwide demand.</p>

          <p>CBS has secured a legal victory allowing them to continue distributing Sony's "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" during an ongoing lawsuit appeal. A Los Angeles judge had previously ruled that Sony was no longer obligated to provide episodes to CBS, but the network appealed. The appellate court granted CBS' request to keep the stay in place, enabling them to continue distribution duties during the appeal process. CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties, while Sony claims CBS entered into unauthorized licensing deals and paid itself a commission.</p>

The order, extending to Ukrainians, Afghans, and military members, requires the government to restart processing applications for migrants renewing their status. The judge ruled that the administration‚Äôs termination of these programs was likely unlawful and could cause discord across the country. The decision is a victory for civil and immigrant rights groups challenging the administration's efforts to strip legal status from various groups.</p>

The company's stock rose in extended trading, despite a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the current quarter due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is "effectively closed to U.S. industry" due to the export ban. Despite this, Nvidia's growth continues, fueled by demand for its AI chips used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT (not investment advice).</p>

The projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire have been declared "nationally significant", allowing them to speed through the planning process. These reservoirs are currently pencilled for completion in 2036 and 2040 respectively. The government also says that it intends to pass legislation to automatically make the other seven proposed reservoirs "nationally significant" too. Household consumption of water may also need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population, scientists warn.</p>
