          <p>Dozens of hand-sewn American flags intended for Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK were replaced at an estimated public cost of £52,800. A government supplier reported that the US embassy objected to the standard shade of red, requesting a brighter "cherry red" instead. This last-minute change meant the 66 flags flown along the Mall and at Windsor Castle had to be remade. The incident highlights the detailed diplomatic protocols and expenses involved in hosting high-profile state visits.</p>

          <p>The upcoming PFL lightweight title rematch between champion Usman Nurmagomedov and challenger Paul Hughes is being hailed as a major event in the promotion's history. Their first bout in January was a dramatic, closely contested fight that saw the undefeated Nurmagomedov pushed to his limits before winning by unanimous decision. Pundits like Dan Hardy noted Hughes's remarkable confidence and skill, which surprised the champion and created a compelling narrative. The rematch in Dubai is anticipated to be a tactical battle, with expectations that Nurmagomedov will employ a more wrestling-heavy strategy.</p>

          <p>The cabinet of Papua New Guinea has officially approved the "Pukpuk" defense treaty with Australia, a significant agreement that obligates each nation to assist the other if attacked. Prime Minister James Marape stated the treaty reflects deep trust and a shared history, and it includes provisions for up to 10,000 Papua New Guineans to serve with the Australian Defence Force. This move is seen as part of a broader effort by Australia and the United States to counter China's growing security influence in the Pacific region. The treaty now requires ratification by the parliaments of both countries.</p>

          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurateurs is transforming the culinary scene in Paris, opening establishments that offer authentic, regional Chinese dishes far beyond typical Cantonese fare. These new restaurants, such as Tonton Mao which specializes in northeastern grilled skewers, cater to a younger demographic of diners, including a growing population of Chinese students and professionals. The trend reflects a shift from the French-adapted Chinese food of previous generations to a more diverse and genuine representation of China's vast culinary landscape. Chefs are often brought directly from China to ensure authenticity in flavor and preparation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consortium of lenders has put forward a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances and fund infrastructure improvements. The investors stated their plan would not require taxpayer funding and aims to rebuild public trust by focusing on reducing pollution and improving services. The plan, which is now under review by the regulator Ofwat, comes after years of financial instability and concerns about the company's future.</p>

          <p>Switzerland's Defence Minister, Martin Pfister, is urging lawmakers to relax the country's strict arms export laws to enhance international security cooperation. He argued that the current restrictive stance, which has blocked the re-export of Swiss-made weapons to Ukraine, undermines the trust of security partners. Pfister highlighted emerging threats like cyber attacks and drone incursions, stating that Switzerland must be a reliable partner and able to cooperate with other armed forces. The proposed revision to the war materials act aims to bolster the domestic defense industry while navigating the nation's long-standing policy of neutrality.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda struck Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, delivering powerful winds and heavy rainfall to the island before moving out into the Atlantic and weakening to a Category 1. As of early Thursday, the storm's center was moving away from Bermuda, with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph. Forecasters expected the storm to continue weakening and become an extratropical cyclone. While a hurricane warning remained in effect, there were no immediate reports of major damage, though the storm was expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has finalized a secondary share sale that allows employees to sell stock, valuing the artificial intelligence company at a record $500 billion. The transaction, which totaled $6.6 billion, cements OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing SpaceX. This tender offer is seen as a strategy to retain top talent and reward long-term employees without pursuing an initial public offering, especially amid intense competition for AI researchers. The final sale amount was less than the authorized $10.3 billion, which some insiders reportedly view as a sign of employee confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

The initiative has received support from major defense contractors like Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall, who stand ready to contribute technology and expertise. The plan follows a series of airspace incursions by suspected Russian drones in countries like Poland, Lithuania, and the Nordic nations. While the concept is gaining momentum as a collaborative European security effort, some experts express concern that bureaucratic hurdles could slow down its implementation at the required speed.</p>

He argues that these models are designed to predict the most likely next word and often align with user prompts, which is contrary to the contrarian thinking that fuels revolutionary science. Wolf suggests that true scientific discovery requires generating novel, unlikely, yet true ideas, a capability today's AI lacks.

The government is reportedly considering options to reform or remove the limit in the upcoming budget, with a tapered system being one possibility. Campaigners argue that scrapping the policy would be a cost-effective way to lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.</p>
