          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% growth in the first three months of the year, surpassing analysts' forecasts of 0.6%. According to the Office for National Statistics, this growth was primarily fueled by the UK services sector, with a notable contribution from the production sector as well. This indicates a positive start to the year for the UK economy, suggesting resilience despite global economic uncertainties. The figures reflect a potential upward trend in economic activity within the country. Optimism score is at 75.</p>

          <p>Researchers have determined that a version of the Magna Carta held by Harvard University is an original from 1300, issued by King Edward I, rather than a copy as previously believed. Experts from King's College London and the University of East Anglia based their findings on the document's size and handwriting, aligning it with the six other known originals from that period. This discovery elevates the document's significance, recognizing it as a key piece of world constitutional history.

          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its intent to disband after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a move that could significantly alter Turkish politics. Political experts suggest this could lead to changes for the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) and require parties to adapt their programs and discourse. The fate of PKK members, the surrender of weapons, and the potential release of Kurdish politicians remain uncertain.

He acknowledges the difficulty of facing Crystal Palace in the final and highlights the team's determination to end the season with a trophy.

          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom driven by pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications. Despite projections of moderating growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry will have limited impact. Danish drugmakers rely on a 'merchanting and processing' system, where most of the value is attributable to intellectual property, with manufacturing outsourced to other countries. The IMF notes that direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are expected to be limited.</p>

          <p>A business consultant is urging the Jersey government to introduce statutory workplace pensions to improve the quality of life for an aging population. Kevin Keen suggests implementing auto-enrollment schemes, similar to those used in Guernsey, Australia, and the UK. The government had previously shelved plans for auto-enrollment pensions, prioritizing support for employers and workers transitioning to a living wage. The call comes ahead of a conference addressing the challenges of an aging population, with the number of people aged 75 and over expected to increase significantly.</p>

The decision comes amid a rice shortage partly due to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased consumption from foreign tourists.

          <p>A manuscript in Harvard Law School's library, once considered a copy of the Magna Carta, is now believed to be an original from 1300, making it one of only seven such documents in existence. Two British academics made the discovery, confirming the authenticity through handwriting and dimension analysis. The manuscript was purchased for just $27.50 in 1946 and has been tucked away in the archives for decades. The New York Times article is used here for duplicate coverage on a similar topic.</p>

          <p>Harvard Law School's library has housed a manuscript for 80 years which has now been discovered to be one of seven original versions of the Magna Carta, dating back to 1300. The manuscript, purchased for just $27.50 after World War II, had been misidentified as a copy until two British academics happened upon it by chance. The researchers determined the authenticity after Harvard Law School photographed it under ultraviolet light and then subjected it to various levels of spectral imaging.

          <p>Japan's antitrust watchdog has unveiled draft guidelines to prevent Google and Apple from blocking competition in their app stores. The law aims to promote competition from smaller firms by prohibiting the tech giants from excluding competitors and using data unfairly. The commission hopes the change will reduce prices, improve access to convenient apps and benefit consumers. The guidelines also address product screening practices to prevent unfair treatment of software suppliers.</p>
