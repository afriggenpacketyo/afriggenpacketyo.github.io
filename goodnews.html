          <p>Eddie Palmieri, a celebrated pianist and bandleader who was a trailblazer in Latin music, has passed away at the age of 88. Known for his highly percussive and innovative piano style, he fused Afro-Caribbean rhythms with jazz, creating a new sound with his orchestra, La Perfecta, in the 1960s and 70s. Born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, Palmieri won multiple Grammy awards, including for his landmark 1974 album "The Sun of Latin Music."

          <p>In a wide-ranging BBC interview, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch shared formative experiences from her childhood that she says shaped her political views. She recounted an incident from her school days where she exposed a classmate for cheating, illustrating her strong stance against rule-breaking. Badenoch also discussed losing her religious faith, the "poverty of low expectations" she encountered as a student in London, and her father's dying wish for her political success. The interview provides personal insight into the background and motivations of the current leader of the opposition, who insists she can revive the party's fortunes.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel made a celebrated, albeit brief, return to the Hollywood Bowl for his 20th anniversary summer season with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. His program featured a unique pairing of Duke Ellington's symphonic poems with Maurice Ravel's jazz-influenced piano concertos, performed by soloist Seong-Jin Cho. The homecoming is bittersweet, as Dudamel's subsequent planned concerts with the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela were canceled due to travel issues. The review praises the LA Phil's versatility but notes the challenges of presenting such complex music in the large amphitheater setting.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the tech giant will increase its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years. This raises Apple's total domestic commitment to $600 billion and is expected to create 20,000 new U.S. jobs. The move is seen as a way for Apple to avoid potential tariffs on its products, which rely on a complex international supply chain. The new investment will focus on bringing more of Apple's supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S., including a recent deal to produce magnets for iPhones in Texas.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Introduce Licensing Scheme for Cosmetic Procedures like Botox and Fillers</h2>

          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to crack down on the non-surgical cosmetic industry by introducing a new licensing scheme for practitioners. Under the proposals, clinics will need to meet strict safety, training, and insurance standards to offer procedures like Botox and dermal fillers. The most high-risk treatments, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. The move, which has been welcomed by the industry, aims to protect the public from rogue operators and the serious health complications associated with unregulated cosmetic treatments.</p>

          <p>In a move aligning with efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, Texas Instruments is partnering with Apple to construct a new semiconductor factory in the United States. This development comes as President Trump threatens a 100% tariff on foreign-made chips, a policy designed to incentivize such domestic investments. The reliance on foreign semiconductors, particularly from Taiwan, has been a long-standing national security concern. This partnership is part of a broader trend, spurred by legislation like the CHIPS Act, that has seen companies like Intel and TSMC also announce plans for new U.S.-based fabrication plants.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts that a record number of 18-year-old students are likely to be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their grades. This is attributed to universities seeking the stability of domestic students amid uncertainty surrounding international enrollment numbers. As universities become more competitive for UK undergraduates, they are expected to show more flexibility during the clearing process. The prediction comes as students across the country prepare to receive their A-level and other level-three qualification results next week.</p>
