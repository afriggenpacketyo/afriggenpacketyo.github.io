          <p>On Ukraine's Independence Day, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Kyiv, asserting that only Ukraine and its allies, not Russia, would determine future security guarantees. He called for an immediate ceasefire to end the conflict, emphasizing that unchecked Russian aggression would spread. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces reported recapturing three villages in the Donetsk region, while Russia accused Ukraine of a drone attack on the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant and criticized Western attempts to block peace talks. US envoy Keith Kellogg and EU and German leaders also expressed strong solidarity, with Norway announcing significant air defense system contributions.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS), sending a Dragon capsule with 2.5 tons of equipment and supplies, including an innovative thruster kit. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, delivering crucial cargo such as crew provisions, science gear, and a new propulsion system designed to help maintain the ISS's altitude. This mission supports 50 new research projects, including studies on bone loss, 3D metal printing in space, and bioprinting for nerve regeneration. The addition of the "boost trunk" marks a significant step in diversifying the station's re-boost capabilities, reducing reliance on Russian systems.</p>

          <p>Levi Kelly, a tiny homes expert, successfully built a functional 19.4-by-4-foot tiny house in his yard for approximately $5,000, aiming to create one of the smallest livable homes. Constructed on an old utility trailer, the build took one month and utilized existing materials, with major expenses going to lumber, insulation, and solar/electrical systems. Despite its minimal footprint, the house includes essentials like an AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, a portable toilet, an outdoor shower, and a compact kitchen, all powered by solar panels. Kelly, who has tested the home in various conditions, emphasizes creative space utilization and efficiency as key to tiny living, suggesting that even a few extra inches can significantly enhance comfort.</p>

This marks the 36th consecutive drawing without a grand prize winner, driving excitement and ticket sales across the 45 participating states and territories.</p>

          <p>SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has become indispensable to the US space industry, evolving from a startup to a $400 billion powerhouse. Initially struggling, the company was saved by a $1.6 billion NASA commercial cargo contract in 2008, which enabled the development of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule. Today, SpaceX dominates launch services, conducting 83% of all spacecraft launches in 2024, and is critical for NASA's ISS missions, global internet (Starlink), and future lunar plans (Starship). Its lower cost of access to space has fostered a new ecosystem of companies worldwide, transforming the industry as envisioned by its early proponents.</p>

Transitioning from a salaried role, she now typically works 40-hour weeks, prioritizing work-life balance over maximizing income, though she could earn closer to $500,000 with more overtime. Rodriguez aggressively invests 40% of her pre-tax income, having paid off nearly $124,000 in student loans quickly, and aims for sustainable financial growth and the option to slow down by age 50. Her journey reflects a shift from a "scarcity mindset" to one of comfort and confidence, allowing her to enjoy travel and personal freedom.</p>

          <p>Despite China's economic overtures and significant trade with European nations, US allies are largely resisting Beijing's "charm offensive" on trade, primarily due to their deep-rooted security and cultural allegiances with Washington. The article argues that centuries of shared identity and robust security integration bind these nations to the US strategic architecture, making economic pragmatism secondary to foundational security. While allies engage in diplomatic appeals for restraint, they instinctively safeguard intelligence-sharing pacts and defense commitments with the US. This recalcitrance highlights an unbridgeable gap between China's global ambitions and the geopolitical realities for US allies.</p>

Gebbia, who previously worked with Elon Musk's DOGE team and shifted political alignment to Trump, expressed his goal to make the US "the most beautiful, and usable, country in the digital world."

          <p>Rhode Island has become the first US state to legally require workplace accommodations for menopause symptoms, including temperature control, flexible breaks, and private spaces. This landmark legislation aims to validate and address a previously invisible workplace issue affecting nearly every woman in her 40s or 50s. The author, a professor, praises this policy for being shaped with input from affected women and HR leaders, contrasting it with other health policies by the Trump administration that lacked stakeholder consultation. The article emphasizes that inclusive policy-making, involving those who implement and live with the consequences, is crucial for creating effective and beneficial outcomes, potentially even saving lives.</p>

          <p>Coyotes are increasingly adapting to urban life across the US, with a notable pair, Romeo and Juliet, thriving in New York's Central Park. Wildlife biologists explain this expansion is due to declining predators and the transformation of farmland into suburbs, allowing coyotes to navigate urban habitats effectively. Photographers are documenting these animals to raise public awareness and reduce fear, emphasizing that coyotes rarely attack humans if given space and not fed. While past interactions in Central Park led to controversial captures, city officials have since adopted a "coexistence" approach, promoting public education and responsible management to ensure safety for both humans and wildlife.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's oral obesity pill, orforglipron, is still seen as a strong competitor to Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide, despite trial data showing slightly less weight loss and higher side effects than investor expectations. Analysts predict Eli Lilly's small-molecule drug will capture a significant market share due to easier manufacturing, better absorption without dietary restrictions, and potentially lower pricing, addressing current supply shortages. While Novo Nordisk's pill showed higher efficacy in its trial, Eli Lilly's CEO aims for a global launch next year, with experts emphasizing that 12% weight loss is still a great outcome for many patients. The competitive landscape for these "gamechanger" drugs will ultimately depend on pricing, insurance coverage, and commercialization strategies. (not investment advice)</p>
