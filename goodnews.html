          <h2>Dental Experts Share Tips for Preventing Tooth Loss in Aging Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 14:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dental professionals emphasize that tooth loss is not an inevitable part of aging and offer several essential tips for maintaining oral health. Protecting gum health is crucial, as gum disease can lead to tooth loss and contribute to other health issues like dementia, heart attack, and stroke. Experts recommend preventing dry mouth by staying hydrated and using dry mouth rinses, as well as personalizing dental visits based on individual needs. Financial assistance options and adopting healthy habits, such as quitting smoking and limiting sugary treats, are also important for preventing tooth loss, while cosmetic dentistry can restore appearance and confidence.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of people in the Midwest and East Coast are facing dangerously hot weather as a rare June heatwave persists. Heat advisories are in effect across a large area, with heat indices expected to reach between 100 and 105F in many cities. Public health departments are declaring heat emergencies, urging residents to seek air-conditioned spaces and providing resources to address heat-related illnesses. Meteorologists attribute the extreme temperatures to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity.</p>

          <p>Ben Stokes made a key breakthrough, while Harry Brook's brilliant 99 highlighted a thrilling third day in the first Test between England and India at Headingley. India was building a lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2 with a 96-run advantage at the close of play. Brook's aggressive innings, which included multiple chances, propelled England to virtual parity after they were earlier behind. The match is finely balanced, with drizzle and fading light adding to the tension.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets mostly closed higher on Sunday following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, with Tel Aviv stocks reaching an all-time high. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced slight losses, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 showed significant growth, closing 2.7% higher. Analysts suggest the Gulf region has distanced itself from the conflict, supporting peaceful resolutions and condemning Israeli aggression, which has helped isolate it from significant short-term market impacts.

          <h2>Five Phrases to Avoid When Talking to Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 13:03:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that certain phrases can instantly make children refuse to listen, with traditional parenting phrases triggering a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead of threats or bribes, parents should use language that fosters cooperation and respects a child's autonomy. Phrases to avoid include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." The alternative approach involves explaining decisions, giving children agency, and validating their emotions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Parents know all too well what it's like to deal with a kid who refuses to listen: It's frustrating. But after years of studying over 200 parent-child relationships, I've noticed something fascinating: Parents who rarely deal with defiance don't make threats, bribes or harsh consequences. They use language that makes children actually want to cooperate. Traditional parenting phrases often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, activating the part of the brain focused on survival rather than learning. But when we shift to language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, cooperation becomes natural.</p>

By leveraging his construction background and negotiating effectively, he acquired the property for $2.4 million after identifying and addressing deferred maintenance issues.</p>

          <p>Spain has reached an agreement with NATO to be excluded from the alliance's 5% GDP defense spending target. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that such spending would be "disproportionate and unnecessary" for Spain. While respecting other countries' decisions to increase defense investment, Spain plans to meet its NATO commitments by spending only 2.1% of its GDP. The move follows Spain's initial objection to the 5% target, raising concerns about potential disruption of the upcoming NATO summit.</p>

The pilot program will involve a small number of cars operating in a geofenced area, with "Early Access" invites primarily going to Tesla investors and enthusiasts. The launch comes amid scrutiny over autonomous vehicle safety, with regulatory investigations and concerns raised by safety advocacy groups. The robotaxi service could help boost the company's fortunes and reach a $2 trillion market cap by 2026.</p>
