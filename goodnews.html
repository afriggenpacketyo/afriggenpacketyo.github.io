          <p>Skittles in the US are now manufactured without titanium dioxide, a color additive that was banned in the European Union in 2022 due to potential health risks. Mars, the maker of Skittles, stated that it stopped using the ingredient in its US Skittles portfolio at the end of last year, after years of criticism. The move follows concerns about processed foods to the front of public health debates, and Mars had previously committed to removing all artificial colors from its foods by 2016. The company did not specify if the change would extend to Skittles sold outside the US, but emphasized its commitment to product safety and quality. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>Irish rap group Kneecap has cancelled its performance at the TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow due to police concerns about safety. These concerns arose after a band member was charged with a terror offence for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a London gig. Additionally, criticism stemmed from 2023 footage appearing to show a band member making controversial statements about political figures. The band will perform at the Glastonbury festival and will hold a separate show at Glasgow's O2 Academy as compensation for the cancellation. The optimism score is 60.</p>
