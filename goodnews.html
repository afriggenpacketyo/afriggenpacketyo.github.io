          <p>Alibaba's CEO, Wu, presented an ambitious AI development roadmap, aiming for artificial superintelligence through its Qwen models and cloud services, with the goal of becoming the world's leading full-stack AI service provider. This strategic move highlights the escalating competition between Chinese and US tech giants in the AI sector, a field attracting massive investments with profound economic, social, and geopolitical implications globally. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang later referenced Wu's remarks, stressing the importance of substantial investment in AI development beyond just hardware. The article emphasizes that comprehensive software and infrastructure are as crucial as chips for dominance in the rapidly advancing artificial intelligence domain.</p>

          <p>The US Men's National Team secured a 1-1 draw against Ecuador in Austin, Texas, with Folarin Balogun scoring the equalizer in the 71st minute, marking his second consecutive goal for the team. Despite controlling much of the game and displaying improved tactical shape with a three-man backline and aggressive wingbacks, the US conceded an early goal due to a minor defensive mistake. Coach Mauricio Pochettino highlighted that results are secondary to performance ahead of the 2026 World Cup, and the team's encouraging display against a strong Ecuadorian side indicated significant progress. The players' post-match disappointment underscored their belief that they could have achieved a better score, reflecting their growing ambition.</p>

          <p>The UK, alongside France and Germany, has declared its readiness to utilize the full value of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's war effort, aiming to increase pressure on President Vladimir Putin and facilitate negotiations. This joint action, undertaken in cooperation with the US, follows a previous approach where only interest from these assets was used. With over £25 billion in Russian assets frozen by the UK alone, and €211 billion in the EU, the move comes amidst renewed Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainian President Zelensky has urged further sanctions and air defense systems, emphasizing the need for decisive action from G7 allies.</p>

          <p>British band Wolf Alice has achieved an unprecedented fourth consecutive Mercury Prize nomination for their album, "The Clearing," a feat unmatched by other acclaimed artists.

          <p>Maiwand Banayee, a 45-year-old living in the UK, recounts his past as a radicalized teenager in 1990s Afghanistan, where he was prepared to die for the Taliban. Lured by promises of glory and an eroticized afterlife, he joined the group and enforced its strict Sharia laws, driven by a desire to prove his masculinity. His deradicalization was a gradual process, initiated by doubts about the Taliban's cruelty and disrespectful treatment of individuals. Banayee has since written a book, "Delusions of Paradise," aiming to warn young people about the dangers of extremism, especially with the rapid increase in religious schools in Afghanistan since the Taliban's return to power.</p>

          <p>Many individuals experience a noticeable decline in mood during autumn and winter, often referred to as "autumn blues" or, in severe cases, Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This phenomenon is linked to reduced sunlight exposure, which impacts serotonin and melatonin levels, leading to increased tiredness and feelings of isolation. The article highlights various strategies to combat these seasonal mood changes, including proactive social planning, seeking human contact, maximizing natural light exposure, and maintaining consistent sleep schedules. Experts also recommend light therapy, a balanced diet, regular exercise, and even "romanticizing" the colder months by embracing cozy activities, emphasizing that finding joy in everyday things can significantly improve well-being.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump underwent a "semiannual physical" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, six months after his annual exam, ahead of a trip to the Middle East. Despite White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it a "routine yearly checkup," Trump himself referred to it as semiannual, stating he felt "in great shape." A summary from his doctor, Sean Barbabella, described the visit as part of his health maintenance plan, involving advanced imaging and lab tests, concluding he is in "exceptional health" with a cardiac age 14 years younger than his chronological age of 79. The visit aimed to dispel rumors about his health, fueled by recent public appearances with bruising and previous absences.</p>

          <p>Senior US officials provided a timeline detailing the monthslong efforts behind President Trump's 20-point peace plan, which led to a Gaza ceasefire and initial hostage release. Negotiations involved key players like Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, with crucial meetings in New York and Sharm El Sheikh involving Qatari, Turkish, and Egyptian intelligence chiefs. A significant breakthrough included Israeli Prime Prime Minister Netanyahu's apology to Qatar for an airstrike, building trust amidst deep mistrust. The plan's first phase involves a 72-hour hostage release and Palestinian prisoner swap, with a second phase aiming for an "almost permanent ceasefire" pending further negotiations on governance and disarmament in Gaza.</p>

She expressed immense gratitude, viewing the award as recognition for an entire society's struggle for freedom.

He stated that this new era presents a "tremendous opportunity" for Hong Kong to proactively design specialized financial frameworks. These frameworks would specifically support the capital needs of global companies operating within these critical technology sectors, thereby ensuring the city's continued relevance and growth as a vital financial hub.

          <p>President Trump announced a deal with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to offer discounted prescription drugs to US patients, particularly those on Medicaid. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will provide drugs to Medicaid patients at "most-favored-nation" prices, matching the lowest rates offered in other high-income countries, and list primary care medications on the new government website, TrumpRx. This follows a similar deal with Pfizer, aiming to lower drug costs and encourage US manufacturing. Experts, however, caution that the impact on Medicaid patients may be modest due to existing "best price" protections, and the TrumpRx site's broader benefit for most insured patients remains unclear.

Coach Brendan King, reviewing game tape, realized a scoring error meant their opponent, Apache High School, should have won 43-42, not 44-43. Despite league rules stating scores are final, the team unanimously decided to appeal their own victory, prioritizing sportsmanship and integrity.

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, has retired to the countryside after sustaining injuries during a dramatic bolting incident in central London last year. Quaker was one of five horses spooked by construction noise, leading to them running loose through the city, colliding with vehicles, and causing injuries. Despite undergoing surgery for bleeding and a small break, Quaker was the only horse deemed unable to return to active duty, unlike his four stablemates who have since resumed service. His rider, who broke his back in the incident, has also made a full recovery. Quaker will now enjoy a peaceful retirement at The Horse Trust sanctuary, founded to care for working horses.</p>

This crackdown is part of broader US efforts against Chinese tech companies deemed security threats.

Prompt AI, founded in 2023, informed employees of the pending transaction, indicating that investors would not be "made whole" and some staff might not join Apple. The startup's flagship app, Seemour, which enhances home security cameras with advanced detection capabilities, will be retired. This acquisition aligns with Apple's strategy of quietly acquiring smaller teams to integrate talent and technology into its product lines, particularly its HomeKit smart home division, despite facing criticism for its slower AI progress compared to other tech giants.</p>
