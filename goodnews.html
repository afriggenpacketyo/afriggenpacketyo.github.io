          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, asserts that the Trump administration's attempts to silence pro-Palestinian voices have failed. Khalil, who was arrested for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants. He accused the White House of attempting to dehumanize those who disagree with the administration's policies. His release follows a judge's ruling that he is not a flight risk or threat, though the Trump administration plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation.
