          <p>The White House has acknowledged formatting and citation errors in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" report, which critiques the U.S. food supply, pesticides, and prescription drugs. The report, which cites hundreds of studies, faced scrutiny after some citations were found to be non-existent or misinterpreted. Despite these issues, the White House maintains confidence in Kennedy and describes the report as a transformative assessment of chronic disease afflicting American children. The report is intended to inform policy recommendations and the White House has requested additional funding for the MAHA initiative. </p>

          <p>China has agreed to resume importing seafood from Japan, ending a two-year ban imposed after the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports expected to begin once China completes necessary procedures. The agreement is based on China's participation in water sampling missions with the International Atomic Energy Agency. This resumption is expected to occur from areas outside the Fukushima region. </p>

DOGE has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, though Democrats in Congress have criticized Musk's influence.
