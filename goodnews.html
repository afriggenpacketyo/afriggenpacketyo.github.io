          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has settled its $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the conservative media outlet Newsmax for $67 million. The lawsuit stemmed from false claims broadcast by Newsmax alleging widespread fraud involving Dominion's machines in the 2020 presidential election. This settlement follows a similar, larger $787 million settlement between Dominion and Fox News for airing comparable falsehoods. Despite the settlement, Newsmax maintained in a statement that its coverage was fair and criticized the judge overseeing the case, claiming it did not expect a fair trial.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open reveals that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is significantly impacting contraceptive use in the U.S. Researchers found that nearly a third of people who obtained the OTC pill, Opill, had previously used no method of contraception at all. The study also showed a substantial shift from less-effective methods like condoms. Users of the OTC pill were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and live in rural areas, suggesting the prescription-free option is successfully reducing barriers to access for key demographics.</p>

          <p>State health officials in Texas have officially declared an end to the measles outbreak that began in late January and resulted in 762 confirmed cases. The declaration was made after 42 days—double the disease's maximum incubation period—passed without a new reported case in the affected counties. The outbreak primarily affected children, with two unvaccinated children tragically dying from the virus. The Texas Department of State Health Services credited the containment to a comprehensive response including vaccination, testing, and public education, but urged continued vigilance for new cases.</p>

The company, which is scaling up its robotaxi fleet, also drew investments from 14 other major firms like Baillie Gifford in the second quarter. Pony.AI's robotaxi revenue grew 158% year-over-year, driven by cheaper new vehicle models and expanded commercial permits in China's largest cities. The investments reflect growing confidence in the autonomous ride-hailing sector's transformative potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A school superintendent in a low-income Pennsylvania district is using technology to make music education more accessible by 3D printing violins for students. Dr. Laura Jacob of the California Area School District initiated the program to overcome the high cost of renting instruments, which can be a barrier for many families. By producing the violins for just $50 each, the district has provided over 200 instruments for free, enabling more students to learn and play. The program has been met with enthusiasm from students, who report feeling more confident and empowered.</p>

          <p>Cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW and will no longer use the iconic peacock logo as it spins off from parent company NBC Universal. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is part of the creation of a new independent business called Versant. This new entity will also include other former NBC Universal channels like CNBC, USA, and E!. The rebranding aims to establish a separate identity for the news organization as it builds its own modern newsgathering operations independent of NBC News.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Zelenskyy meets with U.S. officials, an analysis of financial contributions to Ukraine reveals a complex picture of international support. Data from the Kiel Institute shows that while the United States is the largest single-country donor, with commitments totaling $130.6 billion, Europe as a whole has committed more, at $165.7 billion. The aid from both sides is a mixture of grants and loans, though the U.S. has provided more direct grants while the EU has offered more loans. This context challenges some political claims that Europe's contributions are significantly smaller than those of the U.S.</p>

          <p>Drugmaker Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to cash-paying patients in the United States, a price less than half of its current list price of nearly $1,350. The move comes amid increasing political pressure on pharmaceutical companies to lower medication costs. The discounted price will be available through various platforms, including the drug's official website and GoodRx, expanding access for uninsured or underinsured patients with Type 2 diabetes. This strategy also aims to steer patients away from unregulated compounded versions of the medication.</p>

          <p>Google and nuclear startup Kairos Power have announced a partnership with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to deploy an advanced nuclear reactor by 2030. The TVA has agreed to purchase up to 50 megawatts of power from Kairos' Hermes 2 reactor, which will help power Google's regional data centers. This collaboration marks a significant step for advanced nuclear energy in the U.S., as it uses a power purchase agreement model where Google and Kairos bear the financial risk of construction. The project aims to demonstrate a faster, more affordable approach to building nuclear plants.</p>
