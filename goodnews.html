          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made female billionaire at age thirty, attributes her entrepreneurial drive to a frugal upbringing by immigrant parents. She began making money as a child by trading Pokémon cards and later developed coding skills to create and sell bots for online games. After dropping out of Carnegie Mellon to accept a Thiel Fellowship, she co-founded Scale AI, which was later acquired by Meta for $25 billion. Guo is now the founder of the monetization platform Passes, though the company is currently facing a class-action lawsuit which it denies.</p>

          <p>New data from England's Department for Education reveals a strong correlation between student absences in the first week of the school year and persistent absenteeism later on. According to the figures, 57% of pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 went on to be "persistently absent," compared to just 14% of those with perfect attendance that week. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents and schools to prioritize attendance from day one to combat what she calls "critically high" absence levels that have persisted since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have arrived in Tianjin, China, for the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The gathering of the regional security bloc, which was founded as a counterweight to Western alliances, is taking place as both India and Russia face economic pressure from the United States. Modi is holding his first talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in seven years, a significant development as the U.S. has imposed steep tariffs on Indian goods over its continued purchases of Russian oil. The summit is being held with extensive security and promotional fanfare in the host city.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the best she has ever made, citing the need to prioritize her mental and physical health. After a demanding season where she captained Chelsea to a domestic treble, Bright felt she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not give 100% to the national team. The 32-year-old, who has since undergone knee surgery and started counseling, says she felt she had "lost herself" while balancing leadership duties. She now feels mentally and physically rejuvenated ahead of the new season.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee who led the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), is stepping down after a four-month tenure, declaring his mission "accomplished." The MCC, a U.S. foreign aid agency created in 2004, provides infrastructure grants to developing nations. Dasgupta's role was to reposition the agency from a traditional aid provider to a strategic investment tool aligned with the Trump administration's "America First" agenda, focusing on U.S. return on investment and countering Chinese influence. His departure comes as the administration seeks to reframe global engagement, preserving the MCC as a leaner, investment-driven entity while cutting other aid programs.</p>

          <h2>Biologists Use Drones with Loud Music and Movie Clips to Deter Wolves from Livestock</h2>

          <p>A team of USDA biologists is experimenting with a novel, non-lethal method to protect cattle from gray wolves: drones equipped with loudspeakers. Operating near the California-Oregon border, the researchers blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and dialogue from the film "Marriage Story" to haze the predators and interrupt hunts, particularly at night. This creative approach is part of an ongoing effort to find ways for ranchers and the recovering wolf population to coexist, as conflicts increase. While the technology is expensive and has limitations, early results have been successful in scaring wolves away without harming them.</p>

          <p>Labor unions and activists are organizing a series of "Workers over Billionaires" protests across the Los Angeles area for Labor Day on Monday. The demonstrations are a response to what organizers describe as threats to workers' rights from the Trump administration, including immigration raids, cuts to Medicaid, and a weakened National Labor Relations Board. The protests are scheduled in numerous locations, including Culver City, Torrance, Wilmington, and San Pedro. This article provides a list of the planned events, continuing a tradition of labor activism on the federal holiday that commemorates the 19th-century fight for more equitable labor laws.</p>

          <p>The meeting between India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's President Xi Jinping at the SCO summit is being viewed as a potential turning point for the two economic powerhouses. Both nations are currently facing significant economic pressure from U.S. tariffs, creating a shared incentive to improve their strained relationship. While deep-seated issues like border disputes and regional rivalries remain, the immediate economic challenges may be pushing them toward greater cooperation. Experts suggest that even small steps, such as resuming direct flights and easing visa restrictions, could signal a thaw and send a clear message to Washington that both countries have other strategic options.</p>

          <p>Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime secured a major upset at the US Open, defeating world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in a four-set thriller that lasted nearly four hours. After dropping the first set, the 25th seed mounted a comeback, winning a crucial second-set tiebreak that shifted the match's momentum. Zverev, a former US Open runner-up, grew visibly frustrated as his game faltered, leading to his earliest exit from the tournament since 2018. For Auger-Aliassime, the victory marks a significant return to form after struggling with injuries and represents his first Grand Slam win over a top-five opponent.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans began their 2025 football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, an FCS opponent. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime, while the offense never punted and averaged over 10 yards per play. The defense also showed significant improvement from last season, recording five sacks and scoring a touchdown on an interception by safety Bishop Fitzgerald. While the lopsided win provided a smooth start, the quality of the opponent makes it difficult to gauge the team's true strength.</p>

          <p>Despite recent polls showing a rise in its public favorability, Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is facing internal anxiety over its future leadership. With current chairman Eric Chu Li-luan set to step down in October, the party is struggling to identify a successor for what some consider a challenging role. A recent poll from My Formosa indicated the KMT's favorability has edged past that of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). This presents a political opportunity for the KMT, but uncertainty about who will take charge is creating a sense of unease within the party.</p>
