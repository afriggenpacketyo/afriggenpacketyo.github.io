          <p>UCLA's athletic director, Martin Jarmond, discussed the university's plans following the House settlement agreement with the NCAA, which allows schools to directly pay athletes. UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing, maintaining its Olympic sports programs and current scholarship limits for at least one year. Payments will be distributed using a formula similar to the back-payment model, with a larger share going to football and men's basketball players. Jarmond emphasized the importance of investing in the athletic program to compete at the highest level.</p>

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, successfully took her first flight from the nest. After a brief initial attempt, Gizmo soared into the air, joining her sister Sunny, who fledged earlier in the week. The eaglets, born in March, had been practicing for their first flights by flapping their wings and jumping between branches. Although it is unclear where Sunny and Gizmo will go, young eagles tend to return to the nest soon after their first flight.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards began her tenure as head coach of the England women's cricket team with a clean sweep over the West Indies in both T20 and ODI series. However, the article cautions against excessive optimism, noting that England has historically dominated home bilateral series but struggled in major tournaments. The series win may not necessarily indicate a significant change in the team's ability to perform under pressure. Tougher tests lie ahead, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK in a new role, just two days after resigning as chairman. Yusuf will lead the party's "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. He had previously cited that working to get it elected was no longer "a good use of my time", without expanding further. Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed delight at Yusuf's return, stating that he will now take on a more public-facing role within the party. Yusuf attributed his earlier resignation to exhaustion after 11 months of work.</p>
