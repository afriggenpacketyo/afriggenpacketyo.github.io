          <p>President Donald Trump recently held an hour-long private meeting with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at the White House. The discussion comes amid a shifting relationship between the two, who were often at odds during Trump's first term. In his second term, Bezos has reportedly sought to improve relations, especially as his company Blue Origin competes with Elon Musk's SpaceX for government contracts. The meeting signals a potential alignment of interests, particularly as the administration focuses on domestic manufacturing and technology, while Bezos navigates the political landscape to benefit his business ventures.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn public attention for his choice of attire during a strenuous hike in Arizona. The 71-year-old was photographed hiking Camelback Mountain in dark blue jeans despite temperatures exceeding 90°F, a decision that baffled fellow hikers and social media users. This is not the first time his preference for exercising in denim has been noted, as he has previously been filmed working out and wading in a creek while wearing jeans. The incident has sparked a lighthearted but critical conversation about his judgment, especially given his role overseeing public health.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) is set to name Gita O’Neill, a veteran attorney from the L.A. City Attorney’s office, as its new interim chief executive. The appointment comes as the agency faces a major transition, with Los Angeles County forming its own homelessness department and taking over a significant portion of LAHSA's budget and responsibilities. O'Neill will be tasked with guiding the embattled agency through this downsizing period, which follows harsh audits that criticized its poor financial oversight and contract management. Her selection aims to bring stability during a period of significant structural change.</p>

          <p>A new student loan repayment plan, named the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), has been established under a law signed by President Trump. Expected to be available by July 2026, RAP will calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with payments ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings and a $10 minimum. This income-driven plan will offer loan forgiveness after 30 years, a longer timeline than existing options. As other repayment plans are phased out, RAP will become one of only two choices for new borrowers, alongside a standard 10-to-25-year fixed payment plan.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey man has pleaded guilty to leading a sophisticated criminal enterprise that trafficked stolen catalytic converters, generating over $600 million in illicit revenue. The defendant, Navin Khanna, admitted to purchasing stolen converters from a network of thieves across multiple states and then reselling them to a metal refinery. The refinery would extract the valuable precious metals like platinum, palladium, and rhodium contained within the devices. This guilty plea is a major development in a nationwide investigation that began after a routine traffic stop in Oklahoma uncovered a truck full of the stolen auto parts.</p>

          <p>In the first half of the year, artificial intelligence startups in the U.S. raised a staggering $104.3 billion, nearly matching the total for all of 2024, with giants like OpenAI and Anthropic leading the charge. Despite this massive influx of investment, the market for exits—such as acquisitions or IPOs—tells a different story, with only $36 billion in total value generated. This disparity highlights a trend where venture capital is pouring into the AI sector at a historic rate, but lucrative returns for investors remain limited. The market is currently characterized by frequent, but lower-value, acquisitions rather than high-value public offerings. (not investment advice)</p>
