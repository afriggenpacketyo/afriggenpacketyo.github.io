          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale parades and marches to mark the culmination of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. While celebratory, this year's events are taking on a more defiant and protest-oriented tone in response to recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights. Organizers have noted a more challenging environment, including a reduction in corporate sponsorships. The events commemorate the 1969 Stonewall uprising, which was a pivotal moment for the gay rights movement in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for supermarkets and food manufacturers to voluntarily encourage healthier eating habits among customers. As part of a partnership to tackle rising obesity rates, retailers will decide on their own methods, which could include promotions on healthy items or adjusting loyalty point systems. The initiative, which will be part of the NHS 10-year plan, aims to make healthy food more accessible and relieve pressure on the health service. Critics note that the voluntary nature of past programs has had mixed success.</p>

          <p>China's decision to halt exports of rare earths is accelerating international efforts to establish alternative production facilities, though the process is expected to be costly and complex. An American firm, REalloys, is collaborating with a Canadian council on a project to produce high-performance magnet materials using ore from Brazil. Analysts suggest that building a supply chain independent of China, which has long dominated the market, will likely require government subsidies and tariffs to be viable. This move highlights the strategic global importance of rare earth elements in modern technology. (not investment advice)</p>

The initiative, planned for a nationwide rollout by 2026, educates students on UV levels and proper sunscreen application. Health experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases later-life cancer risk, and with melanoma cases projected to rise, early education is a key preventative measure.

The government had attempted to ban the march, citing a controversial "child protection" law that restricts LGBTQ+ content. However, Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, used a legal loophole to allow the event to proceed, which he framed as a peaceful show of resistance. The large turnout was seen as a clear message of solidarity against the government's anti-LGBT policies.</p>
