        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of luxury group Kering saw a significant 8.7% increase after the company reported a smaller-than-expected sales decline for its third quarter, largely driven by a notable improvement at its flagship brand, Gucci. Although Gucci's sales were still down 14% year-over-year, this marked a sharp recovery from the 25% plunge experienced in the previous quarter, signaling that management's turnaround efforts may be taking hold. The positive results have bolstered investor optimism, with analysts suggesting the performance reflects both an improving luxury sector context and the initial success of Kering's strategic actions, such as the recent sale of its beauty unit to focus on core fashion businesses.

Reflecting on her journey, she identified her performance in 'Firebird' as a pivotal moment, noting how it visibly diversified the audience and marked a significant shift for representation within the ballet world.

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce has joined an activist investor group aiming to pressure the struggling theme park operator Six Flags into improving its customer experience and financial performance. The investment coalition, which owns about 9% of the company, is seeking to influence strategy as Six Flags faces declining visitation and financial losses following its merger with Cedar Fair. The company has been cutting costs by laying off park presidents and canceling seasonal events, raising concerns about the quality of the park experience. Kelce, a lifelong fan of the parks, stated he wants to help make Six Flags special for the next generation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 1.5% in September, reaching their highest pace in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. The rise is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability and boosted buyer activity. Despite the increase in sales, the housing supply remains historically lean, which continues to put upward pressure on prices. The median home price rose 2.1% year-over-year to $415,200, marking the 27th consecutive month of annual gains and keeping prices 53% higher than pre-pandemic levels, posing an ongoing challenge for many potential buyers.

          <h2>Essay Argues Conservative Movement is Gaining Energy on College Campuses</h2>

          <p>In a recent essay, a Stanford graduate argues that the real political energy on college campuses today is found on the right, not the left. The author contends that a campus culture perceived as stifling debate and fearing offense has pushed intellectually curious students toward conservative groups that encourage disagreement and discourse. This trend is not necessarily driven by support for Donald Trump, but rather by a hunger for a robust marketplace of ideas that they feel is absent in progressive spaces. The article suggests this dynamic is leading to a quiet resurgence of conservative thought and activism at elite universities across the country.</p>

          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates remaining attractive, financial planners suggest that now may be a strategic time for savers to lock in yields before they potentially decline. Experts recommend allocating between 10% to 30% of cash savings into CDs, depending on individual financial goals and emergency fund needs. They emphasize matching the CD term length to specific short- to medium-term goals, such as a down payment or a large purchase. To maintain flexibility and manage reinvestment risk, some also advise using a "CD laddering" strategy, which involves splitting deposits across CDs with varying maturity dates.

          <p>Shares of several quantum computing firms, including IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave, surged following a report that the Trump administration is in talks to take equity stakes in the companies in exchange for federal funding. This potential move aligns with the administration's recent strategy of investing directly in industries deemed vital to national security, such as rare earth minerals and advanced semiconductors. The government's interest signals a growing focus on quantum computing as a strategically critical technology due to its potential to revolutionize numerous fields and its significant national security implications, particularly in the technological competition with China.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Airlines has hired Nat Pieper, an industry veteran with nearly three decades of experience, to serve as its new chief commercial officer. The appointment comes as the airline seeks to bolster its profitability, which has been lagging behind competitors like Delta and United. Pieper previously held high-level roles at Delta and Alaska Airlines and most recently led the Oneworld airline alliance. He replaces the former commercial chief who was ousted earlier in 2024 after a controversial business travel strategy backfired, leading to a sharp drop in revenue projections. Pieper's hiring is seen as a move to stabilize and refocus the airline's commercial strategy.</p>

          <p>A new tax law enacted by the Trump administration significantly enhances the benefits of qualified small business stock (QSBS), offering a more profitable way for many entrepreneurs to sell their companies. The legislation raises the tax-free gain cap from $10 million to $15 million, lowers the required stock holding period from five to three years, and increases the asset cap for eligible C-corporation businesses to $75 million. These changes broaden the number of businesses that can benefit from converting to a C corp before a sale. The new rules could result in millions of dollars in additional tax savings for owners planning their exit strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a year marked by trade disputes and diplomatic friction, the United States and the European Union are demonstrating a more united front, largely driven by a shared frustration with Russia's stance on the war in Ukraine. This alignment was highlighted by the recent announcement of coordinated sanctions targeting Russia's energy sector. The U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. noted that while President Trump's relationship with the bloc had a rocky start, the need to increase pressure on Moscow has brought the two powers closer together. This evolving dynamic suggests that geopolitical necessities are helping to mend transatlantic relations that were previously strained.</p>
