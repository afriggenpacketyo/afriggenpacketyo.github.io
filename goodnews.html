          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, returned to New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over 100 days due to his role in campus protests against Israel. The Trump administration sought his deportation, alleging his activities aligned with Hamas, though no criminal charges were filed. A judge ruled Khalil was neither a threat nor a flight risk, criticizing the government's actions as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech.</p>

          <p>WNBA player Sophie Cunningham criticized the league's referees for allegedly failing to adequately protect Caitlin Clark, her teammate on the Indiana Fever. Cunningham's comments followed a game where she committed a hard foul to defend Clark, leading to a brawl and ejections. She believes the referees have not been consistently calling fouls when Clark is roughed up by opposing players. Cunningham's actions have garnered attention, with fans viewing her as an "enforcer" protecting Clark, and her social media following has surged since the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling prevents a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities, potentially stripping them of millions of dollars in research funding. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful, siding with universities that argued the cuts would threaten critical work in areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Similar caps on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health have also been blocked by judges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated assisted departure flights from Israel, according to U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, with two flights departing from Tel Aviv to Athens carrying approximately 70 U.S. citizens and their families. This action follows confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for Americans evacuating Israel, and the State Department has placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory due to armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest. The U.S. is urging citizens needing assistance to register in the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). The evacuation efforts come amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with missile strikes causing casualties in both countries.</p>

          <p>NPR's Frank Langfitt reflects on covering both a military parade and a "No Kings" rally on the same day, noting how these events highlight America's political and cultural divisions. The military parade, featuring tanks and armored vehicles, contrasted sharply with the "No Kings" protests against the politicization of the armed forces. Langfitt suggests that these events serve as a Rorschach test, revealing the stark differences in perspectives and values within American society. By attending both events, he gained a unique perspective on the nation's complex and often conflicting ideologies.</p>

Receptionists at the Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham describe the chaotic scene when phone lines open, with limited appointments available and increasing demand from patients. The Labour government has pledged to end the early morning phone "scramble" with increased funding and online appointment options, but the situation remains challenging. The practice has expanded its team of health professionals to complement the work of family doctors, but the demand continues to rise.</p>

          <p>The band South Arcade discusses the inspiration behind their music, which is rooted in Y2K core, a cultural movement reflecting nostalgia for the late 1990s and early 2000s. The band members, born around the turn of the millennium, draw inspiration from artists like Rihanna, Korn, and Justice, aiming to capture the energy of that era. The Y2K hashtag has gained traction on TikTok, with millions of posts showcasing artists like Pitbull and Avril Lavigne. The appeal of Y2K core lies in its escapism and the feeling of a time when personal expression was more tangible and less reliant on digital minimalism.</p>
