          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has announced the 12 contenders for the 2025 Fat Bear Week competition, an annual event highlighting the park's brown bears as they prepare for hibernation. The contest, which began in 2014, allows people worldwide to vote online for the fattest bear, with livestreams showcasing the bears in their natural habitats. Park rangers emphasize that a fat bear is a healthy bear, as they can gain up to 700 pounds in preparation for the winter. This year's contenders include familiar faces like 32 Chunk, last year's runner-up, and newcomers like 602, nicknamed "Flow-tato," with the winner receiving the prize of surviving another winter season. The article's overall tone is lighthearted and celebratory, highlighting the bears' health and resilience.</p>

          <p>Parents are reporting that their nonverbal son began speaking after trying leucovorin, a drug typically used to treat chemotherapy side effects, off-label for autism. Dr. Richard Frye is studying leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, and its potential to help children with autism who have a blockage in folic acid transport to the brain. The FDA has begun the process of approving leucovorin as a treatment for autism, despite limited large-scale clinical trials. Leucovorin increases brain levels of folate in kids with CFD, and one-third of kids experienced improvement in their speech and other behavior when treated with leucovorin. The article reflects a hopeful outlook on potential treatments for autism and the impact on affected families.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has transferred eight former death row inmates, whose sentences were commuted by President Biden, to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado. These inmates, convicted of heinous crimes including murder, will now face stricter conditions of confinement. Bondi stated that this action aims to ensure the inmates spend the rest of their lives in conditions consistent with their egregious crimes, providing a measure of justice to the victims' families. This move reverses some of the previous administration's efforts on criminal justice reform and prioritizes cracking down on violent offenders. The tone of the article is firm and decisive, focusing on justice for victims and accountability for criminals.</p>
