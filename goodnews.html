          <p>A leading Japanese expert in Marxism, known for his extensive research including unpublished works of Karl Marx and collaborative projects like MEGA2, has been appointed to a significant role within the School of Philosophy at Wuhan University in China. This academic move underscores China's unwavering commitment to Marxist theory, which remains a mandatory subject for all undergraduates and a crucial part of postgraduate entrance examinations across the country. The scholar, who holds a doctorate from Tohoku University and previously served as a dean, was recently recognized by the World Association for Political Economy in 2024 for his contributions. This appointment represents a notable instance of international academic collaboration within a highly influential and politically significant area of study in China.</p>

          <p>San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh addressed a viral post-game confrontation with Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Liam Coen, acknowledging his part in the heated exchange. The incident, which saw both coaches needing to be held back, stemmed from Saleh's pre-game comments about the Jaguars having a "legally advanced signal-stealing-type system." Saleh clarified that his intention was to offer a compliment, but he admitted to using "the wrong choice of words" in his attempt to praise Coen's staff for their strategic preparation. Both coaches have since downplayed the situation, indicating that the matter is resolved and their professional respect remains.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming "golden week" holiday, uniquely extended to eight days this year by coinciding with both the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, is anticipated to generate a substantial surge in domestic and international travel. Forecasts from China Trading Desk suggest total outbound trips from mainland China could more than double compared to the previous year, potentially reaching between 8 million and 8.4 million. Demand is notably surging for visa-free destinations such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, while Russia and South Korea have also observed increased bookings following new visa exemption rules.

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is reportedly nearing a deal to acquire Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for approximately $10 billion, potentially finalizing within days. This acquisition would mark Berkshire's largest since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a record cash hoard of $344 billion, indicating its readiness for significant investments. Greg Abel, Buffett's designated successor as CEO, possesses strong expertise in the energy industry, aligning strategically with this reported target. Berkshire Hathaway already holds a substantial 28.2% stake in Occidental, and this move would further deepen its investment in the company's operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines is making "massive progress" in its revitalization, securing up to $475 million in debtor-in-possession financing from debtholders, alongside an additional $150 million from a major aircraft lessor, pending court approval. The struggling budget airline recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in less than a year, driven by high operating costs, weaker demand, and lingering operational issues. As part of its aggressive cost-cutting strategy, Spirit plans to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft and 12 airport leases, aiming to shrink operations. This article details the airline's determined efforts to stabilize its financial position and build a stronger future, despite skepticism from competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Lithium Americas surged over 35% in extended trading following the announcement that the U.S. government will acquire a 5% equity stake in the company and another 5% directly in its Thacker Pass project. This Nevada-based lithium mine is anticipated to become one of North America's largest sources of the critical mineral, with its first phase of operations expected to commence in late 2027. This strategic investment, confirmed by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, marks a significant move by the White House to secure the domestic mineral supply chain. It represents the first such stake proposed for a Canadian-domiciled company, reflecting a broader commitment to ensuring a robust supply of essential resources for U.S. interests.

          <p>Bear 32 Chunk has been named the winner of Fat Bear Week 2025, triumphing after two consecutive years as a runner-up in the annual Katmai National Park and Preserve competition in Alaska. Despite sustaining a broken jaw earlier in the year, likely from a mating season fight, Chunk demonstrated remarkable determination and adaptability, learning to effectively consume salmon without the full use of his mandible. This resilience allowed him to bulk up significantly, estimated at over 1,200 pounds, securing his dominance and substantially increasing his likelihood of surviving the upcoming winter hibernation. The article celebrates Chunk's inspiring perseverance and the public's enthusiastic engagement with this beloved wildlife event.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has agreed to allow South Korean workers to set up facilities at U.S. investment sites under existing temporary visas and will open new channels to help facilitate their entry. This decision comes in the wake of a recent immigration raid at a Hyundai Motor battery facility in Georgia, which underscored the difficulties specialized South Korean workers faced in obtaining appropriate U.S. visas. While these immediate measures address pressing needs, U.S. officials indicated that a more fundamental change to U.S. visa systems, sought by Seoul for clearer and more certain access for its specialty workers, faces "practical legislative constraints."

          <p>This article examines Altria Group (NYSE: MO) as a potentially stable, ultra-high dividend-yielding stock that could serve as a defensive investment for portfolios preparing for a market crash. The tobacco and nicotine giant fuels its over 6% dividend through consistent cash flows from its declining but profitable cigarette business, augmented by strategic price increases and cost cuts. Altria is also actively investing in new nicotine categories, such as its rapidly growing On! nicotine pouch brand, and expanding through international partnerships. The article suggests that Altria's countercyclical nature makes it a suitable counterbalance to hypergrowth stocks, offering consistent returns even during inevitable economic downturns.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio unconstitutionally targeted pro-Palestinian students for deportation. In a scathing 161-page decision, the judge asserted that the Trump administration misused its sweeping powers to suppress constitutionally protected First Amendment speech and to "terrorize" non-citizen activists into silence. The ruling heavily criticized the use of masked agents during detentions and President Trump's "palpable misunderstanding" of free speech principles.
