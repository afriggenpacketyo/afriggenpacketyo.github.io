          <p>The U.S. government has brokered an unusual agreement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, requiring them to pay 15% of their revenue from specific AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This revenue-sharing plan, confirmed by the White House, applies to Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were previously restricted. President Trump stated he personally negotiated the deal with Nvidia's CEO, framing it as a benefit for the country. The move comes amid ongoing efforts to balance national security concerns with American companies' ability to compete in the global AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a $2 billion investment to retool its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant as part of its new "Universal EV Program" focused on producing more affordable electric vehicles. This initiative, combined with a $3 billion battery park in Michigan, aims to create or secure nearly 4,000 jobs. The first vehicle from this program will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck slated for a 2027 launch with a starting price of $30,000. CEO Jim Farley described the strategy as a radical approach to compete with global competitors, particularly from China, and navigate shifting EV policies.</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment shares surged after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, signaling a potential recovery for the theater chain. The company's net loss narrowed significantly to $4.7 million, or one cent per share, compared to a $32.8 million loss in the same period last year. Revenue increased by 35% to nearly $1.4 billion, driven by a 26% rise in attendance. CEO Adam Aron attributed the positive performance to a recovering box office and the company's success in managing its debt, positioning AMC to capitalize on future industry growth.

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a significant rally after a report indicated that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule. Trump confirmed he is looking into the matter and expects a decision within weeks, a move that could significantly benefit the industry by easing tax burdens and encouraging investment. Currently, cannabis is a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, but a potential move to Schedule III would place it with substances like steroids. While the president cannot unilaterally reclassify the drug, his support is seen as a major catalyst for the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford is investing a total of $5 billion in its electric vehicle production, aiming to manufacture more affordable models, including a midsize truck starting at $30,000. The investment includes $2 billion for its Louisville plant and $3 billion for a new Michigan battery facility. Central to this strategy is a new "universal EV platform" and an innovative "assembly tree" production line, which the company claims will be more efficient and ergonomic. By using smaller, cobalt-free batteries and reducing the number of components, Ford intends to lower costs and produce its new EV truck up to 40% faster.</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have announced a new multi-year, first-look deal with Netflix, extending their partnership with the streaming giant. This arrangement gives Netflix the first option on content from their Archewell production company, replacing their previous, more structured deal. The announcement dispels rumors of a complete separation and comes ahead of the second season of Meghan's cookery show, "With Love, Meghan." While financial terms were not disclosed, the original 2020 deal was reportedly worth around $100 million, and this new agreement signals a continued collaboration on various film and television projects.</p>

          <p>This article explores the differences between Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and annuities as tools for retirement savings, highlighting their distinct approaches to financial security. IRAs offer tax-advantaged growth potential and investment flexibility, making them suitable for those with a longer time horizon and higher risk tolerance. In contrast, annuities provide a guaranteed income stream, offering protection from market volatility and appealing to retirees who prioritize predictability and income security. The article suggests that a hybrid strategy, combining both vehicles, can often provide a balanced approach to managing retirement funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House's agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of their China-related chip revenue with the U.S. government is an unusual, transactional move that has broad implications. For the companies, it provides certainty and access to the lucrative Chinese market, with investors viewing 85% of revenue as better than zero. However, it raises long-term questions about whether the government might seek a larger share in the future. Analysts believe this "pay-to-play" tactic is unique to the strategic semiconductor sector and is unlikely to be extended to other industries, while China may view the arrangement with mixed feelings.

The suspension tightens an already constrained market, leading investors to anticipate a rise in lithium prices due to the reduced supply.
