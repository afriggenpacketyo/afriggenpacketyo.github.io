          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with a 39.1% increase from the previous year that surpassed market expectations. This financial success is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. Citing the continued strength of the AI sector, the company has raised its revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range. TSMC also confirmed it is monitoring potential impacts from U.S. tariff policies while continuing its significant investments in U.S.-based manufacturing facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report from Cerulli Associates reveals that only 27% of beneficiaries plan to continue using their parents' wealth advisors after receiving an inheritance. The primary reason for this trend is not dissatisfaction, but rather that most heirs, who are often middle-aged, already have established relationships with their own financial advisors. The study highlights a communication gap, as many benefactors are reluctant to discuss estate plans with their children, leaving advisors with little opportunity to build relationships with the next generation. This trend is significant as over $120 trillion is expected to be transferred between generations in the next 25 years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A guide dog charity in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has welcomed its largest litter in three years, a group of 13 puppies nicknamed "the Baker's Dozen." The puppies, born to mother Yori, have all been given bakery-themed names such as Biscuit, Crumpet, and Ginger. The Guide Dogs charity, which runs the world's largest breeding program for assistance dogs, was surprised by the number of arrivals. These puppies will soon be placed with volunteer puppy raisers across the UK, who will socialize and prepare them for formal training to become life-changing guide dogs by 2027.</p>

          <p>London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that its most prestigious competition has been held outside of Japan. The event features over 44 professional wrestlers, known as Rikishi, competing in a five-day tournament. Organizers undertook significant logistical challenges to ensure authenticity, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. The tournament aims to share the deeply traditional and religious aspects of the sport with a Western audience, complete with English commentary to explain its complex rules and rituals.</p>

Laplanche stated that the company's revenue has more than doubled since its last fundraise in 2021, surpassing $1 billion in annualized revenue this year. While an IPO is a future goal, the current capital raise is intended to strengthen its balance sheet and provide liquidity for employees.</p>

          <p>Instagram has introduced a new default content setting for teenage users that aims to filter their feeds to show content "similar to what they'd see in a PG-13 movie." This move is part of a broader effort by social media platforms to address concerns about protecting young users from potentially harmful material. The change reflects the ongoing challenge of online age verification and content moderation, as lawmakers continue to push for regulations like the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA). While creating a safer environment for teens is a goal, the article notes the difficulty of creating separate, age-appropriate versions of the internet.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race is set for a televised debate featuring a unique slate of candidates: Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman, is currently leading in the polls with a progressive platform, while Cuomo is attempting a political comeback after resigning amid a sexual harassment scandal. The absence of incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped out after facing legal troubles, has reshaped the dynamics of the election in the nation's largest city, presenting voters with distinctly different visions for its future.</p>

          <p>Following the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, Germany has outlined its role in supporting Gaza's future, focusing on humanitarian aid and reconstruction. Chancellor Friedrich Merz confirmed that Germany will not send soldiers but has pledged an initial €29 million for immediate aid and will co-host a donor conference with Egypt to fund the rebuilding effort. The German government is also preparing a much larger, nine-figure sum for reconstruction. The ceasefire has also reignited debate within Germany about resuming full weapons exports to Israel, which were partially halted during the conflict due to the high civilian death toll.</p>

          <p>Uruguay's legislature has passed a law decriminalizing euthanasia, making it the first country in South America to do so through legislative action. The law permits a healthcare professional to assist in ending the life of a mentally competent patient suffering from an incurable illness that causes unbearable suffering, without requiring a terminal diagnosis. This positions Uruguay, a highly secular nation, at the forefront of social policy in the predominantly Catholic region. The move reinforces the country's reputation as one of the most socially liberal in Latin America, following earlier legalizations of cannabis, same-sex marriage, and abortion.</p>

          <p>In a symbolic gesture to acknowledge a historical injustice, the British Library has reissued a reader's card in the name of Irish writer Oscar Wilde. His original card was revoked in 1895 following his conviction for "gross indecency" due to his homosexual relationships, which were criminalized at the time. The new card was collected by his grandson, Merlin Holland, on what would have been Wilde's 171st birthday. The library stated the act is intended to honor Wilde's memory and recognize the immense suffering he endured, correcting a past wrong against one of the 19th century's most significant literary figures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To be considered an 'upper class' retiree in the U.S., one typically needs a net worth falling between the 75th and 90th percentiles, which ranges from approximately $714,000 to $2.1 million. This article notes that while these figures seem substantial, the actual lifestyle they support can vary greatly depending on location and drawdown strategy. For instance, a $2 million nest egg might generate about $8,300 per month using a 5% withdrawal rate, which could be considered middle class in some high-cost metropolitan areas. This highlights that financial class in retirement is more complex than a simple net worth figure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama has appointed a virtual artificial intelligence named "Diella" as a cabinet minister, a world first. Originally a digital assistant on a government portal, Diella's promotion is intended to usher in an era of transparency and incorruptibility in public administration. However, the move has raised constitutional and ethical questions, as an AI cannot be held legally or morally responsible in the same way a human can. Critics and legal experts argue that the concept has no basis in Albania's constitution and may serve as a political distraction while concentrating power, as the prime minister himself retains ultimate responsibility for the AI's functioning.</p>
