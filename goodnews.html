          <p>The latest season of Iowa Public Radio's podcast "Unsettled" delves into the multifaceted issue of gender dynamics in contemporary American society, with a specific focus on the role men play. The series examines how gender influences daily life and contributes to the persistent gender gap. By shifting the lens to include male perspectives and responsibilities, the podcast aims to foster a more comprehensive understanding of the societal structures and personal behaviors that perpetuate these inequalities. This approach seeks to uncover new avenues for dialogue and progress on the topic.</p>

          <p>Veteran guard Marcus Smart is set to join the Los Angeles Lakers after agreeing to a contract buyout with the Washington Wizards. The former Defensive Player of the Year plans to sign a two-year, $11 million deal, which includes a player option for the second year. Smart is expected to provide much-needed perimeter defense for the Lakers, complementing their offense-oriented backcourt. His addition is seen as a key move to bolster the team's depth and defensive capabilities as they aim to contend in the highly competitive Western Conference.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who previously played for the Clippers for six seasons, would bring additional playmaking and veteran leadership to the roster. The potential signing is part of the team's strategy to build a deep and versatile roster capable of competing in the Western Conference. If signed, Paul would join a guard rotation that includes James Harden and Bradley Beal, adding to the team's ball-handling depth.</p>

          <p>Germany's women's national team has reached the semifinals of Euro 2025 after a dramatic 6-5 victory on penalties against France. The German side played with only ten players for over 100 minutes after an early red card, but managed to hold on for a 1-1 draw through extra time. Goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger was the hero, saving the decisive penalty after having scored one herself earlier in the shootout. Germany will now face Spain for a place in the tournament final, showcasing remarkable resilience after a difficult group stage performance.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges by water companies in half by 2030, setting the first clear target on the issue following public outrage. This commitment comes after new data revealed that serious pollution incidents in England rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. The plan also includes measures to ban plastic-containing wet wipes and reduce phosphorus pollution from wastewater. The announcement precedes a major review of the water industry, which faces scrutiny over environmental performance and executive bonuses amid rising consumer bills.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped several feet. The incident occurred mid-song while she was suspended over the audience, startling the singer but not preventing her from quickly recovering and finishing the performance. After completing the song, Perry quipped, "Not today, Satan," to the audience. The event highlights the potential risks of complex aerial stunts commonly used in modern large-scale concert productions, though no one was injured.</p>

Despite a bizarre incident where his shot dislodged a buried golf ball, McIlroy's play moved him to eight under par.

This strategic alignment is driven by the necessity to address the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future U.S. security commitments to Europe. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, focusing on security and defense.

          <p>Spanish football club Barcelona has reportedly reached a deal in principle to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has been out of favor at his current club. The move, likely an initial loan with an option to buy, comes as Barcelona seeks to strengthen its attacking options on the left wing. Despite Rashford's inconsistent form, Barcelona is attracted by his potential and the financially advantageous loan structure, which mitigates risk. The transfer highlights a strange situation where a player deemed an outcast at a struggling Premier League club is being pursued by the La Liga champions.</p>

Australia scored two late tries to make the final scoreline more respectable, but the Lions' lead was never seriously threatened. While a win is a positive start to the series, the flat second-half performance left a feeling that the team has more to give.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Bank of America analysts makes a bold comparison, suggesting quantum computing could be the most significant human breakthrough since the discovery of fire. The technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, theoretically allows for near-instantaneous complex calculations, promising to revolutionize fields like medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence. While major milestones have been achieved, such as Google's Sycamore processor vastly outperforming supercomputers, a quantum computer has yet to solve a practical, real-world problem better than a classical one due to the instability of qubits.

While the plotters were initially deemed traitors, they are now largely remembered as heroes of the German resistance, though their motives and elitist background remain subjects of historical debate.

In its motion, the DOJ cited "extensive public interest" and stated it would work to redact victim information and other personal details to protect privacy. This move has been called for by lawmakers from both parties who argue transparency is crucial to restoring public trust.
