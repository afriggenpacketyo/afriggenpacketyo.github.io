          <p>Thirty-one workers were safely rescued after a partial tunnel collapse at a large industrial complex in Los Angeles. The incident occurred in an 18-foot diameter wastewater management tunnel, approximately five to six miles from the entry point. Despite the collapse, workers managed to scramble over debris to safety, and all were brought out without visible injuries. Los Angeles Fire Department Interim Chief Ronnie Villanueva and Mayor Karen Bass expressed relief, calling it a "great outcome" to a "very scary evening." Over 100 LAFD responders, including specialized search and rescue teams, were deployed to the scene.</p>

          <p>A robot has autonomously performed realistic gallbladder surgery with 100% accuracy, marking a significant advancement in medical robotics. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University trained the machine using surgical videos, enabling it to operate with human-like expertise, even adapting to unexpected scenarios and responding to voice commands. This new system, utilizing machine learning similar to ChatGPT, can adapt to a patient's anatomy in real-time and self-correct. While the robot took longer than a human surgeon, its results were comparable to an expert, paving the way for future autonomous surgical systems in complex medical procedures.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Donald Trump publicly praised Liberian President Joseph Boakai's English-speaking skills, expressing surprise and asking where he learned to speak "so beautifully." Boakai responded that he learned in Liberia, the country's official language, a detail Trump seemed unaware of. Trump further commented that he had "people at this table who can't speak nearly as well." The exchange occurred during a meeting with West African leaders where Trump promised a shift from aid to trade, highlighting the region's valuable resources.</p>

          <p>A former Chinese central bank official suggests the yuan has the potential to become a safe-haven currency, citing its institutional credibility, commitment to stability, and strong macro fundamentals like low inflation and large foreign reserves. The argument posits that the yuan has shown reduced sensitivity to global stress indicators, including the Russia-Ukraine war and US tariffs, displaying a more "stable and neutral" performance. This perspective challenges the traditional dominance of currencies like the US dollar, yen, and Swiss franc, underscoring Beijing's ongoing efforts to internationalize its currency amidst global economic shifts.

          <p>China's weight-loss drug market is burgeoning into a US$150 billion industry, attracting numerous domestic producers. This rapid growth is fueled by the approval of a new class of effective medications, rising obesity rates, and celebrity endorsements. Innovent Biologics, based in Jiangsu province, was the first Chinese firm to secure approval for marketing a weight-loss drug in the country. The market's expansion signifies a significant opportunity for pharmaceutical companies and reflects changing health and lifestyle trends within China, with many firms actively competing for a share of this lucrative sector.

          <p>Vienna is lauded as a "renters' utopia" due to its extensive social housing stock, which comprises about 43% of the city's housing units. This includes municipally owned council housing and properties managed by limited-profit associations, catering to a broad income range. Rent levels in this sector are significantly lower than private market rates, and housing quality is often superior. The system, rooted in "Red Vienna" socialism of the 1920s, has maintained remarkable stability against privatization trends seen elsewhere. While allocation can be complex, Vienna's commitment to housing as a basic need offers a valuable policy model.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists at Beijing Institute of Technology have created the world's lightest insect brain controller, weighing just 74 milligrams, enabling them to command a cyborg bee's flight. The device, strapped to the bee's back, uses three needles to pierce its brain and generate electronic pulses that create illusions, guiding the bee to turn, advance, or retreat. This groundbreaking research achieved a 90% obedience rate from the bees. The development represents a significant leap in neuro-robotics and micro-control, opening new possibilities for understanding insect navigation and developing miniature robotic systems.</p>

WK Kellogg has faced financial struggles and debt since its 2023 spin-off from Kellanova.

Governor Rhee Chang Yong has repeatedly warned about household debt, a significant factor in the bank's monetary policy due to Korea's unique "jeonse" rental system.
