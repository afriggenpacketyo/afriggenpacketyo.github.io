          <h2>Gen Z Activists Promote Chastity and Deeper Connections at the Jersey Shore</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 12:00:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Generation Life, a Pennsylvania-based Christian activist group, recently visited the Jersey Shore to advocate for chastity before marriage among young people. The Gen Z activists engaged beachgoers in conversations about love and relationships, often framing their message as a countercultural response to the perceived superficiality of social media and modern dating culture. Rather than focusing strictly on abstinence, they define chastity as seeing a person for their whole being and fostering deeper intimacy. The article explores their approach in a setting synonymous with hedonism, highlighting the challenges and convictions of promoting a traditional message to a new generation.</p>

          <p>After a transformative trip in 2019, 36-year-old Ashley Kaye left her career, sold her home, and now lives full-time in a heavily customized Toyota Tacoma truck. She has journeyed along the Pan-American highway, spending an average of $1,305 per month on expenses like gas and food. Kaye invested over $50,000 to renovate the truck with a camper, solar power, and other amenities to make it livable for her self-reliant, "overlanding" lifestyle.

          <h2>Atlanta Braves' Ronald Acuña Jr. Executes Stunning Double Play with Powerful Throw</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 11:56:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. made a spectacular defensive play during a game against the New York Yankees, which his team went on to win 7-3. In the third inning, Acuña caught a fly ball deep in right field and unleashed a precise, powerful throw to third base without a bounce. The throw caught Yankees runner Jorbit Vivas, who was attempting to advance, by surprise for the final out of the inning, completing a double play. The play was lauded by both managers, with Braves manager Brian Snitker calling Acuña's accuracy "stupid" and highlighting him as a "weapon" in the outfield.</p>

          <p>Dutch cyclist Thymen Arensman secured his first-ever Tour de France stage victory in a grueling mountain stage, marking a win for the Ineos Grenadiers team. Meanwhile, the race saw a major development as Remco Evenepoel, who was third in the overall standings, was forced to abandon the Tour after struggling on the ascent of the Col du Tourmalet. Overall leader Tadej Pogačar extended his lead slightly by finishing second on the stage, just ahead of his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard. The departure of Evenepoel shifts the general classification dynamics, with Florian Lipowitz moving into the third podium position.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a bone bruise in his left knee more quickly than initially anticipated. The injury, sustained on July 2, was feared to be much more severe, but Muncy is already running and taking swings just over two weeks later. While he was originally expected to miss about six weeks, manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism for a much sooner return. Muncy's absence has been felt by the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled recently, making his speedy recovery crucial for the team as they look to regain their form in the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>The British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 world championships were finally presented with their gold medals at the London Diamond League meeting. The team was upgraded from silver after the original winners, the United States, were disqualified due to a doping admission by team member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. After a lengthy process, the British athletes—Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton—received their long-overdue medals in front of a cheering home crowd. The ceremony provided a moment of recognition for the athletes whose victory was delayed by nearly three decades.</p>

          <p>The second-quarter earnings season is underway, with early results from major companies providing a mixed but generally supportive view of the economy. Financial giants like Wells Fargo and BlackRock initially saw their stocks fall after reporting, but recovered as investors looked past headline numbers to underlying strengths, such as fee-based growth and strategic acquisitions. While some companies like Abbott Labs disappointed by not raising guidance, Wall Street analysts largely defended the long-term outlooks. The article suggests that despite some misses, the initial earnings reports, combined with moderating inflation, indicate that corporations are navigating the current economic challenges effectively.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to entrepreneur and NYU professor Scott Galloway, the worst piece of career advice is to "follow your passion," a sentiment he claims is often dispensed by those who are already wealthy. Instead of pursuing a passion blindly, Galloway advises individuals to find something they are good at that also has the potential to be financially lucrative. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and pivoting when necessary, rather than from a linear pursuit of a single interest. This approach, which involves combining personal strengths with market opportunities, is echoed by other successful leaders like Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach.</p>

          <p>After a week of intense heat, much of the United Kingdom is now under yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, bringing a risk of flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruption. An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the widespread flooding that was feared. However, the dry, parched ground from the recent heatwave increases the likelihood of surface water runoff. The unsettled weather is expected to continue, with additional alerts for heavy rain and thunderstorms extending across England, Scotland, and Wales into Monday.</p>

          <p>Spanish club Barcelona has reportedly opened talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford on an initial loan deal with an option to buy. Rashford has indicated a desire for a new challenge after being sidelined from the first team and told to train separately by manager Ruben Amorim. The 27-year-old has not been assigned a squad number for the upcoming season. For Manchester United, the move would provide significant salary relief, aiding their efforts to fund new signings after already committing over £130 million to other players this summer.</p>

His optimistic presence, as part of the largest overseas contingent at the expo, underscores a recent period of de-escalation, where both nations have agreed on a trade negotiation framework.

          <p>While Americans on average believe a net worth of $839,000 would make them financially comfortable, money experts caution that this single metric can be misleading. Certified financial planner Joy Slabaugh notes that net worth is just a snapshot in time and doesn't capture the full picture of one's financial health, such as cash flow or asset liquidity. Instead of fixating on a specific number, experts advise focusing on whether your financial habits align with your core values and goals. True financial comfort, they argue, comes from understanding what you want your money to do for you, such as providing security or freedom.</p>
