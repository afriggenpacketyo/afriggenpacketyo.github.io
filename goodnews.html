          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group announced it has accumulated approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and related digital assets, which now constitute about two-thirds of the company's liquid assets. This move reflects President Trump's increasing embrace of cryptocurrency, a pivot that has significantly grown his personal net worth while in office. The company's stock, trading as DJT, saw a rise following the news. Critics and ethics experts raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as the president could profit from policies he is actively promoting to make the U.S. a global crypto hub.

          <p>This article provides guidance for individuals considering investing $20,000 in short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) this month. It notes that current market conditions have inverted the typical rate structure, with short-term CDs often offering higher interest rates than long-term ones. Savers should consider that CDs can offer protection against market volatility and that the highest rates are often found at online banks rather than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. However, it also points out that despite lower rates, long-term CDs may yield more interest over their full term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a provider of artificial intelligence data centers, increased after the company announced plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds.

This follows a previous successful debt offering and a major investment in a new data center, signaling strong investor confidence and expansion for the company. CoreWeave, which serves major clients like Nvidia and Microsoft, has seen its stock price more than triple since its public debut in March.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo is entering the functional beverage market with the launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, set to be released this fall. The move comes just months after the company acquired the popular prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion. This new product is a strategic effort to appeal to health-conscious consumers and counteract declining soda consumption in the U.S. The prebiotic version will contain more fiber than Poppi and will be sweetened with cane sugar, aligning with a broader industry trend toward healthier ingredients.</p>

          <p>This article outlines why a reverse mortgage could be a particularly beneficial financial tool for homeowners aged 62 and older in the current economic climate. It suggests that these loans, which provide payments from home equity, can supplement income, especially for those concerned about Social Security gaps. A key advantage highlighted is that no monthly repayments are required, which is beneficial in a high-interest-rate environment. Additionally, qualifying may be easier than for other types of loans, offering a viable way for seniors to access funds amid inflation and market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

This article details three primary requirements potential candidates must meet.

Second, the debt must be primarily unsecured (like credit cards or personal loans) and fall within the program's minimum and maximum limits. Finally, the person must be willing to commit to the program's rules, which often includes closing credit accounts and participating in financial counseling. (not investment advice)</p>

Second, he recommends maintaining eye contact and standing your ground, as sharks prefer to ambush unsuspecting prey. As a final resort, de Gelder advises pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose to drive it away, rather than punching it.</p>
