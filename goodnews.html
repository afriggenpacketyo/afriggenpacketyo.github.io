          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers like Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr must significantly increase their delivery volumes in the coming months to reach their goal of breaking even by 2025. While second-quarter losses have narrowed due to a price war boosting sales, intense market competition and investor concerns about overcapacity are creating financial pressure. Nio's CEO, William Li, stated the company aims to deliver 50,000 vehicles per month in the fourth quarter, a target double its current output, to survive the highly competitive landscape.

          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting titled "Portrait of a Lady," which was looted by the Nazis during World War II, has been recovered by authorities in Argentina. The artwork by Giuseppe Ghislandi had been missing for 80 years until it was unexpectedly spotted in an online real estate listing posted by the daughter of the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing it. The discovery, prompted by Dutch journalists investigating the officer's past, has thrilled historians and the heirs of the original owner, who are seeking to recover over a thousand other missing works.</p>

The optimism in the tech sector was fueled by a federal court decision in an Alphabet antitrust case, which suggested major tech companies might successfully navigate regulatory challenges, though broader economic fears continue to weigh on the market.

The company's CEO stated that second-quarter performance exceeded expectations, attributing the success to increased customer engagement from the high-profile campaigns. One advertisement featuring Sweeney sparked a national debate but ultimately boosted brand visibility, while a clothing line with Kelce launched around the time of his engagement to Taylor Swift also captured significant public attention.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 20:14:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, stating there is no evidence of an "invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had used the obscure wartime law to expel hundreds of individuals accused of being gang members, arguing their presence constituted an incursion. The court rejected this, finding that encouraging illegal immigration is not equivalent to an armed invasion, thereby granting an injunction that blocks the use of this specific law for removing the migrants who filed the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, China, has introduced a stimulus measure offering subsidies of up to 5,000 yuan (US$700) for hosting large banquets. The policy is designed to boost local consumption by encouraging spending in the catering sector, as officials aim to stabilize economic growth. This initiative reflects the challenge local governments face in promoting spending while adhering to Beijing's broader anti-corruption campaign, which discourages extravagance. The new measures in Shaoxing are part of a wider effort to stimulate the local economy across various sectors, including retail and housing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally by freezing over $2.2 billion in federal research funding for Harvard University. The administration had withheld the funds in response to allegations of antisemitism on campus, but Judge Allison D. Burroughs found that this was done without due process and used antisemitism as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling is a significant victory for Harvard, as the frozen funds support over 900 research projects, including studies on cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart disease. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, ranchers are challenging the conventional food system by adopting regenerative agriculture and creating a direct-to-consumer business model. Faced with threats from corporate agriculture and extreme weather, the Mannix family co-founded the Old Salt Co-op, partnering with other ranches to process their livestock locally and sell beef directly through their own restaurants and online. This approach focuses on sustainable land management, such as resting pastures to improve soil health, which they believe is essential for long-term ecological and financial survival, creating a more resilient and secure local food system.</p>

          <p>Drawing from personal experience as both a former police detective and a recent car crash victim, an article outlines six crucial steps to take immediately following a collision. The first priorities are to stop the car, turn off the engine, and check for injuries, as failing to stop is a legal offense. If possible, vehicles should be moved to a safe location with hazard lights on. The article stresses the importance of calling 999 if anyone is injured, if the other driver leaves the scene, or if the accident is causing a major road obstruction.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been negotiated to prevent approximately 98,000 voters in North Carolina from being removed from the rolls, marking a victory for Democrats and voting rights groups against the Department of Justice. The DOJ, under the Trump administration, had sued the state to disqualify voters who registered without providing a driver's license or partial social security number. The new settlement allows these voters to provide the missing information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue without disenfranchising them, pending a judge's final approval.</p>

C-SPAN's traditional funding model, reliant on fees from cable and satellite providers, has been strained by the industry's shift to streaming. The expansion, which was encouraged by a U.S. Senate resolution, is seen as crucial for the network's financial stability and its public service mission.</p>

Displaying fearless and aggressive play, Anisimova overcame an early break to control the match, hitting nearly twice as many winners as unforced errors. This marks Anisimova's first US Open semifinal appearance and a significant comeback after taking a mental-health break from the sport in 2023.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District has settled a lawsuit filed five years ago by parents who alleged the district failed to provide adequate education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement will provide tutoring and other academic support to an estimated 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students over the next three school years. The lawsuit claimed that the district's remote learning plan disproportionately harmed Black and Latino students. The settlement aims to address the significant learning setbacks experienced by students during campus closures, though it comes too late for those who were in high school at the time.</p>
