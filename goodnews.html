          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a rebound, climbing more than 3%, following a significant drop triggered by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest that Tesla's investor base is largely unaffected by the drama. Reports of a potential truce brokered by Trump circulated, but a White House official denied any interest in a call with Musk. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words between the two figures.</p>

          <p>The First Liberty Institute, a legal organization focused on religious freedom, is celebrating the Supreme Court's unanimous decision in favor of the Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB). The ruling struck down Wisconsin's attempt to deny a religious tax exemption to CCB because it doesn't proselytize or serve only Catholics. The court affirmed that the government cannot decide what it means to be religious, preventing government overreach into religious life. The institute believes this decision has far-reaching implications, protecting religious charities and ministries nationwide and preventing the government from intruding on religious doctrine.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at reducing national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to enhance drone detection and identification and crack down on unlawful uses such as spying and drug smuggling. The initiative is a priority in preparation for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The order also seeks to boost U.S. drone development and commercial use, including deliveries and other purposes.</p>

          <p>Amazon is investing in automating its logistics operations, including the use of AI-powered humanoid robots for deliveries. Morgan Stanley estimates that Amazon is targeting roughly $200 billion in logistics costs for automation. These robots would deliver packages directly to customers' doors from Rivian electric vans, potentially reducing delivery times and labor costs. The company is reportedly testing these robots at a San Francisco "humanoid park." This move represents the next phase in Amazon's automation strategy, which aims to improve efficiency and market share (not investment advice).</p>

Kidd, a Hall of Fame point guard and former Knicks player, has a coaching record of 179-149 with the Mavericks. His experience and ties to the Knicks make him a potential candidate for the job.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses the anti-managerialism driving the Trump administration's policies, particularly those enacted by the Department of Government Efficiency. The author argues that this movement, aimed at dismantling the "tyranny of the bureaucracy," is rooted in the belief that a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats has usurped democracy. The essay explores how this anti-managerial revolution seeks to roll back bureaucratic control and transform institutions from government to corporations.</p>
