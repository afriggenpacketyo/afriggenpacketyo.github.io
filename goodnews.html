          <p>The UK government is proposing an expansion of the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method considered destructive, across English waters. The proposed extension would increase the prohibited area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 within the UK's offshore protected areas. This move aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed, and it follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling. The proposal is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, seeking views from the marine and fishing sectors.</p>
