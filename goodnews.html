        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NBA's free agency period has commenced with significant moves from several teams aiming to bolster their rosters for the upcoming season. The San Antonio Spurs signed center Luke Kornet to support Victor Wembanyama, while the Houston Rockets added veteran forward Dorian Finney-Smith and center Clint Capela. Other notable deals include D'Angelo Russell joining the Dallas Mavericks and Tyus Jones signing with the Orlando Magic. These early transactions indicate aggressive strategies by teams to build contending rosters, setting the stage for a dynamic and competitive season ahead.</p>

          <p>China's Tianwen-2 probe has successfully sent back its first images of the Earth and the Moon, captured from a distance of over 12 million kilometers. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) confirmed the spacecraft is in good working condition following its launch in late May. This mission milestone coincides with ground-based research in China where teams are testing autonomous robots in lava caves. These tests are designed to simulate future lunar explorations, where such robots could potentially investigate similar geological formations on the Moon's surface, advancing China's ambitious space exploration program.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political protests serve a crucial, often overlooked function: preventing the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where individuals wrongly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. Research shows people consistently underestimate public support for issues like climate action and abortion rights, leading to a "false social reality." Public demonstrations, like those following the Dobbs decision, can correct these misperceptions by making collective sentiment visible. This process builds common knowledge, showing people not only what their fellow citizens believe but also that others are aware of this shared opinion, thereby empowering dissent and challenging the status quo.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has implemented a new law requiring women, alongside men, to be subject to military conscription upon turning 18. Under the new system, both genders will enter a lottery that could compel them to serve an 11-month term, an increase from the previous four months. This change, which follows the examples of Norway and Sweden, is part of Denmark's effort to bolster its defense capabilities and meet NATO targets amid heightened security concerns in Europe. The government aims to increase the number of annual conscripts to 6,500 by 2033, with officials citing the need for greater combat power.</p>

          <p>A Japan Airlines flight from Shanghai to Tokyo was forced to make an emergency landing after experiencing a sudden, violent descent. Passengers described a terrifying experience as the aircraft, a Boeing 737-800 operated by Spring Airlines Japan, plunged from over 32,800 feet to 10,000 feet, causing oxygen masks to deploy. The flight diverted to Kansai Airport in Osaka due to an alert regarding an irregularity in the cabin's pressurization system. Fortunately, none of the 191 passengers and crew members on board were injured during the harrowing incident.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea's recent transfer activity, including the pursuit of forward Jo√£o Pedro, reflects head coach Enzo Maresca's desire to create a more versatile and unpredictable attack. Maresca's tactical system often eschews traditional full-backs in favor of numerical superiority in the midfield, but this has sometimes left the team struggling against defensive opponents. By acquiring players with different profiles, like Jo√£o Pedro who can play as a second striker and link up play, the club aims to develop multiple modes of attack. This strategy is designed to better navigate a grueling season with Champions League demands and overcome defensively organized teams.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare will now block artificial intelligence crawlers from scraping website content by default, a significant move that could impact how AI models are trained. This new policy requires website owners to opt-in to allow AI bots to access their data, giving creators more control over their content. The change addresses concerns that AI companies are extracting vast amounts of information without permission or compensation, depriving publishers of traffic and revenue. This shift puts the onus on AI developers to respect publisher preferences and could alter the dynamics of data collection for training large language models.</p>

          <p>In a rare show of cooperation, Wisconsin's Democratic Governor Tony Evers and the Republican-controlled Legislature have announced a deal on a new two-year state budget. The compromise includes middle-class income tax cuts, increased funding for the state university system, and additional money for child care and special education programs. The deal, reached after the official deadline, averts a potential political standoff in the key battleground state. This agreement marks a significant moment of bipartisanship, as both sides made concessions to finalize the state's spending plan for the next two years.</p>

          <p>This analysis posits that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary provides a potential roadmap for the national Democratic party. The author argues that Mamdani's success was built on a practical socialist platform focused on affordability, moral integrity on sensitive issues like the Israel-Palestine conflict, and a powerful volunteer-driven ground game that overcame massive spending by opponents. His campaign mobilized a diverse coalition of young, working-class voters by focusing on hope and solidarity rather than fear. The article suggests that embracing such a progressive, unapologetic vision could re-energize the party's base.</p>

          <p>Residents of Leavenworth, Kansas, a town with a long history of prisons, are actively pushing back against private prison firm CoreCivic's plan to reopen a facility to detain immigrants. The opposition is notable for its diverse coalition, which includes local activists, Catholic nuns, and even former guards from the facility, who cite its troubled history of understaffing, violence, and poor conditions. The city of Leavenworth has sued CoreCivic to block the reopening, arguing the company needs a new permit.

          <p>China has unveiled new tax incentives designed to encourage foreign companies to reinvest their profits within the country. The policy allows foreign firms to deduct 10 percent of their reinvested amount from their onshore taxes, an effort to restore investor confidence amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and E.U. This move signals Beijing's desire to appear open to foreign capital and support its local economy. The incentives can be applied retroactively to investments made since the beginning of 2025 and are part of a broader strategy to counteract slowing foreign investment.</p>

          <p>UCLA and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County are recruiting volunteers for Project Phoenix, a citizen science initiative to study how wildfire smoke affects bird populations on the West Coast. Participants, including beginners, are asked to spend ten minutes each week observing birds in a familiar location and logging their findings online. Researchers will use this data to understand how soot and poor air quality alter bird behavior, such as relocation or changes in activity. The project aims to harness "people power" to gather valuable data for conservation efforts in an era of increasing wildfires.</p>
