          <p>An infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient in the world to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using CRISPR technology. Diagnosed with severe Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase 1 deficiency (CPS1), a rare and often fatal metabolic disorder, KJ received three infusions of the experimental therapy to fix the mutated gene in his liver. So far, he has shown no serious side effects and is gaining weight while thriving in the hospital. Doctors are optimistic about the potential of personalized CRISPR treatment to address other rare genetic disorders, though KJ will need careful monitoring for the rest of his life.</p>

The new law in South Africa allowing the state to seize land without compensation has heightened concerns among Afrikaners, though the government denies racial motivation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deals to sell advanced AI chips to the UAE and Saudi Arabia have sparked debate over whether the U.S. is outsourcing the industry of the future. The deals, negotiated by Trump's AI advisors, aim to boost business for American AI companies. However, concerns have been raised about inadequate protections to prevent the technology from benefiting China and the potential for the world's biggest data centers to be located in the Middle East rather than the U.S.</p>

          <p>The FAA said that Denver air traffic control lost communications for about two minutes on Monday but was able to maintain contact through an emergency frequency. Unlike a recent incident in Newark, radar screens did not go blank in Denver. The FAA is investigating the incident. Issues like the one in Denver are not uncommon given ageing equipment, with the agency planning to complete modernization projects on many systems for at least a decade.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy opened with a three-over 74 at the US PGA Championship. His fundamental issue was technical and uncharacteristic; he hit just four of 14 fairways. Other elements of McIlroy‚Äôs game could not rescue him. Ryan Gerard surged to the top of the leaderboard at seven under par. Luke Donald produced a 67 that rolled back the years.</p>

          <p>Israel has qualified for Eurovision's grand final on Saturday, hours after protesters tried to disrupt the country's dress rehearsal. The singer clasped her hands together, then blew a kiss towards the sky when it was announced she would progress to the final. Despite the ongoing tension, her song is currently among the favourites to win, according to bookmakers. Australia's elimination was the biggest shock.</p>
