          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Cognition is set to acquire Windsurf, another AI coding company, just days after Google hired away Windsurf's CEO and senior staff in a major talent acquisition. The deal includes Windsurf's intellectual property and team, though financial terms were not disclosed. This move highlights the intense competition for top talent in the AI sector among giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI. Cognition, known for its AI coding agent Devin, assured that all new employees from Windsurf will be treated with fairness and respect as part of a unified team.</p>

          <p>Shares of space infrastructure company Rocket Lab surged nearly 11%, extending a significant rally that has seen the stock almost double in the past two months. The company's market value has now swelled to over $19 billion, fueled by a series of successful launches and a new partnership with the European Space Agency. In June alone, Rocket Lab successfully launched three of its Electron rockets, demonstrating the ability to deploy two from the same site within 48 hours. The company's CEO noted that they are now producing a new rocket every 15 days to meet growing demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer voiced his continued support for Apple CEO Tim Cook, despite recent calls for his resignation and concerns over the company's direction. Acknowledging issues like a delayed AI rollout, the retirement of COO Jeff Williams, and criticism from the Trump administration, Cramer argued that Cook's long-term success has earned him the benefit of the doubt. He emphasized the indispensability of the iPhone as a core reason to remain invested in the company. Despite Apple's stock being down nearly 16.5% year-to-date, Cramer has maintained it as a core holding in his charitable trust's portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price soared to a new all-time high, trading above $120,000 as U.S. lawmakers began deliberations on new crypto-focused legislation. The rally is fueled by significant inflows into bitcoin ETFs, which saw their largest single-day influx of 2025 last week at $1.18 billion. Analysts attribute the surge to increased institutional buying and growing investor confidence, driven by the prospect of a clearer regulatory framework in the U.S. The proposed laws, supported by the Trump administration, aim to establish federal rules for stablecoins and clarify the digital asset market.

          <p>For the second year in a row, the number of people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County has declined, with a 4% overall drop and a nearly 10% decrease in the unsheltered population. Officials attribute the progress to significant investments and a focused strategy on clearing encampments and moving individuals into temporary shelter. This marks the first time since the annual count began in 2005 that overall homelessness has fallen for two consecutive years. Despite the progress, challenges remain as the number of people in temporary shelters has increased, highlighting the ongoing need for permanent housing solutions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new deal to ensure weapons continue to flow to Ukraine, with a significant shift in funding. Under the plan, the U.S. will sell billions of dollars worth of military equipment, including Patriot air defense systems, to NATO allies, who will then provide them to Kyiv. President Trump also issued a new threat to Russia, stating that if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days, the U.S. will impose 100% secondary tariffs on countries doing business with Moscow. The move marks a strategic pivot, ensuring Ukraine receives aid without direct U.S. payment.</p>
