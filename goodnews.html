          <h2>Switzerland Implements New Food Labeling Law to Disclose Animal Mutilation Practices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Swiss law now requires food producers and sellers to disclose if imported animal products were sourced from animals subjected to painful procedures without anesthesia, such as castration or dehorning. The regulation, which also covers force-feeding for foie gras, aims to increase transparency for consumers at the point of purchase. While animal advocates argue the law doesn't go far enough, it represents a significant experiment in using consumer information to address animal welfare issues. The policy follows a similar successful law from 2000 regarding eggs from caged hens.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the enforcement of a Trump administration executive order concerning birthright citizenship. The ruling came in response to a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrant families. The decision temporarily protects the constitutional principle of birthright citizenship for all children born in the United States. The judge's order includes a seven-day stay, allowing the administration time to appeal the decision.</p>

Its capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, its flag closely resembles the American flag, and its culture has strong U.S. influences. The historical context explains why many Liberians, including its leaders, speak English with a familiar American-style intonation.</p>

          <p>At the Wimbledon tennis tournament, a unique tradition known as "the Queue" allows dedicated fans to camp out for days to purchase premium tickets at low prices. Hundreds of the best seats, including 500 for Centre Court, are reserved daily for those willing to wait in a grassy field near the venue. The Queue has developed its own vibrant culture, complete with social events, singalongs, and strict etiquette rules enforced by stewards. Many participants say the communal experience and camaraderie of the Queue is as much a part of Wimbledon as the tennis itself.</p>
