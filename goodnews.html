          <p>President Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, attended by prominent CEOs like Elon Musk and Larry Fink. Attendees reported a packed room and amusing scenes of executives sitting on the floor due to lack of seating, but also noted the president's ability to command the room's attention. Trump delivered a speech focusing on U.S. relations with the region, heavily emphasizing his domestic agenda and legacy, leaving some attendees feeling as if they had attended a Trump rally. The event was perceived as somewhat disorganized but ultimately successful in showcasing the strong relationship between the two leaders. </p>

          <p>A recent resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to pave the way for more agreements where minerals are exchanged for security or trade benefits, a concept called "minerals for muscle." The U.S. seeks to secure critical mineral supplies, challenging China's dominance in the supply chain. Experts suggest potential deals with countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while others are skeptical, citing resource nationalism. Canada has expressed a need for trade certainty rather than such an agreement. </p>
