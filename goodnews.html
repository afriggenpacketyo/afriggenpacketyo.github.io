          <p>Despite President Trump's administration resisting the release of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, several ongoing legal cases could force their disclosure. A public records lawsuit filed by Radar Online is challenging the FBI's refusal to release over 10,000 pages of documents, with an appeal expected this fall. Additionally, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a civil case involving an Epstein accuser should be unsealed. These legal pressures offer a potential path to transparency, even as political efforts have stalled.</p>

Citing a Harris Poll, the article notes that many young people now see side hustles and entrepreneurship as necessities, not choices, and view homeownership as less meaningful. The author, who founded a fintech platform, calls for better financial literacy education and for tech companies to create tools that promote long-term investment rather than exploiting financial confusion among young people. He contends that rebuilding belief in economic opportunity is crucial for the country's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully developed and deployed a new type of cryogenic steel, CHSN01, essential for constructing nuclear fusion reactors. The material addresses a critical challenge faced by the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, where existing materials proved too brittle under extreme cold and magnetic stress. This super steel can withstand temperatures near absolute zero and immense forces, positioning China as a leader in advanced materials science. The breakthrough is a significant step forward in the global quest to harness nuclear fusion for clean energy generation.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old CEO of design software company Figma, has become a tech billionaire following his company's successful stock market debut. A former Brown University student, Field dropped out after receiving a Thiel Fellowship in 2012 to co-found Figma, which aimed to make design tools more collaborative and accessible. After a proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was blocked by regulators, Figma went public, with its valuation soaring past $70 billion. Field's story highlights the path of a college dropout to industry leader, driven by a vision for cloud-based, collaborative software.</p>

Amorim stated he is now implementing a stricter culture, holding players accountable with video footage and establishing a leadership group to maintain standards. Despite the difficulties, he says the club's support gives him the belief that he can turn things around and achieve his goal of managing the team for 20 years.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Zhejiang University have developed the "Darwin Monkey," which they claim is the world's first brain-like computer composed of over two billion artificial neurons. The system is built using 960 domestically produced Darwin 3 neuromorphic chips, which mimic the structure and function of the human brain. This advanced computing system has already been used for complex tasks such as content generation, logical reasoning, and mathematics. The achievement marks a significant step in the field of brain-inspired AI, potentially accelerating progress toward more advanced forms of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler, known for his dominant but often stoic on-course demeanor, is receiving praise for his comedic cameo in the new film "Happy Gilmore 2." The article suggests that while Scheffler's consistent excellence can sometimes lack drama, his self-effacing performance in the movie presents a more fun and relatable personality. In the film, he playfully references his real-life arrest at the PGA Championship, appearing in an orange jail suit and choosing to stay in his cell for the chicken fingers. This appearance is seen as a positive image-enhancer for both the golfer and his sport.</p>

          <p>While major donors like the United States, UK, and Germany are cutting their foreign aid budgets, a few other countries, including Spain, Ireland, and South Korea, are increasing their commitments. The article highlights Spain's plan to more than double its aid budget by 2030, a move driven by long-standing public support for development assistance. This shift comes as the global development funding pot is shrinking, threatening progress on health and stability worldwide. The changing landscape could lead to a new, more collaborative model of foreign aid, less dominated by a few wealthy Western powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study led by Chinese and Canadian researchers suggests that earthquakes play a crucial role in sustaining life in Earth's deep biosphere. Scientists have discovered a vast and active ecosystem of microbes miles below the surface, but how they survive in such isolated, nutrient-poor environments has been a mystery. The research indicates that seismic events can generate hydrogen gas from water and fractured rocks. This hydrogen can then serve as a vital energy source for deep-dwelling microorganisms, effectively powering these hidden ecosystems in the planet's darkest depths and expanding our understanding of life's limits.</p>

          <p>Peter Guralnick's new biography, "The Colonel and the King," delves into the complex life of Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's long-time manager. The book aims to provide a more nuanced portrait than the common perception of Parker as a simple con man who exploited the music icon. Guralnick, a renowned rock historian, explores Parker's origins as an undocumented Dutch immigrant and his rise from carnival worker to a master of promotion. While long, the book offers a deeply researched account of the man who built the Elvis industry, presenting a more complete, if at times apologetic, view of their legendary partnership.</p>

          <p>A historical essay examines the crucial, yet undramatic, work of George Washington in the summer of 1775 as he took command of the Continental Army outside Boston. Faced with a chaotic assembly of disparate colonial militias, the Virginia gentleman had to forge a unified American army. He did so through organization, discipline, and, importantly, by transcending his own prejudices to trust talented New Englanders like Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox. This foundational leadership, built on character and judgment rather than just tactical brilliance, was essential to the eventual success of the American Revolution.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge for a pro-Palestinian protest, calling for a ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid for Gaza. The "March for Humanity" proceeded despite heavy rain after a last-minute Supreme Court decision authorized the event, overturning a police rejection based on safety concerns. The court ruled that the urgent humanitarian situation in Gaza was a compelling reason for the march. The event caused major traffic disruptions but remained peaceful, with protesters chanting for an end to the war.</p>

While the Lions secured a 2-1 series victory, the performance was considered good but not great, as they were overpowered in the final Test and lost four of the six halves of rugby played. Standout players included Tadhg Beirne, who was named player of the series, and Tom Curry for his immense physicality. The article offers a detailed breakdown of each player's contribution, from established veterans like Tadhg Furlong to emerging talents who gained valuable experience.</p>
