          <p>WorldPride 2025 concludes its inaugural Washington, D.C. celebration with a weekend parade, marking 50 years of Pride events in the city. Despite the scale of the festivities, organizers note a dampened enthusiasm due to the current political environment, particularly executive orders limiting trans rights. Several corporate sponsors declined to support the event in response to President Trump's executive order targeting "illegal DEI" initiatives. The National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park during the finale weekend sparked backlash from local officials, who viewed it as a controversial move. Despite these challenges, law enforcement is preparing for a large celebration.</p>

          <p>Experts recommend six exercises to alleviate sore and achy feet, focusing on strengthening foot muscles and improving flexibility. These exercises include foot doming, wall stretches, toe spreads, toe yoga, calf raises, and foot massages. Foot doming targets the "foot core," while wall stretches relieve pain and increase blood flow. Toe spreads and toe yoga improve flexibility and balance, while calf raises strengthen stabilizing muscles. The article suggests consulting with a healthcare provider for questions or pre-existing foot conditions. By incorporating these exercises into a daily routine, individuals can improve foot health and reduce the risk of injury.</p>

Ilya Makarov, Anastasiya Lukomskaya, and Ilya Zernov are among those who have joined German political parties to advocate for their values and contribute to their new communities. These individuals were motivated to leave Russia due to political repression and the risk of criminal prosecution for opposing the war. They hope to make a difference in Germany by participating in campaigns, organizing events, and addressing issues important to them.

          <p>Tottenham captain Son Heung-min has described sacked manager Ange Postecoglou as a "legend" who "changed the trajectory of this club." Postecoglou was sacked on Friday, just over two weeks after winning the Europa League final, ending the club's 17-year wait for silverware. Son praised Postecoglou's belief in the team and his leadership, stating that he is a better player and person because of him. Other players, including Vicario and Micky van de Ven, also paid tribute to Postecoglou. Brentford boss Thomas Frank is among the leading candidates to replace Postecoglou.</p>

However, continuity is expected in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan. Lee, from the progressive Democratic Party of Korea, is considered more friendly towards China and North Korea compared to his impeached predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol. This shift has prompted speculation about a potential recalibration in Seoul’s foreign policy towards the US, Japan, China, and North Korea.</p>
