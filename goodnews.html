          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its diabetes drug Mounjaro demonstrated superior health outcomes compared to its older treatment, Trulicity, in a major clinical trial. While Mounjaro showed a modest 8% reduction in major cardiovascular events, it significantly lowered the risk of death from any cause by 16% and provided greater kidney protection. This data strengthens Mounjaro's case as a first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients, especially as Trulicity's patent nears expiration. The results are expected to bolster insurance coverage for the more expensive but more effective drug. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's inflation rate fell to 1.8% in July, a more significant dip than economists had anticipated and down from 2% in June. This brings the rate below the European Central Bank's target, providing some relief amid economic uncertainty. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remained unchanged at 2.7%, and services inflation eased only slightly. The data comes as Germany's economy shows signs of contraction, with GDP shrinking by 0.1% in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that a trade deal with China is within reach, stating, "we have the makings of a deal." While some technical details are still being finalized, he expressed confidence in resolving the issues ahead of an August 12 tariff deadline. The negotiations, described as "tough," aim to de-escalate the trade conflict that has seen both nations impose significant duties on each other's goods. The potential agreement comes amid U.S. concerns over China's ties with Iran and its technological support for Russia.</p>

          <p>Amir Hassan, a Republican running for Congress in Michigan's 8th District, has unveiled a proposal to eliminate income taxes for first responders earning under $100,000 annually. The plan would apply to nurses, teachers, firefighters, and police officers, aiming to incentivize these professions and reward their community service. Hassan, a Navy veteran, is challenging incumbent Democrat Kristen McDonald-Rivet in a key swing district that voted for Donald Trump in 2024. The proposal is part of his platform to bring new economic strategies to a district long represented by Democrats.</p>

The effort provides a small measure of comfort to a community grieving the loss of at least 135 lives.

          <p>The World Meteorological Organization has officially certified a new world record for the longest lightning flash ever detected. The "megaflash" occurred in 2017 and stretched an incredible 515 miles across the U.S. Great Plains, from Texas to near Kansas City. This record was confirmed using advanced space-based mapping technology from geostationary satellites, which allows for more comprehensive measurement of lightning events. The discovery highlights the immense scale of electrical storms and underscores the importance of seeking shelter, as lightning can travel vast distances from its parent thunderstorm.</p>

          <h2>Failure of Recall Vote Against Opposition Lawmakers Temporarily Eases Taiwan-China Tensions</h2>

          <p>An attempt in Taiwan to recall 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers has failed, with all targeted officials retaining their seats. The recall campaign, led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), had framed the issue as a fight to "resist China, protect Taiwan." Analysts suggest that the failure of the recall has averted a potential escalation in cross-strait tensions. A successful recall might have been interpreted by Beijing as a sign of overwhelming anti-China sentiment, potentially leading to a more confrontational stance toward the island.</p>

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, aided by strong performance in its film studios and theme parks. The company's net income was significantly boosted by the sale of its stake in Hulu to Disney. However, the connectivity division saw a loss of 226,000 broadband customers, a persistent challenge for the cable industry amid heightened competition from 5G providers. While the company added a record number of mobile customers, its streaming service Peacock saw subscriber numbers remain flat at 41 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After both rocketing to fame during the pandemic, Moderna and BioNTech are now on starkly different strategic paths.

In contrast, Germany-based BioNTech has diversified, using its windfall to acquire new technologies, notably in the promising field of cancer treatment. This divergence is reflected in their stock performance and cash reserves, with investors now weighing Moderna's focused model against BioNTech's broader portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international scientific team led by China has discovered the deepest known life habitat on Earth, located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. At depths of up to 9,500 meters, researchers found extensive communities of tubeworms and molluscs. These organisms thrive in complete darkness by using chemosynthesis, a process that converts chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulphide from tectonic faults into energy. The finding challenges existing models of life at extreme limits and suggests such communities may be more widespread than previously thought.</p>

In her statement, Harris acknowledged that the party's traditional "playbook" has often failed and called for new methods and fresh thinking to address the nation's crises. This decision allows her to engage in political and policy debates from outside elected office. Allies suggest she will likely focus on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections and may be positioning herself as a key figure in reshaping the party's strategy.</p>
