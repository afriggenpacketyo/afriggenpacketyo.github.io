        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bulgaria has received the green light from the European Commission and the European Central Bank to join the Eurozone, potentially becoming the 21st member state to adopt the single currency. Both institutions assessed that Bulgaria meets the necessary requirements, paving the way for Euro adoption by January 1, 2026. This marks a significant shift from previous reports that concluded Bulgaria did not meet the convergence criteria due to high inflation. Price stability is just one of several requirements a country must fulfill to join the Eurozone, alongside limitations on government deficit, debt ratio, and exchange rate stability.</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff, the world number two, defeated fellow American Madison Keys to reach the semifinals of the French Open. Gauff won in three sets, overcoming a shaky start to find her rhythm and dominate the third set. She acknowledged that it was not an easy match and praised Keys' forehand as one of the best on tour. Gauff, who won the French Open doubles title in 2024, will face either Mirra Andreeva or Lois Boisson in the semifinals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sweden has reached an agreement to send up to 600 criminals to serve their sentences in an Estonian prison, in an effort to reduce pressure on the country's overcrowded jails. Starting in July of next year, Sweden will be able to transfer male prisoners convicted of various crimes to a prison in Tartu, Estonia. Sweden will pay 8,500 euros per inmate per month, which is less than the average cost of 11,500 euros per month in Sweden. The Swedish prison system is currently facing significant pressures due to tougher laws and sentencing related to gang-related violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paying bills on time is crucial for credit scores, but it's not the only factor, and not all payments are equal. While on-time payments are essential, many people incorrectly assume that all bill payments are reported to credit bureaus and impact their credit score. Payments like rent-to-own, private school tuition, and utilities may not be reported, and buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans may or may not influence your credit. It is important to review your credit report to understand which payments are contributing to your credit score. (not investment advice)</p>
