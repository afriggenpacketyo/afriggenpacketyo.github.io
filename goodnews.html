          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a new pilot program to accelerate the integration of electric air taxis, also known as eVTOLs, into the national airspace. The Department of Transportation announced the three-year initiative will partner with private companies and local governments to develop safety regulations and operational frameworks. This program aims to establish U.S. leadership in advanced aerial mobility by allowing piloted and unmanned aircraft to be tested for cargo delivery and emergency services before completing the full FAA certification process. Several aviation companies have already announced their intent to participate in the program.</p>

          <p>In response to historic droughts that have restricted global trade, the Panama Canal Authority is moving forward with significant investments to ensure its long-term water supply. The plans include constructing the Rio Indo dam to supplement the canal's main water source and developing a "land bridge" with a natural gas pipeline to offer an alternative transport route not dependent on water levels. These projects aim to mitigate the impacts of future climate-related disruptions on the vital waterway, which handles a substantial portion of U.S. container traffic. The infrastructure is expected to be completed over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's financial regulator has proposed allowing banks to set their own limits for contactless card payments, potentially removing the current £100 cap entirely. The move has prompted a debate, with some academics warning that eliminating the "friction point" of entering a PIN could lead to increased impulsive spending and debt accumulation. Conversely, proponents argue the change is overdue, as unlimited payments are already possible via secure smartphone wallets. Banks have indicated support for the proposal, emphasizing that they would offer customers the flexibility to set their own personal spending limits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Customs officers in Hamburg, Germany, arrested two men and seized over 400 kilograms of cocaine in a significant drug bust at the city's port. The operation was initiated after observant dock workers noticed the two non-employees carrying more than 20 suspicious sports bags from a ship to a car and alerted authorities. One suspect was apprehended immediately, while the second was captured after a brief manhunt involving a police helicopter. The seizure underscores Hamburg's status as a major entry point for narcotics into Europe, confirming warnings from officials about a recent "cocaine surge" on the continent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long throw-in is making a comeback as a potent offensive strategy in the Premier League, with Brentford FC emerging as its leading practitioners. The club has scored seven goals from long throws since the start of last season, significantly more than any other team in the league. This tactic, which creates chaos and unpredictability for defending teams, was highlighted in a recent match against Chelsea where a late goal from a long throw secured a draw. Pundits and coaches acknowledge the difficulty in defending against the unique angle and trajectory of these throws, proving that old-school tactics can still be highly effective.</p>

          <p>A recently signed memorandum of understanding between China's Hainan province and Hong Kong is set to create a new phase of economic cooperation. This opinion article argues that Hainan's development as a free trade port is not intended to compete with Hong Kong but to complement it. By leveraging Hong Kong's world-class financial system, legal services, and global connectivity, Hainan can attract significant cross-border investment and scale its growth. The partnership also aims to create integrated tourism and cultural opportunities, enhancing the overall economic competitiveness of southern China as a region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who led a historic legal battle for equitable funding for Maryland's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), has passed away at 81. He was the driving force behind a 15-year lawsuit that culminated in a landmark $577 million settlement in 2021, addressing decades of state underfunding. Richardson's colleagues remember him as a leader "armed with history" whose tireless advocacy not only transformed his own university but also cast a national spotlight on funding disparities faced by HBCUs across the country. His tenure saw significant growth in enrollment and campus expansion at Morgan State.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has confirmed that two tornadoes touched down in the rural landscape of San Juan County in southeastern Utah on Saturday afternoon. The first confirmed tornado was located near Montezuma Creek, while a second, radar-indicated tornado formed east of Monticello. Both storms tracked northeast across the state line into Colorado. While the tornadoes prompted warnings about flying debris and potential damage to mobile homes and vehicles, they moved through largely unpopulated areas. There have been no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries resulting from the severe weather event.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a decades-long prohibition, granting working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar who reside in camps along the border. This significant policy shift is a response to severe cuts in international humanitarian aid, particularly from the United States, which have led to food shortages and rising malnutrition in the camps. The move is expected to allow refugees to become more self-sufficient, support their families, and stimulate the local economy. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the decision as a potential "regional benchmark" for rights-based refugee solutions.</p>
