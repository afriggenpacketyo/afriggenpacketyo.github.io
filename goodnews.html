          <h2>China Develops Parallel Optical Computing Chip Amid US Sanctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 00:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have achieved a milestone by developing the 'Meteor-1,' the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip. This chip aims to address the soaring computational demands of AI and data centers. With a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, it rivals advanced Nvidia GPUs. This development is particularly significant given US export controls that restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips. The article suggests that optical computing could offer a path to overcome the limitations of traditional electronic chips. The advancement is seen as crucial for China's technological self-sufficiency and global competitiveness. </p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as the attack resulted in no reported casualties, raising hopes for de-escalation. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant declines, dropping below levels seen before Israel's attack on Iran. The strike was in response to U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the missiles, preventing any casualties. Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate, with some suggesting President Trump has successfully used a 'peace through strength' strategy. The market's reaction indicates a sentiment that the situation is being contained. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's rare earth dominance is significantly supported by supplies from Myanmar, a country with a war-torn economy. Myanmar accounts for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports, particularly heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium. These elements are vital for high-tech manufacturing, including defense, aerospace, and renewables sectors. However, the extraction process in Myanmar has high environmental costs, and the country's instability poses supply chain risks for China. Disruptions in Myanmar due to civil conflict have already caused spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A brutal heat wave is expected to settle in across the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service has called it "the first significant heat wave this season," with people from the Midwest to the East Coast expected to experience record maximum and minimum temperatures. More than 150 million Americans are under extreme heat alerts, with the total number affected rising to about 200 million. The heat wave is caused by a heat dome, an area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity. Staying indoors with air conditioning and staying hydrated are key to staying safe during the heat wave.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, aiming to end the conflict between the two countries, though Iranian officials were less definitive about the agreement. Under the ceasefire, Iran would stop striking Israel, and Israel would then cease striking Iran. The conflict began with Israel launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets, prompting Iranian counterattacks on Israel. The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking sites believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The announcement's impact on the broader dispute over Iran's nuclear program remains unclear.</p>
