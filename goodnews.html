        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tech giants including Apple, Google, and Meta are advancing real-time language translation technology, moving concepts from science fiction closer to reality. Apple recently showcased a 'Live Translation' feature for its new AirPods Pro 3, which can translate several languages instantly for the listener. This development is part of a broader industry trend spurred by generative AI, with Google integrating voice-preserving translation into its Pixel phones and Meta developing similar capabilities for its smart glasses. These innovations are poised to reshape communication but also raise concerns about the future of translation professions.</p>

          <p>Millions of Facebook users who filed claims in a $725 million privacy settlement are set to receive payments over the next several weeks. The class-action lawsuit stemmed from allegations that Facebook improperly shared user data with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica. Approved claimants will receive an email notification before their payment is issued, with the average amount being approximately $29. The final payout for each individual is calculated based on the duration of their Facebook account activity between May 2007 and December 2022.</p>

          <p>England's rugby captain, Zoe Aldcroft, is set to return from a knee injury to start in the Women's World Cup quarter-final match against Scotland. Aldcroft has been sidelined since the tournament's opening game but has been named to the starting lineup as blind-side flanker. Her return is a significant boost for the team as they enter the knockout stages of the competition. England is heavily favored to win, having not lost to Scotland since 1999, and a victory would extend their record-breaking international winning streak.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Social Security trust fund is projected to be depleted around 2033, which would trigger significant automatic benefit cuts if no action is taken. A common proposal to address this is raising the retirement age, but this approach disproportionately affects lower-income workers who have shorter life expectancies. An alternative plan suggests a tiered increase, raising the retirement age only for the top 40 percent of earners while leaving it unchanged for the majority. This approach aims to ensure the program's solvency without placing a heavier burden on more vulnerable retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his first month as CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance, David Ellison has moved quickly to reshape the company's strategy. He has secured a multi-billion dollar deal for UFC streaming rights, greenlit a film based on the 'Call of Duty' video game franchise, and signed the creators of 'Stranger Things' to an exclusive agreement. These aggressive content acquisitions, alongside key executive hires, signal a long-term investment strategy focused on high-value franchises and technology. Ellison's actions follow a prolonged merger process and aim to reverse a period of underinvestment at Paramount.</p>

Officials stated that many of these unregulated items are being imported from China and pose a significant public health risk. This crackdown is part of a broader government effort to combat the rise of illegal vaping, which also presents environmental hazards due to improperly discarded devices.</p>

          <p>California's legislature is considering SB 53, a bill that would require developers of powerful 'frontier' AI models to produce public transparency reports on potential catastrophic risks. These risks include scenarios like AI-enabled bioterrorism or cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. The bill targets major companies and mandates the creation of safety frameworks and the reporting of critical safety incidents. While proponents see it as a necessary step to ensure accountability and prevent disaster, some industry groups argue it could stifle innovation with excessive compliance costs, highlighting the ongoing debate over state versus federal AI regulation.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is causing a noticeable shift in the apparel industry, particularly in the clothing resale market. Resellers report a significant influx of larger-sized clothing and a corresponding rise in demand for smaller sizes, a phenomenon they term the 'Ozempic effect.' While major clothing manufacturers have not officially announced changes, some brands catering to larger sizes are seeing demand shift from their largest offerings to slightly smaller plus-sizes. This trend is prompting a re-evaluation of inventory and production strategies across the fashion sector.</p>
