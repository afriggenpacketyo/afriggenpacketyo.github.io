          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 17:45:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup began with significantly low attendance, raising concerns about the tournament's appeal and potential implications for the upcoming 2026 World Cup. Experts attribute the poor turnout to factors such as inconvenient weekday afternoon scheduling, a lack of marketing by FIFA, and high ticket prices. The empty seats have caused embarrassment for FIFA, suggesting that more realistic ticket pricing and better marketing strategies are necessary for future events in the United States. It is important for FIFA to learn from these early setbacks to ensure the success of the World Cup next year. The large number of empty seats is a bad look for a tournament that FIFA has placed so much importance on, and they will have to make adjustments accordingly. </p>
