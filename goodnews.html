          <p>A BBC report provides a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges faced by a GP practice in Nottingham, England, during the daily 8 AM rush for appointments. Receptionists at Tudor House Medical Practice describe the high demand and frustration from patients trying to secure same-day appointments, leading to verbal abuse. The practice has implemented measures to improve access, such as online booking and a call-back system, but increasing demand and a shortage of GPs continue to create pressure. A new government deal aims to alleviate the early morning phone scramble by providing additional funding and promoting online appointments.</p>

          <p>The BBC explores the growing trend of Y2K core, which reflects nostalgia for the late 1990s and early 2000s culture. The pop-punk band South Arcade exemplifies this trend with their music, drawing inspiration from artists like Rihanna, Korn, and Justice. While some fans are original listeners revisiting the era, many younger fans find escapism in the maximalist aesthetic of the time, contrasting it with the minimalism of modern phone culture. Despite the cost-of-living crisis impacting musicians, South Arcade utilizes TikTok to connect with audiences and bring the Y2K aesthetic to a new generation.</p>

          <p>The BBC explores the trend of seeking quick fixes for stress and high cortisol levels on social media, with experts cautioning against their effectiveness. Many social media posts advise drinking cortisol cocktails or taking supplements, but these may not address the underlying causes of stress. A woman who experienced burnout found that social media hacks did not work and instead sought therapy to address childhood trauma and practice mindfulness. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing the root causes of stress, such as relationship problems or financial worries, and seeking medical advice for sudden body changes.</p>
