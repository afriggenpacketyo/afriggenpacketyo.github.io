        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to require medical schools to include nutrition courses in their curriculum to remain eligible for federal funding. Kennedy expressed concern over the lack of nutrition education in medical schools, emphasizing the need for physicians to treat illnesses with food and preventative measures rather than relying solely on medication. While details of the plan are sparse, it has garnered support from nutrition experts who have long advocated for comprehensive nutrition education in medical training. Some medical schools claim they already offer sufficient nutrition education, but a 2015 study revealed that medical students receive an average of only 19 hours of required nutrition education during their four years of study. </p>

Thirty Ink is a house-of-brands conglomerate that includes Unanimous Media, Gentleman's Cut bourbon, and Underrated Golf and Basketball. A significant portion of the revenue is attributed to Curry's partnership with Under Armour, where he serves as president of Curry Brand. The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization reached $144 million, due to low bottom-line operational costs.

          <p>Dr. Cate Shanahan identifies eight seed oils that she believes are harmful to health, including corn, canola, cottonseed, soy, sunflower, safflower, rice bran, and grape seed. She says these oils require high heat and pressure for extraction, leading to the presence of a neurotoxin called hexane. The oils contain polyunsaturated fatty acids that can degrade into toxins during heating, and the refining process removes essential nutrients. While some health agencies defend seed oils, Shanahan argues that they are commonly found in processed foods and restaurants, making them a significant source of unhealthy ingredients. </p>

          <p>The 5-year rule is an IRS regulation that affects how non-spouse beneficiaries must take distributions from an inherited annuity when the original contract owner dies. It essentially requires that the entire value of the annuity be distributed, either all at once or in multiple withdrawals, within five years of the original owner's death. This rule generally applies to non-qualified annuities, which are funded with after-tax dollars, and only comes into play when the beneficiary is not a spouse. It is important for beneficiaries to understand the tax implications, as withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. (not investment advice)</p>
