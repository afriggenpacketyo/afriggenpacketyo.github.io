          <p>The UK continues to experience a significant heatwave, with temperatures reaching up to 33.1°C in England and record warmth for the year in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Amber heat health alerts remain active for southern and eastern England, warning of potential health risks, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The heat has prompted hosepipe bans for millions and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland. The Met Office forecasts a slight dip in temperatures before a cooler, wetter front arrives early next week, bringing relief and much-needed rain.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was discovered in Niger in November 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the Viking space probe. The piece represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Tibetan Dams May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow to India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study offers preliminary evidence that China's mega-dams in Tibet may not cause the water crisis in India that many have feared. Contrary to concerns about potential droughts downstream, data collected since 2014 from two large dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, indicates an increase in water flow during the dry season. The research showed that low flows in February were up by more than 50 percent, suggesting the dams might actually be regulating water levels and providing more stability. This finding could reshape the geopolitical conversation around transboundary water resources in the region.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights the burgeoning commercial space economy in China and suggests Hong Kong is well-placed to contribute significantly to its growth. The global space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, driven by private investment in areas like satellite constellations and space manufacturing. In China, private investment in the aerospace sector is expected to skyrocket, with companies like i-Space and LandSpace already achieving major milestones, such as launching rockets into orbit. Hong Kong's financial and technological prowess could make it a vital hub for this emerging industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent article examines the reasons behind Boeing's 2015 decision to cease production of the C-17 Globemaster III, a versatile military transport aircraft. The primary factors were a lack of demand and significant U.S. defense budget cuts at the time, which made the expensive aircraft program unsustainable once the U.S. Air Force's order was fulfilled. Despite its unique capabilities, such as landing on short, undeveloped runways, new orders were scarce. Ironically, recent global conflicts have renewed interest in the C-17, prompting speculation about whether Boeing could resume its production.</p>

          <p>Several start-ups, including UK-based Better Dairy, are developing cheese made from lab-grown casein, the key protein in milk, without involving animals. The process uses genetically modified yeast in a technique called precision fermentation, which they claim can produce cheese that tastes like the real thing while avoiding the off-flavors of many plant-based alternatives. Despite a recent decline in vegan cheese sales, these companies are betting on a "silent revolution," targeting products like frozen pizza first. They aim to launch commercially within a few years, hoping to overcome regulatory hurdles and achieve price parity.</p>
