          <p>Google is rolling out its Gemini artificial intelligence assistant to its Chrome browser for all Mac and Windows users in the U.S., intensifying its competition with AI startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The integration allows users to interact with Gemini to understand webpages, manage tasks across tabs, and access Google apps like Calendar and YouTube without leaving their current page. Google is also introducing new "agentic" capabilities, enabling Gemini to perform tasks like booking appointments or ordering groceries. This move places the browser at the center of the battle for consumer AI dominance.</p>

          <p>In Long Beach, Minnesota, one of the smallest towns in the U.S. with that name, a community landmark combines a tiny chapel and a vibrant garden. The Morning Glory Gardens were established in the 1960s to beautify a swampy area, and the historic Morning Glory chapel was moved to the site in 1981. The chapel, which seats about 12 people comfortably, hosts several weddings each year and serves as a place for quiet reflection for visitors. Maintained by volunteers, the intertwined garden and chapel provide a cherished piece of tranquility for the local community.</p>

          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, asserted that smart glasses represent the next major evolution in computing devices. He envisions a future where users interact with computers through natural interfaces like voice commands, sight, and hand gestures, similar to how people interact with each other. This vision aligns with the company's recent unveiling of the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display controlled by a neural wristband. Cox's statements underscore Meta's strategic belief that wearable technology, specifically glasses, will become the primary computing platform.</p>

          <h2>Impact of Federal Reserve Rate Cut on Reverse Mortgages Explained for Retirees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 12:58:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, which has lowered conventional mortgage rates, retirees considering reverse mortgages face a more complex situation. Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond Fed policy, including lender margins and investor appetite, so they may not fall as quickly. However, lower rates can still be beneficial, as they can increase the total amount of home equity a retiree is eligible to borrow. The article advises retirees to shop around for rates and carefully consider whether a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate product best suits their financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has offered his market outlook for the final quarter of the year, predicting that any potential correction will likely be limited to 3% to 5%. He attributes this stability to under-invested money managers who are poised to buy on any decline, especially from late October onward. While acknowledging the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, he identifies the primary short-term threat to the market as escalating tensions with China over Taiwan. Long-term, he points to the $37 trillion U.S. national debt as a concern but advises investors to focus on stock fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. tariffs could lead to higher prices on popular Halloween items like costumes, decorations, and candy, many of which are manufactured overseas. A costume shop owner in Texas reported that tariffs have increased his wholesale prices by 5% to 19%, forcing him to absorb most of the cost to keep prices stable for customers. Despite the potential for price hikes, the National Retail Federation projects that Halloween spending will reach a record $13.1 billion this year. This suggests that while consumers are aware of the tariffs, they are still planning to invest in the holiday.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects, including beetles, flies, and wasps, preserved in 112-million-year-old amber in Ecuador, a first for South America. This finding helps fill a major gap in the fossil record, as most ancient amber has been found in the Northern Hemisphere. The specimens date back to the Cretaceous period, a time when flowering plants were beginning to diversify. The amber provides a "little window into the past," allowing researchers to better understand the ancient rainforest ecosystem and the evolving partnership between insects and plants during the age of dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>An in-depth analysis of fighter compensation challenges the narrative about the pay gap between boxing and the UFC. While top-tier boxers earn significantly more than their UFC counterparts, with just a few boxing stars' earnings matching the UFC's entire roster payout over several years, the distribution of money differs. Data shows that the UFC pays a lower percentage of its revenue to athletes (under 20%) compared to boxing promoters (often over 60%). However, the UFC's structure provides higher minimum pay and spreads compensation more evenly down the fight card, meaning its undercard fighters often earn more.</p>
