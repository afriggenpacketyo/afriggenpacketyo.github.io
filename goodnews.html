          <p>As the Emir of Qatar hosts President Trump, it marks the culmination of a successful effort to improve the country's global image after past accusations of funding terrorism. Qatar has invested heavily in lobbying and hosting events like the FIFA World Cup to reshape its reputation. The potential gift of a luxury jetliner to Trump has drawn criticism, with concerns raised about ethical and security implications. Despite objections from Democrats and some conservatives, Trump defends accepting the gift, highlighting Qatar's role as a mediator in the Gaza conflict and its strategic relationship with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Beijing has agreed to moderately relax export controls on some rare earth minerals, which are crucial for high-tech and aerospace industries, as part of a trade truce with the United States. This move signals China's willingness to de-escalate tensions while maintaining control over these critical resources. The agreement involves pausing or removing non-tariff countermeasures imposed since April, along with lowering most tariffs for 90 days. Following China's initial restrictions, prices of some rare earth elements had surged in the overseas market, indicating the impact of China's policy.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reduced most of their recent new tariffs on each other's imports and suspended part of the reciprocal duties for 90 days, following trade talks in Switzerland. The U.S. cut tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China reduced retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. to 10% from 125%. Both countries will retain a portion of their early-April retaliatory tariffs for further negotiation. During the talks, China agreed to suspend or remove non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals.</p>
