          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight bound for Boston experienced a bird strike shortly after taking off from Miami International Airport, forcing it to return for an emergency landing. The incident involved Flight DL1300, where birds reportedly struck one of the aircraft's engines. According to the airline and the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane landed safely back in Miami without any injuries to passengers or crew. After a delay, the flight was able to depart again, arriving in Boston approximately two hours later than its originally scheduled time. Delta has issued an apology for the inconvenience caused by the event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's head cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has indicated that the selection of the squad for the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia will be a straightforward process. He described the group as "pretty settled," with the main point of discussion likely revolving around the choice of a second spinner to back up Shoaib Bashir. McCullum confirmed that England might take as many as seven specialist seam bowlers and will not select a specialist backup wicketkeeper, with Ollie Pope able to deputize. The squad, expected to be announced next week, will also be supported by an England Lions team during the tour.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has been crowned the new men's 100m world champion in Tokyo, marking a significant moment for Jamaican sprinting. The 24-year-old's victory is the first global 100m title for a Jamaican man since the retirement of icon Usain Bolt, who was in the crowd to witness the triumph. Seville, who is coached by Bolt's former mentor Glen Mills, delivered a personal best time of 9.77 seconds to lead a Jamaican one-two finish with Kishane Thompson. This victory fulfills long-held expectations and signals a potential shift in dominance back to the Caribbean nation in men's sprinting.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley has been actively investing his NFL earnings, reportedly putting millions into various tech startups and venture capital funds. His portfolio is said to include stakes in AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. Barkley adopted a strategy early in his career to live off endorsement deals while investing his substantial contract money. This approach, which initially focused on traditional index funds, has more recently expanded to include riskier but potentially high-reward ventures in the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, calling for unity to secure a second term in government and defeat the Reform party. Speaking in Sunderland, Phillipson paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and pledged to continue her vigorous campaigning role. The contest, which also features former Cabinet colleague Lucy Powell, is viewed by some as a test of the Prime Minister's leadership. Phillipson warned against internal divisions, stating that a divided party would only benefit political rivals like Nigel Farage.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Premier League title defense has been characterized by a series of dramatic, late-game victories, drawing comparisons to the famous "Fergie Time" of Manchester United's past. Now dubbed "Arne Time" for manager Arne Slot, the team has secured all four of its league wins this season with goals scored in the final minutes, including a 100th-minute winner against Newcastle. This trend highlights the team's resilience and psychological edge, creating an aura of inevitability that can wear down opponents. While demonstrating the team is not yet at its peak performance, this winning mentality signals a formidable strength.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid adoption of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is posing a significant challenge to traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are diverting transactions that would have otherwise gone through credit cards, thus reducing key revenue streams. Financial institutions are also concerned because BNPL usage often creates a "black hole" in a consumer's credit profile, as this form of debt is not typically reported to credit bureaus. This makes it difficult for lenders to accurately assess a person's overall financial risk.</p>
