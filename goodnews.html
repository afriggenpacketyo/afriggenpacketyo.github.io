          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its second fiscal quarter, driven by strong sales in mobile phones, video gaming (including the Nintendo Switch 2 launch), and computing. Despite this recovery, the retailer maintained its full-year forecast, citing ongoing uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business. CEO Corie Barry noted that while customers are resilient, they remain deal-focused, and the company is innovating with a new third-party marketplace and in-store experiences to spur growth. The company's net income, however, decreased year-over-year, reflecting a challenging economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The distinctive smell of marijuana has become a noticeable and recurring distraction at the US Open tennis tournament, particularly around Court 17, which some Danish media have dubbed "hash-banen." Players like Casper Ruud and Maria Sakkari have voiced complaints, citing the aroma drifting from the adjacent Corona Park, where recreational cannabis is legally permitted in New York since 2021. Despite the USTA's strict no-smoking policy within the grounds, officials acknowledge they cannot control what happens outside its perimeter. This phenomenon highlights the cultural shift in New York and contributes to the tournament's unique, often chaotic, atmosphere.</p>

Strong majorities of both Democratic and Republican voters, across various demographics, expressed positive views, even amidst federal funding cuts and legal challenges from the Trump administration regarding antisemitism and admissions policies. While Democrats showed higher support for increased taxpayer funding, majorities from both parties agreed on the significant value of UC's diverse contributions to California communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Department for Transport has announced the first electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for a £3,750 discount under a new government grant scheme, aiming to encourage drivers to switch from petrol and diesel cars. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier qualify for the maximum reduction, with 26 other models receiving a £1,500 discount. The scheme, funded by £650 million over three years, seeks to make EV prices competitive with their fossil fuel counterparts. However, some critics, including the Alliance of British Drivers, argue that the upfront costs and an insufficient number of charging points remain significant barriers for many potential buyers.

          <p>Florida's controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Everglades is expected to be empty within days, following a U.S. District Judge's order to halt new detainees and wind down operations within 60 days. The judge's ruling cited potential violations of federal law regarding public input and environmental impact during the facility's hasty construction. Governor Ron DeSantis attributed the declining population to federal immigration authorities complying with the order, while environmental groups welcomed the closure of the facility, which was built at a cost of over $400 million and faced numerous complaints about its unsanitary conditions.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods exceeded fiscal second-quarter earnings and sales expectations, prompting the company to raise its full-year guidance, driven by strong comparable sales growth of 5%. Demand for new and innovative products, particularly from Nike's revamped running portfolio, contributed significantly to this performance. CEO Lauren Hobart noted no signs of consumer spending slowdown due to tariffs, which the company has offset with "surgical" price increases. The company's upcoming $2.4 billion acquisition of Foot Locker, expected to close in September, aims to make it the top athletic footwear seller in the U.S. and expand its global presence, despite Foot Locker's current struggles.

          <p>Nvidia reported robust second-quarter earnings with sales surging 56% to $46.74 billion, slightly exceeding expectations, driven by "full steam" AI infrastructure spending. CEO Jensen Huang projected $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by the decade's end, highlighting immense market opportunity. However, the positive results were tempered by significant uncertainty regarding Nvidia's future in China, following the Trump administration's ban on selling its H20 chip. While a deal to restart sales to China is pending, and Huang sees a "real possibility" for Blackwell processor sales there, the geopolitical environment continues to cast a shadow over this crucial market segment.

This strategic move aims to capitalize on the NFL's top ratings and attract new audiences, particularly as late-night television faces declining viewership and financial challenges in the streaming age. The initiative comes after a similar airing last season yielded the show's best ratings, demonstrating its potential. NBC remains committed to its late-night programs, viewing them as valuable ecosystems for promoting NBCUniversal properties and generating revenue beyond traditional ratings metrics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US economy expanded at a 3.3% annual pace in the second quarter, an upward revision from initial estimates, bouncing back after a first-quarter slump, according to new government data. This growth was primarily fueled by a sharp decline in imports, reversing a previous surge, and robust business investment in AI. However, economists note that the overall strength was somewhat illusory, with average growth at only 1.4% for the first half of the year and underlying private-sector demand remaining weak outside of AI. Concerns about the economy persist, with expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates soon to shore up growth. (not investment advice)</p>
