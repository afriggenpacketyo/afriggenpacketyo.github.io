          <p>The UK is set to sign an agreement with Mauritius, transferring sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The deal allows the US and UK to continue operating a strategically important military base on Diego Garcia for 99 years, with a potential 40-year extension, in exchange for multi-billion pound payments from Britain. Mauritius was separated from the archipelago in 1965, and has long claimed the islands were illegally taken as part of a deal for independence in 1968. Defence Secretary John Healey has emphasized the importance of the Diego Garcia base to UK and US security interests.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with conservative holdouts to push forward a massive budget package containing his second-term agenda, with House GOP leaders aiming for a vote as soon as possible. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the meeting as productive, but some Republicans remain wary of the bill's details. The budget package faces opposition from both fiscal conservatives seeking deeper spending cuts and blue-state Republicans concerned about the state and local tax deduction cap.

          <p>Leaders of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) have regained control of their headquarters after a judge declared the Trump administration's takeover "null and void". The ruling followed a lawsuit by USIP leaders after they were forcibly removed from their positions by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in March. The judge's decision reversed the Executive Order that had declared USIP "unnecessary" and terminated its leadership and staff. USIP's mission is to provide analysis, education, and resources to promote peace and reduce the chance of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts.</p>

          <p>US researchers are proposing a novel approach to combat malaria by administering malaria drugs to mosquitoes, preventing them from spreading the disease. Instead of focusing on killing mosquitoes with insecticides, the Harvard University team has identified a pair of drugs that can successfully eliminate malaria parasites within the insects. The aim is to coat bed nets with these drugs, allowing mosquitoes to absorb them through their legs. With insecticide resistance increasing, this new method offers a promising alternative for reducing malaria transmission.</p>

          <p>Some Afrikaners are refuting claims of a "White genocide" in South Africa, despite the Trump administration offering expedited refugee status to members of this White ethnic minority. While some Afrikaners claim they are victims of violence and discrimination, others, like commentator Piet Croucamp, assert that Whites remain economically the strongest group in South Africa. Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein agrees that there is no white genocide and emphasizes the importance of land sharing between Black and White farmers.

          <p>Researchers are advocating for the NHS in the UK to offer additional scans to women with dense breasts to improve cancer detection rates. A Cambridge University study found that alternative scanning methods, such as enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, could significantly increase the number of cancers detected in women with very dense breasts. Dense breasts make it harder to spot cancers using traditional mammograms. The study suggests that implementing these additional scans could identify 3,500 extra cancers per year and potentially save 700 lives.</p>
