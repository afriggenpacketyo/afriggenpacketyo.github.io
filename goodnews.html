          <p>Samsung Electronics has announced a significant $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors to a major, unnamed company. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, caused Samsung's shares to rise over 2% in early trading. The identity of the counterparty is being kept confidential at their request to protect trade secrets. This major contract comes as Samsung's foundry business faces challenges, struggling to compete in the market for high-bandwidth memory chips used in artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service took a person into custody after they climbed a fence at the U.S. Treasury Building, located adjacent to the White House. The individual dropped a bag that prompted a response from an explosive ordnance disposal team, which ultimately cleared the item as safe. The suspect was transported for a medical evaluation and will face charges for unlawful entry. The article notes this incident occurs amid heightened security concerns, referencing two prior assassination attempts on President Trump during his campaign.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice announced the success of "Operation Grayskull," an investigation that dismantled a prolific child sexual abuse network on the dark web. The operation led to the shutdown of four interconnected websites that hosted millions of files and had over 120,000 members. At least 18 individuals who led and utilized the sites have been convicted, including a key administrator labeled as one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material. The DOJ hailed the operation as one of its most successful prosecutions of this kind.</p>

          <p>China's tech hub of Shenzhen has introduced a new policy mandating leniency for researchers whose government-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The rules state that innovators should not be punished or held accountable if projects stall due to reasonable issues like technical difficulties or unforeseen market changes, provided there was no misconduct. This move is designed to encourage scientists and entrepreneurs to "boldly explore uncharted territories" without the fear of failure hindering their careers or future funding opportunities.</p>

These findings have fueled Tamil pride and sparked a conflict between the state and India's BJP-led federal government over cultural identity and historical interpretation.</p>

Despite the sell-off, he expresses his long-term conviction in the industrial conglomerate's value, viewing the dip as a buying opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>
