          <p>Linde Jacobs, a Minnesota woman, is spearheading efforts to find a cure for a rare genetic form of frontal temporal dementia (FTD) after her mother succumbed to the illness. Jacobs discovered she and her sisters carry the gene, prompting her to advocate for research and connect with Dr. Claire Clelland, a gene editing expert. She also located a fellow inmate who was a stranger that recognized her mother's condition and helped Linde get a diagnosis. Promising research at the University of Minnesota offers hope for a treatment that could prevent the onset of the disease in gene carriers.</p>
