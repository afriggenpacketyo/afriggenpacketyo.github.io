          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is facing challenges in the Tokyo assembly election, which is seen as a bellwether for the upcoming House of Councillors race. Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, is expected to perform well among independent voters. The election results are being closely watched for their potential impact on national politics, with past Tokyo assembly races influencing leadership changes and policy shifts. Key issues in the election include inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies.</p>

          <p>Actor Patrick Schwarzenegger discusses his role as Saxon Ratliff in "The White Lotus," describing the character as a "sex-obsessed, protein shake-chugging bro." He expressed initial reservations about the role but ultimately embraced the challenge, noting that creator Mike White saw a connection between his privileged background and the character. Schwarzenegger also addressed the influence of his famous parents, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, on his career, including early lessons in business and philanthropy. He emphasized his desire to carve his own path in acting and to be recognized for his talent rather than his family connections.</p>

          <p>Verbal jousting and psychological tactics have commenced ahead of the British and Irish Lions 2025 tour, with Wallaby coach Joe Schmidt and Lions general manager David Nucifora exchanging remarks. Schmidt's comments on the Lions' center partnership being comprised of southern hemisphere-born players touched on a sensitive topic for some Lions supporters. Nucifora responded with a jibe about Schmidt overthinking things, highlighting the mental sparring that is characteristic of Lions tours. The tradition of mind games on Lions tours dates back to at least 1896, with psychological tricks and trash talking being part of the competition.</p>

          <p>South Korea is set to join the global race to develop sixth-generation fighters, according to Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI). KAI's Vice-President Shin Dong-hak stated that the technologies showcased at the Paris Air Show, including 4.5-generation fighters and unmanned aerial vehicles, will become key elements in the switch to sixth-generation fighters. This move places South Korea alongside countries like China and the United States, which are also developing next-generation fighter aircraft. KAI's display at the air show included the KF-21 Boramae fighter jet, FA-50 light combat aircraft, and next-generation unmanned combat aircraft, suggesting a focus on crewed-uncrewed teaming.</p>
