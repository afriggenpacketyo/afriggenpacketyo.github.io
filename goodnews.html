          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, has asserted his party's readiness to form a new government in Wales, promising fresh energy and ideas to replace Welsh Labour, which has governed since 1999. Speaking at their annual conference, he positioned Plaid Cymru as the leading alternative, urging voters to support them to prevent Nigel Farage's Reform UK from gaining ground. The party aims to broaden its appeal beyond its traditional Welsh-speaking strongholds, emphasizing policies like a child poverty payment, while navigating a new voting system and significant competition. Despite being pro-independence, the 2026 election will not center on that issue. The article highlights Plaid's ambition to lead, even if it requires coalition building.</p>

          <p>Prince William launched a National Suicide Prevention Network, backed by a £1 million contribution from his Royal Foundation, aiming to understand root causes and provide support. On World Mental Health Day, the Prince was visibly moved during a conversation with Rhian Mannings, who founded a bereavement charity after her husband died by suicide five days after their infant son's death. Mannings shared the stigma surrounding suicide and her enduring question of 'Why didn't you speak to me?' The network will comprise 20 organizations and be chaired by Professor Ann John, focusing on collaborative efforts to tackle this complex challenge. This initiative underscores the importance of open dialogue and unified support.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines across the UK are proclaiming 'Peace within reach' and 'A moment of shared hope' following a tentative ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered by President Trump. The Daily Mirror urges the US and its allies to ensure the deal leads to a comprehensive peace settlement, warning of potential derailment. The Daily Express credits Trump with achieving the 'unthinkable' prospect of Middle East peace. However, The Daily Telegraph and Financial Times highlight remaining sticking points, including Hamas's disarmament and the composition of an international stabilization force, underscoring the fragility of the agreement. The article also briefly mentions Nigel Farage's comments on Britain's education system. The overall sentiment reflects cautious optimism for the region.</p>

          <p>After 21 years, the identity of a woman whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004 has been confirmed as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer. Her identification came through a crucial tip-off following an appeal aired on German TV, part of the international 'Operation Identify Me' campaign. Ms. Pommer, known as 'the woman with the German keys,' was discovered in sand dunes near Wassenaar with no obvious signs of injury, and the cause of death remains unexplained. This marks the fourth successful identification through the Interpol-coordinated initiative, which releases 'black notices' to the public, demonstrating the power of international collaboration in solving cold cases. The article highlights a significant breakthrough in a long-standing mystery.</p>

          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a significant discovery: adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity when bent. This breakthrough, published in Nature Physics, reveals that salt-doped ice can produce an electrical response comparable to high-performing ceramic materials. The phenomenon is attributed to flexoelectricity, where an electrical charge is generated under non-uniform strain. This research opens up promising avenues for harnessing clean power in cold environments, potentially leading to the development of low-cost energy sources in previously challenging conditions. The article highlights an innovative scientific advancement with practical implications for renewable energy.</p>

          <p>A United States federal judge has issued a temporary halt to President Donald Trump's deployment of hundreds of National Guard soldiers in Illinois, including Chicago. The Trump administration had ordered the troops to protect federal officials and facilities, particularly Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, from what it described as violent protesters. Local Democratic officials in Illinois, including Governor JB Pritzker, sued to block the deployment, accusing Trump of unconstitutional authoritarianism and spurring protests with heavy-handed operations. The judge expressed doubt over the federal government's claims of violence, stating that the deployment would 'add fuel to the fire.'

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills is anticipated to announce her campaign for the U.S. Senate next Tuesday, according to Democratic sources. Mills, a Democrat, aims to challenge long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins in what is expected to be a closely watched race in the upcoming midterm elections. Having served as governor since 2019 and previously as attorney general, Mills gained national attention for confronting President Trump over his administration's policies on transgender athletes. Her entry into the race could provide a rare opportunity for Democrats to flip a GOP-held seat and contest the Senate's Republican majority, despite a challenging national landscape.

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's victory in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race signals a potential ideological shift for the nation, marking the rise of its first female prime minister-in-waiting. An arch-conservative and nationalist, Takaichi's ascent suggests an end to the centrist pragmatism of previous administrations. Her economic vision combines fiscal expansionism with protectionist elements, aiming for state-led industrial revival and strategic investments in defense and technology to reduce reliance on China. This approach could deepen 'friendshoring' strategies with Southeast Asian economies but may also tie aid and investment more closely to strategic cooperation.
