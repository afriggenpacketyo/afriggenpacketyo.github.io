        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A writer reflects on her evolving relationship with Renaissance art, transitioning from youthful indifference to a profound connection driven by life's traumas and joys. Initially dismissing the art form as unrelatable, experiences like a violent attack and later, motherhood, opened her up to the emotional depth in works by masters like Piero della Francesca and Raphael. The article suggests that personal growth and lived experience are key to unlocking the power of historical art, allowing one to connect with the universal human emotions depicted within it.</p>

          <p>British fighter Lerone Murphy has emerged as a strong contender for the UFC featherweight title after a spectacular first-round knockout of Aaron Pico at UFC 319 in Chicago. Murphy, who accepted the fight on just three weeks' notice, used a spinning back elbow to end the bout and extend his undefeated career record to 17 wins. Following the victory, which earned him a $50,000 performance bonus, Murphy called for a championship fight against Alexander Volkanovski.

          <p>A cold case detective details the undercover operation that successfully obtained the DNA of Bryan Patrick Miller, the man later convicted of the 1990s Phoenix "canal murders." Posing as a security consultant, the detective met Miller at a Chili's restaurant under the pretense of a job offer, allowing forensics to collect his DNA from a used water glass. Despite the detective's initial skepticism that the mild-mannered Miller could be the killer, the DNA was a perfect match to evidence from the crime scenes of victims Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. Miller, known locally as the "Zombie Hunter," was subsequently arrested and sentenced to death.</p>

The collection, on loan from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, includes dozens of oil paintings and sketches. According to the gallery's deputy director, the exhibition is curated to emphasize Repin's "Russianness" and his connection to different periods of Russian history. This presentation comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed the artist, known there as Illia Riepin, as part of its own national cultural heritage, highlighting cultural tensions.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has returned to social media after a three-week silence following the mixed reception of her "Good Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle. The campaign, which played on the term "good genes," sparked a divided online debate, with some critics calling it "tone-deaf" while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. Sweeney, who has not publicly addressed the controversy, shared photos from a night out with friends. American Eagle previously released a statement clarifying the campaign's focus was strictly on their denim products and celebrating individual confidence.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood Italian restaurant famous for its celebrity clientele and old-school charm, has died at age 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. Born in the former Yugoslavia, Tana was a professional soccer player and actor before opening his restaurant in 1964, creating a late-night dining haven for Hollywood stars. The establishment became an institution, known for its discreet service, red-and-white-checkered tablecloths, and comfort-food classics. Though he sold the restaurant in 2009, its legacy as a timeless piece of Los Angeles history endures under its new ownership.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Rethinks Decades-Old "85th Percentile" Rule for Setting Road Speed Limits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 00:00:53 EDT</div>

          <p>A long-standing traffic engineering guideline known as the "85th percentile rule" is facing increased scrutiny and modification across the United States. This rule suggests speed limits should be set based on the speed that 85% of drivers naturally travel, effectively letting the fastest drivers determine the legal limit. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists. In response to rising road fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors like road use and safety risks should be considered, prompting some states and cities to adopt new, safety-focused approaches.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, capitalizing on a series of defensive and strategic mistakes by their rivals to retake sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Padres' sloppy play included three runners caught stealing in the first two innings and a costly dropped fly ball that led to two runs. Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered six shutout innings against his former team, while catcher Will Smith was instrumental in neutralizing San Diego's baserunning. The win also clinched the season series for the Dodgers, giving them a crucial tiebreaker advantage.</p>

          <p>During his trial, Bryan Patrick Miller, convicted of the Phoenix "canal murders," employed a unique defense strategy, arguing he was not guilty by reason of insanity. His lawyers contended that severe childhood abuse by his mother, a detention officer, caused him to develop dissociative amnesia, creating a violent alter ego responsible for the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. Prosecutors countered this claim by highlighting Miller's clear memory of other violent incidents. The judge acknowledged the evidence of childhood abuse but ultimately found Miller guilty and sentenced him to death for the crimes.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Propose Hypersonic Aircraft Design with a Single Pivoting Wing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 22:00:14 EDT</div>

          <p>A new Chinese design concept envisions a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a single, centrally mounted "scissor wing" that can rotate up to 90 degrees during flight. This innovative approach aims to solve the aerodynamic challenges of flying at both low and high speeds. At takeoff and subsonic speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift. As the aircraft accelerates towards Mach 5, the wing pivots to become parallel with the fuselage, transforming the entire vehicle into an efficient "waverider" shape that minimizes drag at hypersonic velocities.</p>
