          <p>In response to a reported surge in violent crime, the Trump administration has directed federal agencies to increase their law enforcement presence in Washington, D.C. The operation, coordinated by a task force established in March, involves agencies like the FBI and DEA focusing on tourist areas and crime hotspots. This move is framed as fulfilling a campaign promise to restore safety in the nation's capital, with the White House stating there will be "no safe harbor for violent criminals" under the new directive. The deployment will initially last for seven days with an option to extend as needed.</p>

After losing the first set in a tiebreak, the 22-year-old rallied to win 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-6(3). The victory marks his first ATP Masters 1000 championship and makes him the youngest American to achieve this feat since Andy Roddick in 2004.

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration's executive order on birthright citizenship from being enforced. This is the fourth court ruling to block the policy, which aims to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. The judge certified a class action for all affected children, stating the plaintiffs were highly likely to win their case on the grounds that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The administration argues the amendment's jurisdiction clause does not apply to parents without permanent legal status.</p>

The company reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a sharp turnaround from a loss in the same period last year, largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds. This performance was boosted by investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy, with several other portfolio companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, expected to go public soon.

He had launched an unsuccessful legal challenge to prevent his expulsion, arguing it was an "affront to democracy" before his appeals process was complete.

The meeting between Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is intended to produce an official peace agreement between the two nations. In his announcement, Trump highlighted that the countries have been at war for many years, resulting in thousands of deaths. He positioned the summit as a significant diplomatic achievement for his administration, which he said has been engaged with both sides for some time to end the long-standing conflict.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, confirming its identity. Experts have been tracking the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe, which has seen it move at a rate of about 100 kilometers per year over the last decade. While a warming climate is considered a contributing factor to this migration, it is not yet clear if the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are reportedly experiencing dating app fatigue and are turning to old-fashioned, in-person singles events to find partners. Companies like Date Cincy in Cincinnati are hosting events that attract hundreds of attendees looking for face-to-face connections, free from the potential misrepresentation of online profiles. This trend aligns with data showing a 42% rise in attendance at singles events and a significant drop in the stock value of dating app Bumble. Couples who have met at these events praise the ability to gauge real-life chemistry instantly.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement to avoid a court order. Tonka, a former celebrity animal actor, was found in a small cage and has since been relocated to a sanctuary. Animal rights group PETA, which initiated the legal action, praised the sentence as justice for the animal's suffering.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral GLP-1 medication, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity achieve significant weight loss in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Participants lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with a safety profile consistent with existing injectable weight loss drugs. The most common side effects reported were gastrointestinal issues like nausea and diarrhea. The company plans to submit the pill for regulatory approval later this year, which could make it a more accessible and convenient alternative to current injectable treatments by 2026.</p>

          <p>The UK government is drafting legislation to impose new geographical restrictions on serious violent and sexual offenders after they are released from prison. Instead of traditional exclusion zones that bar entry to specific areas, the new system would confine offenders to a designated area where they are permitted to be. This approach, which would be enforced with enhanced electronic tagging, is intended to provide victims with greater peace of mind by reducing the chance of accidental encounters. Critics, however, have raised concerns that the plan will add more pressure to an already strained probation service.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing federal agencies to explore regulatory changes that could permit 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity. While not an immediate change, the move could significantly broaden investment options for millions of Americans, giving them access to higher-risk, higher-reward asset classes. The private equity and cryptocurrency industries, which have long sought access to the trillions in retirement funds, have applauded the decision. The process of rewriting the rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is expected to take several months or longer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse reported mixed financial results for its second quarter, with strong sales growth offset by the negative impact of high beef prices on profits. The company's revenue of $1.51 billion beat estimates, driven by a 5.8% increase in same-store sales and higher customer traffic. However, earnings per share missed expectations due to commodity inflation, a headwind the company expects will worsen in the third quarter. To counteract these costs, the company plans a modest menu price increase later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers have begun to reduce the steep price discounts offered to consumers, following a government intervention aimed at stabilizing the market. Intense competition had driven industry-wide discounts to a record high of over 17% in recent months, threatening the profitability of a key national industry. While the pullback from the price war is seen as an encouraging sign, analysts caution that the root cause of the issue, namely significant overcapacity in the sector, remains unresolved. A sustainable recovery in pricing may therefore still be a long-term challenge. (not investment advice)</p>
