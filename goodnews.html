          <h2>Trump to Announce Medicare Drug Pricing Plan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 15:47:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to unveil a "most favored nation" plan aimed at cutting Medicare drug prices, a policy previously attempted during his first term. This initiative seeks to tie the prices of certain high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. The Biden administration abandoned a similar proposal in 2022 due to court orders and stakeholder concerns. Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has hinted at the policy's return, citing high prices for drugs like Ozempic in Europe.</p>

          <p>Here‚Äôs Looking at You, a celebrated Koreatown restaurant known for its eclectic cuisine, will close on June 13 after nearly a decade. The decision was influenced by the death of chef Jonathan Whitener in 2024, as well as the challenges of operating post-pandemic. Owner Lien Ta expressed that the restaurant would not be the same without Whitener, her collaborator. The restaurant faced additional difficulties including industry strikes and citywide wildfires, leading to financial instability. Ta plans to take time to rest and recover before considering future endeavors in the restaurant industry.</p>

          <p>The Gates Foundation will close its doors on December 31, 2045, after 25 years of operation, committing to spend down its endowment and Bill Gates' remaining personal fortune. This decision is driven by the belief that the foundation's central goals in global health and human development can be achieved in a shorter time frame. Despite the Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid, Gates remains optimistic about making radical improvements in global development, particularly with the aid of A.I. He expressed concern over the impact of aid cuts on childhood mortality and advocated for increased innovation in healthcare.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has climbed above $100,000 for the first time since February, reaching a high of $100,881.90. The surge occurred after President Trump teased a trade announcement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Analysts suggest that market uncertainty and a pro-crypto Trump administration have contributed to Bitcoin's rise. However, ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan, along with the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to cutting rates, could test Bitcoin's resilience in the future.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering a HELOC should be aware of minimum draw requirements that can affect the cost-effectiveness of this borrowing option. Lenders may require an upfront draw even if the borrower doesn't need the funds immediately, potentially incurring unnecessary interest charges. Ongoing minimum usage requirements during the draw period can also complicate repayment plans and increase interest costs. Understanding these requirements is crucial for making informed decisions about HELOCs.</p>
