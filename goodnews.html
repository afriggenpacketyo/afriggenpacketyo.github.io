          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their best day since 2008, soaring over 14% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. The health insurer's stock had been down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and a weakened financial outlook. The investment from such a prominent figure, along with new stakes from investors Michael Burry and David Tepper, has been interpreted as a major vote of confidence. Analysts suggest this move could establish a near-term trading floor for the managed care sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK supermarket chain Iceland is launching a new initiative to combat rising retail theft by offering customers a £1 reward for reporting shoplifters. Shoppers who alert staff to a theft in progress will receive the credit on their Iceland Bonus Card, a move the company hopes will help mitigate the estimated £20 million it loses to shoplifting annually. The company's executive chairman, Richard Walker, stated that this is not a victimless crime and that reducing theft could help lower prices for all customers. The announcement comes as police-recorded shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have reached their highest level in over two decades.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has officially signed 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma in a deal worth £26 million plus add-ons. The highly-rated Italy Under-19 international has signed a long-term contract with the club that runs until 2031. Leoni, who began his career at Padova, attracted interest from major Italian clubs after an impressive debut season in Serie A. The signing provides Liverpool with needed reinforcement in their central defense following the recent sale of Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen, with the transfer now pending international clearance and a work permit.</p>

          <p>American shoppers continue to purchase jewelry at a strong pace, providing a bright spot in a global market where consumer sentiment is weaker in Europe and China. Danish brand Pandora reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales for the second quarter, highlighting the American market as an outlier. This trend is also visible at the luxury end, with Cartier-owner Richemont posting a 17% jump in Americas sales. However, the industry faces headwinds from potential tariffs, particularly for brands like Pandora that manufacture heavily in Thailand, and rising costs for materials like silver and gold.

The departure follows a pressure campaign from investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, who were dissatisfied with the company's turnaround efforts. Wheeler, who became CEO in 2022, stated her decision was to allow the company to focus without the distraction of outside interest. The company, which uses technology to buy and sell homes, has seen its business model challenged by rising interest rates, though its stock has rallied significantly since hitting a low in June.</p>

          <p>Despite rising home prices nationwide, a new Zillow analysis reveals that a handful of U.S. metro areas still offer mansions for under $1 million. Cities such as Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Cleveland, Ohio, have a median price for homes over 5,000 square feet that falls below this threshold. This contrasts sharply with coastal markets like San Jose, where the median mansion is valued at $6.5 million. The data shows a significant shift from just a few years ago, when nearly half of all U.S. mansions were valued at less than $1 million, a figure that has now dropped to just three in ten.</p>

          <p>Charity founder Krish Kandiah has offered an "olive branch" to UK shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick, seeking to de-escalate a public dispute. The row began after Kandiah, during a BBC radio segment, described comments made by Jenrick about migrants as xenophobic, prompting an apology from the BBC. Kandiah has now publicly suggested they work together to address public fears over issues like housing and jobs rather than increasing anti-immigrant sentiment. He referenced previous positive collaboration with Jenrick when he was housing minister during the intake of refugees from Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Stock market activity on Friday showed a continued rotation into the health-care sector, which received a significant boost from shares of UnitedHealth. This trend occurred as momentum-driven stocks saw some pressure and new data from the University of Michigan indicated a decline in consumer sentiment for August. Consumers expressed growing concerns about future inflation and unemployment, though they also seemed to have dismissed worst-case scenarios regarding tariffs. Meanwhile, July retail sales figures met expectations, providing a mixed but stable picture of the U.S. consumer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, many households are struggling with their monthly payments. For a typical $3,000 balance, the minimum payment can range from $60 to $85, depending on the issuer's calculation method, which often involves a percentage of the balance plus interest and fees. Merely paying the minimum is a costly strategy that can trap consumers in debt for years due to compounding interest. The article outlines several strategies to escape this cycle, including balance transfers, debt consolidation loans, and negotiating with issuers through credit counseling or hardship programs.

          <p>Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of the Kingsmill brand, has agreed to acquire its rival Hovis from private equity firm Endless. The merger would create the largest bread producer in the United Kingdom, surpassing current market leader Warburtons, though the deal still requires approval from the competition watchdog. ABF stated that combining the two currently loss-making businesses would allow for significant cost-cutting and create a more competitive and profitable entity. The Unite union has responded by warning that it will not tolerate any negative impact on jobs, pay, or working conditions for its members at both companies.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard and felt across a wide area of England, including Essex, Cambridgeshire, and parts of London. The Royal Air Force confirmed that the noise was caused by three Typhoon fighter jets that were scrambled from RAF Coningsby to intercept a civilian aircraft. The plane had lost contact with air traffic control while traveling from Nice. Communications were successfully re-established, and the aircraft was safely escorted to Stansted Airport, after which the jets returned to their base. The event caused a brief public alarm, with many residents reporting that the bang shook their houses.</p>
