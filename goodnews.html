          <p>A woman whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004 has been identified as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer. Her identification is the fourth successful case for Operation Identify Me, an international police campaign launched in 2023 that uses public appeals and shared police records to name unidentified female victims of suspicious deaths. After a German TV appeal, a crucial tip led Dutch and German investigators to confirm her identity through DNA testing. The cause of her death remains unexplained as the investigation continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists from China and Spain has discovered that adding salt to ice allows it to generate electricity when subjected to non-uniform strain, a phenomenon known as flexoelectricity. The researchers found that bending salt-doped ice produced an electrical response comparable to specialized ceramic materials. This breakthrough could pave the way for developing low-cost, clean power sources in cold environments. The team successfully fabricated devices using saline ice, demonstrating its potential as a novel energy-harvesting material.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants defeated the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles 34-17, handing the Eagles their second consecutive loss. The victory was powered by impressive performances from rookies Cam Skattebo, who ran for three touchdowns, and quarterback Jaxson Dart, who threw for one touchdown and ran for another. The Giants' defense also played a key role, sacking Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts three times and securing a crucial interception. This win marks only the Giants' fourth victory against their NFC East rivals in their last 18 matchups.</p>

The measures aim to guide industry associations in establishing reasonable prices based on average production costs and to increase regulatory oversight. Authorities will warn businesses suspected of engaging in destructive price competition and can intervene with cost investigations and price inspections. The government stated that such disorderly practices are detrimental to innovation, product quality, and the overall health of the national economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have secured their place in the National League Championship Series with a thrilling 2-1 walk-off win against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4. The game, which stretched into the 11th inning, was decided by a critical throwing error from Phillies reliever Orion Kerkering on a comebacker to the mound with the bases loaded. The errant throw allowed the winning run to score, clinching the series for the Dodgers in an instant classic.

          <p>South Korean chipmakers Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix saw their share prices surge to record highs, boosted by a wave of investor enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence sector. The rally was fueled by news of a potential major deal involving OpenAI and AMD, as well as positive remarks from Nvidia's CEO about strong demand for AI technologies. SK Hynix shares jumped 10%, while Samsung rose nearly 6% as markets reopened after a holiday. The gains reflect the pivotal role South Korean companies play in supplying memory chips essential for AI development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic Governor of Maine, Janet Mills, is reportedly planning to announce her campaign for the U.S. Senate next week, setting up a major challenge against longtime Republican incumbent Susan Collins. As a term-limited governor, Mills is considered a top recruit for Democrats in one of the most anticipated contests of the upcoming midterm elections. The race in the Democratic-leaning state presents a rare opportunity for Democrats to flip a Republican-held seat, which could be crucial in determining control of the closely divided Senate.</p>

          <p>California has enacted a new law that makes it illegal for streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video to play advertisements at a volume significantly louder than the program being watched. The bill was inspired by the experience of a legislative staffer whose infant was repeatedly awakened by blaring commercials. This legislation effectively closes a loophole in the 2010 federal CALM Act, which previously only applied to broadcast and cable television. Because of California's large market, the new rule is expected to lead to changes in ad volume nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has granted a stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who has spent 22 years on death row for the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter. The stay allows the trial court to review new evidence challenging the scientific validity of the "shaken baby syndrome" diagnosis that was central to his conviction. Roberson's defense argues that the child died from pneumonia, not abuse, and that his unrecognized autism contributed to his wrongful conviction. The case highlights a growing re-evaluation of past convictions based on evolving medical science.</p>

Named Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or "sword dragon of Dorset," the dolphin-sized creature lived approximately 185 million years ago and helps fill a significant gap in the fossil record. The unique specimen features a long, sword-like snout and shows evidence of a possible cause of death from a bite to the head, likely from a larger ichthyosaur.

Additionally, the post-credits stinger reveals a new villain who is the successor to the antagonist from the original 1982 "Tron" film.
