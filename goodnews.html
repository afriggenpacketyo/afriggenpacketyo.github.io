          <p>A new NATO report indicates that for the first time, all 32 member states are projected to meet the alliance's defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also reveals that only three nations—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting a newly agreed-upon, more ambitious goal of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized that financial commitments must be translated into tangible military capabilities to ensure effective deterrence.</p>

          <p>The controversial immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have zero detainees within a few days, according to an email from a state official. The facility, which has been the subject of legal challenges that halted the intake of new detainees, was visited by President Trump and was projected to cost approximately $400 million. The head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, confirmed the imminent emptying of the center in a communication with an interfaith community group. This development comes as Governor Ron DeSantis's administration plans to open a new immigration facility called "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, forecasting sales growth to remain above 50% for the upcoming quarter, signaling continued high demand for its AI infrastructure products. Despite the strong performance, the company's stock saw a slight dip in extended trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year to $41.1 billion, fell just short of analyst expectations. The results confirm Nvidia's central role in the global AI buildout, though this quarter marked its slowest growth period in over two years. The company also announced an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Mayor Appoints New Film Liaison After Extended Delay</h2>

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, President of the Board of Public Works, to serve as the city's chief film liaison. This role, which had been vacant since she took office, is crucial for helping film and television productions navigate city bureaucracy and streamline the process of shooting in Los Angeles. The delay in filling the position had frustrated industry advocates, who viewed it as a necessary step to support local production amid increasing competition from other states and countries. The appointment aims to protect L.A.'s signature industry and retain production jobs.</p>

          <h2>Cracker Barrel Reverses Logo Redesign After Facing Conservative Backlash</h2>

          <p>Less than ten days after its debut, Cracker Barrel has reverted to its classic logo following a swift and intense backlash from conservative commentators who claimed the company had gone "woke." The controversy centered on the new, minimalist design, which critics saw as a betrayal of the chain's small-town, Southern identity. This article argues that Cracker Barrel has always been a corporate simulation of rural authenticity, designed to capitalize on nostalgia for a disappearing way of life. The author suggests the failed rebrand was not a sign of progressive politics but another step in the corporate sanding-down of genuine vernacular culture.</p>

          <p>A charity named Greater Change is tackling homelessness by providing direct, no-strings-attached cash payments to individuals at risk of losing their homes. The organization reports that 86% of the people it has supported have moved into stable housing, with the funds typically used for rent deposits, bills, or clearing debts. This approach, known as direct cash transfer, is based on international evidence suggesting that people in crisis make responsible financial choices when given agency. While the scale is small, Greater Change argues the model saves taxpayer money in the long run by preventing the higher costs associated with long-term homelessness.</p>

The new book revisits sisters Dolphin and Star, now in their 30s, as they continue to navigate life with their mother, Marigold, who has bipolar disorder. Wilson describes writing the sequel as both the "easiest and hardest" book of her career, as she felt compelled to portray a realistic, and not always happy, continuation of their lives. She reflects on her career of tackling difficult themes like mental illness and messy families, emphasizing her commitment to writing stories that are true to life.</p>

          <p>China has rapidly become the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and exporter, a trend that is fundamentally altering the global car industry. Propelled by massive government subsidies and a robust battery supply chain, companies like BYD have overtaken legacy automakers and even Tesla in production volume. This surge has led to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, which have imposed tariffs to protect their domestic industries from what they allege are anti-competitive practices. Analysts predict China will produce four out of every ten cars globally by 2030, cementing its dominance and forcing international competitors to adapt to the new landscape.

          <p>Following Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer pushed back against growing concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble. He argued that the massive AI-related spending by major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google is a worthwhile investment, not a repeat of the dot-com bust. Cramer acknowledged that while Nvidia's stock dipped slightly after its report, the underlying demand is real and driven by competent industry leaders with strong balance sheets. He compared the current moment to the early days of Amazon, suggesting that betting against this technological shift would be a mistake. (not investment advice)</p>
