          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a fourth consecutive day of gains as tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump appeared to cool down. Musk announced a tentative launch date of June 22 for Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, further boosting investor confidence. He also expressed regret over some of his recent social media posts about Trump, signaling a potential end to their public spat. The renewed focus on Tesla's robotaxi strategy and the de-escalation of political tensions contributed to the positive market response, indicating that Tesla is on the verge of a new era.</p>

          <p>Gold has risen to become the world's second-largest reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' increasing appetite for the precious metal, according to a European Central Bank report.

While gold prices have experienced a recent rally, the market has become choppy amid fluctuating U.S. tariff policies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new tyrannosauroid species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, which lived over 85 million years ago in Mongolia, representing a 'missing link' in the evolution of apex predators like the T. rex. This mid-grade tyrannosauroid, weighing around 1,700 pounds, possessed features not seen in later, more iconic tyrannosaurs, such as teeth incapable of crushing bone. The discovery, based on a skeleton found in the Gobi Desert in the 1970s, helps rewrite the family history of tyrannosaurs, showing how these Asian species eventually crossed into North America and evolved into apex predators. This new discovery has brought excitement to the paleontology community.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.4% in May on an annual basis, slightly below forecasts, suggesting that President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted consumer prices.

Economists anticipate the Federal Reserve will hold off on cutting rates until later this year due to inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target.
