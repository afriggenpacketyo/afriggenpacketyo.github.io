          <p>Nvidia has announced a landmark $5 billion investment in its competitor, Intel, marking a significant collaboration between the two semiconductor giants. The partnership will focus on developing custom chips for AI data centers and personal computers, integrating Nvidia's accelerated computing technology with Intel's CPU architecture. This move is seen as a crucial lifeline for the struggling Intel, which has faced substantial financial losses and recently saw the U.S. government take a 10% stake. The deal aims to bolster U.S. technological leadership amid growing competition from China.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects, including beetles, flies, and wasps, trapped in 112-million-year-old amber in Ecuador, a first for South America. This finding provides a rare window into the Cretaceous period, when flowering plants and insects were co-evolving, a partnership that has become one of nature's most successful. The amber fragments, which also contain ancient pollen and leaves, suggest the area was once a humid, resinous forest different from today's Amazon. Researchers believe the discovery will help unravel the biodiversity of the former supercontinent Gondwana.</p>

          <h2>Philosopher Spinoza's Approach to Managing Criticism and Emotional Turmoil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the wisdom of 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza as a guide for handling modern-day criticism and online attacks. Despite facing rejection and condemnation for his ideas, Spinoza developed a method to maintain equanimity by using reason to understand and regulate his emotions. He argued that achieving consciousness over one's feelings, a process now known as metacognition, moves emotional responses from the primitive limbic system to the rational prefrontal cortex. By observing emotions impartially, one can avoid being controlled by fear and anger, allowing for a more measured and dignified response to censure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has indicated its approval of the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett described the move as a "prudent call," even though some within the administration, including new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, had advocated for a larger half-point reduction. Hassett stated that a slow and steady approach is sensible policy, representing a good first step toward lower rates. This measured response contrasts with President Trump's previous aggressive criticism of the central bank and its chair, Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>During its first U.S. investor day, Hyundai Motor reconfirmed its ambitious growth strategy, which includes a $26 billion investment to expand its American operations between 2025 and 2028. The company aims to increase its global annual sales to 5.55 million vehicles by 2030, with the U.S. market serving as the primary "engine of growth." However, the automaker lowered its 2025 operating profit margin forecast, citing ongoing U.S. tariffs. The event was also marked by CEO José Muñoz expressing empathy for workers affected by a recent immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia.</p>

          <p>Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, with strong performance from its casual-dining brands offsetting weakness in its fine-dining segment. Same-store sales grew 5.9% at Olive Garden and 5.5% at LongHorn Steakhouse, driven by value offerings that attracted customers across all income levels. Despite this, the company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 fell short of Wall Street expectations. Darden raised its full-year revenue growth forecast but only reiterated its earnings projections, causing its stock to fall in morning trading.</p>

The seating arrangement strategically placed these influential figures next to UK political leaders, such as Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his advisors. This focus on business royalty underscores the diplomatic and economic objectives of the visit, with billions in U.S. investment into the UK being a central theme.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point interest rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. For a borrower with a $500,000 mortgage, this reduction translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $3,040. This represents a saving of about $300 per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year, which were over 7%. The article highlights how even small shifts in the Fed's policy can create significant financial relief for homebuyers and opportunities for existing homeowners to refinance.

          <p>Researchers at the University of St. Andrews have located what they describe as a "mileage clock" within the brain by studying the neural activity of running rats. They discovered specific cells in a region associated with navigation and memory that fired in a regular pattern, ticking with every few steps the animal traveled. When the environment was altered, this firing pattern became erratic, and the rats' ability to estimate distance was impaired. A similar experiment with human volunteers suggested that the human brain possesses the same internal mechanism for measuring distance traveled.</p>

Ukraine, with its extensive experience in drone warfare, would be invited to share its expertise and know-how in developing this defensive line against potential aggression.</p>

His appointment comes after a glittering career that includes two Champions League titles and numerous league championships across Europe with clubs like Porto, Chelsea, and Real Madrid. While his return is met with excitement by many fans who remember his early impact, it is also seen as a risk for both Mourinho and the club. The timing, just before presidential elections at Benfica, has led to speculation that the move is a political play by the current president, Rui Costa.</p>

With average HELOC rates falling to their lowest levels since March 2025, the monthly cost of borrowing has decreased. For a $100,000 HELOC with a 15-year draw period, the monthly payment at the current average rate of 8.05% would be approximately $959.

The expansion reflects the intense race among cloud providers to build capacity for the growing demands of artificial intelligence.

          <p>The Treasury and IRS have finalized rules from the Secure 2.0 Act that will impact how older, higher-earning workers make 401(k) catch-up contributions. Starting in 2027, workers who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year must make their catch-up contributions on a post-tax (Roth) basis, rather than pre-tax. This change was designed to help fund the legislation by generating upfront tax revenue.
