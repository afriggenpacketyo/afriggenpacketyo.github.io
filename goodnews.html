          <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom of California proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to aid the entertainment industry after President Trump called for tariffs on movies filmed overseas. The proposal, if approved, would represent the largest government subsidy program for the industry in the United States. This initiative comes as Hollywood has lost production to states and nations offering tax credits and cheaper labor. The move aims to strengthen domestic production and bring more filming back to the United States.</p>
