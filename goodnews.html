          <p>An armed man was arrested at the State Farm Stadium in Arizona, the venue for Charlie Kirk's upcoming memorial service. The individual, identified as 42-year-old Joshua Runkles, was allegedly impersonating a law enforcement officer and carrying a weapon in a prohibited area. The Secret Service, in coordination with local law enforcement, detained him after he exhibited suspicious behavior and claimed to be an officer. An investigation is ongoing to determine his motives for being at the high-security event.</p>

Kildunne, who was returning from a concussion, scored a crucial try that broke open a tense match, showcasing the skill that earned her the world player of the year award. Her dynamic play, which included beating 12 defenders and gaining 208 meters, helped England overcome a resilient French side.

          <p>While the immediate threat of flash flooding has subsided in the U.S. Southwest, another surge of monsoonal moisture is expected to bring a low-level risk back to southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico from Sunday into Monday. This follows recent deadly flooding in the region. In the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is churning and expected to strengthen into a hurricane by late Sunday. However, forecasts indicate it will remain at sea and pose no direct threat to land as it moves northeast across the ocean.</p>

          <h2>Social Psychologist Identifies Disrespect as a Key Red Flag in Romantic Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 14:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, a lack of respect is a major red flag in a relationship that can severely damage a person's self-esteem over time. In her book "Love by Design," she explains that disrespect can manifest in various ways, from small inconsiderate actions to larger behaviors like devaluing a partner's priorities or identity. Nasserzadeh emphasizes that respect is a fundamental ingredient for a relationship's survival. She advises addressing these behaviors through conversation, but notes that if the pattern continues, it may undermine the core reason people seek partnerships: to be seen and valued.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Uses "Golden Share" to Block U.S. Steel Plant Closure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 13:43:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to prevent U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. This marks the first use of "golden share" rights, a power granted to the White House as a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon. These rights give the government veto power over strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned against the shutdown, U.S. Steel reversed its decision, ensuring the facility will continue operations. (not investment advice)</p>
