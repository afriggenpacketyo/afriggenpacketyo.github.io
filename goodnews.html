          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 20:11:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Campaigning has officially commenced for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, viewed as a prelude to the upcoming House of Councillors race. All eyes are on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can maintain its seats, given his sluggish popularity and Cabinet approval ratings sometimes dipping below 30 percent. No party currently holds a majority in the 127-member assembly, making this election crucial for the balance of power in the region. The outcome of this election could significantly impact Ishiba's political standing and the LDP's future prospects. </p>

          <p>A "Trojan horse" therapy, belantamab mafodotin, will be available on the NHS in England, marking a world-first treatment for the blood cancer myeloma. This therapy delivers toxic drugs directly inside cancer cells, halting the disease for nearly three times longer than current treatments while reducing side effects. Paul Silvester, one of the first patients to receive the treatment, reported that it has been "life-changing," allowing him to plan history-themed adventures. Clinical trials have demonstrated that this therapy can halt myeloma for three years, compared to 13 months with existing therapies.</p>

          <p>Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi is spearheading an effort to lower rice prices in Japan, reminiscent of his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. This move comes after Koizumi's popularity waned following a third-place finish in the LDP leadership race. Analysts suggest his communication skills and reformist approach could benefit the LDP in upcoming elections. Koizumi has released government stockpiled rice at half the market value, drawing attention to issues in the agricultural sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles city officials have created a curfew exemption for ticket holders of indoor events and performing arts venues downtown, including the Music Center. This decision allows evening performances of "Hamlet" and "Rigoletto" to proceed despite the 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew in the civic center area. The move comes after arts organizations reported a drop in patrons due to the curfew, prompting cancellations and financial losses. However, major protests planned for Saturday have led to further cancellations and closures, highlighting the ongoing tension between public safety and cultural events.</p>
