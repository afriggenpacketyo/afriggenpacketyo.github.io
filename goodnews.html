          <h2>Exploring the Rising Rates and Shifting Definitions of Autism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:19:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the significant increase in autism diagnoses over the past two decades, examining the factors contributing to this rise. The article highlights that the expansion of diagnostic criteria, including the addition of Asperger's syndrome and PDD-NOS, has broadened the scope of what is considered autism. Additionally, increased awareness and research have led to better recognition of autism in women and adults, who were historically underdiagnosed. The piece also touches on the tensions within the autistic community regarding the diverse presentations of autism and the varying levels of support needed. Optimism score is based on a general understanding of the shifting nature of autism and the efforts to better understand and support individuals with autism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed not to freeze funds to Maine schools after the state challenged the president's demands regarding transgender rights.

Maine sued the USDA and reached a settlement to restore funding. The governor of Maine stated that the state would not tolerate bullying tactics. Optimism score is based on the state's success in defending transgender rights and maintaining school funding.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antivenom has been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. This could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites. The research focused on elapids, such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans, and kraits. The team identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has ordered the State Bar of California to revert to national exams after a testing debacle. The court also lowered the passing score on the State Bar's botched February exam. The court expressed concerns over the processes used to draft the questions, including the use of artificial intelligence. The State Bar's executive director, Leah T. Wilson, will step down in July. The decision came after many test takers urged Wilson to resign after the exam was plagued by technical glitches and irregularities.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers player Max Muncy has started wearing glasses in games to improve his sight. Muncy learned he has astigmatism in his right eye, making him slightly left-eye dominant.

Last year, Kik√© Hern√°ndez also began utilizing glasses midseason after discovering astigmatism. Optimism score is based on the potential for improved performance with the use of glasses.</p>
