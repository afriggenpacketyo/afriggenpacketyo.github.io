          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge granted bail, a decision criticized by the Department of Homeland Security. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in custody since March following his arrest in New York City. The judge's order supersedes an immigration judge's denial of asylum and order for continued detention. Khalil's attorney asserts that his detention was retaliatory for his pro-Palestinian activism and speech protected by the First Amendment, while the Department of Justice argued against the return of his green card. The terms of Khalil's release include surrendering his passport and restricting domestic travel, and he plans to hold a press conference in New York. The article reflects on the conflict between judicial and executive powers and the implications for national security, while also highlighting the personal impact on Khalil and his family. Optimism surrounding Khalil's release is tempered by the ongoing legal battles and political tensions.</p>

          <p>MLB has suspended Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and San Diego Padres manager Mike Shildt for one game each following a bench-clearing incident during their game. Padres reliever Robert Su√°rez received a three-game suspension for intentionally hitting Shohei Ohtani with a pitch. The incident was sparked after Dodgers pitcher Jack Little hit Fernando Tatis Jr. with a pitch, leading to Shildt's ejection. Tension had been building throughout the series, with Tatis being hit multiple times by Dodgers pitchers. The Padres won the game 5-3, but concerns remain about Tatis's health after the incident.</p>

          <p>The appropriateness of wearing shorts to work remains a debated topic as offices relax dress codes. While some companies allow shorts, especially during summer, others maintain a more formal standard, particularly for client-facing roles. Stylists recommend tailored shorts and advise monitoring colleagues' attire to gauge appropriateness. Some companies, like Santander, explicitly prohibit beachwear, while others, like We Are Social, embrace creative expression through clothing. The perception of shorts may also differ between men and women, and some individuals find shorts more comfortable than traditional office wear.</p>

          <p>Romance and fantasy book sales have surged, pushing UK fiction revenue above ¬£1bn, with romantasy gaining popularity on TikTok. The article explores the rise of romance fiction, particularly romantasy, and its appeal to young women, with tropes like "enemies to lovers" and a focus on female pleasure driving sales. Despite commercial growth, attitudes towards the genre remain derisive, particularly towards "spicy" titles. Some industry experts believe sexism keeps the genre from the mainstream, while others note changing attitudes due to the economic force of romance readers. The rise in sales is a positive sign.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is largely shaped by concerns about President Trump's views on defense spending and the alliance itself. Secretary General Mark Rutte is aiming to secure a commitment from European allies to increase their defense spending, a key demand of Trump. The summit will be shorter than usual, reportedly due to Trump's preferences, and will focus on areas of agreement to avoid highlighting divisions. While some European nations are increasing their defense spending, driven by both Trump's pressure and concerns about Russia, many will struggle to meet the new targets. The summit is an effort to appease Trump and maintain the alliance's unity despite differing views on trade, Russia, and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, over three months after his detention. Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested by ICE in March, sparking demonstrations. The government has not accused Khalil of a specific crime but invoked a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The judge expressed skepticism about the government's requests to keep Khalil detained, suggesting his arrest was related to his protests. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and his release comes with travel restrictions and the surrender of his passport.</p>

The author sarcastically suggests that the absence of a uniform allows agents to avoid accountability and express themselves freely through their clothing. The piece implies that the lack of a recognizable uniform undermines the rule of law and creates confusion and fear. The article uses humor to critique ICE's practices and policies.</p>

          <h2>Louisiana Law Requiring Ten Commandments in Classrooms Blocked by Court</h2>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The ruling supports civil liberties groups' arguments that the mandate violates the separation of church and state. Republicans have touted the law, arguing the Ten Commandments are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law. The court's ruling backs an order from a U.S. District Judge, who declared the mandate unconstitutional. The case is expected to make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
