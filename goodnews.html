          <p>A Republican state senator in New Jersey, Michael Testa, has introduced legislation to officially rename the Delaware Bay as "The Bay of New Jersey." The proposal, which would require state agencies to update all materials, appears to be inspired by a Trump administration order that renamed part of the Gulf of Mexico. Testa, who represents a district bordering the bay, argued that New Jersey's significant commercial and recreational fishing industries justify the name change for the vital body of water.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former middleweight world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous points decision in a cruiserweight contest in California. Paul controlled the fight against a largely passive Chavez, whose lack of engagement drew frustration from his legendary father at ringside. Despite securing the win and improving his professional record, Paul was met with jeers from the crowd, and the fight did little to silence critics who question the caliber of his opponents.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, making the state its largest shareholder and positioning the company as a potential European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This strategic move is part of a broader European Union push for technological sovereignty in the critical space communications sector.
