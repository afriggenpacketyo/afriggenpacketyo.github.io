          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported strong first-quarter operating profits but cautioned that ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China could negatively impact global container market volumes. The company, considered a bellwether for global trade, revised its 2025 container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4%, citing increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Maersk's CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the first quarter benefited from robust demand, but the company remains wary of the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite the revised outlook, Maersk maintained its 2025 profit guidance.</p>
