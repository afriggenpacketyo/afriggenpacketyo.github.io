          <p>"Jimmy Kimmel Live!" made its return to television, attracting a significant 6.26 million viewers despite facing preemptions in a substantial portion of U.S. TV households. Host Jimmy Kimmel used his monologue to address his prior suspension, clarifying remarks he had made that were critical of reactions to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Disney, the parent company, highlighted the show's success, reporting its highest rating among adults aged 18-49 in over a decade and noting that Kimmel's monologue alone garnered more than 26 million views across various digital platforms. Kimmel light-heartedly suggested that efforts to "cancel" him inadvertently led to increased viewership for the program.</p>

          <p>Parents report that their son with autism, Mason, began speaking just days after starting treatment with leucovorin, an inexpensive off-label drug typically used to ease chemotherapy side effects. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, is studying leucovorin for autism, theorizing it bypasses a folic acid transport blockage in the brain, which may contribute to neurological problems. While preliminary phase 2B studies have shown positive effects on speech, larger phase 3 trials are still needed for full FDA approval, a process the FDA has begun despite the limited data. The article notes that a significant challenge for broader adoption is the drug's generic nature, which makes it less attractive for pharmaceutical investment, even with its potential to substantially impact a percentage of autistic children.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Bears NFL franchise has achieved a record-setting valuation of $8.9 billion, following the recent sale of a 2.35% minority stake to existing team owners, a deal approved by the NFL's finance committee. This valuation significantly surpasses previous NFL minority stake records, including the San Francisco 49ers at $8.6 billion and the Philadelphia Eagles at $8.3 billion. The sold stake, originating from the estate of Andrew McKenna, was predominantly acquired by the McCaskey family, increasing their ownership to approximately 77%. The article highlights the team's substantial increase in value, having been $6.4 billion just a year prior, and notes the team's ongoing exploration of building a new fixed-roof domed stadium in Arlington Heights, which is expected to provide opportunities for year-round events and increased revenue.

          <p>The Carabao Cup fourth-round draw has unveiled a series of compelling matchups, highlighted by a significant clash between Premier League champions Liverpool and FA Cup winners Crystal Palace. Defending champions Newcastle United are set to host Tottenham in another high-profile, all-Premier League tie, while Arsenal, aiming to break a long-standing drought since their last victory in the competition in 1993, will face Brighton. In a notable development for lower-league teams, Grimsby Town, the sole remaining League Two side and recent conquerors of Manchester United, secured another home game against Premier League Brentford. The draw also promises a historic all-Welsh derby as Wrexham prepares to host Cardiff City, their first encounter since 2002, with Swansea City drawn against Manchester City.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores China's Global Governance Initiative (GGI), framing it as a strategic response to the multifaceted challenges currently confronting international governance. The article posits that despite enduring historical trends towards peace and cooperation, the world continues to grapple with a Cold War mentality, hegemonism, and protectionism. It identifies three critical deficits within existing global governance mechanisms: a severe underrepresentation of the Global South, an erosion of authoritativeness due to the disregard for the UN Charter and the imposition of unilateral sanctions, and an urgent need for enhanced effectiveness in areas like the UN 2030 Agenda and new domains such as artificial intelligence and cyberspace. China's GGI aims to address these issues by advocating for a more inclusive, equitable, and effective global system.</p>

          <p>A preliminary trial for a one-time gene therapy, AMT-130, has shown remarkable success in slowing Huntington's disease progression, with a 75% reduction over three years in high-dose patients compared to standard care. This experimental treatment, which delivers genetic instructions to turn off harmful proteins in the brain, offers hope for the 100,000 Americans affected by the neurodegenerative disorder. While the results are promising and patients tolerated the complex brain surgery well, experts caution that larger studies are needed, and FDA approval could still be years away. If approved, AMT-130 would be the first treatment to actually slow the disease's advancement rather than just manage symptoms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lithium Americas' stock experienced a dramatic surge of 95% following reports that the Trump administration is actively seeking an equity stake in the Canadian mining company. This significant development occurs as Lithium Americas is in the process of renegotiating the terms of a substantial $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy, designated for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada. The Thacker Pass project is anticipated to become one of North America's largest sources of lithium, a critical material for electric vehicle batteries. The administration's proposal for a "very small stake" is intended to establish a cash buffer and mitigate risk for taxpayers, particularly given that portions of the loan repayment are being deferred to later years. This initiative represents the White House's latest strategic effort to acquire direct ownership in the supply chain of minerals deemed critical to U.S. interests, following a similar stake acquisition in rare earth miner MP Materials.

          <p>A dramatic and high-stakes police pursuit spanning multiple counties in California reached its conclusion when an armored vehicle, specifically a BearCat, strategically rammed and pinned a suspected stolen big rig in Buena Park. The chase, which was broadcast live, involved numerous unmarked SUVs and officers from the Fontana Police Department, as the driver of the big rig persistently refused to stop. Several tense moments unfolded during the pursuit, including the big rig's passenger communicating with a pedestrian and appearing to retrieve an item from an SUV's roof. Ultimately, an officer emerged from a porthole atop the BearCat, training a rifle on the occupants, who then surrendered. Police officials highlighted the unique complexities involved in pursuing a large vehicle like a big rig, noting additional factors such as potential weapons and different access points compared to standard vehicle chases.</p>

          <p>With U.S. debt levels at record highs, many individuals are struggling to manage their financial obligations, making effective debt payoff strategies crucial. This article outlines several common pitfalls to avoid, emphasizing that good intentions alone are insufficient. Key mistakes include only making minimum payments, which barely reduces balances and accrues significant interest, and taking on new debt while trying to clear old ones, which can quickly erase progress. The article also advises against ignoring available professional help like credit counseling or debt relief companies, draining emergency funds, failing to adjust spending habits, and delaying action, as interest compounds rapidly.

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's new political thriller, "One Battle After Another," is reviewed as a fun and fizzy adaptation that explores the enduring fight for liberation across generations. The article highlights Teyana Taylor's powerful performance as the volatile leader Perfidia Beverly Hills, who heads a revolutionary group called the French 75. Leonardo DiCaprio plays her lover, Bob, a "piddly, ponytailed follower" who later becomes a single dad in hiding. The film, which feels like it was filmed tomorrow, reorients the story around race and delves into themes of ideologues versus conservatives, and loyalists versus rats, with Anderson's distinct sensibility and a marvelously uneasy score by Jonny Greenwood.</p>
