          <p>President Trump declared a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, emphasizing increased market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and the reduction of non-tariff barriers. The deal, still being finalized, includes a 10% tariff on imported goods, expected to generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. The U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a boost for trade and job creation, while Britain anticipates tariff cuts on U.K. cars and the elimination of tariffs on steel and aluminum. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to meet with a Chinese trade delegation in Switzerland to address ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Mexican business leaders and executives are praising Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan's emphasis on the necessity of a trade partnership between the U.S. and Mexico. Rowan's statements have fueled the perspective that a global trade war could position Mexico as a beneficiary amidst uncertainty, especially as companies seek manufacturing alternatives to China. The two economies are seen as complementary, with the majority of trade involving products manufactured in both countries.
