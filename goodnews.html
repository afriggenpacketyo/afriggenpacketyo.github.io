          <p>A team of Chinese scientists is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a nearly 2,000-year-old seismoscope invented by polymath Zhang Heng. The device, described in historical texts as an ornate jar with dragons that drop bronze balls to indicate an earthquake's direction, has been debated by scholars and was even removed from China's curriculum. Using modern science and new evidence, the researchers hope to restore the legendary invention's reputation and prove its sophisticated capabilities in early seismic detection. The project highlights a blend of ancient ingenuity with contemporary scientific validation.</p>

          <p>A documentary about the life of professional wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, who died at age 71, was already in production for Netflix. The project, a partnership between WWE and production company Words + Pictures, reportedly includes over 20 hours of interviews with Hogan, whose real name was Terry Bollea. This film is separate from a previously discussed biopic that was set to star Chris Hemsworth. The documentary is expected to offer fans a final, in-depth look at the career and life of the wrestler credited with significantly boosting WWE's global popularity.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport following a landing gear issue during its takeoff roll. All 173 passengers and six crew members aboard the Boeing 737 MAX 8 were safely deplaned and bussed back to the terminal. The airline confirmed the incident was a maintenance issue involving a tire, and the Denver Fire Department later extinguished a related fire. While operations at the airport were briefly halted, they have since returned to normal, and the affected passengers were scheduled to depart on a replacement aircraft.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary, an occasion marked by an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded on July 26, 1775, the agency played a crucial role in unifying the nation. The new stamps honor its history, featuring Benjamin Franklin, the first postmaster general, and depictions of postal workers. The celebration occurs amid recent discussions about the agency's future, though the newly appointed postmaster general has stated his opposition to privatization.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, though an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. The diagnosis came as a relief, as a more severe injury could have ended his season. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average and OPS, received a PRP injection and is expected to miss 10 to 14 days before potentially returning as a designated hitter. He first felt pain after making a strong throw from the outfield in a game earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Ozzy Osbourne, this article reflects on the cultural impact of the early 2000s MTV show "The Osbournes," which redefined celebrity reality television. The series presented the Black Sabbath frontman not as a rock god but as a relatable, bumbling father, creating a format that producers called a "reality sitcom." By blending the family's mundane daily life with their extraordinary fame, the show pioneered a genre that paved the way for future hits like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." The article notes how the show's unscripted, fly-on-the-wall approach captured a genuine family dynamic that resonated with millions of viewers.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold, deep ocean water to the surface. This weather pattern has resulted in persistent cloud cover and drizzle, a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, forecasters caution that the region's hottest months, September and October, are still to come.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened the existence of many establishments. Under the proposed changes, developers building new properties near existing venues would be required to soundproof the new constructions. The reforms also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and expanded outdoor areas, making it easier to open bars in disused shops and promote al fresco dining. The government hopes these changes will help revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry.</p>
