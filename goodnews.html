          <h2>European Central Bank Maintains Interest Rates Amid Trade-Related Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 08:46:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to hold its key interest rates steady, citing significant uncertainty surrounding global trade negotiations, particularly between the EU and the United States. This decision to pause follows four consecutive rate cuts earlier in the year, which were implemented to combat high inflation. While inflation in the euro area has now reached the bank's 2% target, policymakers remain cautious due to geopolitical volatility. Officials suggest that further rate adjustments will likely wait until September, pending updated economic forecasts and the outcome of the critical EU-U.S. trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 08:44:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a valuable savings tool, with top accounts offering rates that exceed current inflation levels. This article highlights that today's high rates can be locked in for the duration of the CD term, providing a secure, insured investment. It contrasts the low national average yields with the significantly higher rates available from online banks, which often have lower overhead costs. The piece also explains the phenomenon of the inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better returns than long-term ones, suggesting a laddering strategy for savers.

          <p>Garry Ringrose, a player for the British and Irish Lions, has been praised for his decision to withdraw from a major Test match against Australia due to lingering concussion symptoms. Despite being selected for his Test debut, Ringrose informed the head coach he was not feeling right, a move described as selfless and a powerful message about player safety. This incident underscores the increased focus on head injuries in rugby, supported by technology like 'smart' mouthguards and rigorous return-to-play protocols. Former players and commentators lauded the decision as a significant step forward in how seriously concussions are treated in the sport.</p>

          <p>The European Union and China have agreed to create an upgraded 'export supply mechanism' to address European concerns over Beijing's restrictions on rare earth materials. The agreement, announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is designed to quickly identify and resolve supply chain bottlenecks. This development comes after China imposed licensing requirements on rare earth exports, which disrupted some European industries. Von der Leyen stated that the new mechanism aims to restore trust in the trade relationship by ensuring a reliable supply of these critical raw materials, which is aligned with China's long-term strategic interests.</p>

          <p>Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has officially announced the launch of a new political party, co-founded with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. In a joint statement, they declared it is time for a 'real, democratic alternative' and invited supporters to an inaugural conference to shape the new entity. The party's platform focuses on a mass redistribution of wealth, nationalization of key industries like energy and water, and an end to arms sales to Israel. This move follows months of speculation after Corbyn was suspended from Labour and successfully ran as an independent in the 2024 general election.</p>

          <p>A rescue mission is in progress for three miners trapped underground following a mine collapse at the Red Chris mine in northern British Columbia. According to officials, the miners are believed to be uninjured and have successfully moved to a designated refuge station. This safe area is equipped with sufficient food, water, and ventilation to sustain them for an extended period. The mine's operator, Newmont Corp, has suspended operations while rescue efforts continue, though communication with the trapped workers has been limited since a second ground collapse further blocked access to their location.</p>

Amazon, which deals with a massive volume of returns, sees the technology as a way to efficiently screen inventory and reduce losses.

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will end its long-standing open seating policy and introduce assigned seating for all flights beginning in January 2026. The new procedure will involve passengers boarding in zones and proceeding to pre-selected seats. This change is part of the airline's evolution to offer customers more control and new options, such as purchasing extra legroom seats. When a passenger can select their seat will depend on their fare type and loyalty status. This move follows another major policy shift earlier in the year when the airline ended its free checked bag policy for non-loyalty members.</p>
