          <p>Starbucks is piloting a banana-flavored protein cold foam at five U.S. locations, paired with their iced latte. This move reflects the growing popularity of protein-enhanced foods and beverages, exemplified by celebrity-endorsed products and a $6 billion protein shake sector. As part of its "Back to Starbucks" restructuring plan, the company aims to simplify its menu by 30% by the end of fiscal year 2025 to boost sales, which have remained relatively flat. The new protein beverage is part of a larger initiative to reimagine its menu and create a more intentional customer experience, focusing on handcrafted drinks. The company hopes the new initiative will bring the company back to its glory days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk publicly regretted some of his recent social media posts concerning President Donald Trump, stating that they "went too far." This follows a public dispute between Musk and Trump over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill, which Musk opposed, leading to market concerns about Tesla and SpaceX. The feud had dissolved a tight partnership that had propelled Musk to spearhead the budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under Trump's second administration. Trump had previously indicated potential consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates challenging the bill, but later softened his stance, indicating he would be open to speaking with Musk. Musk's expression of regret signals a potential attempt to mend relations amid the fallout from their disagreement.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will remain at their current levels, even without a finalized trade deal. President Trump's statement that U.S. duties on China will total 55% is not new, comprising existing blanket tariffs plus those on specific products. The announcement followed high-level trade talks between the U.S. and China in London. Trump indicated that China's tariffs on the U.S. will remain at 10%, where they have been since a temporary agreement to pare back retaliatory duties. The situation remains subject to final approval between Trump and President Xi Jinping.</p>
