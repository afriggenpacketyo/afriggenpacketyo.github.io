          <p>Sueichi Kido, the 85-year-old secretary general of Nihon Hidankyo, Japan's Nobel Peace Prize-winning atomic bomb survivors group, has stepped down due to ill health at the organization's annual meeting. Kido, who was a survivor of the Nagasaki bombing, led the group's efforts to abolish nuclear arms, including accepting the Nobel Prize in 2017. Jiro Hamasumi, a 79-year-old in-utero atomic bomb survivor, has been selected as the new secretary general. Hamasumi previously served as the group's deputy secretary general and spoke at the UN's Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons meeting in March. The organization will continue its work towards nuclear disarmament.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives for the time being, ensuring that elections for both chambers of parliament will not occur simultaneously in July. This decision follows Yoshihiko Noda, head of Japan's main opposition party, stating he will not submit a no-confidence motion against Ishiba's Cabinet to avoid stalling progress on critical political issues. The ruling bloc, led by Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party, lacks a majority in the lower house, and a successful no-confidence motion would necessitate either dissolving the chamber or the Cabinet's resignation. The House of Councillors election is expected on July 20, amidst ongoing challenges related to U.S. tariffs and Middle East tensions.</p>

          <p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has lowered its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, bringing it to 0%, citing easing inflationary pressures. The SNB noted that inflation in Switzerland dipped into negative territory in May compared to February, primarily due to declining prices in the tourism and oil sectors. The bank projects annual inflation at 0.2% this year, rising to 0.5% next year, and 0.7% in 2027, assuming the target interest rate remains at zero. Switzerland experienced strong economic growth in the first quarter, largely due to increased exports to the United States in anticipation of future U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is one of several schools working to address the shortage of air traffic controllers in the U.S. by offering an accelerated training program that mirrors the FAA Academy. With the FAA facing a shortage of over 3,000 certified controllers, these programs allow students to begin medical and background checks early, potentially skipping the FAA Academy altogether. Graduates are eager to start their careers, willing to work overtime to meet the demands of the job. The accelerated programs aim to shorten the hiring process from years to weeks or months.</p>

          <p>With a significant heat wave expected to impact much of the United States, experts recommend taking precautions to stay cool and prevent heat-related illnesses. Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the U.S., so it's important to check the heat index, wear lightweight clothing, and seek shady environments. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include excessive sweating, weakness, and dizziness, and it's crucial to stay hydrated and take breaks. Cooling towels and submerging in water can also help lower body temperature.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth celebrations across the country face new challenges this year, including safety concerns and reduced corporate support, yet organizers remain determined to honor the day. In Bend, Oregon, initial safety concerns led to the cancellation of the annual festival, but another group revived it on a smaller scale indoors. West Virginia state employees no longer receive Juneteenth as a paid holiday, prompting organizers in Charleston to move their event to Friday. Despite these hurdles, many communities are moving forward with Juneteenth events to celebrate Black culture and excellence.</p>

The artifacts, wrapped in paper labeled "Emperor Nintoku's tomb," were recently acquired by Kokugakuin University from an art dealer, having previously been held by a collector who participated in a survey of the tomb in 1872. The Daisen Kofun is under the control of the Imperial Household Agency as the mausoleum of Emperor Nintoku, although scholarly debate persists regarding who was actually buried there.</p>

Ishiba's efforts to secure a deal on U.S. tariffs during a meeting with President Trump in Canada were unsuccessful, with the key sticking point being the 25% auto tariff. While avoiding easy concessions is politically advantageous, the lack of a deal could have economic repercussions.

          <p>Japan's decision to make high school tuition virtually free, even for private institutions, is raising concerns among educators and policy experts who fear it could lead to an exodus from public schools and exacerbate inequalities. Critics argue that the policy lacks adequate support for struggling public schools, which serve as "safety nets" for students with diverse needs. The policy, aimed at easing household financial burdens, may inadvertently undermine public schools already facing enrollment and budget challenges. Analysts emphasize the need for the government to provide resources and a clear vision for the high school system.</p>
