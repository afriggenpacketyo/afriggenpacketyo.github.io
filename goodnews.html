          <p>A federal judge has postponed the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for around 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling delays the expiration until a November hearing, with the judge criticizing the administration's actions as being based on a "preordained determination" rather than an objective review of country conditions. Most of the affected individuals have resided in the U.S. for over two decades, having been granted TPS due to natural disasters in their home countries. The administration argues that conditions have improved enough for them to return safely.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have determined that the modern potato originated from an ancient interbreeding event between a tomato ancestor and a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species from Chile around 9 million years ago. A study published in the journal *Cell* explains that a key gene from the ancient tomato, combined with a gene from the wild potato species, enabled the development of starch-rich tubers. This discovery, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, resolves a long-standing puzzle about the starchy vegetable's evolutionary history. The findings demonstrate how hybridization can spur the emergence of new traits and species.</p>

          <p>Apple announced a 10% year-over-year revenue increase to $94.04 billion for its June quarter, surpassing analyst expectations and marking its largest quarterly growth since late 2021. The strong performance was driven by record iPhone sales and a rebound in its services division, with growth noted across most geographic regions, including Greater China. Despite the positive results, the company provided little new information on its artificial intelligence strategy, which has tempered investor enthusiasm. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed the company's commitment to AI, mentioning progress on a more personalized Siri for release next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who famously escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, is being created for the South Carolina State House grounds. This will be the first monument to honor an individual African American at the state capitol, a site currently dominated by statues of White men with Confederate ties. The project, a result of a bipartisan effort, is seen by historians as a step toward completing the state's historical narrative. The 12-foot sculpture by artist Basil Watson will depict Smalls' journey from bondage to a pioneering statesman.</p>

          <p>Despite a drop in its stock price following its latest earnings report, some analysts are maintaining a buy rating on Amazon, viewing the dip as a purchasing opportunity. The company beat revenue and earnings expectations, but its guidance for third-quarter operating income was lower than anticipated, and growth in its AWS cloud unit was not as strong as competitors. The long-term investment thesis remains focused on the growth of high-margin divisions like AWS and advertising, both of which exceeded expectations. Analysts believe that as long as the company continues to improve margins by lowering costs, the stock price will ultimately follow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has unveiled plans to construct a new $200 million ballroom, a project long desired by President Donald Trump. The 90,000-square-foot addition will be built alongside a modernized East Wing and will be funded by private donations, including from the president himself. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the new venue, with a seating capacity of 650, is a "much needed" addition that will eliminate the need for tents for large events like state dinners. Construction is set to begin in September, with offices in the East Wing being temporarily relocated during the process.</p>

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has disclosed that he was suffering from a "relentlessly debilitating" case of Lyme disease throughout his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. The 44-year-old singer shared his health struggle on Instagram, explaining it was the cause of his nerve pain, fatigue, and sickness, which had led to criticism of his on-stage energy. He stated that despite the physical and mental toll, he chose to continue the tour to prove his mental tenacity and now wants to be more transparent about his struggles.

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy to make its main civil service internship scheme exclusively available to university students from poorer families. This change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase the representation of working-class individuals in Whitehall to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program. The policy defines lower socio-economic background based on parental occupation, addressing the current underrepresentation of this group in successful civil service applications.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet trade deadline, opting for minor additions rather than the blockbuster deals made by some of their National League rivals. The team addressed needs in their bullpen and outfield by acquiring veteran reliever Brock Stewart from the Minnesota Twins and outfielder Alex Call from the Washington Nationals. The front office expressed confidence in their current roster, suggesting they believe internal improvements from returning injured players will be key for their late-season push. This conservative approach contrasts with last year's more aggressive deadline strategy.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has delayed its planned closure by 45 days due to a massive outpouring of community support. Since announcing its closure, the restaurant has seen hours-long lines of customers wanting one last meal, leading to a dramatic jump in sales. Owner Cedd Moses negotiated a temporary extension with the landlord while he actively seeks a new buyer who will respect the landmark's legacy. While grateful for the surge, Moses noted that the restaurant business in L.A. remains challenging due to high costs and post-pandemic demand issues.</p>
