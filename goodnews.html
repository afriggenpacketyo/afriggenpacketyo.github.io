          <p>Snopes investigated a rumor circulating online that Iranian state TV announced a "great surprise" that the world would remember for centuries. The rumor, shared widely on social media and reported by some news outlets, lacked evidence and could not be verified through wire services. The rumor possibly originated from an X post from an account that is not affiliated with any government entity. Snopes contacted Iran's ministry of foreign affairs for clarification, but did not attach a fact-check rating due to the lack of definitive evidence. The spread of the rumor occurred amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East Coast are facing dangerously hot temperatures as a rare June heatwave persists. Multiple heat advisories have been issued from Minnesota to Maine, with heat indices expected to exceed 100F in many areas. Cities are opening cooling centers and providing resources to help residents cope with the extreme heat. Meteorologists attribute the heatwave to a heat dome, a phenomenon trapping heat and humidity, with the unusual aspect being the vast geographical area affected.</p>

          <p>England captain Ben Stokes made a key breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test at Headingley. India was building a lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2 with a 96-run advantage at the close. Brook's innings, marked by aggressive strokes and dropped catches, ended when he top-edged a hook. The match is finely poised, with both teams having momentum shifts throughout the day.

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher after the United States struck three key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's intervention would help resolve the conflict. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly lower, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major regional gainer, closing significantly higher. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's call for peaceful resolution has helped isolate it from the conflict, leading to a positive mid-term market outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships identifies five toxic phrases that trigger defiance in children. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," activate a child's fight-or-flight response. The study suggests alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries, such as explaining decisions and framing requests positively. The goal is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural by fostering respect, emotional safety, and involvement.</p>

This would be Durant's fifth team, and the Rockets were reportedly his preferred destination. The trade comes as the Rockets aim to build on their rising status in the Western Conference, while the Suns seek to revamp their roster after a disappointing season.</p>

          <p>Spain has secured an agreement with NATO to be excluded from the alliance's 5% of GDP defense spending target, according to Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Sanchez stated that such a high level of spending would be "disproportionate and unnecessary" for Spain, which can meet its NATO commitments with a 2.1% GDP allocation. Despite respecting other countries' decisions to increase defense investment, Spain will maintain its current spending level while fulfilling its obligations. Spain had previously agreed to accelerate efforts to meet NATO's existing 2% target.</p>
