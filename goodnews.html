          <p>Despite ongoing conflicts, including fighting in Gaza, airstrikes in Lebanon, and strikes within Iran, Israel's economy has demonstrated surprising resilience. The country's finances are strained by increased military spending and the mobilization of reservists, but the high-tech sector continues to thrive. To compensate for the financial burden, the government has increased taxes, including the value-added tax (VAT). While industries like tourism and manufacturing have suffered, the overall labor market remains tight, and investors appear optimistic, anticipating a resolution to the conflicts and the elimination of Iran's nuclear threat (not investment advice).</p>

Siemiatkowski believes AI can personalize and improve various financial services, moving beyond Klarna's current image as solely a "buy now, pay later" service.

This new warranty replaces Ram's current five-year or 60,000-mile warranty, which is standard for full-size pickup trucks.

          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, approving an amendment to a crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished for ending a pregnancy. The amendment passed 379-137, with supporters arguing it was cruel to prosecute women for having abortions, particularly those who are vulnerable. Under current law, doctors can legally carry out abortions up to 24 weeks, but the new measure aims to remove the threat of prosecution for women who obtain abortion pills and terminate their own pregnancies, especially in cases beyond the legal limit. Anti-abortion groups opposed the measure, arguing it would lead to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy.</p>

The article suggests that men's reluctance to engage in "messy" or emotional storytelling stems from cultural expectations and a fear of appearing unmanly. The author discusses how gossip can be a valuable social tool for building intimacy and connection, highlighting the potential for men to improve their social skills by embracing gossip. It argues that men's inability to share secrets contributes to the male loneliness epidemic, suggesting that learning to gossip could foster deeper friendships.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As tariffs increase, businesses are using "tariff engineering" to lower duty rates by changing materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit different "harmonized system codes." Although new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions exist, allowing companies to benefit through these strategic design choices. One example is the inclusion of cubic zirconia in lapel pins to classify them as jewelry instead of festive articles, avoiding a 14% tariff. While legal, this practice requires careful navigation to avoid misrepresenting product classifications, and is more challenging for heavily regulated sectors like automotive and aerospace (not investment advice).</p>
