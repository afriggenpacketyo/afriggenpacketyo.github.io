        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the more than $500 million penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil business fraud case. The court ruled that the monetary judgment constituted an "excessive fine" that violates the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. While the financial penalty was struck down, the court upheld the injunctive relief designed to curb the Trump Organization's business practices. The original lawsuit, filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, had resulted in Judge Arthur Engoron finding Trump liable for fraudulently overvaluing his assets for years.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 11:07:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Science Advances suggests that public wolf hunting in the Western U.S. has a minimal impact on reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers analyzed data from Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, finding that killing wolves did not significantly decrease the number of cattle and sheep killed by predators. According to the findings, it would require killing approximately 14 wolves to save a single cow. The study's authors suggest that non-lethal strategies may be more effective management tools for mitigating human-wildlife conflict, a contentious issue in states with rebounding wolf populations.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams has revealed her use of GLP-1 weight-loss medications, stating she turned to them after hitting a wall with traditional diet and exercise following the birth of her children. In a new campaign for the telehealth company Ro, Williams, who is now a celebrity ambassador, shared she has lost 31 pounds in eight months. She also addressed the stigma surrounding these drugs, arguing that using them is not an "easy way out" but a form of self-care that requires courage. Williams joins other public figures, like Oprah Winfrey, in openly discussing their use of these popular but controversial medications.</p>

          <p>Actor Glen Powell has publicly stated he will not pursue the iconic role of James Bond, explaining that he believes the character should be played by an authentic British actor. In an interview, the 36-year-old Texan actor expressed that while he could humorously portray a "Jimmy Bond," the role of James Bond itself belongs in the hands of a Brit. This statement comes amidst ongoing speculation about who will next portray the famous spy, a conversation that has included other actors like Pierce Brosnan, who recently joked about a potential return to the franchise under specific circumstances.</p>

The app is designed to serve both existing cable subscribers, who get access included, and cord-cutters who can now purchase ESPN's full suite of channels via streaming. An unlimited plan is available for $29.99 per month, with various bundle options including Disney+ and Hulu. This move marks a major strategic shift for Disney, making its primary linear sports content available for the first time outside the traditional pay-TV ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has reportedly won the race to sign Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze, making a decisive move after rival club Tottenham Hotspur had already agreed to terms. The transfer materialized quickly after an injury concern arose for Arsenal's Kai Havertz, prompting the club to act on its long-standing interest in Eze. A key factor in the decision was Eze's childhood connection to Arsenal, having played in their academy, which reportedly made his choice straightforward once the offer was made. The signing is seen as a major coup for Arsenal, adding a dynamic and creative option to their attack.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have released further details of their recent trade agreement, clarifying tariff rates for key sectors. Under the framework, a 15% tariff will apply to most EU goods, including pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, a rate significantly lower than previously threatened by President Trump. However, European autos will face the 15% tariff only after the EU passes legislation to eliminate its own duties on U.S. industrial goods. The deal also includes EU commitments to purchase U.S. energy and military equipment, with the EU's Trade Commissioner calling it the most favorable trade deal the U.S. has offered any partner.</p>

This provision effectively restricts the flow of advanced semiconductor technology to China, reflecting a key U.S. policy objective.

          <p>Police divers in Italy have performed their annual maintenance on the famous underwater statue, "Christ of the Abyss," located off the coast between Portofino and Camogli. Using pressurized water hoses, the team carefully removed a year's worth of accumulated crustaceans and bacteria from the 2.5-meter bronze sculpture. The statue was placed on the seabed in 1954 as a memorial for those who have died at sea and has become one of the Mediterranean's most popular dive sites. Officials state the water-blasting cleaning method is environmentally safe and prevents the kind of damage previously caused by scraping the statue with metal brushes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, financial experts suggest that a home equity loan can be a strategic tool for homeowners to save money. One of the primary uses is for debt consolidation, allowing borrowers to pay off high-interest credit card debt with a loan that has a lower, fixed interest rate, potentially saving thousands. Another effective use is financing home improvements that increase the property's value, as the interest on such loans may be tax-deductible. Experts advise, however, that these loans are best for long-term value creation rather than covering daily expenses or luxury purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

Their case has seen renewed public interest following new evidence supporting their claims of long-term sexual abuse by their father, which they argued was their motive.

          <p>As part of a broader trade agreement with the European Union, the Trump administration has retreated from its threat to impose tariffs as high as 250% on pharmaceuticals and 100% on semiconductors from the bloc. According to newly released details of the deal, these key sectors will instead be subject to the same 15% tariff rate applied to most other EU exports. This decision provides significant relief to European exporters, particularly in countries like Ireland and Denmark, which are major pharmaceutical producers.

          <p>The average interest rate for a five-year fixed mortgage in the United Kingdom has fallen to 4.99%, marking the first time it has dipped below the 5% threshold since May 2023. This milestone, along with the average two-year fixed rate also falling, signals a potential turning point in the borrowing market and could boost buyer confidence. The steady decline in borrowing costs over the last year, coupled with wage growth, has slightly improved housing affordability. However, analysts suggest that recent inflation data may limit further significant rate cuts in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial advisors generally recommend against purchasing annuities for individuals under the age of 50 due to tax penalties for early withdrawals and the long-term growth potential of other investments. Conversely, insurance companies often do not sell annuities to those over 90, as the likelihood of a return on their policy diminishes. For older adults, experts suggest annuities may not be suitable if basic retirement expenses are already covered by other income sources, if there is a need for liquidity, or if the individual has significant health issues.

          <p>The film "Honey Don’t!," co-written by Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke, is a desert noir that prioritizes style and character over a coherent mystery plot.

The review praises the strong performances from Qualley, Aubrey Plaza, and Chris Evans, as well as the sharp dialogue. However, it criticizes the film for feeling shaggy and longer than its 89-minute runtime, describing it as an affectionate in-joke for its creators that doesn't always land with the audience.</p>
