          <p>A federal appeals court has extended its block of a judge's order that directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The ruling allows the continued deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they are assisting federal law enforcement. Newsom had sued the president over the federalization of the California Guard. The court sided with Trump, stating he likely lawfully exercised his authority to federalize the Guard under Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents. The court rejected the argument that Trump needed Newsom's permission to call up the Guard. The optimism score here reflects the ongoing tension between state and federal powers and the potential for escalation. </p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has upheld President Trump's authority to maintain control over California's National Guard, despite a lawsuit from Governor Gavin Newsom challenging the legality of the troop deployment. The court extended a pause on a previous ruling that deemed Trump's federalization of the Guard unlawful. The decision stems from protests and unrest in Los Angeles related to immigration raids. The Justice Department argued that the president's determination of an emergency warranting National Guard use is not subject to judicial or gubernatorial review. The court's decision has sparked debate regarding the balance of power between federal and state governments in response to civil unrest. </p>

          <p>China has been urged to use the resumption of visits to Tibet by Indian pilgrims to improve relations between the two countries after years of tensions. Earlier this year, China said it would allow pilgrims to return to the Tibet autonomous region this summer to follow two pilgrimage routes after a five-year suspension caused by Covid controls and ongoing cross-border tensions. The sites are sacred to followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon.

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold billions of dollars in transportation grant funding from states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction, stating that "large-scale irreparable harm would occur without the preliminary injunction." The ruling comes ahead of a grant application deadline for states, with the Department of Transportation imposing conditions requiring adherence to an Immigration Enforcement Condition. The judge agreed with the states, finding no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the congressionally approved purposes of the Department of Transportation. The optimism score reflects the protection of state autonomy and the continued funding of transportation projects. </p>

          <p>At a recent high-level summit, China and its Central Asian partners expressed shared security concerns, signaling close ties amid global turbulence. The growing influence of China in Central Asia has raised questions about whether Russia's regional dominance is waning, especially given its preoccupation with the Ukraine war. While Moscow dismisses such concerns, diplomatic observers note Russia's limited capacity to counterbalance China's increasing influence. China is avoiding challenging Russia as Central Asia's key security guarantor and dominant power. The optimism score reflects the shifting geopolitical landscape. </p>
