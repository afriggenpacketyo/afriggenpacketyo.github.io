One likely reason is the pent-up demand for exits among venture capital firms after a period of poor market returns and valuation slashes. Private investors are eager to distribute returns to their investors, reflecting a multiyear drought in IPOs and a strong desire for liquidity among early investors. (not investment advice)</p>
