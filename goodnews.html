          <h2>"Tipflation" and Digital Payment Systems Create Confusion for Consumers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rise of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options is causing widespread confusion and frustration, a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation." While tipping norms were once clear, customers now face prompts in unexpected places, from fast-food counters to self-service kiosks. Experts note that these systems often default to suggesting tips of 15-25%, pressuring consumers into tipping more frequently and generously. This shift, accelerated during the pandemic, benefits not only employees but also the tech companies that process the transactions.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, stating it is prepared to enter negotiations on the implementation details. The proposal reportedly includes a two-month ceasefire in its war with Israel, with President Trump expressing optimism that a deal could be reached soon. However, Israeli sources indicate that while there is support for the terms, a final commitment has not been made. The development comes amid ongoing conflict and a dire humanitarian situation, particularly concerning aid distribution.</p>

          <p>Daniel Meursing, founder of a luxury event staffing agency, details his journey from an average salary to becoming a self-made millionaire. His primary strategy involved extreme frugality, living far below his means by saving over 50% of his income from a loan officer job. He emphasizes that this disciplined saving allowed him to accumulate the necessary capital for investment. Meursing treated investing as a second job, dedicating significant time to learning about financial markets to grow his savings into substantial wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England and Wales have been drawn into what is being called the "toughest group of all" for the Women's Euro 2025 tournament. Group D also features formidable opponents France and the Netherlands, meaning three of the four teams are ranked in the world's top 11. Statistical models give a team from this group the highest probability of winning the entire tournament. The challenging draw means defending champions England and debutants Wales face a difficult path to the knockout stages, with no room for error in their opening matches.</p>

          <p>A non-alcoholic "cortisol cocktail" has gained popularity on social media, with proponents claiming it can lower the body's primary stress hormone. The drink typically combines coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium powder, and salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients, alone or in combination, can directly reduce cortisol levels. While the beverage is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, doctors note that managing stress effectively relies on proven methods like adequate sleep, exercise, and social connection.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai, an innovative Chinese typewriter designed by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. The machine is a crucial artifact in the history of modern Chinese computing, as it solved the immense challenge of typing a language with tens of thousands of characters. Lin's ingenious design broke down characters by shape rather than sound, a concept that underlies modern East Asian input methods. Its rediscovery has generated excitement among scholars studying the intersection of language, technology, and culture.</p>

On Saturday, swimmers took to designated zones near the Eiffel Tower, celebrating the historic reopening of the waterway which had been closed for over 100 years due to pollution. Mayor Anne Hidalgo was present for the event, highlighting that the river now meets European water quality standards on most days. The move fulfills a long-held ambition for the city, especially with record high temperatures driving demand for urban cooling spots.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to shift public opinion and gather vital data on ocean health. The research involves temporarily capturing sharks, examining their stomach contents to assess their diet and health, and then releasing them. Researchers explain that a healthy shark population is a key indicator of a healthy marine ecosystem. The lab's leader, Dr. Taylor Chapple, notes the difficulty in securing funding for shark research despite public fascination, as people are often hesitant to financially support the often-feared predators.</p>

          <p>A couple in Scottsdale, Arizona, was fined $4,000 by their property management company, Denali Real Estate, after they posted negative online reviews about their rental experience, which included black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in their lease that penalized tenants for reviews rated three stars or less. Such clauses are illegal under the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA), which protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback. After being contacted by local news, the company stated it would remove the clause from future leases.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to manage negative emotions like anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a surge of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this period, any lingering feeling is due to consciously or unconsciously re-running the thought. By allowing oneself to feel the emotion for that short time and then choosing to shift focus, individuals can prevent rumination and recover more quickly from life's upsets.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the central role of hobbies in Danish culture, a professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School undertook an experiment to try 17 different hobbies in one year. She found that engaging in activities like tennis, woodworking, and mahjong fundamentally changed her life by reducing doomscrolling, fostering community, and deepening her relationships. The experience helped her feel less lonely and more confident, leading her to conclude that actively pursuing hobbies is a key secret to achieving better work-life balance and overall happiness, rather than waiting for balance to appear on its own.</p>

          <p>Deaths from heart attacks have plummeted by nearly 90 percent in the U.S. since 1970, a major public health achievement. This dramatic improvement is attributed to a combination of factors, including the significant decline in smoking rates, the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and better emergency treatments like CPR and angioplasty. While heart disease remains a leading cause of death, often in more chronic forms, the risk of an acute heart attack being fatal has been drastically reduced, saving tens of millions of lives over the past five decades.</p>
