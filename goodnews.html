          <p>A palliative care physician reflects on how facing mortality can provide clarity on how to live authentically. The essay contrasts clich√© bucket lists with the more profound, ordinary wishes that arise when people confront their own mortality.

Living with an awareness of death's uncertainty can be terrifying, yet it also offers the possibility of living freely.</p>

This comes as China's film market struggles with declining revenue, despite efforts to stimulate domestic consumption. However, observers remain optimistic about the long-term resilience of China's film market, citing improved domestic productions.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder will meet in the NBA Finals, marking the end of a championship drought for one of the teams. The Thunder, formerly the Seattle SuperSonics, last won a title in 1979, while the Pacers have only reached the Finals once before in 2000. Oklahoma City's dominant season, led by MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, is contrasted by Indiana's surprising playoff run, fueled by Tyrese Haliburton's emergence. The Finals will showcase a display of parity in the modern NBA.</p>
