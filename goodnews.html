          <h2>Nvidia Reports Strong AI-Driven Revenue Amid Geopolitical Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia announced a robust 56% surge in revenue to $46.7 billion for the second quarter, primarily propelled by the escalating demand for AI capabilities from major tech companies like Meta and OpenAI. Despite these impressive financial results, Nvidia continues to grapple with complex geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, which contributed to a slight dip in its shares during after-hours trading. CEO Jensen Huang underscored the intensity of the global AI race, noting a substantial increase in annual spending from leading tech firms. The company is actively lobbying the U.S. government to secure approval for the sale of its advanced Blackwell chips to China, a critical market, even as analysts highlight China's strategic efforts to foster domestic competition in the semiconductor sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taylor Swift's recent engagement has ignited widespread discussion about parasocial relationships, a phenomenon where individuals develop one-sided emotional connections with celebrities. Fans reacted with intense personal joy and tears, exemplifying the illusion of intimacy fostered by constant access to stars' private lives through social media and reality television. Psychologist Sonia Jaeger describes these as "my friend who doesn't know me" connections, which can fulfill a universal human need for connection, particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, experts caution that while these relationships can offer a sense of community and distraction, they are akin to "fast food" for emotional needs, as they lack the reciprocal affection and genuine support found in real-life friendships.</p>

          <h2>Argentinian Authorities Search for Nazi-Looted Painting Spotted in Advertisement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 01:49:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentinian authorities are actively searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, "Portrait of a Lady" by Guiseppe Vittore Ghislandi, which is believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer 80 years ago. The painting, originally part of Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's extensive collection, recently resurfaced in a real estate advertisement for a property in Argentina thought to be owned by descendants of the Nazi fugitive, Friedrich Kadgien. Police conducted a raid on the seaside villa but did not locate the artwork, though they discovered relevant German documents from the 1940s. This renewed search underscores Argentina's historical role as a refuge for Nazis and the ongoing international efforts to recover plundered Jewish property, even decades after World War II.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's latest film, "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, features Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player whose life descends into a violent crime caper in the gritty backdrop of 1998 New York City. After a series of unfortunate events, Hank finds himself relentlessly pursued by various criminal factions and the NYPD, forcing him to confront his past athletic glory and present failures. The article commends Aronofsky's affectionate, albeit grimy, portrayal of pre-millennial New York and Butler's compelling performance as a charismatic yet self-loathing protagonist. The film delves into Aronofsky's recurring themes of squandered potential and the heavy burden of talent, showcasing his consistent fascination with characters teetering on the brink of losing their way.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are actively participating in a robust US$1 trillion bull run, with many anticipating further significant gains, buoyed by a government pledge to stabilize the economy.

Investors are strategically focusing on high-beta stocks within the new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware sectors, expecting continued liquidity to support market growth. This article reflects a cautious yet optimistic sentiment among traders, balancing current market performance with broader economic considerations and future predictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot is rapidly approaching the $1 billion mark, now estimated at a staggering $950 million, after no tickets successfully matched all winning numbers in Wednesday night's $850 million drawing. This makes the current prize the sixth-largest Powerball jackpot in history, boasting an estimated cash value of $428.9 million before taxes. Ticket sales have more than doubled in the past week as a growing number of players participate, with proceeds also benefiting various community causes. The next drawing is scheduled for Saturday, offering a single winner the life-changing choice of a lump sum payment or a 30-year annuity, despite the odds of winning the top prize standing at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea opted to keep its policy rate unchanged at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need for further assessment of housing prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas, as well as household debt. Despite this hold, the central bank upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% from 0.8% and its inflation forecast to 2% from 1.9%, indicating a cautiously optimistic economic outlook. It anticipates a modest recovery in domestic demand, bolstered by a supplementary budget and improved consumer sentiment, though exports are expected to gradually slow due to the expanding impacts of U.S. tariffs. This decision follows recent agreements between South Korea and the U.S., including substantial investment pledges and reduced tariffs, which could influence future economic stability.

          <p>The 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's brutal death is being solemnly commemorated with a poignant train ride from Chicago to Mississippi, retracing the journey he took in 1955. Organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, the passengers included Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till's mother, Mamie Till, famously insisted on an open-casket funeral in Chicago, with the harrowing images from it widely credited with galvanizing the modern Civil Rights Movement. This commemorative event serves as a powerful reminder of past injustices, a testament to the progress achieved, and a call for continued reflection and healing to foster a more just and equitable society.</p>

          <p>Cardi B returned to the witness stand in a civil trial where a security guard is suing her for alleged assault in 2018, seeking $24 million. The rapper vehemently denied touching, scratching, or spitting on the plaintiff, Emani Ellis, stating they only exchanged heated words. Her defense received a significant boost from testimony by her obstetrician and his receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, who described seeing Ellis initiate physical contact and sustain an injury to her own forehead. Malcolm testified that Cardi B was behind her during the altercation, making it highly improbable that the rapper caused the injury. The defense concluded its presentation, leaving the outcome of this high-stakes celebrity legal case uncertain.</p>

The consortium recently acquired four logistics assets from CapitaLand Ascendas Reit for S$306 million, and these properties are expected to form a key part of the REIT's initial asset composition. This strategic move aims to expand their industrial property portfolio and capitalize on regional growth opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>
