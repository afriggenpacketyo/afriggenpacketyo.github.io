Yates attacked on the Colle delle Finestre, surpassing Isaac del Toro and Richard Carapaz, who were ahead of him in the general classification. With teammate Wout van Aert's assistance in the breakaway, Yates extended his lead in the final 30km, ultimately winning the stage and the Giro d'Italia, marking a significant comeback after facing challenges on the same climb in 2018. The Briton's victory was an emotional moment as he celebrated with his team after a dominant display of strength and strategy on the challenging mountain stage, finishing with a lead of three minutes and 56 seconds.
