          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a 90-day tariff truce, with the U.S. lowering its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports to 30% and China reducing its tariff on American goods to 10%. While this offers temporary relief to companies and consumers, experts caution that a long-term trade deal remains uncertain and the reduced tariff could still lead to price increases. The article highlights the potential for improved consumer confidence and economic growth if the reduced tariffs remain in place, but also notes concerns about businesses facing continued uncertainty and the possibility of renewed tariff escalations after the truce expires.</p>
