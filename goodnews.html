          <p>A Chinese research team has published findings revealing that moonquakes are actively triggering landslides on the moon, a discovery that challenges previous geological assumptions. The team detected 41 new landslides formed since 2009 by comparing before-and-after images of unstable lunar areas. This analysis, detailed in the peer-reviewed National Science Review, suggests that lunar endogenic activity has not entirely ceased, as conventionally believed. The article highlights the critical implications of these findings for human civilization's plans to establish permanent infrastructures and deep-space outposts on the moon, necessitating revised geological hazard assessments.</p>

          <p>Angels outfielder Mike Trout hit his 400th career home run, a significant milestone that prompts reflection on his 14-year major league career, which began with immediate impact. Despite winning three MVP awards and consistently ranking among the league's best, Trout's career has been increasingly hampered by injuries since 2019, leading to questions about his ultimate statistical benchmarks. The article highlights Trout's unwavering loyalty to the Angels, having twice foregone free agency to remain with the team, even amid their struggles and lack of postseason success. His dedication to the team and his low-key persona are emphasized as qualities that make him a role model citizen in Major League Baseball.</p>

          <p>Evelyn Palla is reportedly set to become the first female CEO of Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national rail operator, with an official announcement from Transport Minister Patrick Schneider expected on Monday. Palla, a 52-year-old from South Tyrol, joined the company in 2019 and previously led its regional subsidiary, DB Regio, where she delegated more powers to regional management teams. Her appointment comes as Deutsche Bahn faces significant challenges, including widespread delays and cancellations attributed to old and overloaded infrastructure, leading to substantial compensation payouts. Chancellor Friedrich Merz had promised to restructure the company's management and modernize Germany's transport infrastructure, making Palla's leadership crucial for addressing these systemic issues.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourism to Japan is experiencing a significant surge this year, primarily driven by a weaker yen, which makes high-end goods and cultural experiences more affordable for middle-class and wealthy families. Over 6.7 million Chinese travelers visited Japan in the first eight months of 2025, marking a substantial increase from the previous year. These tourists are reportedly "splashing out" on luxury branded items, gourmet food like sushi and barbecue, and unique experiences such as stays in traditional ryokan guest houses. This trend highlights the economic impact of currency fluctuations on international travel and the luxury market, boosting Japan's tourism sector.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Catcher Will Smith Diagnosed with Hairline Hand Fracture, Playoff Availability Uncertain</h2>

          <p>Dodgers catcher Will Smith has been diagnosed with a hairline fracture in his right hand, making his return before the end of the regular season doubtful and his playoff availability "up in the air." The injury, initially undetected by X-rays and MRIs, occurred when a foul ball hit his hand earlier in the month, causing persistent swelling. Despite the three-time All-Star's absence, the Dodgers have managed adequately, partly due to the emergence of journeyman catcher Ben Rortvedt. The team remains optimistic about Smith's quick healing, but acknowledges that his return timeline is at the mercy of how quickly the bone recovers.</p>

          <p>Anuparna Roy made history as the first Indian director to win the Orizzonti Award at the Venice Film Festival for her debut film, "Songs of Forgotten Trees." Roy, who grew up in a nondescript tribal village in West Bengal and worked in a call center, self-funded her initial short film before securing backing for this feature. Set in Mumbai, the film explores the intimate relationship between two migrant women navigating same-sex desire and shared experiences of marginality and survival in an urban environment. Critics praised the article's "anguished portrait" and "remarkable subtlety" in depicting urban alienation, highlighting Roy's unique and authentic filmmaking style.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a popular muscle-boosting supplement, is now being investigated for its potential cognitive benefits, including improving short-term memory, mood, and focus. While extensively researched for athletic performance, new studies are exploring its impact on female biology and conditions like perimenopausal brain fog, which affects millions of women. Experts suggest creatine may increase brain energy stores, potentially mitigating effects similar to sleep deprivation, especially for individuals under stress or with dietary deficiencies. However, the article notes that more research is needed, and results vary, with warnings about potential side effects like stomach upset and the importance of consulting a doctor, particularly for those with kidney conditions.</p>

          <p>The White House has outlined a prospective deal for TikTok's U.S. operations, which would grant American entities control over the app's powerful algorithm and six of seven board seats for its U.S. operations. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated a signing could occur "in the coming days," though China has yet to confirm the agreement. Under this arrangement, tech giant Oracle, chaired by Trump ally Larry Ellison, would manage data and privacy for the app in the U.S. This development follows previous threats to ban TikTok over national security concerns and multiple delays in implementing the ban, reflecting a complex negotiation over the popular video-sharing platform's future.</p>
