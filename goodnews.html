          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced a significant financial commitment to support global women's empowerment, pledging US$110 million during an international summit in Beijing. The funding includes US$10 million for UN Women over five years and US$100 million for the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund. Xi emphasized the need for an inclusive social environment free from discrimination, acknowledging that women's development still faces complex challenges. The announcement comes as China hosts a summit commemorating the landmark 1995 Beijing conference on gender equality.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team has received a significant boost as key players Ben Stokes and Mark Wood are reportedly nearing full fitness for the upcoming Ashes series against Australia. According to teammate Brydon Carse, both the talismanic captain Stokes, who was recovering from a shoulder injury, and express pace bowler Wood are looking "near enough 100% fit." Their return is considered crucial for England's chances, especially as Australia's captain Pat Cummins is a doubt for the first Test. The durability of both teams' pace attacks is expected to be a decisive factor in the series.</p>

Their inclusion marks a significant moment, with Burgess returning to the national team after a decade-long absence. However, the squad notably omits Super League's Man of Steel winner, Jake Connor. Head coach Shaun Wane expressed confidence in the selected players, highlighting the tough decisions made due to the high level of talent available.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis of multiple studies suggests that taking vitamin D2 supplements could unexpectedly reduce the body's levels of vitamin D3, the more potent form naturally produced through sunlight exposure. Researchers from the University of Surrey found that individuals taking vitamin D2 had lower D3 levels compared to those who did not. This finding adds to previous research indicating that D3 is more effective at boosting the immune system. The study authors recommend that, pending further research, vitamin D3 supplements may be more beneficial for most people.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Stocks Show Resilience Amid Renewed US Tariff Threats</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese stocks have demonstrated resilience, rallying despite renewed threats of tariffs from the U.S. administration. According to Chen Li, an economist at Soochow Securities, the market's foundation is supported by a weakening U.S. dollar, which helps mitigate the impact of trade tensions. He suggested that investors have become "immune" to the constant threat of higher duties, which now cause short-term corrections rather than major market shifts. The underlying market jitters are attributed more to concerns over U.S. fiscal policy and global economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The initial phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan has seen Hamas release its remaining 20 living hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israel. The agreement, which began with a ceasefire, also includes provisions for increased humanitarian aid into Gaza. Key next steps involve negotiations over the future governance of a demilitarized Gaza, which the plan suggests would be overseen by a transitional committee before being handed to a reformed Palestinian Authority. Significant challenges remain, including Hamas's disarmament and the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal.</p>

          <p>U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has publicly praised the "tireless efforts" of UK National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell in achieving the historic Gaza ceasefire agreement. Witkoff's commendation highlights the UK's significant diplomatic role, contrasting with earlier dismissive comments from the U.S. ambassador in Israel. Powell, who has extensive experience from negotiating the Good Friday Agreement, is said to have a strong working relationship with Witkoff and was in Egypt during the final negotiations. The praise is seen as a political boost for Powell amid domestic pressures.</p>

          <p>The National League Championship Series presents a classic David-versus-Goliath narrative, pitting the small-market Milwaukee Brewers against the star-studded, high-payroll Los Angeles Dodgers. Brewers manager Pat Murphy has leaned into this storyline, humorously highlighting the Dodgers' "shoestring budget" and star power. Despite the financial disparity, the Brewers earned home-field advantage by having the best record in the major leagues, including sweeping the season series against the Dodgers. The series will test whether the Brewers' cohesive team play can overcome the Dodgers' formidable roster of individual talent.</p>

          <p>With the final living Israeli hostages now free, this article reflects on the profound psychological and existential challenges they faced during two years of captivity. Drawing on the memoir of a previously released hostage, Eli Sharabi, it details the torment of confinement in Hamas's tunnels, including malnutrition, sensory deprivation, and psychological abuse. The piece explores how hostages endured by finding a "why" to live, quoting Viktor Frankl, and clinging to the idea of home. It celebrates their perseverance as a form of "existential heroism" in the face of unimaginable despair and loss.</p>
