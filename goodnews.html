        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to confusing and inconsistent federal guidance on vaccines, several states are forming regional coalitions to establish their own public health policies. Alliances on the West Coast and in the Northeast are issuing joint recommendations on vaccines, creating their own data-sharing protocols, and even exploring group purchasing to fill the vacuum left by Washington. State health leaders say these actions are necessary to restore public trust in science and protect residents from infectious diseases that don't respect borders. This trend highlights a growing fragmentation of public health authority, where states are acting as "laboratories" that could lead to conflicting health systems and further polarize the nation.</p>

          <p>Television personality Dani Dyer has been forced to pull out of the current season of "Strictly Come Dancing" after sustaining a fractured ankle during training. Dyer explained that she "landed funny" during rehearsals and a subsequent scan confirmed the break. The injury occurred after the pre-recorded launch show had aired but before the first week of live competition. In a statement, she expressed her heartbreak over the situation and her disappointment at no longer being able to dance with her professional partner, Nikita Kuzmin. Show producers expressed their sadness over her departure and wished her a swift recovery, hoping to welcome her back in the future.</p>

          <p>Lisa Jeanine Findley has been sentenced to more than four years in federal prison for orchestrating a sophisticated scheme to fraudulently sell Elvis Presley's iconic Graceland estate. Findley pleaded guilty to mail fraud, admitting to creating a fake investment company and forging documents to claim that Presley's late daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, had used Graceland as collateral for a non-existent $3.8 million loan. She then attempted to foreclose on the property and auction it off before the Presley family, led by Riley Keough, took legal action to stop the sale. The judge described the elaborate plot as a "wild scheme" designed to defraud the singer's heirs.</p>

          <p>The 2026 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival has sold out all passes for both of its weekends just three days after they went on sale, a significant rebound from slower sales in recent post-pandemic years. The festival, featuring headliners Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, Karol G, and Anyma, has seen a return to its pre-pandemic trend of selling out rapidly. This strong performance is a welcome sign for promoter Goldenvoice and serves as a positive indicator for the broader concert industry. The quick sellout contrasts with recent struggles faced by other major music festivals and tours, suggesting robust consumer demand for premier live events.</p>

          <p>The popular Fat Bear Week competition has officially commenced, allowing the public to vote for the brown bear in Alaska's Katmai National Park that has best prepared for winter hibernation. Hosted by the park and explore.org, the single-elimination tournament pits 12 bears against each other, with voters choosing the one that "best exemplifies fatness and success." The contest, which draws millions of online participants, highlights the bears' critical need to build up fat reserves by feasting on salmon from the Brooks River. Last year's champion, Grazer, and perennial favorite, Chunk, are among the contenders in this year's event, which educates the public about the park's ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly is investing $6.5 billion to construct a new manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas, dedicated to producing its pipeline of small molecule drugs. A key product will be its experimental oral obesity pill, orforglipron, as the company aims to scale up production to meet anticipated high demand in the booming weight-loss drug market. This investment is part of a broader strategy to increase domestic manufacturing, with the company having already committed billions to new U.S. plants. The new Houston site is expected to create over 600 permanent highly skilled jobs and 4,000 construction jobs, enhancing the company's production capacity for medicines across several disease areas.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced it is accelerating its schedule for the Artemis II mission, which will send four astronauts on a flight around the moon, with a potential launch date as early as February 5th. This mission marks the first time humans will travel beyond low-Earth orbit in over 50 years. The updated timeline comes after engineering fixes were completed on the spacecraft's heatshield, which experienced issues during the uncrewed Artemis I test flight. The 10-day mission is a critical step in NASA's plan to eventually return humans to the lunar surface and comes amid a renewed space race, with China also aiming to land astronauts on the moon by 2030.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of strengthening, the growth rate for single-family home rents in the U.S. began to slow in July, potentially signaling that landlords are facing pressure from financially strained consumers. According to data from Cotality, single-family rents rose 2.3% year-over-year in July, a rate below the pre-pandemic average and a clear loss of steam from earlier in the year. The slowdown was observed across most major metropolitan areas and at all price tiers, with markets like Miami seeing no rent growth at all. This trend contrasts with the high demand seen previously, which was fueled by soaring home-purchase prices pushing families into the rental market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration must restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), that it had previously frozen. The judge granted a preliminary injunction, stating the administration likely violated federal law by failing to provide specific procedures or explanations for the funding cuts. The grants, primarily from the National Institutes of Health for critical medical research, were suspended by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal setbacks for the administration's strategy of using federal funding as leverage against elite universities it criticizes.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States is governed by an aging political class, creating widespread frustration and a desire for change that a figure like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could harness. The piece points to recent polling showing Democratic voters' preference for progressive politicians and rumors of AOC considering a future run for Senate or the presidency. While acknowledging that Ocasio-Cortez has moderated some of her initial left-wing positions, the author contends that she possesses the charisma and "fight" necessary to challenge the status quo. The article concludes that despite her flaws, AOC may be one of the best hopes for leading the country out of the current political "hellscape."</p>

          <p>This article recounts a story of unexpected kindness when a woman, Lara Friedman, found herself in a dangerous situation with her 120-pound Rottweiler, The Dude. During a late-night walk, a sudden barrage of nearby fireworks sent the dog into a total panic, making it impossible for her to get him home safely on the slippery sidewalks. As she stood frozen, a stranger named Blake noticed her distress, first trying to calm the dog and then offering to walk them home. When that failed, he drove his car over and, with the help of another man, safely transported the terrified woman and her dog home, turning a frightening ordeal into a memorable act of kindness.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history and business model of the S&P 500, revealing how a simple list of 500 stocks became a lucrative cornerstone of the American financial system. Initially created as a market barometer, its profitability soared with the advent of financial products like index funds and ETFs that pay licensing fees to use its name and data. The S&P 500's dominance is protected by its trusted brand, economies of scale, and its role as a common language for investors, creating a nearly impenetrable "moat" against competitors. Despite recent concerns about its heavy concentration in a few large tech stocks, the index continues to fulfill its primary role: reflecting the current state of the market.

His extensive coaching journey spans nearly three decades and includes high-profile roles with the New Zealand All Blacks and the England men's team. Mitchell's career has taken him across the globe, and he is known for laying the foundations for future World Cup-winning sides, though he never won the title himself as a head coach.
