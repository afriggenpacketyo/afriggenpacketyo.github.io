          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area, marking only the second time in history that the National Weather Service's Chicago office has issued such a warning. The storm, driven by 60 to 70 mph winds over dry farmlands, caused significantly reduced visibility on major interstates and prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Showers and thunderstorms combined with the dust storm resulted in reports of "mud rain" in some areas, while some schools closed due to power outages from previous severe weather events. Cooler, dry weather is expected for the weekend, with a rainy pattern returning next week with projections of 1 to 1.5 inches of rain.</p>
