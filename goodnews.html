          <p>Actor Charlie Sheen has openly revealed that he has maintained celibacy for nearly a decade, a significant change that began after he achieved sobriety in 2017. He explained in an interview that what was once a top priority in his life, the pursuit of sex, became something he needed a prolonged break from, although he remains receptive to the idea of companionship in the future. Sheen has been remarkably candid about his past struggles with sex addiction and extensive drug use, including substantial expenditures on sex workers, viewing this celibate period as an essential component of his recovery. His experience is echoed by other public figures who have embraced celibacy for personal growth or spiritual reasons.</p>

          <p>Neil Hershman, a 30-year-old entrepreneur and former Wall Street analyst, has successfully revitalized the once "stale" frozen yogurt chain 16 Handles, transforming it into a thriving business that generated $20.6 million in systemwide sales in 2024. After initially becoming a franchisee and recognizing a significant lack of innovation within the company, Hershman made the strategic decision to acquire the entire brand in 2022. His approach involved introducing unique limited-edition flavors and implementing a revamped digital marketing strategy, which collectively led to a notable surge in customer demand and a substantial increase in sales. This turnaround also coincides with a broader national trend of consumers rediscovering frozen yogurt, often perceiving it as a healthier and "affordable luxury" dessert option.</p>

The author highlights improvements in public health, such as cleaner air and water, and safer environments. While acknowledging modern health challenges like obesity and mental illness, the article argues against catastrophizing the present, emphasizing that current problems should be addressed by building upon, rather than dismantling, the foundations of past progress.</p>

          <p>Renowned British TV presenter Davina McCall has joyfully announced her engagement to celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas, marking a significant milestone seven years after their relationship began. This happy news arrives just months after McCall publicly shared her successful recovery from a benign brain tumor, which necessitated surgery last year. Douglas, who provided dedicated care for her at home during her recuperation, recently characterized her health journey as "a huge journey." McCall, a highly recognizable figure on British television, has been married twice previously and is a mother of three children. The couple, who initially met on a reality show set in the early 2000s, has extended their "heartfelt" thanks for the immense support received from medical teams, friends, and family throughout her health challenges.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management is pushing Performance Food Group (PFG) to explore a merger with US Foods, nominating four directors to PFG's board to assert pressure. The firm, led by Scott Ferguson, believes such a combination could yield substantial synergies, estimated between $800 million and $1 billion, primarily from purchasing, logistics, and warehouse rationalization. While a previous Sysco-US Foods merger was blocked on antitrust grounds, Sachem Head argues a PFG-US Foods deal (merging the second and third largest players) could succeed under the current Trump administration's more favorable regulatory environment. This article suggests a stock-based combination would benefit all shareholders by allowing participation in long-term value creation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group shares have surged almost 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its stake in mid-August, with the stock closing at $352.51 on Friday. However, it remains unclear whether Berkshire Hathaway's investment, which involved purchasing over 5 million shares between April and June, is currently profitable on paper. Depending on the exact purchase price within that quarter, Berkshire's stake could still be in the red, despite the recent gains. Analysts remain positive on UnitedHealth's turnaround prospects, with some raising price targets, suggesting the worst may be over for the stock, which is still down 30% year-to-date. The article also notes Warren Buffett's disappointment with Kraft Heinz's split and his recent drop in the Forbes 400 ranking (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Elissa Kalver, a young mother, received a devastating diagnosis at age 34: incurable HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, which had aggressively spread to her spine, liver, and subsequently, her brain. Despite an initially grim prognosis, significant medical advancements and a carefully tailored treatment plan have enabled her to effectively manage the aggressive disease, remarkably shrinking her brain tumors by 80%. Kalver has since adopted a powerful philosophy of "living, not just surviving," actively engaging in multiple clinical trials and dedicating herself to advocacy for other cancer patients. She established "We Got This," a pioneering nonprofit gift registry for individuals battling cancer, and continues to make a profound impact while cherishing time with her family, commemorating her "cancerversaries" as vital milestones of her ongoing life journey.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 08:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Convenience stores are increasingly dominating the morning meal market, with their customer traffic for breakfast items surging by 9% in the past three months, a rate that significantly outpaces the mere 1% rise experienced by traditional fast-food chains. This notable shift is primarily driven by "food-forward convenience stores" that are strategically investing in high-quality prepared food options and aggressively expanding their market presence. Established fast-food giants, including McDonald's, have observed a decline in their breakfast traffic, as budget-conscious consumers, sensitive to rising menu prices, are opting for what they perceive as "good bang for their buck" and a broader array of choices at convenience stores. This trend underscores a fundamental change in consumer behavior, where the accessibility and diverse offerings at c-stores are now directly challenging the long-standing dominance of fast-food in the highly lucrative morning meal segment.</p>

          <p>Tokyo is currently hosting the prestigious World Athletics Championships, with tens of thousands of spectators gathering for the opening events, signaling a welcome return to full venues after the pandemic-induced restrictions of the 2020 Olympics. The event has drawn particular attention due to the World Athletics federation's controversial re-imposition of mandatory SRY gene testing for athletes competing in the female category, a measure designed to determine biological sex. While the federation defends this policy as crucial for protecting the integrity of women's sports, it has faced criticism for being an unreliable indicator of femaleness and for being perceived as an extension of broader "culture wars." Despite the controversy, 95% of female athletes reportedly completed the test. The championships, set to run until September 21, commenced with Canadian Evan Dunfee winning the men's 35km race walk, much to the enthusiastic reception of the crowd.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are advocating for Chagas disease, spread by "kissing bugs," to be recognized as endemic in the United States to increase public awareness and improve screening. The article highlights the case of a high school student who tested positive for Chagas through a blood donation, despite her family's unawareness of the disease. Chagas, common in Latin America, can cause severe chronic issues like heart failure in 20-30% of infected individuals, even if initially asymptomatic. Experts note a misconception that the disease is not present or testable in the US, stressing the need for routine screening and early treatment, as human development increasingly brings people closer to the bugs' natural habitats.</p>

          <p>The article provides essential information for individuals seeking a COVID vaccine under the FDA's newly narrowed approval guidelines for 2025. This year, shots are primarily approved for those 65 and older, and individuals at high risk for severe illness, a significant departure from previous universal recommendations. While many doctors' groups still advise vaccination, the change means some younger, healthy individuals may face difficulties or require a doctor's prescription. The article details eligible risk factors, clarifies confusion around pregnancy recommendations, and explains that insurance coverage may be uncertain until CDC recommendations are finalized. It also notes that while supply is ample, finding a pharmacy with stock might require some effort.</p>
