          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the massive monetary penalty, which had grown to over $500 million, imposed on President Donald Trump and his company in a civil fraud lawsuit. The court ruled that the fine violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against "excessive fines." However, the ruling upheld the original judge's finding that Trump and his associates committed business fraud by inflating asset values, and it also kept non-monetary sanctions in place to curb the company's business practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that approximately 44% of American adults are now ordering meals from children's menus at restaurants. The primary motivations for this trend are saving money and preferring smaller portion sizes amid rising food costs and economic uncertainty. This shift in consumer behavior comes as some fast-food chains report slowing sales, suggesting that diners are actively seeking more affordable options. The trend highlights how diners are adapting their habits to cope with financial pressures.</p>

          <p>The WNBA has officially broken its all-time single-season attendance record, with over 2.5 million fans attending games so far this year. This milestone was reached in fewer games and with fewer teams than the previous record set in 2002, signaling significant growth in the sport's popularity. The achievement supports the league's ongoing expansion plans, which aim to increase the number of teams from 15 to 18 by 2030 to meet the rising demand for professional women's basketball.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates declining in recent months, financial experts advise homeowners with high interest rates to prepare for a potential refinancing opportunity. Key preparatory steps include reviewing credit reports for errors, protecting credit scores by avoiding new debt, and estimating home equity levels. Homeowners should also begin gathering necessary documents like proof of income and existing mortgage statements to be able to act quickly when rates are favorable. Being prepared allows for an opportunistic approach in a fast-changing interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fujifilm's new $3 billion biologics manufacturing plant in North Carolina illustrates the lengthy and complex process of increasing domestic drug production, a goal encouraged by the Trump administration's tariff policies. Building such a facility takes three to five years, making it difficult for the industry to quickly shift supply chains away from foreign manufacturing hubs like Europe. While recent clarification indicates pharmaceutical tariffs from the EU may be lower than feared, companies like Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson were already expanding U.S. operations due to tax incentives and a desire for supply chain flexibility.</p>

          <p>The German government plans to introduce a €6.5 billion subsidy in 2026 to lower high electricity prices for consumers by financing transmission network costs. This measure, funded by a special climate and energy transformation fund, aims to alleviate the financial burden on households and businesses facing structurally high energy prices. The move is part of a broader package of relief measures, though a promised general reduction in electricity taxes for all consumers has been postponed, with current plans focusing on industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, exceeding analysts' expectations. The increase is attributed to a slight improvement in housing affordability and a significant 15.7% year-over-year rise in the number of homes for sale, giving buyers more options. While the median home price hit a record for July, the rate of price growth has slowed dramatically to just 0.2% annually, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point where price pressures are easing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion allows wealthy investors to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets by exchanging them for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF). This "like magic" technique involves seeding a new ETF with a portfolio of stocks before it launches, with strict diversification rules required to qualify for the tax deferral. While the use of this strategy is growing, it remains a niche option with high investment minimums and potential downsides, such as being locked into a specific ETF. (not investment advice)</p>

The discussions focused on de-escalating tensions, reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement, and ensuring humanitarian aid for Syria's Druze minority. This marks a major shift after years of hostility, especially following the fall of the Assad regime. While full normalization of ties is a long-term goal, the immediate focus is on establishing security and stability along their shared border.</p>
