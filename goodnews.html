          <p>A parenting expert identifies five key characteristics of parents who raise highly successful children, emphasizing the importance of optimism, tailored motivation, and fostering a love of learning. Parents should encourage a sense of possibility and positivity, adapting their motivational approach to their child's interests. Learning and empowerment can happen anywhere, and parents should foster self-sufficiency rather than intervening in every task. A genuine love for knowledge matters, and parents should motivate with love rather than being overly critical.</p>

          <p>Passenger confusion over varying hand luggage rules among budget airlines has triggered an EU legal dispute. The EU is considering standardized sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines to add clarity to existing laws. The European Consumer Organisation believes the proposals do not go far enough and that airlines should not charge for reasonably sized hand luggage. The proposed rules aim to protect passengers from unexpected baggage fees and reduce disputes at airports.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are trialing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to eliminate superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria that can replace drug-resistant bacteria in the gut. Early data indicates that this approach may help tackle antibiotic-resistant infections, which claim a million lives annually. The study suggests that donor bacteria can compete with superbugs for resources in the gut, potentially eliminating them or reducing their levels.</p>
