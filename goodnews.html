          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially joined the contest for Labour's deputy leader, becoming the most prominent candidate to declare so far. This race follows Angela Rayner's departure and sees other potential contenders like Lucy Powell and Emily Thornberry considering bids. The tight three-day nomination window has drawn criticism from some within the party, including Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who argues it's unfair and prevents a broader discussion on the party's direction. Phillipson emphasizes her working-class background and commitment to Labour values, aiming to counter the threat from Reform UK. The contest takes place as Labour is in government, with a focus on delivering electoral promises. This internal election will help shape the party's future leadership. </p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng intends to launch its mass-market Mona series in overseas markets, including Europe, by 2026. This move is expected to intensify competition with both Chinese rivals and established automakers in the global EV sector. Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng indicated the company's international expansion is progressing faster than anticipated and expressed openness to acquiring other electric carmakers. The Mona series, which debuted in China with an aggressive price point, aims to introduce more competitively priced vehicles into markets where Chinese firms are already gaining traction. Despite challenges like EU tariffs, Xpeng is exploring manufacturing in Europe to support its accelerated global growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is actively working to upgrade its free-trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year, aiming to complete the CAFTA 3.0 upgrade protocol. This initiative underscores Beijing's strategy to diversify exports and strengthen economic ties with its largest trading partner, especially as global supply chains shift and US protectionism intensifies under President Donald Trump. The upgraded deal, which concluded talks in May, will expand market access in areas like agriculture, digital trade, and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, both sides plan to deepen cooperation in emerging sectors such as the green and digital economies, leveraging advanced technologies like AI to drive industrial upgrades. This move reflects China's efforts to bolster regional trade networks against a backdrop of increasing global competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New league tables rating the performance of NHS trusts in England have been published, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital topping the list, and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn at the bottom due to structural issues. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated these tables will inform the public and promote choice, while holding leaders accountable. Trusts are scored on seven areas, including waiting times and finances, and categorized to guide support and incentivize improvement. However, NHS Providers questioned the metrics, warning that a narrow focus on rankings could have unintended consequences. The initiative aims to drive up standards, with top performers gaining more autonomy and underperformers receiving support, potentially impacting leadership pay. This new system seeks to enhance transparency and tackle variations in care across the health service.</p>

          <p>Chinese search engine giant Baidu is issuing a 4.4 billion yuan (US$618 million) dim sum bond to secure lower financing costs and enhance operational flexibility, supporting its aggressive expansion in artificial intelligence. This five-year bond, with an annual coupon of 1.9%, is Baidu's second dim sum bond issuance, following a larger one in March. The move capitalizes on relatively low Chinese interest rates and growing investor demand for alternatives to US dollar assets. The bond issuance comes despite Baidu reporting weak second-quarter earnings, with total revenue and net profit seeing declines. This financing is crucial for the company's strategic AI investments amidst a challenging financial landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
