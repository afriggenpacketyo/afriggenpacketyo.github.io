          <h2>Tesla Sales Rebound in Norway Despite European Lag Amidst Musk's Controversies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May, contrasting with a decline in other European countries, driven primarily by the popularity of the revamped Model Y. Despite the sales boost, a recent survey indicated that 43% of Norwegian EV drivers would not buy a Tesla due to political reasons, likely related to Elon Musk's support for the MAGA movement. Norway's EV incentives, such as VAT exemptions and access to bus lanes, also contribute to the surge in sales. The surge in sales is attributed to the firm's revamped model Y SUV, suggesting that a first batch of deliveries appears to have taken place in May, with more coming in June.</p>

          <p>Despite Chris Sale recently being recognized as the fastest to reach 2,500 career strikeouts, Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell holds the all-time record for strikeouts per nine innings at 11.1679. This statistic highlights the evolving role of pitchers, particularly the emphasis on strikeouts in modern baseball. Snell's high strikeout rate was a key factor in the Dodgers' decision to sign him to a five-year, $182 million contract, though he is currently on the injured list. The Dodgers have a history of valuing pitchers with high strikeout rates, with several of their pitchers ranking among the all-time leaders in strikeouts per nine innings.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, located on the Italian island of Sicily, has erupted, releasing a significant ash cloud and lava fountain. The eruption is characterized by "explosions of increasing intensity" from the Southeast Crater, with lava flowing down the mountain's face. There have been no immediate reports of risk to the local population or air travel, as the area is accustomed to Etna's frequent eruptions. Mount Etna is considered Europe's most active volcano and the world's most active stratovolcano, erupting at least once every year for the past several years.</p>

          <p>Silver prices have increased over the past year, currently sitting at around $33 per ounce, up from just under $27 per ounce a year ago, and analysts predict it could reach $40 per ounce by the end of the year. Experts advise that silver can be a good hedge against market volatility, though it may not be the best investment for those seeking high returns. The Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates will also play a significant role in silver's price movement. Precious metals should comprise between 5 and 10% of a portfolio.

The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes, many of which were established 70 years ago. The initial focus will be on the airspace around London, with changes expected in the 2030s. The plans also aim to reduce aviation's climate change impact and facilitate new technologies like flying taxis.</p>

          <p>A new international study indicates that colon cancer patients experienced improved survival rates through a 3-year exercise program. The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, found that the benefits of exercise rivaled those of some drugs. The study compared patients given fitness and nutrition information to those working with a coach to increase physical activity, revealing that the exercise group had fewer cancer recurrences and deaths. Experts suggest that cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a standard of care for colon cancer survivors.</p>
