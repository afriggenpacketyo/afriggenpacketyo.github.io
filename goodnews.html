          <p>Lowe's surpassed Wall Street's earnings projections for the quarter, driven by increased demand for home improvement projects. The retailer announced the acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, a distributor of interior building products, for $8.8 billion, aiming to attract more business from home professionals. Lowe's has revised its full-year outlook to reflect this acquisition and the earlier acquisition of Artisan Design Group, expecting total sales of $84.5 billion to $85.5 billion. CEO Marvin Ellison stated that these acquisitions will strengthen the company's solutions for growing professional customers, and the company saw solid performance in both do-it-yourself and professional segments of its business. This score reflects the positive financial news and strategic growth moves by the company.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin is moving up the Atlantic Ocean, posing a threat to the East Coast with life-threatening surf and rip currents. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., North Carolina's Outer Banks are under tropical storm warnings and are warned of possible coastal flooding, leading to evacuation orders. The storm is projected to pass between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda, then south of Atlantic Canada, with dangerous conditions expected to last throughout the week. Coastal areas from South Florida to New England are taking precautions due to the risk of rip currents, and officials are urging people to heed local warnings. The storm is not projected to hit the U.S. directly. The optimism score is based on the fact that no casualties have been reported and the storm is not expected to hit the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite exceeding Wall Street's expectations for sales and earnings, Target shares fell 10% after announcing the appointment of Michael Fiddelke as the new CEO, succeeding Brian Cornell. The company's sales and store traffic have declined, and the retailer reaffirmed its full-year forecast, expecting a low single-digit percentage decline in sales. Fiddelke outlined three priorities: reestablishing Target's reputation for stylish items, improving customer experience, and leveraging technology for efficiency. Digital sales showed positive growth, and the company is focusing on regaining ground in key merchandise categories like home goods, with the score reflecting the mixed performance and future strategic direction.</p>

          <p>Shares in Chinese toymaker Pop Mart reversed course to rise after the company posted a near-400% surge in net profit, driven by booming global demand for its Labubu dolls. The company's revenue jumped significantly, and its Labubu plushies have gained international popularity, with keychains spotted on celebrities. Pop Mart CEO Wang Ning said the firm is well-positioned to hit its revenue target, despite concerns over stricter oversight of blind-box toys. The stock has rallied since the start of the year, and Asia-Pacific, excluding China, was the company's largest overseas market. The score reflects the company's strong financial performance and global expansion.</p>

Experts suggest strengthening credit profiles and shopping around for the best rates.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed progress in relations with China, agreeing to resume direct flights and boost trade, while also strengthening ties with Russia. This comes amid growing friction between India and the US after President Trump imposed tariffs on Indian goods, citing imports of Russian energy. India has decried the tariffs as unjust and unreasonable, and is seeking to balance diverse partnerships and protect strategic autonomy. Experts suggest India's engagements with China and Russia should not be seen primarily as a response to the US, but as part of a long-standing policy. The score reflects the complexities of international relations and India's efforts to navigate geopolitical tensions.</p>
