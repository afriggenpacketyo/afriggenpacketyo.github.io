        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists from multiple institutions has reportedly developed a new form of blockchain technology designed to be secure against attacks from future quantum computers. Standard blockchain systems rely on encryption algorithms that are vulnerable to the immense processing power of quantum computing. The new solution aims to safeguard the integrity and security of digital ledgers used in finance and supply chain management. This technological advancement addresses a critical emerging threat to digital security as quantum capabilities continue to develop globally, positioning China at the forefront of this defensive technology.</p>

The piece highlights Kershaw's superior career statistics in several key areas and his role as the foundational leader during a golden age of Dodgers baseball.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that effectively bans most migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president had exceeded his legal authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally adopt an alternative immigration system in defiance of laws passed by Congress. The judge granted a nationwide injunction but stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal. The ACLU hailed the ruling as a critical victory for those fleeing danger.</p>
