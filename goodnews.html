          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of a Georgia family whose home was wrongly raided by the FBI, allowing them to proceed with their case under an exception to law enforcement immunity. The family was previously unable to sue for damages due to this immunity, but the court's decision now opens the door for their case to be heard. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the court, marking a significant development in the family's pursuit of justice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears that President Trump's tariffs would drive up inflation, traditional data points measuring inflation have not yet reflected this impact. Consumer and producer prices rose only 0.1% in May, but three factors are believed to be keeping inflation in check: companies stockpiling imported goods, a time lag before tariffs affect the real economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economists anticipate that the impact of tariffs will become more apparent in the coming months as these factors dissipate.</p>

          <p>Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, will impose fines starting at ‚Ç¨500 on passengers whose disruptive behavior leads to their removal from a flight. The airline hopes this measure will deter unacceptable behavior onboard its aircraft, as disruptions are often caused by a small number of unruly passengers. Ryanair has amended its terms and conditions to allow fines to be directly charged to the card used for booking. The airline has also called on the European Union to limit the sale of alcohol at airports.</p>
