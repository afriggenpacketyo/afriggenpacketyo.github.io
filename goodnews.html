          <p>Several high-profile figures from England's Football Association (FA) are moving to Bay Collective, a new US-based multi-club ownership group focused on women's football. Anja van Ginhoven, England's general manager, and Kay Cossington, the former FA technical director, have taken senior roles, signaling a strategic shift in talent from established European bodies to new, agile American ventures. Van Ginhoven compared the move to shifting from a slow-moving "tanker" to a nimble "speedboat," allowing for quicker, more innovative decisions. The new leadership aims to build a progressive and sustainable ecosystem centered on the specific needs of female players.</p>

          <h2>Pew Research Finds Majority of Divorced Americans Are Likely to Remarry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 07:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that two-thirds of Americans who get divorced will eventually remarry. The study highlights that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women and that remarried individuals often achieve greater household wealth compared to those who remain divorced. Experts note that people entering second marriages tend to do so with more foresight, often seeking prenuptial agreements to protect assets. However, the research also cautions that second marriages have a higher rate of divorce, particularly among those over 50, a demographic known as "gray divorces."</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans providing care for ill or elderly adults face significant challenges, prompting NPR to create a comprehensive survival guide based on nearly 600 submissions from experienced caregivers. The resource offers practical wisdom on navigating the complex U.S. healthcare system, adjusting to the demands of caregiving, and the importance of seeking support to avoid burnout. It emphasizes that self-care is not a luxury but a necessity, involving setting boundaries and managing mental health. The guide aims to provide a sense of community and shared expertise for those in what is often an isolating and difficult role.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Sincere 'Cringe' Activism Is a Potent Tool Against Political Cynicism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As millions prepare for nationwide "No Kings" protests against President Trump, an analysis suggests that the earnest and sometimes mocked activism of the "Resistance" movement is a powerful antidote to political cynicism. While critics have dismissed the movement's aesthetics as cringe-worthy, its on-the-ground organizing proved effective in past elections and local policy fights. The article posits that in an era of authoritarian rhetoric, sincere belief in democratic ideals, even if uncool, is essential to counter the nihilism that erodes political possibility. This form of activism is evolving to focus more on concrete, community-based organizing rather than just large-scale marches.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered one of the greatest individual postseason performances in baseball history, powering the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Ohtani hit three home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out 10 batters while allowing only two hits over six shutout innings. His dominant two-way display secured a four-game sweep in the National League Championship Series and earned him the series MVP award. The Dodgers will now seek to become the first team in 25 years to win back-to-back World Series titles.</p>

          <h2>Trial Results Show Blood Test Can Detect Over 50 Types of Cancer, Often at Early Stages</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study shows that the Galleri blood test can successfully detect more than 50 different types of cancer by identifying fragments of cancerous DNA in the bloodstream. In a trial involving 25,000 adults, the test identified cancer in 62% of positive results, with more than half of those cases found at an early, more treatable stage. Significantly, three-quarters of the cancers detected were types that currently have no routine screening programs, such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer. The results suggest the test could revolutionize early cancer diagnosis, pending further data from a large-scale NHS trial in England.</p>
