          <p>The United States and China are set to begin a new round of trade negotiations next week, aimed at de-escalating the ongoing tariff conflict between the two economic superpowers. The talks come as President Donald Trump acknowledged that the current cumulative tariff rate of 157% on Chinese goods is "not sustainable," despite defending the measures as necessary. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia to continue discussions that previously led to a temporary tariff truce.

          <p>A trial for the Galleri blood test has yielded exciting results, suggesting it could significantly speed up the diagnosis of more than 50 different cancers. The test, which detects fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, successfully identified cancers in a North American study, with over half found at an early, more treatable stage. Notably, three-quarters of the cancers detected are types that currently have no routine screening programs, indicating the test could fundamentally change the approach to cancer detection if further trials, including one by the NHS, prove successful.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old woman from Newport discovered she had a large, cancerous kidney tumor after a seemingly minor accident during a weekend trip to Butlin's. After being playfully picked up by someone, she felt a "pop" and later went to the hospital suspecting a broken rib. A CT scan to check for internal damage unexpectedly revealed the tumor, which had gone undetected despite causing symptoms like fatigue and back pain. The chance discovery led to surgery and a successful cancer-free diagnosis, with the woman calling the incident a "miracle."</p>
