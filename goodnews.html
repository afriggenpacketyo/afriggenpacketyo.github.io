          <p>Google has introduced a new "Preferred Sources" feature, allowing users to prioritize news publishers like Vox in their "Top Stories" and "From Your Sources" sections. This initiative aims to help users more easily find quality, trusted information amidst the growing role of AI in search results. By selecting preferred sources, users can ensure that explainers and in-depth analyses from their chosen outlets are more likely to appear prominently when searching for complex topics such as tariff news or Supreme Court decisions. This small step helps curate a more reliable news feed.</p>

          <p>World No. 11 tennis player Holger Rune, 22, openly discusses his clear ambition to win multiple Grand Slams and become world No. 1, despite inconsistent results against lower-ranked opponents. He acknowledges his strength against top players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, whom he has beaten multiple times, but emphasizes the need for greater consistency in tournaments. Rune is working with coach Lars Christensen and has sought informal guidance from tennis legend Andre Agassi, who believes Rune's goals are "very achievable."

          <p>A significant study by GiveDirectly in rural Kenya found that one-time cash grants of approximately $1,871 per household reduced infant and child mortality by 48%, largely due to increased hospital deliveries and improved food security. While the impact on lives saved is remarkable, the study highlights that the cost-effectiveness of this intervention, at nearly $300,000 per life saved, is not competitive with other health initiatives like Vitamin A supplementation or malaria prevention. This research emphasizes cash transfers' primary benefit in poverty reduction rather than as a leading lifesaving tool, contrasting with less impactful findings from similar experiments in the U.S.</p>

          <h2>Regulators Explore Investor Knowledge Test for Access to Private Assets</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. regulators are considering a knowledge test for "accredited investors" to expand access to private-market assets like pre-IPO companies and hedge funds, currently restricted to the wealthy. While these investments offer potential higher returns, they also carry greater risks, including limited liquidity and subjective valuations. Experts highlight the difficulty of designing a comprehensive test that assesses understanding of these complex risks, especially given low general financial literacy. The current wealth-based accreditation thresholds, unchanged since the 1980s, have broadened access but don't guarantee investor sophistication. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A newly identified species of dinosaur, unearthed on the Isle of Wight, has been named Istiorachis macaruthurae, referencing record-breaking sailor Dame Ellen MacArthur. The medium-sized herbivore, which roamed 125 million years ago, featured an "eye-catching sail" along its back, possibly for display. MacArthur expressed deep honor, noting the symbolic connection between the dinosaur's sail and her life spent sailing. The fossil remains were originally discovered by a fossil hunter in 2019 and were previously misidentified as an existing species before recent analysis confirmed its unique characteristics.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier directive regarding Delhi's estimated one million stray dogs, now mandating that non-aggressive strays be vaccinated and sterilized before being released. The initial order, which called for all strays to be moved to shelters, had faced widespread protests from animal welfare groups advocating for more humane solutions. Dogs exhibiting rabies or aggressive behavior will still be immunized and kept in shelters. The court also banned feeding strays in public spaces, requiring dedicated areas, and plans to formulate a national policy on stray dogs.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that California Governor Gavin Newsom's plan to temporarily redraw congressional districts to counter Republican gerrymandering has more support than opposition, though many voters remain undecided. The measure, which aims to preserve balance in the U.S. House, is backed by 46% of voters, with 36% opposed. Newsom's approval ratings have risen as he takes a combative stance against President Trump, including through social media campaigns. Critics, however, argue the plan undermines the state's independent redistricting commission, raising questions about its long-term viability and public trust.</p>

The novel is described as more mature and less showy than her previous works, maintaining a wry humor throughout. It offers an intriguing, if at times unrelatable, addition to the canon of underworld narratives, filtering hell through a scholar's eyes.</p>
