          <p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a 10-year-old chess prodigy from London, has achieved another significant milestone by defeating former women's world champion and grandmaster Mariya Muzychuk. The victory occurred during the first round of the European Chess Club Cup in Greece, with experts describing her performance as a "near-perfect game." This accomplishment follows her historic win over a 60-year-old grandmaster during the summer, which made her the youngest female player to achieve such a feat. Sivanandan, who only began playing chess during the pandemic at age five, continues to gain international recognition for her exceptional talent.</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League has entered into a multi-year licensing deal with prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket, marking a first for a major sports league. The agreement grants the platforms access to official NHL data and logos, while the league gains brand exposure and customer protection measures. Prediction markets, which allow users to trade on the outcomes of various events, are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission but face scrutiny from some who view them as unregulated gambling. The NHL sees the partnership as an opportunity to engage a new and broader audience beyond traditional sports betting.</p>

His comments came as the stock for Beyond Meat experienced extreme speculative trading, which he used as an example of the type of inexplicable price movement that would draw regulatory scrutiny.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia secured a six-wicket victory over England in the Women's World Cup, overcoming an early top-order collapse. After falling to 68-4, a commanding 180-run partnership between Annabel Sutherland (98 not out) and Ash Gardner (104) guided the defending champions to their target with more than nine overs remaining. England had set a total of 244-9, with Tammy Beaumont top-scoring with 78, but their middle order struggled against Australia's disciplined bowling. The result served as another demonstration of Australia's formidable batting depth, even with both teams having already qualified for the semi-finals.</p>

          <h2>New Novel Explores Modern Heterosexual Relationships as a Counterpoint to "Heteropessimism"</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Claire-Louise Bennett's new novel, "Big Kiss, Bye-Bye," offers a nuanced perspective on contemporary heterosexual relationships, subtly pushing back against the recent cultural trend of "heteropessimism." The book follows an unnamed writer navigating the aftermath of a breakup, using inventive language and a meandering plot to explore intimacy and connection. This article positions the novel as a response to the gloomy outlook on relationships between men and women, arguing that it emphasizes the specific, real, and personal aspects of intimacy over broad sociopolitical generalizations. It suggests the novel champions the value of lived experience in a world saturated with abstract, often online, discourse on gender dynamics.</p>

          <p>English rugby star Emily Scarratt has announced her retirement from the sport at age 35, stating that winning a second Rugby World Cup felt like the ideal conclusion to her 17-year international career. Scarratt, England's all-time leading point scorer and the 2019 World Player of the Year, said that while she felt she could have continued playing, she is content to end on her own terms. In her final tournament, she played a crucial role off the field, supporting the team even when not selected for the matchday squad. Scarratt plans to remain involved in rugby as a coach, pundit, and in youth development.</p>

          <p>Amid rising bankruptcy inquiries, this article clarifies a common misconception about Chapter 13 bankruptcy, explaining that it does not require filers to surrender their entire income. Instead, individuals create a three-to-five-year repayment plan using only their "disposable income," which is the amount left after covering reasonable and necessary living expenses like housing, food, and transportation. This process allows people with regular income to catch up on debts, particularly secured ones like mortgages, while maintaining a basic standard of living. The article also briefly outlines alternatives like debt settlement and credit counseling, advising consultation with a financial expert.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani naval vessel, as part of a U.S.-led international maritime partnership, has seized narcotics valued at over $972 million from two sailboats in the Arabian Sea. The seizure, confirmed by U.S. Central Command, included several tons of crystal methamphetamine and a smaller quantity of cocaine. The operation was carried out by the PNS Yarmook, a vessel participating in the 47-nation Combined Maritime Forces, which patrols key shipping lanes to disrupt illegal smuggling. The intercepted vessels were identified as having no nationality, and the confiscated narcotics were subsequently disposed of after testing.</p>

          <p>Following the historic "No Kings" protests against the Trump administration, organizers from various groups are planning their next steps, focusing on sustained, diverse forms of resistance. Leaders from organizations like Indivisible, the ACLU, and the SEIU are advocating for tactics beyond one-day marches, including targeted boycotts, rapid response networks, and increased local-level organizing to challenge the administration's policies. The goal is to channel the energy of the millions who protested into concrete actions that can pressure institutions and corporations to resist what they term authoritarian overreach. The movement aims to build a broad coalition for ongoing civic engagement.</p>
