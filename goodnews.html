          <h2>Thousands to Receive Payouts in Forced Meter Fitting Scandal</h2>

          <p>Thousands of energy customers in the UK are set to receive compensation, potentially up to ¬£1,000 each, due to the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies will pay out over ¬£70m in compensation and financial support after a review by Ofgem revealed suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. The scandal erupted during the cost of living crisis when energy firms were found forcing their way into homes to install meters. Affected customers do not need to take action, as compensation will be paid directly into their accounts, but enforcement investigations are continuing for British Gas, Utilita and Ovo.</p>

          <p>King Charles III delivered a significant speech at the opening of parliament in Canada, defining its place in an uncertain world and its relationship with the US. The address, for new Prime Minister Mark Carney, highlighted Canada's sovereignty amidst US President Donald Trump's undermining remarks. The King emphasized the need for Canada to reinforce its trading relationships, particularly with European allies, while pursuing economic and security talks with the US. The speech also addressed domestic policy, including infrastructure projects, indigenous ownership, and internal trade barriers.</p>

          <p>Three major wildfires continue to burn north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, while crews also battle fires in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces. Firefighters have made significant progress, and all Minnesota evacuations were lifted on Memorial Day. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Minnesota fires cover about 30,000 acres. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was "human caused," and interactive maps are available to track the fires' progress. Donations are being accepted to support relief efforts for affected community members.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. This marks the third time this month that a federal judge has rejected Trump's law firm executive orders, which sought to impose sanctions, including suspending security clearances and barring employees from federal buildings. The judge stated that an independent judiciary and bar are essential to the American system of justice. The order against WilmerHale cited the firm's previous employment of former special counsel Robert Mueller.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO stands out due to existing shareholders selling a larger portion of shares than the company itself, a characteristic reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. Circle will sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders will sell 14.4 million. While the company is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, the hefty amount of insider sales likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. Silicon Valley's tech investors are eager for exits to distribute funds to their investors. (not investment advice)</p>

This victory marks a significant milestone for Draper, who lost in his first two appearances at Roland Garros.</p>
