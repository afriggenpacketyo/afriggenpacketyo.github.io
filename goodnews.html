          <p>A same-sex penguin couple, Scampi and Flounder, are raising a rare Humboldt penguin chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. Zoo experts entrusted the male pair with one of the eggs from another couple to improve the chick's chances of survival, as part of a successful breeding season that produced ten chicks. This event highlights the zoo's vital role in the international breeding program for Humboldt penguins, which are a vulnerable species with declining population numbers. The zoo notes that same-sex penguin parenting is not unheard of and that both parents share in the feeding and care duties.</p>

          <p>The iconic British band Oasis began their highly anticipated reunion tour with a powerful performance in Cardiff, their first in 16 years. Brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher took the stage together, playing classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Live Forever" to a fervent crowd of 70,000. Despite their well-documented feud, the performance was seen as a reconciliation, with Liam Gallagher's vocals sounding particularly strong and revitalized. The concert, which featured a setlist dominated by their 1990s material, has been hailed by critics as their best performance in decades, signaling a successful and emotional return for the band.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been knocked out of Wimbledon in the third round following a hard-fought match against top seed Aryna Sabalenka. Raducanu challenged the world number one, even serving for the first set, but ultimately lost 7-6, 6-4 on Centre Court. Despite the defeat, the performance was seen as a significant improvement for Raducanu, who demonstrated resilience and pushed a three-time Grand Slam champion to her limits. Sabalenka praised Raducanu's play and is now set to face Elise Mertens in the fourth round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has shared advice on five "toxic" food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are linked to heart disease. He also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he advocates for whole foods like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried alternatives.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team secured a dramatic five-run victory over India in the third T20 international at The Oval, keeping the five-match series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but captain Harmanpreet Kaur was caught, ending their chase at 166-5. England's win was built on a strong opening partnership from Sophia Dunkley (75) and Danni Wyatt-Hodge (66), though they experienced a sudden collapse. A crucial spell of fast bowling from Lauren Filer helped turn the tide back in England's favor during India's innings.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis categorizes the net worth of retirement-age Americans into six distinct levels, from the "struggling" to the "top 1%." Households with a net worth under $13,000 are considered to be struggling, while the solidly middle class falls between $394,300 and $1.16 million. Reaching the affluent top 10% requires a net worth of at least $2.9 million, and the ultra-wealthy top 1% possess over $21.7 million. The article suggests financial strategies for each tier, such as budgeting, diversification into assets like gold or real estate, and robust estate planning for the wealthiest individuals.

          <p>England wicketkeeper Jamie Smith scored a record-breaking 184 not out against India, the highest score ever by an England wicketkeeper in a men's Test match.

This performance is seen as a major milestone in Smith's burgeoning international career, solidifying his role as an aggressive and powerful batter in the number seven position.

This performance, along with other recent offerings, has provided much-needed returns for venture capital firms that have faced a liquidity drought since early 2022. While major private companies like SpaceX and Stripe remain on the sidelines, the increase in IPOs and strong market performance from companies like CoreWeave are fueling cautious optimism. Investors hope this signals a sustained trend, though potential roadblocks like geopolitical uncertainty remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history for creating the concept of a "citizen." Speaking ahead of the nation's 250th birthday, Burns emphasized that the Declaration of Independence's words, though not inclusive at the time, were inspirational and set in motion global movements for equality. He argued for embracing the complexity of American history, including the flaws of its founders, to create a richer and more accessible story for everyone. His new film, "The American Revolution," aims to explore these multifaceted narratives.</p>

          <p>A provision within the newly signed Republican tax and spending package creates a temporary federal income tax deduction for tipped workers. The measure, which the White House frames as a win for the working class, allows employees like waiters and bartenders to deduct up to $25,000 in tip income from their federal taxes until 2028. However, critics argue the benefit is limited, as it doesn't affect state, local, or payroll taxes and excludes many low-wage workers who earn too little to have federal tax liability. Labor advocates suggest that raising the federal minimum wage would be a more effective way to help low-income earners. (not investment advice)</p>
