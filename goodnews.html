          <h2>Number of Missing Persons in Texas Floods Drastically Reduces</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 21:31:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following severe flooding in Texas earlier in the month, officials in Kerr County have significantly revised the number of missing individuals. Initial reports listed nearly 100 people as unaccounted for, but this figure has now dropped to just three after extensive verification efforts by state and local agencies. Despite this positive development, the overall death toll from the floods across Texas remains high, with over 130 fatalities confirmed, 107 of which were in Kerr County alone. The update provides a measure of relief amid the ongoing recovery from the devastating natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Pop singer Charli XCX and George Daniel, the drummer for the band The 1975, have officially married. Speculation began after the couple was seen posing for photos at Hackney Town Hall in London, which the singer later confirmed through social media posts. The news was celebrated by fans, coming after the massive success of her recent album, "Brat." The couple, who have been public about their relationship for years and got engaged in 2023, have also collaborated professionally on several of Charli XCX's musical projects, including her latest album.</p>

          <p>The England national rugby team defeated the United States with a decisive 40-5 score in a match in Washington D.C. that was significantly disrupted by weather. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to lightning strikes in the area, forcing players and spectators to seek shelter. Despite the interruptions, England scored six tries, maintaining momentum and concluding their tour with a perfect three-win record. The match also served as an opportunity for several new players to make their debut for the English side under coach Steve Borthwick.</p>

          <p>Following last year's deadly attack in Southport, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law to target individuals preparing for mass violence, even without a clear ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects who are planning attacks but do not fit the traditional definition of terrorism. This change would grant authorities similar powers to those used against terror suspects, enabling them to act on preparatory steps like researching a target, which is currently difficult to prosecute without an ideological link.</p>

          <h2>Debate Arises in the UK Over the Potential Benefits of Shorter School Summer Holidays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK regarding the merits of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could help mitigate learning loss, especially for disadvantaged students, and ease the childcare and financial burdens on working parents. However, many teachers oppose the idea, viewing the long holiday as essential for recharging and planning. The discussion also considers the impact on family holiday costs and whether spreading breaks throughout the year could be a more effective model, as some school districts have already begun to implement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has suggested that savers are missing out on financial gains due to an overemphasis on the risks of investing in stocks and shares. The government is considering new initiatives, including sending information about investment opportunities to those with funds in low-interest accounts, to foster a stronger investment culture. While a controversial proposal to cut the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs has been put on hold, the goal remains to shift capital into UK companies. Experts note a gender gap in investing and caution that any push must be carefully managed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of modern, private members-only clubs is gaining popularity in India, catering to the country's growing class of young, self-made entrepreneurs and creatives. These clubs, such as Soho House, offer a more relaxed and contemporary alternative to the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas that have long been the exclusive domain of the old-money establishment. Unlike their predecessors, these new spaces prioritize personal accomplishment over family legacy for membership. They provide a venue for networking, collaboration, and socializing for a new generation of India's wealthy who may not fit into the old aristocratic enclaves.</p>

          <p>Veteran guard Marcus Smart is set to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers after agreeing to a contract buyout with the Washington Wizards. Smart, the 2022 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, is expected to sign a two-year, $11-million deal, bringing much-needed perimeter defense to the Lakers' roster. After nine seasons with the Boston Celtics, Smart spent last season split between Memphis and Washington, with his playing time limited by injuries.

          <p>Rory McIlroy kept his hopes alive at The Open with an eventful third-round 66, leaving him tied for fourth place but still six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler. His round was highlighted by a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole, which sent roars through the home crowd at Portrush. However, the round also included a bizarre moment when his ball landed on another golf ball buried in the rough, leading to a bogey. Despite the deficit, McIlroy feels he has given himself at least a "half-chance" heading into the final day.</p>
