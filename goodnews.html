          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Tianjin, pledging to resolve their long-standing border disputes. The meeting, Modi's first visit to China in seven years, occurred on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Both leaders emphasized moving relations in a "meaningful direction," focusing on economic development over rivalry and maintaining a peaceful environment at the border following previous deadly clashes in 2020. This rapprochement aims to stabilize the relationship between the two most populous nations and foster regional stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood on social media and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, has led to soaring prices and supply shortages. Japanese green tea exports have quadrupled in the last decade, with tencha, the tea used for matcha, seeing its auction price jump 170% this year. The increased demand is straining Japan's aging farming communities and labor-intensive production process, which involves shielding tea buds from the sun. Retailers are now rationing supplies, and major companies like Ito En are struggling to secure enough raw materials to meet the booming global appetite.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire at age 30, attributes her entrepreneurial drive to a frugal upbringing that motivated her to find ways to make money from a young age. Her early ventures included trading and selling Pokémon cards and colored pencils in elementary school. This hustle evolved into selling virtual items from online games and later creating websites and internet marketing tools. Guo eventually dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, leading to the co-founding of Scale AI, which was acquired by Meta for a valuation of $25 billion.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the best she has ever made, citing the need to prioritize her mental and physical health. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea win a domestic treble, Bright felt she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not give 100%. The 32-year-old, who captained England to the World Cup final in 2023, used the summer break for knee surgery and counseling, and now feels she has recovered and is mentally in a better place.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee leading the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), has stepped down after a four-month tenure, declaring his "mission accomplished." His role was to reposition the U.S. foreign aid agency as a strategic investment tool aligned with an "America First" agenda, focusing on countering Chinese influence and securing returns for the United States. During his time, Dasgupta emphasized evaluating projects based on national security benefits and strengthening U.S. leverage, particularly in regions with critical mineral resources. His departure comes as the Trump administration continues to reframe America's global engagement.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 10th anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly changed German society and politics, sparking both a wave of humanitarian support and significant social and political challenges. A decade later, the nation is taking stock of the long-term consequences, including successes in labor market integration and ongoing debates about immigration and social cohesion. The anniversary comes as the current government adopts a more restrictive stance on migration.</p>

          <p>Researchers with the USDA are testing a novel method to deter gray wolves from attacking livestock: drones equipped with loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and dialogue from the film "Marriage Story." The experiment, conducted near the California-Oregon border, aims to provide a non-lethal way to manage the growing wolf population and reduce conflicts with ranchers. The drones, which use thermal imaging to monitor wolves at night, have successfully interrupted hunts by startling the predators with unexpected noises. While promising, the technology's high cost remains a challenge for widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old British Formula 1 enthusiast, Brandon Burgess, is undertaking the ambitious challenge of attending every race in the 24-event season on a budget of just £20,000. Using only his 28 days of annual leave from his tech job, Burgess aims to demonstrate that following the sport globally can be more accessible than its reputation suggests. By staying in hostels, being strategic with travel during back-to-back race weekends, and carefully managing costs, he has kept his budget on track through the European leg of the season. His journey now faces its toughest test with the more expensive "flyaway" races remaining.</p>

          <p>Strained by recent US tariffs, India and China are exploring a reset in their economic and diplomatic relationship during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China, the first in seven years, signals a potential shift as both nations seek to navigate a challenging global trade environment. While deep-seated issues like border disputes and regional rivalry persist, the economic pressure from Washington is creating new incentives for cooperation. Experts suggest this could mark a turning point, with both economic powerhouses looking to diversify partnerships and strengthen regional stability.</p>

          <p>Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has stated his ambition to develop a system for virtual assets that could rival the traditional SWIFT network for international financial transactions. He predicts that transaction volume facilitated by Tron, which is expected to reach $8 trillion this year, will surpass SWIFT's within the next five years. Sun highlighted Tron's efficiency, processing transactions in seconds compared to SWIFT's days-long settlement times. This confidence is rooted in Tron's growing dominance in the stablecoin market, which pegs cryptocurrencies to stable assets like the U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans began their football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, marking the team's highest point total since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The offense was explosive, never punting and recording three plays of over 60 yards, while the defense registered five sacks and a pick-six. While the performance was dominant, it came against a Football Championship Subdivision opponent, making it a smooth but perhaps not fully revealing start to the season.</p>
