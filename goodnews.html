          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, originating on June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. The holiday's recognition in 2021 followed renewed calls for acknowledgment of emancipation amid the Black Lives Matter movement. While some upcoming celebrations may be smaller due to changes in corporate sponsorships, communities across the country continue to honor Juneteenth with parades, parties, and cultural events. Juneteenth symbolizes freedom and the importance of remembering the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel have finalized their partnership, with U.S. Steel retaining its name and headquarters in Pittsburgh. The agreement includes commitments to maintain U.S. steel production and invest approximately $11 billion in U.S. Steel by 2028. The deal also involves a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, granting the president power to approve or veto major corporate decisions through a "golden share." The United Steelworkers union has expressed concerns about the long-term implications of the deal, but the companies emphasize the benefits of the partnership for the American steel industry.

          <p>Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel has been finalized, granting the Trump administration significant control through a "golden share." This share allows the US government to veto various corporate decisions, including plant closures and job relocations. The acquisition includes an $11 billion investment in US Steel, including funds for a new US mill. While the deal faced political opposition, it ultimately received approval, granting Nippon Steel access to American infrastructure projects while avoiding steel tariffs. The agreement represents an unusual level of government intervention to secure the deal's approval.</p>

          <p>The Senate is deliberating on President Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill," which includes a proposed senior deduction of up to $6,000 per qualifying individual. This "bonus" is intended as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, which is restricted by reconciliation rules. The full deduction would be available to individuals with incomes up to $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes up to $150,000. The Senate version features a faster phase-out rate for higher incomes, potentially benefiting middle-income taxpayers the most. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Purchasing a $500,000 annuity at age 65 can provide a substantial monthly income during retirement, with payments varying based on gender and annuity type. A 65-year-old male could receive around $3,269 per month, while a female could receive approximately $3,151 per month for life. Joint life annuities, covering two people, typically offer smaller payouts. Factors influencing annuity income include interest rates, annuity type, and payout features, making it essential to shop around for the best rates and consider individual retirement goals.
