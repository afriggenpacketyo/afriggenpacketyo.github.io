          <p>In response to President Trump's call for tariffs on movies filmed overseas, California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry. This initiative aims to counteract the loss of film and television production to other states and countries offering tax incentives and cheaper labor. The proposal seeks to strengthen domestic production and "Make America Film Again," building on California's existing state program, and Senator Adam Schiff is also working on a similar federal film incentive proposal.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States, partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. The order follows a federal appeals court ruling that narrowed an earlier decision from Whitehead. The judge dismissed the government's interpretation of the ruling, stating that it required rewriting a judicial order. The refugee program provides legal migration to the U.S. for those displaced by war, natural disaster, or persecution. Optimism score: 60</p>
