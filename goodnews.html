          <p>While digging trenches in Lima, Peru, utility workers discovered a well-preserved, 1,000-year-old female mummy with its dark brown hair still intact. Archaeologists believe the remains belong to the pre-Inca Chancay culture, which thrived in the region from 1000 to 1470 A.D. Experts note that such discoveries are common in Lima, which is home to around 400 archaeological sites, as the area's dry desert climate naturally mummifies remains.</p>
