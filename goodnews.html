          <p>The White House has detailed a proposed deal to prevent a US ban on TikTok, placing the app's American operations under a new US-based joint venture. This new entity will have a majority of American investors and board members, with software company Oracle serving as the security provider to monitor the platform and its algorithm. A senior official expressed confidence that China has approved the framework, which aims to address national security concerns by bringing the app's powerful recommendation algorithm and user data under US control. The president is expected to sign an executive order extending the ban's enforcement pause to finalize the deal.</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has surpassed Modelo Especial to become the best-selling beer in the United States, according to recent retail and restaurant sales data. This shift marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot two years ago following a controversial marketing partnership. Modelo's decline is attributed to several challenges facing its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and reduced spending from its core Hispanic consumer base. The change in market leadership is reflected in the companies' stock performance, with AB InBev's shares rising while Constellation's have fallen significantly this year.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and OpenAI have announced a monumental partnership in which Nvidia will invest $100 billion into the AI research lab. The investment is part of OpenAI's plan to build an unprecedented amount of AI infrastructure, requiring 10 gigawatts of power and an estimated 4 to 5 million of Nvidia's GPUs. This deal deepens the symbiotic relationship between the two tech giants, as OpenAI's demand for Nvidia's chips has fueled the chipmaker's growth since the launch of ChatGPT. The collaboration aims to support the development of next-generation AI models and will be deployed progressively, with the first phase expected to be operational in 2026.</p>

          <p>As part of the deal to secure TikTok's future in the United States, the app's influential content algorithm will be copied and retrained exclusively using American user data. This process will be overseen by tech firm Oracle, which will serve as the security partner for a new US-based joint venture controlling the platform. The move is a key component of the agreement designed to satisfy national security requirements by isolating the US version of the algorithm from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. However, some analysts caution that altering the algorithm could potentially degrade the user experience for its 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has pardoned Alaa Abdel Fattah, a prominent British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist and blogger who has been imprisoned for most of the last decade. Abdel Fattah, one of Egypt's most well-known political prisoners, was serving a five-year sentence for "spreading false news." His release follows extensive international pressure and a recent hunger strike by his mother, with his family expressing immense relief at the news. Human rights organizations welcomed the pardon, expressing hope that it signals a broader commitment from the Egyptian government to release thousands of other peaceful critics who remain wrongfully detained.</p>

          <p>On his "Morning Meeting" livestream, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to consider buying shares of Boeing if the stock experiences a pullback, suggesting it is an opportunity to build a position in the aerospace company. He also expressed a bullish outlook on two other industrial stocks, DuPont and Honeywell, highlighting their planned business spinoffs as a positive catalyst that has historically worked well for creating shareholder value. Cramer noted that while Microsoft's stock has been resting after a strong run, its cloud business provides a long-term advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a visit to New York for the UN General Assembly, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has renewed his call for the United States to formally lift sanctions imposed under the 2019 Caesar Act. Sharaa, who came to power after overthrowing Bashar al-Assad's regime, argued that the sanctions are no longer justified and are harming the Syrian people as they try to rebuild their economy. His visit marks the first time a Syrian leader has attended the assembly in nearly six decades. The call comes as Damascus is reportedly in advanced talks with Israel on a security deal, hoping to halt Israeli airstrikes and secure a troop withdrawal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a strong case for significant cuts to the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Miran argued that current monetary policy is overly restrictive and risks harming employment, suggesting the rate should be nearly two percentage points lower. He cited disinflationary pressures from the administration's policies on taxes, immigration, and deregulation as factors that allow for more aggressive easing. His stance is in stark contrast to the consensus on the Federal Open Market Committee, where he was the sole dissenter in a recent vote, advocating for a larger rate cut.</p>

          <p>Meta's new AI-powered smart glasses are being adopted by members of the blind and visually impaired community as a tool to enhance their daily independence. The glasses can connect to apps like "Be My Eyes," which links users with volunteers for real-time assistance, and use optical character recognition to read text aloud from menus, signs, and mail. While users and advocates like the National Federation of the Blind praise the technology as a useful step forward, they also note it is a work in progress with limitations, such as battery life. The article highlights that while the glasses are a valuable aid, they do not replace the need for fundamental skills.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to a nearly three-year low of 6.13%. For a borrower with a $1 million mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $6,079, which is about $600 less per month compared to the 7.04% average rate seen in January. Over the 30-year term of the loan, this lower rate could save a homeowner more than $200,000 in total interest costs. The rate drop also makes refinancing more attractive for existing homeowners looking to reduce their monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced it will acquire Metsera, a biotech company specializing in weight loss drugs, in a deal valued at up to $7.3 billion. This strategic move aims to bolster Pfizer's position in the rapidly growing obesity drug market after it faced setbacks with its own drug candidates. Metsera brings a promising pipeline of oral and injectable treatments, including a GLP-1 drug that showed significant weight loss in early trials and is being developed as a once-monthly injection. The acquisition is seen by analysts as a way for Pfizer to accelerate its entry into a market that could be worth $100 billion by the 2030s.</p>

          <p>The organizers of the World Conker Championships in Northamptonshire feared the event might be canceled due to a shortage of suitable conkers caused by an unusually hot and dry summer. The weather caused horse chestnuts to fall from trees prematurely and underdeveloped, threatening the supply for the annual contest. However, following a public appeal for help, organizers have received offers from people across the country to supply conkers, making them confident the event will proceed as planned. While the conkers used this year may be smaller than average, the championship is expected to go ahead on October 12th.</p>

          <p>As of September 22, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,728.61 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant fluctuation. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset, with its price influenced by a variety of economic and geopolitical factors. Key drivers include supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and changes in central bank interest rates. Geopolitical uncertainty and the strength of the U.S. dollar also play significant roles, as investors often turn to gold during times of instability, and the metal is priced in dollars.
