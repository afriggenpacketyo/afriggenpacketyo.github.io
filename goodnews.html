          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets saw gains as investors evaluated the outcomes of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, though sentiment was tempered by ongoing tariff uncertainty. The market movements followed a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that deemed many of President Trump's global tariffs illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both registered increases, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined. Economic data, such as South Korea's slowing consumer price index, also influenced regional trading activity. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eric Peters, the investment chief at Coinbase Asset Management, has suggested that Bitcoin has a significant chance of experiencing a massive rally similar to the 18th-century "South Sea bubble." Speaking on a podcast, Peters attributed this potential to Bitcoin's limited supply, which doesn't increase with price, unlike other assets. He stated that as institutional barriers to entry fall, increased passive flows into a fixed-supply asset could trigger a dramatic price surge. However, he also noted other possibilities, including wild price swings or even a decline over the next five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP with a congenital disability, is drawing attention to the significant accessibility challenges within the historic Houses of Parliament. Tidball, who was elected last July, described how simple tasks like opening doors with round handles are difficult and noted the lack of accessible toilets near key areas. While some modernizations have occurred, she argues that much more needs to be done to make the building inclusive for disabled MPs, staff, and constituents. The House of Commons Modernisation Committee is currently reviewing these issues and is expected to publish a report with recommendations.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, stands as a celebrated treasure of American architecture and a benchmark for national park lodges. Built in 1904 from some 10,000 trees, it was once advertised as the largest log cabin in the world. The inn's unique design, featuring twisted and gnarled wood described as "freaks of the forest," was conceived by architect Robert Reamer. For over a century, it has welcomed millions of visitors and inspired the architectural style of other grand lodges in national parks across the United States.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Tom Odell has shared how a concert he considered a failure profoundly inspired musicians Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell. Odell recalled feeling dissatisfied with his 2016 show at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, but Finneas later credited that specific performance as the reason he decided to release music under his own name. The story serves as a lesson for Odell that one never knows the impact they might have, even on a bad day. This connection has come full circle, with Eilish inviting Odell to open for her on her world tour.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new transfer spending record, with their total outlay for the summer window surpassing £3 billion. This figure significantly exceeds last summer's £1.96 billion and is more than the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. The record was broken on deadline day, highlighted by Alexander Isak's £125 million move from Newcastle to Liverpool. This massive expenditure underscores the Premier League's immense financial dominance in European football, with newly promoted clubs also spending heavily to compete in the top flight.</p>

          <p>China is advancing a plan to establish a development bank for the 10 member nations of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), including Russia and India. The initiative aims to insulate the Eurasian group from risks associated with the US dollar-dominated trade system and to accelerate key infrastructure projects. The SCO officially announced its decision to create the bank following its recent summit. Analysts believe such a financial institution would be a logical step for the bloc, providing an alternative for financing and trade settlement that could diminish the global influence of the US dollar.

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating, researchers placed the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of conflicting age estimates. The fossil's features differ from both Neanderthals and modern humans, strengthening the theory that it belongs to Homo heidelbergensis or a related archaic population that coexisted with early Neanderthals. This finding provides a clearer context for the complex, branching history of human evolution in southeastern Europe.</p>

While visibility will depend on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, the phenomenon might be seen as far south as the Midlands. The best viewing opportunities are expected on Monday and Tuesday nights, offering a potentially rare and memorable sight for sky-gazers.</p>
