          <p>Thomas Wolf, co-founder of AI startup Hugging Face, suggests that current AI models like ChatGPT are not poised to make Nobel Prize-level scientific breakthroughs. He argues that these models are designed to predict the most likely outcome and often align with user prompts, whereas true scientific discovery requires contrarian thinking and identifying novel, unlikely truths. While AI can serve as a valuable "co-pilot" for researchers by aiding in data analysis, Wolf believes a fundamental shift in AI architecture is needed for it to generate truly revolutionary ideas. This provides a sobering perspective on the current limitations of generative AI technology.</p>

          <p>Major European defense contractors, including Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall, have welcomed a proposal to build a multi-layered "drone wall" to protect the EU's eastern flank from Russian aggression. The initiative has gained momentum following recent airspace incursions in Poland, the Baltic states, and Scandinavia, which have been attributed to Russia. While defense firms stand ready to contribute expertise and technology, some experts express concern that the project could be slowed by bureaucracy and that it must also account for drones launched from within EU territory. The plan underscores the growing importance of unmanned aerial systems in modern warfare.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has described the two-child benefit cap as having a "devastating impact" on child poverty, indicating a strong possibility the government will soon lift the controversial policy. Introduced by the previous Conservative government, the rule prevents families from claiming universal or child tax credits for a third or subsequent child. Phillipson emphasized the urgency of tackling the issue as child poverty rates continue to rise, stating children should not be punished for circumstances beyond their control. The Treasury is reportedly considering several replacement options, including a tapered system.</p>

          <p>An Iraqi family that has been in legal limbo in Europe for 15 years has finally been granted provisional asylum in France, bringing a sense of stability after immense tragedy. The Alhashemi family suffered the loss of their seven-year-old daughter, Sara, who suffocated during a failed attempt to cross the English Channel in a small boat in April 2024. After her death, the family was housed in a migrant transit hostel for nearly a year, grappling with grief and bureaucratic hurdles. The decision to grant them residency, along with the recent birth of a new baby girl, offers the family a chance to rebuild their lives.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to open higher, continuing the positive trend from the previous session, with major indices in the UK, Germany, France, and Italy all showing expected gains. This optimism follows a strong performance in Asian markets, particularly South Korea's Kospi, and a new high for the S&P 500 in the U.S. despite the ongoing government shutdown. The shutdown has delayed key economic data releases, such as the September jobs report, but investors appear to be shrugging off immediate concerns, creating a favorable backdrop for European equities.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured their spot in the National League Division Series by defeating the Cincinnati Reds 8-4 in a decisive wild-card game. The team overcame early adversity after a defensive error by Teoscar Hernández in the first inning led to two unearned runs for the Reds. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto settled in to deliver a clutch performance over 6 ⅔ innings, escaping a bases-loaded jam in the sixth. Key offensive contributions, including a go-ahead double from Kiké Hernández and a redemptive two-run double from Teoscar Hernández, sealed the comeback victory for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers completed a two-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds in the wild-card series, but now face a much more formidable challenge in the Philadelphia Phillies. While the Dodgers showcased resilience and key performances from players like Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Mookie Betts in their 8-4 victory, the upcoming best-of-five series against the Phillies is seen as a major hurdle. The Phillies, who bested the Dodgers in the regular season, are described as a dangerous and determined team with a strong rotation and a passionate home crowd, making this matchup a critical test for the Dodgers' championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>In a satirical nod to the U.S. housing affordability crisis, the 133-year-old Maxwell House coffee brand has launched a marketing campaign temporarily rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee." The tongue-in-cheek ads acknowledge that in the current economy, owning a house is out of reach for many, so the brand is adopting a "more affordable name." The campaign reflects the reality that the median age of first-time homebuyers has risen to a record high of 38, as high prices and interest rates make homeownership increasingly difficult for younger generations.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed a lawsuit for a second time filed by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album "Nevermind." Elden had claimed the image constituted child pornography and had caused him lifelong harm. The judge ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the photograph pornographic, comparing it to a "family photo of a nude child bathing." The court had previously dismissed the case on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired, a decision that was later reversed by an appeals court, leading to this new ruling on the merits of the case.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has ruled that graphic photos from the crime scene of the 2022 University of Idaho student murders will not be publicly released. The judge determined that the "incredibly disturbing" images showing the victims' bodies would cause "extreme emotional distress" for their families, which outweighs the public's interest in scrutinizing the investigation. The ruling came after family members of the victims requested the images be kept private. Bryan Kohberger pleaded guilty to the stabbing murders of the four students and was sentenced to life without parole, concluding the criminal case.</p>
