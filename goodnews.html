          <p>Frank Bruni's New York Times opinion piece discusses the rising influence of Laura Loomer within the MAGA movement and the potential trouble this poses for Donald Trump. Loomer, known for her provocations and conspiracy theories, has gained Trump's favor, but her infighting and extreme views could alienate other Republicans. Bruni argues that Trump's reliance on such figures, who prioritize audacity over sound ideas, undermines his ability to govern effectively. The article also touches on the broader divisions within the Republican party and the challenges Trump faces in maintaining unity.</p>

          <h2>House Republican Bill Proposes Increased Child Tax Credit</h2>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to make permanent the $2,000 child tax credit and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, but experts say this plan leaves out millions of low-income families. The proposed changes also require both parents to have a Social Security number to claim the credit, potentially excluding 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present. The tax break starts to phase out for higher-income families, beginning at an adjusted gross income of $400,000 for married couples filing jointly.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Nationwide Injunctions in Birthright Citizenship Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 15:51:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on the legality of nationwide injunctions, specifically in the context of President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The justices focused on whether a single district court judge should have the power to block a policy across the country, rather than the merits of the birthright citizenship order itself. Concerns were raised about the history of nationwide injunctions, the practical implications of inconsistent rulings across states, and the potential for the Trump administration to avoid judicial review by not appealing unfavorable decisions.</p>

          <p>The Chargers are seeking NFL approval to sell an 8% stake in the franchise to private investment firm Arctos. If approved, the Spanos family would still retain approximately 61% ownership. This development follows Tom Gores' acquisition of a 27% stake in the team last September, resolving a dispute within the Spanos family. The Chargers' ownership was recently ranked highly by players, reflecting improvements in the team's facilities and coaching.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer identifies Walmart, Costco, and Amazon as the retailers best positioned to mitigate tariff-related price increases. These companies have the scale and balance sheets to negotiate with suppliers and absorb some of the costs, maintaining competitive pricing. Cramer emphasizes the importance of size and buying power in the current environment, noting that these three retailers can leverage their relationships with vendors and private label brands to manage prices effectively. He suggests that while Walmart may face downside risk to profits, it and the other two retailers can hold the line better than competitors.</p>

She expressed gratitude for the support she received and hopes to have more children in the future.</p>
