        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin highlighted his state's strategies to combat human trafficking, crediting the Trump administration with providing significant support to law enforcement efforts. Speaking at a conference, Youngkin stated that federal cooperation under Trump has been crucial for dismantling criminal networks, drawing a parallel to fighting transnational gangs like MS-13. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares contrasted this with the Biden administration, which he claimed was unresponsive to requests for a similar interagency task force. The officials emphasized that tackling human trafficking requires a multi-state and federal approach to be effective.</p>

          <p>Tottenham's new manager, Thomas Frank, is establishing a new culture at the club ahead of the season, emphasizing inclusivity and a collective team spirit. In a notable early move, he invited all staff, including non-technical employees, to a first-team meeting to foster a sense of unity. Frank is known for his hands-on, detail-oriented coaching style and a "glass half-full" optimistic personality, which contrasts with his predecessor's approach. While his vision for team spirit is clear, his long-term tactical strategy is still developing amid pre-season challenges, including injuries and the departure of key players.</p>

          <p>Policy experts estimate that Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, based on the latest government inflation data. This projection, from analysts at the Senior Citizens League and others, would be a slight increase from the 2.5% adjustment in 2025. The official COLA is calculated by the Social Security Administration in October, based on the average inflation for July, August, and September. The calculation uses the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which rose 2.5% over the last year as of July. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $50,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves weighing stability against flexibility. A CD offers a fixed interest rate for a set term, providing guaranteed returns, while a high-yield savings account has a variable rate that can change with market conditions. Current calculations show that for shorter terms like three months, a high-yield account might earn slightly more, whereas for terms of six months to a year, a CD could have the edge. However, for longer terms, the higher variable rate of a savings account could yield more if rates remain stable or rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, was successfully rescued after being lost for nine days in the remote wilderness of British Columbia, Canada. He survived by building a shelter from moss and sticks, drinking pond water, and eating what he could find in the wild. To signal for help, Barber carved the word "HELP" on a large rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud, which ultimately led to his discovery by a search and rescue helicopter. Though severely dehydrated and with a leg injury, he was hospitalized and has since been released, with rescuers noting he was lucky to have been found.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, saw its shares rise after reporting a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million in its first quarterly earnings since going public. The growth was fueled by a 90% increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin, which reached $61.3 billion. Despite posting a net loss due to non-cash IPO-related charges, the strong revenue performance reflects growing institutional interest in stablecoins. CEO Jeremy Allaire noted a surge in engagement from major financial institutions, particularly after the passage of new U.S. crypto legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Sphere has sold over 120,000 tickets for its upcoming immersive screenings of "The Wizard of Oz," with sales expected to reach 200,000 before the first show. Sphere Entertainment CEO James Dolan called the project "groundbreaking," noting that the company used AI-powered technology to expand the classic 1939 film's frames to fit the venue's massive screen. The experience aims to be fully immersive, featuring 4D elements like haptic seats, environmental effects, and custom scents. Despite the high cost of the project, the strong demand is seen by some analysts as a significant and underappreciated catalyst for the company.</p>

          <p>Paraguay is exploring a new law that would allow companies to assemble electronic goods locally using imported components, primarily from China. Government ministers presented the plan to lawmakers, arguing it could create jobs and diversify the economy by taking advantage of global trade tensions. The strategy aims to position Paraguay as an attractive assembly hub, particularly in light of recent U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian exports. This economic proposal is unfolding amid a growing political debate within Paraguay about whether to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing.</p>
