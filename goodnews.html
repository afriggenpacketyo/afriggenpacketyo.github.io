          <p>President Trump announced his administration's plans to reopen and expand Alcatraz to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders, emphasizing law, order, and justice. The Bureau of Prisons stated they would comply with the Presidential order. Alcatraz, a former maximum-security prison, operated from 1934 to 1963 and housed infamous criminals like Al Capone. It closed due to high operating costs, later becoming a popular tourist site as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, drawing visitors to the island to experience its history.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 19:04:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular among women to preserve fertility, offering a chance to delay childbearing, with procedures increasing significantly in recent years. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. Advocates highlight the empowerment it provides, while critics caution about the costs, lack of guarantees, and potential for exploitation by profit-driven fertility companies. The optimal age for egg freezing is in one's 20s, but many women are freezing later in life, citing career goals or the absence of a partner. Success rates vary depending on age and the number of eggs frozen.</p>
