          <h2>German Military Study Downplays Extremism, Researchers Urge Caution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 04:03:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent internal survey by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences indicates that less than 1% of German soldiers harbor right-wing extremist views. While the study offers some reassurance, it also reveals that a notable percentage of soldiers hold chauvinist or xenophobic attitudes. Researchers caution against complacency, noting that the survey relies on voluntary responses and may underestimate the true extent of extremism within the military. With the German government aiming to increase recruitment, maintaining rigorous checks on potential recruits will be crucial.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the resurgence of night trains in Europe with the declining state of long-distance public transport in the United States. In Europe, driven by environmental concerns and government support, sleeper trains are becoming a competitive alternative to short-haul flights. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to prioritize car-centric infrastructure and invest in unproven, niche transportation projects. The article advocates for revitalized rail networks in America, emphasizing their potential to foster community, reduce environmental impact, and offer a more sustainable vision for the future of travel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is increasingly using public-private partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans through the Belt and Road Initiative. This model involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Projects like Nairobi's mega-highway and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are adopting PPPs, with Chinese contractors recouping investments through toll fees. This approach allows China to continue supporting infrastructure development in Africa while mitigating financial risks for both parties.</p>
