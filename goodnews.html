          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren-like sound as part of a national test of the emergency alert system. The drill, which lasted for about ten seconds, is the second of its kind and aims to ensure the system's effectiveness in warning citizens about life-threatening events such as severe weather or public safety emergencies. While officials deemed the test a success, noting that tens of millions of phones received the alert, some minor technical glitches were reported. The system has already been used in real emergencies, including for flood warnings and the discovery of a WWII bomb.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who passed away from leukemia in 2006 at age 15, has been declared the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis used his computer programming skills to spread the Catholic faith online by documenting miracles, making him a relatable figure for young people. The canonization ceremony, led by Pope Leo XIV in St. Peter's Square, drew tens of thousands of pilgrims. Acutis's preserved body, dressed in jeans and sneakers, is displayed in a glass tomb in Assisi, reflecting his modern identity and impact on a new generation of believers.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy surrounding McLaren's team orders. Lando Norris, who had been running in second place, was given the position back from teammate Oscar Piastri after a slow pit stop had dropped him behind. The team instructed Piastri to yield, citing strategic team reasons, a decision Piastri audibly disagreed with but ultimately followed. The incident has ignited debate over fairness in the tight championship battle between the two McLaren drivers, cutting Piastri's lead over Norris to 31 points.</p>

Dr. Wright strictly avoids sugar and simple carbohydrates, stating she can physically feel the negative effects of inflammation and mental "dullness" when she consumes them. Her approach emphasizes anti-inflammatory nutrition as a key strategy for both physical and cognitive well-being as one ages.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Czech Republic have arrested a man who has been repeatedly spotted driving a Formula 1-style racing car on a public motorway since 2019. The driver, a 51-year-old man, was tracked to his home after the red, Ferrari-liveried vehicle was seen again on the D4 motorway. Police had previously been unable to press charges because the driver's helmet obscured his identity. The vehicle, identified as a Dallara GP2 car, is not street legal, and the owner now faces a fine for driving without essential features like headlights, indicators, or license plates.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed criticisms that the court has enabled President Trump to expand executive power. She asserted that the court's role is not to make political judgments but to decide legal questions based on the law as written, dismissing labels of the court shifting right or left. Barrett also discussed the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, stating that such matters are now appropriately left to the democratic process in the states. She declined to comment on specific pending legal issues, such as the president's authority to deploy troops or impose tariffs.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, who recently served as Germany's foreign minister, has begun her new role as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot, a departure from the usual unanimous approval, reportedly at Russia's request due to her consistent criticism of the war in Ukraine. In her year-long term, Baerbock will chair meetings and manage discussions among the 193 member states, positioning herself as a unifying figure. The move comes after some controversy in Germany over her nomination, which replaced a long-serving diplomat originally slated for the post.</p>

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker successfully completed a 26.4-mile ocean journey from Catalina Island to San Pedro, California, in a kayak he grew entirely from mushrooms. The vessel was created from mycelium, the root-like network of fungi, cultivated inside a kayak-shaped mold with a hemp substrate. This voyage represents the longest open-water crossing in such a craft and aims to showcase fungal materials as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in aquatic recreation. Shoemaker is part of a small but growing community exploring the potential of mycelium for creating sustainable materials for everything from boats to surfboards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's recent elimination of the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed tariff-free imports under $800, has sparked concern for small businesses. However, this article argues that the immediate panic may be misdirected, as the majority of small enterprises are service-based and not reliant on such imports. The author contends that the more critical issue is the broader economy's ability to absorb inevitable price increases. As long as consumer income and wealth remain strong, the overall economic impact might be manageable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in the game's history, was won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. The winning numbers drawn on Saturday were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. The massive prize had been growing for three months without a winner, leading to a surge in ticket sales across the 45 states where the lottery is played. The winners will have the choice between an annuity paid over 29 years or a lump sum cash payment, which for this jackpot was estimated at $826.4 million before taxes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," is one of the most critical actions new parents can take to support their child's long-term health and success. Consistent, deep sleep in infancy is fundamentally linked to cognitive development, emotional regulation, and the ability to learn, which are essential for navigating life's challenges later on. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb with warmth and white noise, but stresses flexibility over rigid routines. He suggests that learning to interpret a baby's unique cues is key to building a strong foundation for lifelong healthy sleep.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a case for why self-described preppers, often associated with right-wing politics, should embrace solar energy as the ideal power source for self-sufficiency. It contrasts the complexities and failure points of relying on stored fossil fuels like diesel with the simplicity and long-term reliability of solar panels and battery storage. The author argues that solar power aligns with conservative ideals of individualism and independence from large, fragile systems. Rather than being just an environmental solution, solar technology provides a robust, decentralized energy source that ensures resilience in the event of societal breakdown, making a home a truly defensible and self-sustaining castle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that China's simultaneous expansion of both coal power and renewable energy is a pragmatic, rather than contradictory, climate policy. While China is adding record amounts of solar capacity, grid limitations and intermittent power sources like hydropower, affected by droughts, create instability. In this context, new coal plants function as a crucial backup or "shock absorber," ensuring grid stability and preventing blackouts during peak demand. This strategy allows grid operators the confidence to continue approving and connecting massive amounts of new renewables without risking the country's energy security during its transition.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, the creator of the online marketplace Vinted, shared the story of how her personal need to clear out a cluttered wardrobe led to Lithuania's first tech unicorn. In 2008, while preparing to move to a smaller apartment, she realized she had far too many clothes and conceived of a website to sell them. After confirming with friends that this was a common problem, she and a co-founder quickly launched a basic site that gained popularity through word of mouth. Despite early mistakes, including a failed attempt to add commission fees, the platform grew into a major player in the second-hand fashion market.</p>
