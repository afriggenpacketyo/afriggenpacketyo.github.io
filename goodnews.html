          <p>England cricketer Chris Woakes has retired from international competition after a distinguished 15-year career that included victories in both the 2019 50-over World Cup and the 2022 T20 World Cup. The 36-year-old all-rounder, who played 62 Test matches and over 150 limited-overs games, was known for his pivotal contributions with both bat and ball, particularly in English conditions. His decision follows his omission from the upcoming Ashes squad and marks the departure of another key member of England's golden era of white-ball cricket.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that China is uniquely positioned to lead a commission for the safe and dignified repatriation of nearly one million Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh to Myanmar's Rakhine state. The author contends that with international aid funding collapsing, a permanent political solution is urgently needed to prevent further regional instability. Given China's significant economic and strategic interests in Rakhine, including the Kyaukphyu deep-sea port, Beijing has a strong incentive to ensure stability. Leading a repatriation effort would serve both humanitarian goals and protect its long-term Belt and Road Initiative investments.</p>

The movie, the first in a trilogy concluding the popular TV series, has earned over $600 million worldwide, highlighting anime's growing mainstream appeal. Aguilar believes the film has solidified the franchise as a "pop culture phenomenon" and reflects the increasing global demand for anime content. The success of "Demon Slayer" underscores the genre's ability to compete with major Hollywood blockbusters at the international box office.</p>

          <p>The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a 25-year trade agreement providing duty-free access for sub-Saharan African nations to the U.S. market, is set to expire. The end of the pact poses significant risks for countries like Lesotho and Madagascar, particularly in their textile and agricultural sectors, which could face job losses. However, some economists view this as a historic opportunity for Africa to reduce its economic dependency and strengthen intra-continental trade through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The expiration also comes as other partners, notably China, are increasing their trade ties with the continent.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has announced it will resume some manufacturing operations in the coming days after a significant cyber-attack forced a complete halt at its UK facilities on September 1. The restart will be phased, beginning with the engine plant in Wolverhampton, to ensure IT systems are brought back online securely. The month-long shutdown has placed immense financial pressure on the company and its extensive supply chain, which employs around 100,000 people. The government has since provided £1.5 billion in loan guarantees to support JLR and help stabilize the affected suppliers.</p>

          <p>Amid the Trump administration's plans to restrict the H-1B visa program, this article highlights that many of America's top tech leaders, including Elon Musk of Tesla and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, were once recipients of the visa. The program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign talent, has been crucial for individuals who went on to found or lead major corporations. While some of these leaders have supported reforms to the system, their stories underscore the program's role in attracting global talent that has significantly contributed to the U.S. technology sector and economy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis suggests that the evolving portrayal of fathers in television sitcoms, from the stoic Ward Cleaver of the 1950s to the anti-heroes like Tony Soprano, reflects and shapes America's changing perceptions of fatherhood. TV critic Phillip Maciak argues that these pop culture representations have helped make the idea of a "dad" more malleable for younger generations. This cultural shift could help explain recent survey data showing that more young men now want to be parents than young women. The article explores how the sitcom dad has mirrored societal shifts, from post-war provider to a more flexible, co-parenting figure.</p>

          <p>In a significant move to mitigate financial risks, China's Henan province has approved the consolidation of 82 small rural banks into a new entity, Henan Rural Commercial Bank. This merger is designed to shore up the stability of the region's smaller lenders, which are more vulnerable to economic downturns, particularly from the ongoing real estate slump. The new bank will absorb all assets, liabilities, and operations of the merged institutions. The action reflects broader concerns from regulators about the health of China's smaller financial institutions, with the central bank having recently flagged hundreds of them as high-risk.
