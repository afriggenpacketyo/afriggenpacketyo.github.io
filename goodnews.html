        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Emory University professor, inspired by a trip to Denmark, undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies. She found that engaging in activities like tennis, mahjong, and home DIY helped her overcome doomscrolling, build community, and redefine self-care beyond passive consumption. The experience fundamentally changed her perspective on work-life balance, leading her to conclude that actively pursuing hobbies is a key secret to happiness and personal growth. This journey also helped her feel less lonely and improved her social interactions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data reveals that Florida was the most popular state for retirees in 2023, attracting a net gain of over 44,500 residents aged 60 and older. Despite this leading position, the number represents a significant decrease from the previous year. The state's appeal is attributed to its lack of income, estate, or inheritance taxes, making it financially advantageous for those on fixed incomes. North Carolina and Arizona followed as popular retirement destinations, while California saw the largest exodus of this demographic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Mars Desert Research Station, operated by the nonprofit Mars Society, is located in the Utah desert and serves as a high-fidelity analog for Martian exploration. Crews of "analog astronauts" live in a confined habitat for weeks, following strict protocols and conducting research as if they were on Mars. This includes wearing simulated spacesuits for extravehicular activities (EVAs) in the Mars-like terrain. The facility aims to prepare humans for the psychological and logistical challenges of future missions to the red planet, which some experts believe could happen as early as 2029.</p>

          <p>This article explores the evolving relationship people have with physical activity, moving beyond purely aesthetic goals like weight loss. It suggests that finding a form of movement that one genuinely enjoys, such as weightlifting or running, can fundamentally improve one's sense of well-being and body comfort. The piece posits that exercise is often wrongly equated with a narrow definition of health, whereas its true benefits lie in mental clarity, stress relief, and community. The discussion encourages readers to unlearn negative associations and discover movement that brings them joy.</p>

          <h2>Medical Advancements Have Drastically Reduced Heart Attack Fatalities Over 50 Years</h2>

          <p>Deaths from heart attacks have plummeted by nearly 90 percent in the U.S. since the 1970s, marking a significant public health achievement. This dramatic improvement is attributed to a combination of factors, including widespread anti-smoking campaigns, the development of statin drugs to manage cholesterol, and better emergency medical treatments like CPR and angioplasty. Despite this progress, heart disease remains a leading cause of death, with challenges like obesity and diabetes posing ongoing risks. Future progress may depend on new drugs and increased access to advanced screening technologies.</p>

          <p>According to Chinese state-affiliated media, China and the European Union are close to resolving their dispute over electric vehicle (EV) tariffs. The "technical" aspects of the negotiations are said to be largely complete, with a final agreement now depending on the "political will" of the EU. The report suggests a deal could be imminent, potentially averting a trade war over EV subsidies and market practices. This development comes after a period of heightened trade tensions, with the EU launching multiple investigations into Chinese trade practices it deemed market-distorting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team achieved a 21-10 victory against an understrength Waratahs side, though the performance was marked by numerous errors. Scotland's Huw Jones scored two tries in the first half, but the Lions struggled with accuracy and discipline, allowing the Waratahs to close the gap. A third try from Alex Mitchell secured the win for the tourists, their third consecutive victory on the Australian tour. Despite the result, the disjointed and mistake-ridden play was seen as an underwhelming performance ahead of the upcoming Test series against the Wallabies.</p>

          <p>A coalition of residents, business groups, and environmentalists in Florida has successfully lobbied for a new law banning oil and gas exploration near the ecologically vital Apalachicola River and Bay. The "Kill the Drill" movement formed after the state initially granted an exploratory drilling permit, sparking fears of a repeat of the economic and environmental damage threatened by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. The newly signed bill, HB 1143, creates a permanent ban within 10 miles of certain protected areas, a major victory for local conservation and economic interests like fishing and tourism.</p>

This "touch of class" is seen as a potent marketing tool, particularly for American consumers.

          <p>The Apple TV+ series "Murderbot," based on Martha Wells's novellas, presents a unique perspective on artificial intelligence by featuring a security cyborg that achieves free will but has no interest in humanity. The protagonist, who secretly calls itself "Murderbot," prefers watching soap operas to interacting with the humans it is assigned to protect. This article suggests the show offers a refreshing departure from typical AI narratives that focus on machines desiring to become human or overthrow them. Instead, it imagines an AI whose desires are entirely its own, highlighting the potential for a true and unrelatable alien intelligence.</p>

The decision was attributed to a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, including low oil inventories.

          <p>This article profiles the work of Reverend William Barber and the revived Poor People's Campaign, a moral movement challenging systemic poverty and injustice in the United States. Grounded in a tradition of nonviolent protest and "fusion" organizing that unites diverse groups, the movement stages actions like "Moral Mondays" to protest policies they deem harmful to the poor. Barber's approach frames political issues as moral crises, challenging what he calls "policy murder" and the wedding of nationalism with exploitation. The movement aims to build a moral counter-narrative and force a public reckoning with inequality.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, could have cancer-fighting properties. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug may combat tumors by strengthening a key group of anti-tumor immune cells known as dendritic cells. These cells can become depleted as cancer progresses, and the study indicates that sildenafil could help reverse this process and restore their function. This discovery could potentially open up a new avenue for tumor immunotherapy strategies.</p>
