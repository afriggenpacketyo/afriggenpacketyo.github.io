          <p>OpenAI is backing a new large-scale AI data center in Norway, a project that marks its first major infrastructure investment of this kind in Europe. The facility, developed in a joint venture between British firm Nscale and Norway's Aker, will be powered entirely by renewable energy. It aims to house 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs by the end of 2026, significantly boosting the continent's computing capacity. This initiative aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data and AI workloads to be processed locally to enhance security and economic growth.</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are reportedly showing interest in China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet. According to Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke, the growing demand for air travel in Southeast Asia, combined with long delivery backlogs from industry giants Airbus and Boeing, is prompting carriers to seek alternatives. China's state-owned manufacturer, Comac, is marketing the C919 as a more readily available and cost-effective option. This regional interest highlights a potential shift in the global aviation market as new players emerge to challenge the established duopoly.</p>

          <p>Canada and Malta have announced their intention to formally recognize the state of Palestine this September at the United Nations General Assembly. This move aligns them with France and potentially the United Kingdom, increasing pressure for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the recognition is conditioned on the Palestinian Authority holding elections and demilitarizing. The decisions reflect growing international support for Palestinian statehood, with over 145 countries already extending recognition, as diplomatic efforts intensify amid the ongoing crisis in the region.</p>
