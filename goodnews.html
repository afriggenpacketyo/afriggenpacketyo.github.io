          <p>Newcastle United has completed the signing of forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford for a total fee of £55 million, following the rejection of two previous offers. The 28-year-old DR Congo international, who scored 19 Premier League goals last season, had publicly expressed his desire to leave Brentford. The move comes after Newcastle sold striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a record fee. Wissa is Newcastle's sixth major summer signing as the club continues to strengthen its squad under head coach Eddie Howe, who praised the forward's pace and work rate.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has signed striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle United for a British record transfer fee of £125 million, which could rise to £130 million with add-ons. The 25-year-old Sweden international signed a six-year contract, stating his motivation is to "create history and win trophies" at Anfield. This landmark deal concludes a protracted saga and elevates Liverpool's total summer spending to over £400 million, a Premier League record. The acquisition of Isak is one of the most expensive transfers in global football history, behind only PSG's signings of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe.</p>

          <p>In Benny Safdie's new film "The Smashing Machine," Dwayne Johnson portrays pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr during a period of personal and professional crisis. The review praises Johnson's casting as a "colossus of muscle," noting no other actor could have filled the role, and highlights his insightful scenes with co-star Emily Blunt, who plays his girlfriend. The film explores Kerr's struggles with substance abuse and the psychological fallout of his first loss. While the movie is described as a solid drama, the review suggests it doesn't quite reach the tragic depths of similar films and keeps the focus primarily on the fighting.</p>
