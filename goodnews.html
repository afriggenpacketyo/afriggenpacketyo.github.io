          <p>Speaking on the day of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's memorial service, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro called for national healing and a universal condemnation of political violence. The governor, whose own residence was targeted in an arson attack, described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and urged Americans to find commonalities rather than focus on differences. He praised Kirk's legacy of engaging in debate and emphasized that the answer to speech one disagrees with should be more speech, not violence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch and his father, Rupert Murdoch, are likely to be part of the investment group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations.

This development comes as negotiations continue to allow the Chinese-owned social media platform to operate in the U.S. under American control, addressing national security concerns.</p>

          <p>A half-mile stretch of London's iconic Oxford Street was closed to traffic for a day as part of a trial to pedestrianize the area. Mayor Sadiq Khan hailed the event as the beginning of a "fight back to rescue this street," with the goal of making the change permanent to increase footfall and create a more pleasant shopping and leisure destination. While the move is popular with many pedestrians, some local residents and businesses have raised concerns about traffic being displaced onto smaller side streets and potential accessibility issues.</p>

The video shows the brother and sister pair, who had been rehabilitated, snarling and aggressively attacking the doors of their transport cages as they were opened. The display underscores the wild nature of these majestic predators, whose populations remain threatened by poaching and habitat loss, making conservation and reintroduction efforts critically important for their survival.</p>

          <p>American runner Cole Hocker claimed a dramatic gold medal in the men's 5,000-meter final at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. Hocker was in 11th place at the start of the final lap but unleashed a devastating finishing kick to surge past the field and win the race. He described the victory as a moment of vindication, having been controversially disqualified from the 1500m semi-finals earlier in the competition, and stated he wanted to end the championships on his own terms.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, European captain Luke Donald has suggested that the US team's decision to accept payment could backfire with the notoriously tough New York crowd. Donald speculated that if the American players, who will receive a $500,000 stipend, are not performing well, the home fans might turn on them. In contrast, he noted that the European players unanimously chose to continue playing for free, motivated by the purpose of inspiring the next generation and supporting grassroots golf.</p>

The event marks a significant milestone for a waterway that was once notoriously polluted with sewage and industrial waste, so foul that its flow was reversed in 1900 to protect the city's drinking water. The successful swim symbolizes the remarkable transformation of the river into a recreational asset, made possible by the Clean Water Act and local restoration efforts.</p>

          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, stock markets have surged to new records, with some Wall Street strategists believing the rally has room to continue. Analysts suggest that the ongoing artificial intelligence boom is driving productivity and strong earnings prospects, justifying higher valuations than in previous eras. However, some caution that easier monetary policy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven more by investor FOMO than by solid fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction down the line.

          <p>According to well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can physically accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. She explains that stress shortens telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes, which naturally shrink as we age. However, this process can be slowed or even reversed through lifestyle changes. Epel recommends simple, sustainable practices like eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short daily breaks for meditation, and prioritizing deep rest to restore cells and combat the negative effects of stress.</p>

The article advises parents to talk openly about emotions, demonstrate empathy in daily life, and validate their child's feelings to build authentic confidence. By treating mistakes as learning opportunities and allowing children space to resolve their own minor conflicts, parents can foster resilience and emotional intelligence that form the foundation for healthy relationships.</p>
