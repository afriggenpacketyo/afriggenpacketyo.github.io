          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has indicated he will assess the most suitable governing framework following the pivotal House of Councillors election in July. He stressed that his ruling coalition securing a majority is a "must-attain" goal, though he acknowledged it will be difficult amid public concern over inflation and stagnant wages. This election represents the first national verdict on his government since it lost its majority in the more powerful lower house last year.</p>

          <p>According to sources, China is planning to invite U.S. President Donald Trump to a military parade in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This potential visit in September could mark the first in-person meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during Trump's second term. The invitation is seen as a significant diplomatic overture, although the article notes it could face opposition from some U.S. officials and is complicated by ongoing bilateral tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government was compelled to make significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to prevent a large-scale rebellion from its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the initial proposals were mishandled and that the subsequent changes, which include protecting disability payments for existing claimants, have improved the legislation. The U-turn came after more than 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the bill, arguing the planned cuts would harm vulnerable people.</p>

The liquid-fuel rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), has been a reliable workhorse for Japan's space development. It is now being replaced by the next-generation H3 rocket, which is designed to be more cost-competitive in the global launch market.

The 1925 quake exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a problem that took decades for many cities to address through mandatory retrofits. The event also spurred Santa Barbara to adopt a cohesive Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style, but the article notes that key vulnerabilities, like soft-story apartment buildings, still exist in the city and across the state today.</p>
