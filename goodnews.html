          <p>Catastrophe bonds are emerging as a crucial financial tool to help homeowners in high-risk areas secure affordable insurance, amidst rising insured property losses and escalating premiums. These bonds provide insurers with significant capital to cover claims if a disaster meets specific criteria, while investors receive returns if no such event occurs. A new model on Oak Island, North Carolina, even directs investor profits towards hurricane resilience upgrades like fortified roofs, demonstrating a proactive approach to mitigating disaster impact. This article highlights the innovative use of catastrophe bonds to stabilize insurance markets and fund preventative measures. (not investment advice)</p>

Spirit plans to cut 40 routes, furlough a third of its flight attendants, and reject leases on 27 aircraft, while also negotiating for $100 million in cuts from its pilots' union.

          <p>President Trump announced a deal with Pfizer to sell discounted drugs directly to consumers through a federal website, TrumpRx.gov, expected to launch in 2026. This initiative aims to align U.S. drug prices with those in other developed countries, with Pfizer agreeing to charge the same price for new drugs globally and offer Medicaid most-favored-nation pricing. While Pfizer claims an average 50% discount on TrumpRx.gov, critics argue the deal primarily benefits uninsured patients and may not significantly lower costs for average consumers due to high list prices. This article highlights the administration's efforts to address drug pricing, though its practical impact remains debated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 288, significantly expanding California's authority over workplace disputes and union elections, in response to the Trump administration's weakening of federal labor regulators. The new law empowers the California Public Employment Relations Board to intervene when the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) fails to act, particularly due to its functional paralysis after losing quorum. This article highlights California's proactive stance to protect workers' rights amidst federal gridlock and challenges to the NLRB's constitutionality. The legislation, though potentially facing legal challenges, aims to ensure workers can continue to unionize and bargain effectively.</p>
