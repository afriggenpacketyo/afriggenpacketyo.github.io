          <p>The article explores the often-overlooked role of personal finance, such as pensions and investments, in fueling the climate crisis by supporting fossil fuel projects. It highlights that shifting to a sustainable pension provider can significantly reduce an individual's carbon footprint. Major banks continue to invest heavily in the fossil fuel industry, often without the knowledge of their customers. The article also discusses green finance alternatives and the challenges of transparency and regulation in sustainable investing. Ultimately, the article suggests that individual actions, combined with citizen advocacy, can influence financial institutions to adopt more climate-friendly practices.</p>

          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering a program to temporarily host international students from Harvard University if they are barred from studying in the U.S. due to government policies. The university previously launched a similar program in 2022 for researchers and students affected by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The potential restrictions stem from actions by the U.S. government regarding Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program, though a temporary injunction is currently in place pending review.

          <p>LEVA, a delivery robot developed by ETH Zurich, combines wheeled and legged locomotion to navigate diverse terrains autonomously. Equipped with GPS, lidar, and cameras, LEVA can identify, lift, and carry cargo boxes weighing up to 187 pounds without human intervention. Its design allows it to roll on smooth surfaces and climb stairs or traverse rough ground, making it suitable for urban deliveries, agricultural tasks, construction sites, and emergency response scenarios. This innovation could lead to faster, more reliable deliveries and reduced labor costs for businesses, potentially revolutionizing material handling and logistics.</p>

          <p>A former state government official shares a story about rectifying a mistake where unemployment benefits were wrongly clawed back from high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The official highlights how a coalition of students, a rural Republican senator, and a lobbying group worked together to change state law and allow the students to keep the benefits. The author argues that building trust in institutions requires local action and investment, citing the importance of local journalism and community involvement. By focusing on local issues, people can find common ground and drive positive change, ultimately influencing broader national issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The Age of Diagnosis," argues that modern medicine's eagerness to diagnose and screen patients is creating problems, with doctors sometimes too quick to label conditions and prescribe treatments. The author, Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan, advocates for "slow medicine," where doctors take time to develop relationships with patients and carefully monitor symptoms before making a diagnosis. Overdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatments and anxiety, and O'Sullivan suggests that a more measured approach is needed to balance technological advancements with clinical judgment. She emphasizes that diagnosis is a clinical skill requiring understanding the patient's story in the context of tests.</p>

Lucas's hands-on approach and the museum's focus on his personal collection have raised questions about its broader purpose and artistic vision, though it is still expected to draw large crowds.</p>
