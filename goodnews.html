          <h2>Trump Announces Tentative Ceasefire Agreement Between Israel and Iran</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 22:37:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, set to fully take effect after 24 hours of winding down operations. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested that while Iran had ceased strikes, there was no formal agreement, and the final decision on military operations would be made later. The conflict, which began on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, has resulted in significant casualties on both sides. Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while other officials engaged with Iran through various channels, with Qatar helping to broker the deal. Optimism remains cautious as details are clarified and confirmed by all parties.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to insert the U.S. into the conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire, with White House officials touting a diplomatic breakthrough. While neither Israel nor Iran has definitively confirmed the development, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi indicated a halt to attacks if Israel ceases aggression. This follows a tumultuous day in the region, with Iran retaliating for U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Trump warned of an overwhelming American response to any Iranian attacks, but later suggested Iran's response was weak and that it was time for peace.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, Republican lawmakers have lauded President Trump's negotiating skills, while Democrats have been more reserved in their response. Republicans praised Trump's leadership and credited him with achieving a peaceful resolution, with some calling for him to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Democrats, however, expressed concerns about the legality and constitutionality of the U.S. military involvement without congressional approval. Representative Thomas Massie stated that he would not push for a resolution requiring congressional approval for attacks on Iran if the ceasefire holds.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer stated that a commitment to international law is at the heart of Sir Keir Starmer's government and its approach to foreign policy.

Hermer defended Starmer's decision to seek a warm relationship with President Trump, arguing it enables the UK to strike economic deals. He also highlighted the UK's success in securing trade deals with the United States, India, and the EU due to its reputation as a trustworthy international partner.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing its plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the United States to study at Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs issued an injunction, citing concerns that the administration's actions violated Harvard's free speech rights. The administration had accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, allegations the university denies. The ruling prevents the administration from blocking the ability of international students to attend Harvard, where almost 6,800 international students are enrolled.</p>
