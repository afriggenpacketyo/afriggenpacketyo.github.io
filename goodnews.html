          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has unveiled DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, an experimental AI model aiming to significantly increase efficiency and reduce operational costs for large language models. This new version incorporates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), which improves the AI's ability to handle extensive information by intelligently filtering out less relevant data, thereby cutting running costs by half. While this innovation promises greater accessibility for developers and smaller companies, experts express concerns about potential reliability issues stemming from the model's selective data processing. The article emphasizes DeepSeek's commitment to open-source sharing and its seamless integration with domestic Chinese AI chips, underscoring its role in the competitive global AI landscape.</p>

          <p>Wales captain Aaron Ramsey has been recalled to the national football squad for the crucial October World Cup qualifier against Belgium and a friendly match versus England. The 34-year-old midfielder was previously left out of the squad for earlier matches, having made only a single substitute appearance in six months as he recovered from injury. However, Ramsey has since demonstrated a strong return to form, starting three games and featuring in two others from the bench for his Mexican club, Pumas UNAM. The squad is further strengthened by the return of Leeds United's Ethan Ampadu and Joe Rodon, Coventry City's Jay Dasilva, and Wrexham's Nathan Broadhead, all recovering from their respective injuries.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is significantly accelerating its domestic arms production, particularly in the drone sector, driven by the uncertainty surrounding continued military assistance from the U.S. President Trump's decision to halt direct aid has prompted Ukraine to ramp up its manufacturing capabilities, with the country's tech entrepreneurs spearheading this transformation into a "defense valley." Drone production has surged from negligible levels three years ago to millions annually, with advanced models capable of striking deep inside Russia. While Ukraine still depends on the U.S. for sophisticated systems like Patriot air defense, it is also developing its own heavy weaponry, such as the Flamingo cruise missile, aiming for greater self-sufficiency and asserting its role as a capable defense partner.</p>

          <p>Indigenous communities across the U.S. are observing Orange Shirt Day to honor and remember the tens of thousands of Native children who suffered abuse and neglect in federal Indian boarding schools. Survivors, such as Ramona Klein, share painful accounts of forced family separation and various forms of abuse, underscoring the federal government's historical policy aimed at cultural eradication. An Interior Department investigation confirmed at least 973 deaths among American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children in these institutions. This observance, gaining traction in the U.S. mirroring Canada's National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, is a vital step towards collective healing, acknowledging historical injustices, and celebrating Indigenous resilience while ensuring these profound traumas are never forgotten.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. electric vehicle (EV) sales experienced a remarkable surge in the third quarter, largely propelled by consumers eager to capitalize on federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs before their September 30 expiration. Automakers and dealers intensified promotional efforts around this deadline, resulting in a notable boost across the entire automotive market, with used EVs also seeing rapid sales. Despite this recent spike, analysts forecast an impending "EV hangover" in the subsequent months as the accelerated demand inevitably wanes. The premature end of these tax credits is anticipated to decelerate future EV sales growth, prompting industry reflection on the balance between consumer incentives and organic market demand.

          <p>Everton midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has publicly expressed his "mind-boggling" frustration after incurring a suspension just six Premier League appearances into the season due to accumulating five yellow cards. The 27-year-old received a booking for a challenge during Monday's 1-1 draw against West Ham, which will force him to miss the upcoming game against Crystal Palace. His manager, David Moyes, supported Dewsbury-Hall's sentiment, labeling the referee's decision as "shabby" and openly questioning the general standard of officiating in the Premier League this season. This article captures the player's and manager's significant dissatisfaction with what they perceive as inconsistent or overly harsh refereeing, directly impacting team selection and performance.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair has been designated by U.S. President Donald Trump as the first named member of a new "Board of Peace," an international body set to temporarily oversee Gaza's governance under an American-led plan to end the conflict. Blair, with his prior experience as a Middle East envoy, believes this 20-point proposal represents the "best chance" to conclude the nearly two-year war, which also includes the demilitarization and redevelopment of Gaza. The plan outlines an immediate ceasefire, hostage releases, and substantial aid provisions, with Hamas reportedly reviewing the offer. While Blair's involvement draws scrutiny due to his Iraq War record, proponents emphasize his critical role in brokering the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has unequivocally ruled out the imposition of VAT on private healthcare services in the forthcoming autumn Budget, asserting "it's not happening" and guaranteeing no such levy. This statement addresses widespread speculation that Chancellor Rachel Reeves might introduce tax increases, including VAT, to adhere to self-imposed borrowing rules and secure funding for public services, particularly amidst elevated government borrowing costs and subdued economic growth. While some, like former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, supported taxing private healthcare to bolster NHS finances, Streeting reaffirmed Labour's election manifesto commitment against raising VAT, National Insurance, or income tax rates, despite the evolving global economic landscape acknowledged by Reeves.

          <p>The UK Prime Minister is poised to announce the launch of a new NHS online hospital service in England by 2027, with the ambitious goal of substantially reducing waiting times. This digital platform, named NHS Online, will employ dedicated doctors to conduct online assessments, consultant check-ups, and follow-up appointments, additionally enabling patients to book scans or tests at local community diagnostic centers. Its phased introduction will focus on specialties where many patients may not require inpatient treatment, such as ophthalmology and gynecology. Building on successful pilot programs, this initiative is projected to deliver 8.5 million appointments within its initial three years, thereby freeing up capacity for in-person care while also addressing critical considerations regarding patient data privacy and preventing digital exclusion.</p>

This strong market performance by Zijin Gold, serving as the overseas gold-mining arm of China's largest mined gold producer, contributes to a notable resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market.
