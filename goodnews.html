National police chief Dieter Romann gave a favorable initial assessment of the tightened border controls and dismissed the police union‚Äôs concerns about overburdened personnel.

          <p>Theoharis and Sandweiss-Back argue that to effectively counter Trump's proposed legislative cuts, a new social contract is needed that lifts from the bottom of society. They draw lessons from past poor people's movements, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), which staged mass marches and demonstrations. The NWRO championed welfare as a right and demanded a guaranteed adequate income, principles that remain relevant today. The authors advocate for the poor to unite across differences, assume leadership, and build visionary projects of survival to transform indignation into lasting power.</p>

While the risk for occasional flyers is low, flight crew members face a higher risk of melanoma due to increased exposure. Sunscreen is recommended for all passengers, especially those with a history of skin cancer or increased sun sensitivity. Dermatologists emphasize the importance of broad-spectrum sunscreen and physical protection like hats and sunglasses to mitigate sun damage during flights.</p>

          <p>A shift has occurred in American elections where stricter voting laws no longer benefit Republicans. Historically, lower turnout favored Republicans due to their affluent electorate's ability to vote despite inconveniences.

          <p>President Trump announced his decision to withdraw the nomination of Jared Isaacman, an associate of Elon Musk, to lead NASA, citing a thorough review of Isaacman's prior associations. The White House did not provide further explanation for the decision. Isaacman, CEO of Shift4 and a SpaceX collaborator, had been nominated in December and approved by the Senate Commerce Committee. Musk expressed disappointment, praising Isaacman's competence, while Semafor first reported the withdrawal.</p>

          <p>China maintained a subdued presence at the Shangri-La Dialogue, with its defense minister absent and a plenary session canceled. Military academic institutions, rather than the defense minister, led the response to American messaging, deviating from typical protocol. The absence of bilateral talks between China and other nations, including the United States, was noted, despite growing concerns about Beijing‚Äôs military strength. The Chinese delegation communicated that they would not be conducting bilateral engagements during the dialogue.</p>
