          <p>A Florida homeowner in Palmetto Bay discovered 98 iguana eggs in her backyard, prompting a call to Humane Iguana Control. The removal team found that three female iguanas had nested in interconnected burrows, laying their clutches in the same location. Iguanas are invasive in Florida and pose health risks, cause landscape destruction, and damage infrastructure through burrowing. Experts advise homeowners not to cover the holes but to flag the burrows and call a professional removal company due to the reptiles' sharp claws, teeth, and whipping tails.</p>

          <p>Professor Sir John Curtice analyzes the Reform Party's strong performance in recent local council elections, noting their success in winning votes and seats. The party's support is particularly strong among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019, suggesting it is more than just a protest vote. Reform's appeal is concentrated in areas that have been characterized as 'left-behind' Britain, where globalization and university expansion have had less impact. The party's success poses a challenge for both the Conservative and Labour parties, requiring them to appeal more to this segment of the population.</p>

          <p>Labour minister Lucy Powell apologized for describing grooming gangs as a "dog whistle" issue during a heated debate on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions. Her remarks drew backlash from political opponents. Powell clarified that she regards child exploitation and grooming with the utmost seriousness and was challenging the political point scoring around the issue, not the issue itself. During the debate, Powell was responding to a question about Reform UK's pledge to replicate the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett announced he will ask the board of Berkshire Hathaway to have Greg Abel replace him as CEO at year end. Buffett, 94, said he will still "hang around" to help, but the final word on company operations and capital deployment would be with Abel, 62. Buffett bought what was then a failing New England textile mill, and over six decades transformed the company into a one-of-a-kind conglomerate with businesses ranging from Geico insurance to BNSF Railway. Buffett is handing over his reins on a high note as Berkshire shares just reached a new peak, giving the conglomerate a market cap of nearly $1.2 trillion.</p>
