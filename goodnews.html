          <p>Haoxiang Gao, a Chinese national attending the University of Michigan, has fled the U.S. after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote at a campus polling location, leading to state charges. Despite a judge's order to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. The FBI has filed federal charges of flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China.</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees prevented a series sweep by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3, after the Dodgers had won the first two games of the series. Yoshinobu Yamamoto had a rare poor start, failing to consistently find the strike zone and struggling with his splitter.

The Dodgers' offense, missing Mookie Betts, struggled against Ryan Yarbrough, resulting in an inconsistent performance and a missed opportunity to build momentum.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Sounders protested the bonus structure for the Club World Cup, wearing shirts reading "Club World Ca$h Grab" during warm-ups. The MLS Players Association supports the protest, arguing that FIFA's new tournament increases player workload without adequate compensation. MLS teams will receive significant amounts to participate, but players are only entitled to 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million per team, leading to an unequal distribution of prize money. The MLSPA has sought meetings with MLS to address the arrangement, but the league has not provided a reasonable proposal.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more effectively to deliver courses, due to financial challenges in the higher education sector. Universities are reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about violating business laws, potentially leading to course closures and mergers. A government review of higher education funding is underway in England, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) expressed support for collaboration where possible. The report suggests that neighboring universities should be allowed to coordinate course offerings to avoid duplication and ensure cost-effectiveness.</p>
