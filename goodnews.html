          <p>Burger King is shifting its strategy to focus on attracting families, starting with a partnership tied to the "How to Train Your Dragon" movie. The fast-food chain will introduce limited-time menu items like the Dragon Flame-Grilled Whopper and Fiery Dragon Mozzarella Fries. Burger King is aiming to reverse recent sales declines by appealing to a broader customer base and capitalizing on the social media presence of parents. The chain's focus on natural dyes in the colored buns comes as artificial food dyes face increased scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A Vox editor experimented with using a flip phone for a month, aiming to reduce screen time and improve real-life connections. The experiment led to more frequent phone calls with friends and family, and a greater appreciation for in-person interactions. While the switch had drawbacks, such as difficulty with texting and missing out on social media events, the overall experience resulted in a more fulfilling social life and improved attention span. The article emphasizes the importance of valuing off-the-cuff hangs and spontaneous moments.</p>

          <p>Kenya is working to expand its tea exports to China, with plans for China to provide tax-free tea packaging materials to Kenya. This partnership aims to improve the quality of Kenyan tea and diversify its exports. The agreement is expected to facilitate the establishment of modern factories in Kenya and align the country's tea industry with international market demands. Kenya also benefits from trade frameworks like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which provide preferential access to African and U.S. markets, respectively.</p>

          <p>UK health officials have detected West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes for the first time. The risk to the general public is considered "very low," and there is no evidence of the virus spreading within the UK. Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023. The detection is attributed to climate change, which is pushing mosquito-borne diseases further north. There have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK to date.</p>
