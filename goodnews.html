          <p>In a wide-ranging BBC interview, UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch shared personal anecdotes that have shaped her political character and worldview. She recounted an incident from her school days in Nigeria where she reported a classmate for cheating, highlighting her strong stance against rule-breaking. Badenoch also discussed her experience with the 'poverty of low expectations' for Black children in the UK education system in the 1990s and spoke about losing her religious faith while still identifying as a 'cultural Christian.' She expressed confidence in her ability to lead the Conservative Party despite current political challenges.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel made a celebrated return to the Hollywood Bowl, marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The performance featured a savvy program blending the music of Duke Ellington with Maurice Ravel's jazzy piano concertos, performed by soloist Seong-Jin Cho. The concert was a vibrant display of the orchestra's versatility, particularly in its rare and energetic performance of Ellington's symphonic works. The event was also bittersweet, as Dudamel's upcoming performances with his Venezuelan orchestra were canceled due to travel issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the tech giant will increase its U.S. investment commitment by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total planned domestic spending to $600 billion over four years. The announcement comes as Apple seeks to navigate the administration's tariff policies, which threaten to increase costs for its internationally produced iPhones. Trump praised the move as a step toward making iPhones in America, though final assembly is expected to remain overseas. The new investment focuses on expanding Apple's U.S. supply chain and advanced manufacturing partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new plan to regulate the non-surgical cosmetic industry, aiming to crack down on unsafe practitioners and protect consumers. The proposals include a licensing scheme for clinics offering procedures like Botox and fillers, requiring them to meet strict safety and training standards. For higher-risk treatments such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), only qualified health professionals will be permitted to perform them. The move, which has been welcomed by industry watchdogs, follows growing concerns over dangerous complications and a recent death linked to an unregulated procedure.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin could occur 'very soon,' with a potential trilateral summit including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to follow. The development comes after Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, held what the president described as 'highly productive' talks in Moscow aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. While the White House confirmed Trump is open to the meetings, Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned that 'many impediments' remain. The diplomatic push occurs as a deadline approaches for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face new U.S. sanctions.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, has predicted that a record number of 18-year-old students will be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their grades. This trend is reportedly driven by universities seeking financial stability from domestic student enrollment amid uncertainty surrounding international student numbers. With tuition fees for UK students rising, universities are keen to fill their courses. The forecast suggests a more favorable admissions landscape for local applicants as they prepare to receive their A-level results next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely anticipated to cut its main interest rate on Thursday, which would be the fifth reduction since last August and would bring borrowing costs to their lowest level in over two years. A rate cut would provide relief for some mortgage holders but would mean lower returns for savers. The decision comes as the UK economy shows signs of stagnation and the labor market cools, which could help ease inflationary pressures. The Bank will also release its latest economic forecasts alongside the interest rate decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Find Evidence of People Living in Pompeii's Ruins After Eruption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 18:39:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research suggests that survivors of the catastrophic AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii. Evidence indicates that a precarious settlement, described as a 'favela among the ruins,' existed at the site until the 5th century. It is believed that some survivors who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others, settled in the upper floors of buried homes and salvaged valuable materials. This discovery challenges the long-held image of Pompeii as a city completely abandoned after its destruction, revealing a more complex history of post-disaster survival.</p>
