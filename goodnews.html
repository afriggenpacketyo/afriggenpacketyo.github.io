          <h2>WNBA Players Advocate for Higher Pay Amid Questions Over League's Financial Reporting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 05:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>WNBA players are publicly demanding higher compensation, highlighted by pre-game shirts stating "Pay us what you owe us," as they negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. While the league has reported annual losses, other financial indicators like rising attendance, ballooning broadcast rights deals, and soaring team valuations suggest significant growth. Players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a figure they argue is disproportionately low compared to other professional sports. The debate centers on the league's accounting practices and whether player salaries reflect their contribution to the WNBA's expanding value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following deadly floods in the Texas Hill Country, state lawmakers are convening a special session to fund recovery efforts and improve future disaster response, including early warning systems. The session occurs amid national uncertainty over the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which the state relies on for matching grants. While disaster relief is a priority, Governor Greg Abbott has also added controversial GOP agenda items like congressional redistricting and stricter abortion laws to the session's docket. This sets the stage for a politically charged session balancing urgent recovery needs with partisan objectives.</p>

          <h2>Proposed US Legislation Aims to Ban Toxic Chemicals from Beauty and Personal Care Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new package of four bills, named the "Safer Beauty Bill Package," has been introduced by Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. House to address the minimal federal oversight of chemicals in cosmetics. The legislation aims to ban hazardous ingredients like formaldehyde and phthalates, require greater supply chain transparency, and fund research into safer alternatives, particularly for products marketed to women of color and salon workers, who are disproportionately exposed. This move follows years of research linking chemicals in personal care products to serious health issues and aims to align U.S. standards more closely with stricter regulations in the European Union.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, known as "Fito," the notorious leader of the violent Los Choneros drug gang, to the United States. Fito, who had previously escaped from an Ecuadorian prison, faces U.S. charges for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine. His organization is known for using hitmen, bribery, and military-grade weapons to control key trafficking routes with the help of Mexican cartels. The extradition marks a significant step in transnational efforts to dismantle a criminal enterprise that has targeted law enforcement, politicians, and civilians in Ecuador.</p>

          <h2>Experimental Nanovaccine Shows Promise in Preventing Cancer Recurrence in Animal Studies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:55:41 EDT</div>

          <p>A research team from China and Singapore has developed a novel nanovaccine that has successfully suppressed cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal tests. The bio-inspired approach targets cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are often responsible for tumors returning after treatment due to their self-renewing properties. Published in Nature Nanotechnology, the findings suggest a promising new avenue for creating personalized cancer vaccines. By effectively targeting the root cause of relapse, this innovative technology could potentially transform long-term outcomes for cancer patients if proven successful in human trials.</p>

          <h2>Venture Capitalists Use 'Power Law' to Identify Startups with Massive Return Potential</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:48:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists often rely on the "power law" principle when deciding which startups to fund, focusing on companies with the potential for exceptionally large, outlier returns. This concept, originating from the Pareto principle, posits that a very small number of investments will generate the vast majority of a fund's profits, outweighing all losses and smaller successes combined. To attract VC interest, founders are advised to pitch a compelling vision for how their company can become a category-defining giant, rather than just a modest success. This approach emphasizes visionary storytelling and demonstrating a clear path to an outsized outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports of rare-earth magnets to the U.S. increased by over 660% in June compared to the previous month, as American companies rushed to secure the critical components. This surge follows a preliminary trade deal that eased Beijing's export licensing requirements, which were imposed in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. China dominates the global supply of these magnets, essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other advanced technologies. The renewed flow of exports provides relief to U.S. industries that faced shortages but also highlights America's deep dependency on China's supply chain for these strategic materials.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A landmark review of the water industry in England and Wales has recommended the most significant reforms since privatization, including abolishing the current regulator, Ofwat. Authored by Sir Jon Cunliffe, the report contains 88 recommendations aimed at fixing a system plagued by underinvestment, leaks, and sewage spills. Key proposals include introducing minimum capital levels to prevent excessive debt, giving regulators power to block unsuitable ownership changes, and focusing on long-term infrastructure investment. The reforms are designed to ensure that future bill increases are tied to tangible improvements in service and environmental protection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners known as the "Battle of Orgreave," a pivotal event during the year-long miners' strike. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the inquiry will investigate the events of the day and their aftermath, including the discredited evidence used in the failed prosecutions of 95 miners. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for over a decade, cautiously welcomed the news. The incident remains one of the most contentious episodes in British industrial history, and the inquiry aims to provide long-awaited answers and justice.</p>

          <p>Two teenage boys were rescued from a disused slate mine in Wales after becoming stranded deep underground. The rescue was initiated after their canoe capsized on a freezing subterranean lake, leaving one of the boys wet and cold. The mother of one teen, an experienced caver who was with them, made the difficult decision to leave them in a safe location and trek for over two hours to get a signal and call for help. A specialized cave rescue team located the boys, who were found cold but safe, and successfully brought them to the surface.</p>

          <p>China is expected to begin importing significant quantities of iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, as Chinese-led infrastructure projects near completion. In Guinea, mining giant Rio Tinto and its Chinese partners are finalizing the railway and port needed to exploit the massive Simandou iron ore deposit, with shipments slated to begin in November. Similarly, a new rail line is being built in Algeria to connect the Gara Djebilet mine in the Sahara to Mediterranean ports. These projects will overcome longstanding logistical hurdles and secure new sources of a critical industrial commodity for Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>
