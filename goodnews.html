          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz has reached his first-ever Wimbledon semi-final after a four-set victory over Karen Khachanov. Fritz appeared dominant after winning the first two sets but experienced a sudden collapse in the third, which he lost 6-1. After a medical timeout, he regained his composure to win a tense fourth-set tie-break, securing the match 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4). As the fifth seed, Fritz is now the highest-ranked American male player seeking to end the country's long drought for a men's Grand Slam singles title.</p>

          <p>A year after his Conservative Party's major election defeat, former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is rejoining Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This marks a return to the investment bank where he began his career in the early 2000s before entering politics. According to the announcement, Sunak will advise global clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical matters. Due to government watchdog rules, his role is restricted for another year to prevent conflicts of interest related to his time as Prime Minister, and he must wait a year before taking the position.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is reportedly planning to end its long-standing policy requiring travelers to remove their shoes during security screenings. An internal memo indicates the change will begin at many major airports and eventually roll out nationwide. This would reverse a security measure that has been in place for nearly two decades, since the failed shoe-bombing attempt in 2001. While passengers in the PreCheck program could often keep shoes on, this new policy would extend that convenience to all travelers in standard screening lanes, aiming to expedite the security process.</p>

          <p>The iconic Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the Norman conquest of England in 1066, will be loaned to the UK for the first time since its creation. The 70-meter-long embroidery will be displayed at the British Museum starting next year as part of a historic agreement between the French and British governments. This cultural exchange will occur while the tapestry's home in the Bayeux Museum undergoes renovation. In return, British treasures, including artifacts from Sutton Hoo, will be loaned to museums in Normandy, symbolizing a strong cultural partnership between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve shows that consumer fears of a sharp inflation spike due to tariffs have subsided. In June, respondents anticipated an inflation rate of 3% for the next 12 months, the same level as in January before the administration's most aggressive trade actions. This figure is down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April. The data suggests that despite ongoing trade negotiations, the public's outlook on near-term price increases has stabilized, aligning with official data showing only modest inflation.

          <p>Boeing delivered 60 airplanes in the last month, its highest total since December 2023, indicating a ramp-up in production of its 737 Max jets. The increase follows a period of slowed production after a door plug blowout incident in January 2024, which intensified scrutiny over the company's manufacturing and safety protocols. Of the 60 planes, 42 were 737 Max models delivered to major airlines. This marks the company's best second-quarter performance since 2018, suggesting progress in overcoming its recent series of crises and production challenges.</p>

Brokerage cash sweeps are also a popular option for earning returns on uninvested funds. The article stresses that while these tools are ideal for short-term goals, long-term savings still require a diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
