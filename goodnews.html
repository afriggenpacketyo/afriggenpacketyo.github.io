          <h2>Sovereignty Upsets Journalism to Win Kentucky Derby in Rainy Conditions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sovereignty defied expectations by winning the Kentucky Derby in 2 minutes and 2 seconds on a muddy track, overcoming favorite Journalism. Jockey Junior Alvarado secured his first Derby win, while trainer Bill Mott celebrated his second, albeit one resulting from a disqualification in 2019. The race, attended by approximately 140,000 spectators, saw the controversial trainer Bob Baffert return after a suspension, though his horse, Citizen Bull, did not win. Recent safety enhancements at Churchill Downs, implemented after a series of horse deaths, appeared effective during the race, as there were no breakdowns reported. The weather added another unknown variable to how the race would unfold, as horses react differently to wet tracks and some have never raced in such conditions.</p>

          <p>America's oldest continuously running distillery, Buffalo Trace, located in Frankfurt, Kentucky, has reopened after being severely impacted by historic flooding.

Despite previous weather-related setbacks, including floods and tornadoes, the distillery owners are committed to remaining in Frankfurt. The reopening occurred just in time for "Derby Week," a period of heightened activity surrounding the Kentucky Derby, and is important to the local economy and the distillery's 770 employees.</p>

          <p>Psychiatrist Awais Aftab discusses the complexities of antidepressant use, noting that while these medications can be lifesaving for some, they also have a less-publicized side involving sexual side effects, manic episodes, and severe withdrawal symptoms. He criticizes the lack of high-quality research on safely tapering patients off antidepressants, leading many to rely on online communities for guidance. Aftab argues that the medical community needs to engage seriously with patients' concerns about psychiatric medications, acknowledging both the benefits and trade-offs. The author emphasizes the importance of scientific transparency to maintain credibility and avoid leaving vulnerable individuals open to exploitation.</p>

          <p>A Florida homeowner discovered 98 iguana eggs in her backyard, leading to the removal of three interconnected nests by Humane Iguana Control. Iguanas, an invasive species in Florida, pose health risks and cause property damage by digging burrows. The high hatch rate of iguana eggs (93%) makes their removal crucial to prevent further infestation. Experts advise against covering up the holes and recommend contacting a licensed removal company due to the reptiles' sharp claws, teeth, and whipping tails.</p>

          <p>An election is underway to incorporate a new city in Texas, known as Boca Chica Village, as Starbase, largely dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX. The creation of this new municipality would allow the local government to have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. The area has seen an increase in company housing and SpaceX facilities. Environmental groups have criticized SpaceX's impact on nearby wildlife, and say the company has increased light pollution and littered the area with debris from rocket launches.</p>
