        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author Suleika Jaouad, in her new book "The Book of Alchemy," advocates for the power of daily journaling as a tool for personal transformation and creative inspiration. Drawing from her own experiences with illness and the pandemic, she explains how journaling can help individuals make sense of their lives and process difficult moments. Jaouad suggests that reading passages from other writers' diaries can offer new perspectives and break creative blocks. For those starting out, she recommends setting a consistent time, integrating it into a daily routine like a morning coffee, and keeping the barrier to entry low by not worrying about the "right" way to do it.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions have made two changes to their starting lineup for the decisive third and final Test against the Wallabies in Sydney. Blair Kinghorn will start on the left wing, and James Ryan comes in at lock, as the team aims for a historic 3-0 series whitewash. Coach Andy Farrell emphasized cohesion, retaining the core of the team that has performed strongly throughout the tour. The selection reflects a focus on winning rather than sentiment, as the Lions seek to become the first of their kind to complete a clean sweep in a series since 1927.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the crucial but often overlooked role of American cyclist Matteo Jorgenson in the 2025 Tour de France. As a "domestique" for the Visma Lease-a-Bike team, Jorgenson's primary job was to support team leader Jonas Vingegaard, often sacrificing his own ambitions by relentlessly challenging dominant rider Tadej Pogačar. Though Vingegaard couldn't overcome Pogačar, Jorgenson's persistent attacks, even while battling bronchitis, ultimately exhausted the race leader. This selfless effort created the opening for his teammate Wout van Aert to win the final stage in Paris, a triumph of team strategy and individual sacrifice over personal glory.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is launching its first European "Stargate" branded AI data center in northern Norway, a project that will run entirely on renewable energy. The facility, a joint venture between British firm Nscale and Norway's Aker, will initially house 100,000 Nvidia GPUs and have 230 megawatts of capacity, making it one of Europe's largest. OpenAI will be a primary customer, buying capacity to deliver services and features to the European continent. This move aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data processing to occur on European soil, and addresses the continent's need for more large-scale AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have reached a trade agreement that includes a partnership to develop Pakistan's significant oil reserves, according to a late-night announcement from former President Donald Trump. The deal also reportedly involves lower tariffs on Pakistani exports to the U.S., averting a potential 29% tariff that was looming. While details remain scarce, Pakistan's finance minister called the agreement a "win-win" situation for both nations. The announcement came shortly after the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on India, with Trump suggesting Pakistan might one day sell oil to its regional rival. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Malaysia's Transport Minister, several Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are showing interest in China's homegrown C919 passenger jet. This interest is driven by a need to diversify aircraft procurement and find alternatives to the long delivery backlogs from industry giants Airbus and Boeing. China's state-owned manufacturer, Comac, is promoting the C919 narrowbody airliner as a more readily available and cheaper option for carriers in Southeast Asia. The growing demand for air travel in the region is creating a significant market opportunity for new players like Comac to challenge the established duopoly.</p>

          <p>Canada and Malta have announced their intention to formally recognize the state of Palestine this September at the United Nations General Assembly. This move aligns them with France and potentially the United Kingdom, increasing pressure for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the decision is predicated on the Palestinian Authority holding elections and demilitarizing. The announcements were made during a U.N. conference on the conflict, which Israel and the United States boycotted, with Israel's ambassador criticizing the move as a "waste of time that legitimizes terrorism."</p>

          <p>Auction house Sotheby's has facilitated the return of a set of sacred jewels, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, to India after facing intense pressure. The planned auction of the "Piprahwa Gems" was canceled following diplomatic intervention from the Indian government and global Buddhist leaders who argued that sacred relics should not be commodified. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the jewels, which will now be placed on permanent public display in India. The relics were originally unearthed in 1898 from a stupa in northern India, and their return is being hailed as a major victory for the country's cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged over 16% after the U.S. and South Korea announced a trade deal that includes a blanket 15% tariff on Seoul's exports. The company is expected to play a key role in revitalizing U.S. shipbuilding through its Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, which it acquired last year. The stock's rise was also bolstered by a strong second-quarter financial report, which showed a significant jump in operating profits and revenue. Hanwha Ocean has also recently announced new orders and initiatives aimed at increasing its global competitiveness against Chinese shipbuilders. (not investment advice)</p>
