          <p>Nintendo's new Switch 2 gaming system has achieved record-breaking sales, surpassing 3.5 million units in the first four days after its release. The strong demand has led to major U.S. retailers posting "out of stock" notices on their online stores.

The Switch 2's successful launch highlights the company's ability to innovate and capture the attention of gamers worldwide, continuing the success of its predecessor.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several factors, including geopolitical uncertainties and currency hedging, are driving Asia's move away from reliance on the U.S. dollar. ASEAN nations are committed to boosting the use of local currencies in trade and investment to reduce exchange rate fluctuations. BRICS nations are also developing their own payment systems to bypass traditional systems like SWIFT. This de-dollarization trend is evident in central bank reserves and trade transactions, as Asian economies seek to reduce FX risks and leverage their own currencies. Optimism score is 60.</p>
