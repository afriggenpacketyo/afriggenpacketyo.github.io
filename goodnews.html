        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the prohibition of bottom trawling in its offshore areas designated as protected, increasing the area covered from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans, coinciding with the UN Ocean Conference in France. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed, with environmental groups like Greenpeace UK and The Wildlife Trust welcoming the move as a win-win for nature and climate. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty to protect 30% of the ocean. The article notes that the UK is among the countries that has yet to ratify.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports to the U.S. saw a significant drop of 34.5% year-on-year in May, marking the steepest decline since February 2020 due to tariffs. Overall exports rose 4.8% but fell short of expectations, while imports plunged 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. This decline was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. Volumes of car and ship exports increased, while smartphone and home appliance exports decreased, reflecting shifts in global trade dynamics. The article notes that China's imports of soybeans surged to a record high, and that the tariff ceasefire occurred in mid-May, by which point the damage was already done. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has started mass production of the world‚Äôs first non-binary AI chip, a breakthrough led by Professor Li Hongge‚Äôs team at Beihang University in Beijing. This innovation overcomes barriers in traditional computing by merging binary and stochastic logic, enabling improved fault tolerance and power efficiency in intelligent control applications. The new Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system combines traditional binary numbers with probability-based numbers. This development could help China sidestep US chip restrictions.</p>
