          <p>The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, equipped with the world's largest digital camera, has released its first images of star nurseries and distant galaxies. The observatory's telescope will conduct detailed images of the southern hemisphere sky for 10 years, creating a time-lapse record. Among the first images is a composite photo of the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula, as well as an image of the Virgo Cluster, which comprises up to 2,000 galaxies. The observatory is named after Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided evidence for the existence of dark matter.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have found evidence that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may be affecting the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. Researchers monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays and gamma ray-induced particle disturbances. The findings could be significant for the scaling of quantum processors and the design of fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. The detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection.</p>

          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) at the upcoming summit. The U.S. is pushing for this increase, comprising 3.5% for pure defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While some members are close to meeting this target, others lag behind the 2% threshold agreed upon a decade ago. European aerospace and defense companies are closely monitoring these commitments, but they remain uncertain about concrete government procurement plans to enable them to scale up production.

The plan aims to cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses through a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme. Manufacturers will see reduced electricity prices, and the most energy-intensive firms will have their network charges cut. The strategy also includes measures to speed up the connection of new factories and projects to the energy grid, with the goal of creating over one million new jobs over the next decade.

This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression.
