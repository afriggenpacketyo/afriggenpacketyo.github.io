          <p>Travelers who haven‚Äôt obtained a REAL ID by the deadline will still be able to fly, but should be prepared for extra scrutiny, according to Homeland Security head Kristi Noem. While 81% of travelers already have compliant IDs, those without may be diverted to a different line for additional identity checks. Passports and tribal IDs will also be accepted at security checkpoints. REAL ID, a federally compliant state-issued license, was recommended by the 9/11 Commission to set security standards for state-issued driver‚Äôs licenses and IDs, with the implementation repeatedly delayed since its initial rollout in 2008. </p>

          <p>The Gujarat Titans secured a remarkable final-ball victory over the Mumbai Indians in an Indian Premier League match that was heavily affected by rain. The match saw several shifts in momentum, with a second rain delay appearing to favor Mumbai, as Gujarat needed 24 runs from 12 balls and was behind on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method. Following the delay, Gujarat's target was adjusted, requiring 15 runs from the final six balls, which they achieved after a series of dramatic plays and a missed run-out opportunity by Mumbai's captain Hardik Pandya. Titans won by three runs via the DLS method.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump, aiming to assert Canada's sovereignty while avoiding conflict, days after being elected on an anti-Trump platform amid strained relations. Carney emphasized that Canada is not for sale and will not become the 51st state, despite Trump's suggestion. Trump, who had criticized Canada's dependence on the U.S. before the meeting, adopted a conciliatory tone, praising Carney's electoral victory. The leaders discussed trade and security issues, with Carney highlighting the need for ongoing discussions beyond trade, but no major breakthroughs were expected from the meeting.</p>

          <p>Retail investors poured over $24 million into Berkshire Hathaway's Class B stock after Warren Buffett announced his intention to leave the CEO role at year-end, with Greg Abel set to take over. This influx demonstrates confidence in Abel and suggests that Berkshire is not solely a Warren Buffett cult stock. Despite a 5% decline in shares following the announcement, everyday traders showed strong interest, with net inflows more than tripling compared to the previous Friday. Buffett plans to remain involved and praised Abel, potentially reassuring investors about the company's future direction. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump stated that the Houthis "capitulated" and no longer want to fight, with the U.S. taking their word. Oman's foreign ministry confirmed a ceasefire brokered by Oman, ensuring freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait. The Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group, have been targeting ships in the region since 2023 in response to Israeli military action in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The major deepfake pornography site, MrDeepFakes, has shut down after losing a key service provider, leading to data loss and making continued operation impossible. The site was known for hosting nonconsensual, digitally altered, explicit sexual content, often featuring celebrities and, in some cases, private individuals. A study found that the site hosted thousands of videos depicting thousands of individuals, which had been viewed over a billion times. The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed the TAKE IT DOWN Act, which aims to combat the proliferation of deepfake pornography by establishing penalties for publishing such content without consent.</p>

Carney's body language during the meeting conveyed his strong stance, with a clenched jaw and attempts to interject during discussions on tariffs. Trump launched a scathing attack on Canada on Truth Social moments before the meeting, claiming the U.S. subsidizes Canada by $200 billion a year. Despite the tense prelude, the meeting was more cordial than expected, with diplomats on both sides relieved.</p>

Attenborough hopes the film will spur leaders to take action on promises to protect a third of the world's oceans at an upcoming UN conference.

Black dandyism has always been practiced by those interested in much more than materialism and the latest style, and is a truly radical kind of freedom, accessible perhaps only through a constant, playful, yet studied change of clothes. While the theme leaned toward men, women creatively connected to it, performing exaggerated forms of masculinity with tailored suits, hats, and other accessories.</p>
