          <p>Starbase, Texas, the town housing Elon Musk's SpaceX facilities, has notified some residents that they might "lose the right to continue using" their property as they currently do. This warning comes as Starbase considers a new zoning ordinance and city-wide map, with a public hearing scheduled for June 23, 2025. The proposed "Mixed Use District" would allow for residential, office, retail, and small-scale service uses. Starbase was officially formed earlier this month and is now run by officials who are SpaceX employees and former employees.</p>

The court consists of nine judges appointed for life by the U.S. president, with Senate consent.

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are declining again, with the average rate dropping to 8.14%, making them one of the cheapest ways to borrow money currently. Borrowers should be aware that rates could rise or fall unexpectedly, and long-term affordability needs to be closely calculated. Homeowners can also consider refinancing a HELOC into a home equity loan with a fixed interest rate in the future. With HELOC rates on the decline, homeowners should keep these considerations in mind to make an informed decision. (not investment advice)</p>
