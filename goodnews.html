          <p>The German government has approved a draft budget for 2025, which includes a significant increase in government spending, facilitated by easing the country's debt brake. The budget allocates funds to repair aging infrastructure, support economic stimulus, and substantially increase military investment, with the defense budget expected to more than double by 2029. Net borrowing is set to rise sharply, reaching ‚Ç¨81.8 billion in 2025. The budget was delayed due to national elections and is now heading to the Bundestag for debate before a final vote in September.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned that stablecoins may only have a minor role in the future financial system, citing a lack of key characteristics found in traditional currencies. The BIS suggests that stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currencies or reserve assets, are susceptible to illicit use due to their pseudonymity and lack of issuer oversight. Instead, the BIS proposes a unified platform for tokenized central bank reserves, commercial bank deposits, and government bonds as a more viable foundation for the next-generation monetary and financial system. This perspective comes amid increasing interest in stablecoins from major economies. </p>

          <p>After applying for 647 jobs, Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, secured a trainee accountant position following an 18-month job search. Morgan, who completed a finance and accounting degree with a year in industry, faced numerous rejections and a lack of feedback, leading her to question the value of her degree. She believes the use of AI in resume screening programs initially hindered her progress, as her CV was not ATS-compatible. Despite the challenges, Morgan's persistence paid off, and she will begin her role in London in September, highlighting the competitive nature of the graduate job market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. military strikes in Iran, concerns are rising about the potential impact on global oil supplies and energy prices. While initial market reactions saw a surge in crude prices, followed by a decline, experts speculate that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport. Disruptions to the Strait could severely impact oil markets, particularly in China, India, Japan, and South Korea. Analysts suggest that a prolonged conflict or Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities could further destabilize the energy market, potentially driving prices higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google may face alterations to its online search services in the United Kingdom as regulators express concerns regarding the tech giant's dominance. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is consulting on a proposal to designate Google with "strategic market status" under new competition rules. This designation grants the CMA greater authority to enforce consumer protections and take action against tech firms with entrenched market power. The move is similar to the European Union's Digital Markets Act and could lead to fines of up to 10% of Google's global annual revenues for breaches.</p>

          <p>Mark Walter, the controlling owner of the Dodgers, is now the controlling owner of the Lakers, which raises questions about the future of sports broadcasting in Los Angeles. Walter could theoretically buy out Charter Communications, which owns SportsNet (Lakers) and SportsNet LA (Dodgers), and put the Dodgers and Lakers on the same channel. The Lakers‚Äô deal runs through 2032, and the Dodgers‚Äô deal runs through 2038, but the time for the single-team sports channel has come and largely gone, and the economics are poor.

          <p>California community colleges are grappling with a surge in fraudulent applications, with over 1.2 million identified last year. Scammers are exploiting the system's open access and remote learning opportunities to steal millions in financial aid. To combat this, officials are considering measures such as a $10 application fee and a complete redesign of the application system with integrated fraud detection tools. Federal officials are also implementing new identity verification procedures to address the growing problem of financial aid fraud.</p>
