          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, in a $9.7 billion all-cash deal. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash reserve of $344 billion. Occidental Petroleum plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO, Vicki Hollub, believes will allow the company to resume its stock buyback program. The deal deepens the existing financial relationship between the two companies, with Berkshire already holding a significant stake in Occidental. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark has voiced her full support for Minnesota Lynx player Napheesa Collier, who recently criticized WNBA leadership over low rookie salaries and other issues. Collier recounted a conversation where Commissioner Cathy Engelbert allegedly suggested Clark should be grateful for her off-court earnings, a comment that has sparked controversy. In response, Clark emphasized the need for strong leadership to capitalize on the WNBA's current surge in popularity and revenue. She highlighted that the league is at a pivotal moment, with players building their brands in college and bringing significant value that needs to be recognized in contract negotiations.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a post-tropical storm after lashing Bermuda with powerful winds and heavy rain as a Category 2 hurricane. While the worst conditions have passed for the archipelago, a tropical storm warning remains in effect, and forecasters expect the system to remain large and powerful as it moves across the Atlantic. The National Hurricane Center noted that swells generated by Imelda, along with the remnants of Hurricane Humberto, will continue to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast. No immediate reports of major damage in Bermuda have been made.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac Corp., the creator of the FICO score, announced a new pricing model that will allow mortgage lenders to license its scores directly, bypassing the major credit bureaus. This change, which sent FICO's stock soaring over 20%, aims to eliminate what the company calls "unnecessary mark-ups" and give lenders more choice. The move is seen as a potential disruption to the business models of Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, whose stocks all fell following the news. The new model is intended to create a more competitive and transparent market for credit scores used in the mortgage industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS Miami entertainment reporter Lisa Petrillo is sharing her personal battle with breast cancer after keeping her diagnosis private for ten months. Her journey began with a life-changing phone call received just moments before a live report, confirming a tumor in her right breast. The discovery was prompted by a self-exam the night before a routine ultrasound, and her persistence in getting the lump checked led to an early, Stage One diagnosis. Petrillo underwent a lumpectomy and radiation while continuing to work, and now hopes her story will encourage others to be proactive about their health and self-examinations.</p>

Emana, who is now a nurse at the same Dallas hospital, finally identified Perry from an old photograph taken shortly after her son's birth.

          <p>Scientists have observed a "rogue planet," an untethered celestial body floating freely in space, consuming surrounding gas and dust at a rate of six billion tons per second. This unprecedented accretion event, observed in an object named Cha 1107-7626, is blurring the lines between how planets and stars are thought to form. The object, located about 620 light-years away, is roughly one to two million years old and has a mass five to ten times that of Jupiter. This discovery suggests that some planetary-mass objects may form more like stars, growing through intense episodes of matter consumption driven by magnetic activity.</p>

The company, which makes popular items like Gatorade, Cheetos, and Doritos, stated that around 40% of its U.S. products still contain synthetic dyes. The process of reformulation is complex, requiring years of research to find stable, flavor-neutral natural alternatives like paprika, turmeric, and carob powder. Tostitos and Lay's will be among the first brands to feature the new, naturally derived colors on store shelves later this year.</p>

Parker is also focusing on her literary work with her book imprint, SJP Lit. Her latest selection is "I Am You" by Victoria Redel, a historical novel about two female artists in 1600s Amsterdam.</p>

          <p>The English Premier League is considering replacing its current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), which have been criticized by some clubs for limiting investment. Chief Executive Richard Masters confirmed that a decision on adopting an "alternative system" is approaching, likely in November. The proposed new model is a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's regulations, which would limit a club's spending on wages and transfers to a percentage of its total revenue, likely 85%. The goal is to align with European standards while still allowing for the investment that has historically driven the league's growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a title that often surprises the Finns themselves. According to experts, the ranking is less about daily joy and more about a deep sense of contentment derived from a well-functioning society that provides strong social support. Public institutions like Helsinki's central library, which offers extensive free services, exemplify the country's commitment to equality and opportunity. This social contract, combined with a strong connection to nature and cultural practices like sauna, contributes to a high quality of life and a feeling that citizens are well cared for.</p>
