          <p>Ghana is facing a critical healthcare challenge due to a lack of legal framework for organ and tissue donation, leaving thousands with kidney and corneal diseases without affordable treatment options. A proposed bill aims to establish a regulatory authority, transplantation centers, and a national registry to make procedures safer and more accessible, but it has been stalled in parliament. While the legislation could drastically reduce costs and save lives, concerns remain about the potential for illegal organ harvesting and the country's ongoing medical brain drain.</p>

          <p>A senior in Ridgefield, Washington, was reunited with her lost indoor cat, Louie, after an 11-day search, thanks to a free, AI-driven tool called Love Lost. The platform, powered by Petco Love, uses facial recognition technology to match photos of lost pets with a national database of found animals from shelters and community apps. A neighbor spotted the cat and used the app's secure chat feature to connect with the owner, leading to the successful and emotional reunion, showcasing how technology can foster community assistance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding between traditional and Roth 401(k) contributions, many savers mistakenly focus on their marginal tax rate instead of their effective tax rate. A financial planner highlights that an individual's effective tax rate—the total tax paid as a percentage of gross income—is often much lower than their top marginal rate. This calculation suggests that for some, making pretax contributions could be more advantageous if they anticipate having a significantly lower effective tax rate during their retirement years.

          <p>Home equity loan and HELOC interest rates may see a modest decline in October, as markets anticipate another potential rate cut from the Federal Reserve later this month. Lenders note that borrowing costs are already beginning to adjust in response to the Fed's signals and moderating inflation, creating a more favorable environment for homeowners looking to tap into their equity. While variable-rate HELOCs are likely to see faster adjustments, experts advise borrowers to consider their personal financial situation and compare offers carefully before taking on new debt.

However, the outlook for 2026 is much bleaker, with the WTO slashing its growth projection to just 0.5% as the global economy is expected to cool and feel the full impact of higher tariffs.
