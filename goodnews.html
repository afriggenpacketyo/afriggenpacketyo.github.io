          <p>Following the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, key European nations and EU institutions issued a joint statement reaffirming their support for Ukraine. The leaders of Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland insisted that Russia cannot dictate Ukraine's future membership in NATO or the EU. The statement also emphasized that as long as the conflict continues, they will maintain and strengthen economic pressure and sanctions on Russia's war economy to push for a just peace.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has awarded two major missile contracts totaling nearly $7.8 billion to defense contractors Lockheed Martin and RTX Corporation. Lockheed Martin received a $4.3 billion order for JASSM and LRASM missiles, while RTX was awarded $3.5 billion for AMRAAM missiles, with deliveries scheduled over the next six to seven years for both U.S. and allied forces. The article notes that while the contract values are large, their annual revenue impact is less than 1% for each company, but highlights RTX's higher profit margins on its missile division compared to Lockheed's.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic drop in violent crime, with homicide rates falling to their lowest levels in half a century. This success is attributed to a multi-faceted strategy implemented by Mayor Brandon Scott, which combines focused deterrence with social support, targeting individuals most at risk of perpetrating or becoming victims of gun violence. The approach, funded in part by federal grants, involves partnerships between law enforcement, social workers, and community groups to offer resources like housing and job training as an alternative to criminal activity.</p>

          <h2>Financial Planners Advise Starting Retirement Savings Earlier Than Public Perception Suggests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates Americans believe age 27 is the ideal time to start saving for retirement, but certified financial planners recommend starting even sooner to maximize the benefits of compound interest. While younger generations like Gen Z and millennials are beginning to save earlier than their predecessors, many people still express regret for not starting sooner. Starting in one's early 20s can significantly increase the final nest egg, making ambitious goals like retiring by age 58 more achievable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered extensive and diverse animal communities, including tube worms and clams, living at depths up to 31,000 feet in Pacific Ocean trenches. These ecosystems thrive without sunlight, deriving energy from chemical reactions involving methane in a process called chemosynthesis. This groundbreaking discovery challenges previous understandings of deep-sea life and suggests that similar chemosynthetic communities could potentially exist in the methane-rich oceans of celestial bodies like Jupiter's moon Europa, bolstering the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that chimpanzees learn combined vocal and gestural communication patterns primarily from their mothers, not their fathers. By observing a wild chimpanzee community in Uganda, scientists found that related individuals on the maternal side shared similar communication styles, a pattern not seen on the paternal side. Because young chimps spend their early years with their mothers, this suggests the behaviors are socially learned, implying that the capacity for socially acquired communication may be an ancient trait shared with humans.</p>

The bear, tracked by wildlife officials as Yellow 2291, previously gained attention for crossing multiple major freeways, and her new family may signal an end to her nomadic behavior.</p>

As the Trump administration reduces federal grants for school psychologists and other programs, peer-to-peer services like Teen Line fill a critical gap by offering a space where young people feel heard and understood.</p>
