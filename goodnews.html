          <p>France has refuted claims made by Telegram founder Pavel Durov regarding interference in Romania's presidential election, labeling the allegations as "completely unfounded." Durov hinted that a Western European country, implied to be France, had requested Telegram to suppress conservative voices. The French Foreign Ministry emphasized its support for Romanian democracy and its EU accession, suggesting the accusations were a diversion from genuine threats of interference by Russia. The ministry also noted that the first round of elections in December was annulled amid reports of electoral violations.</p>
