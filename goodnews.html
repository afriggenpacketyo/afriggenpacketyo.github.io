          <p>Elissa Kalver, diagnosed with incurable HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer at age 34, is sharing her journey of prioritizing life despite a challenging prognosis. Initially given a low five-year survival rate, medical advances have allowed her to manage the aggressive cancer for four years through various treatments, including clinical trials that successfully reduced brain tumors. Kalver has since founded a nonprofit gift registry for cancer patients, written a book, and become a public speaker to advocate for others. Her story highlights the progress in treating this form of cancer and the importance of focusing on quality of life while undergoing continuous therapy.</p>

          <p>Fast-food giants like McDonald's are losing breakfast customers to food-focused convenience stores such as Wawa and Casey's General Store. Recent market data shows that while morning traffic to fast-food chains grew by only 1%, visits to these convenience stores surged by 9%. Consumers are increasingly viewing convenience stores as a viable alternative, citing factors like budget-consciousness, variety, and quality of prepared foods. This trend marks a reversal, as fast-food chains are now looking to convenience stores for strategies to boost their weakest daypart, which has been hit hard by consumers choosing to eat at home.</p>

          <p>China's State Council, led by Premier Li Qiang, has announced measures aimed at boosting private investment to help stabilize the economy and employment. The government plans to create a more fair and competitive market environment, expand market access for private enterprises, and resolve existing bottlenecks. Key areas of focus will include new infrastructure, emerging services, and what the state terms 'new quality productive forces.' To support these initiatives, China will increase allocations from the central budget and may reserve a portion of government procurement contracts specifically for small and medium-sized private companies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent trend of fashion articles heralding the return of skinny jeans has sparked a commentary on the cyclical and often arbitrary nature of clothing trends. The author expresses a personal disdain for jeans, arguing they are uncomfortable and unflattering compared to suits. The piece critiques the fashion industry and media for constantly revising what is considered stylish, compelling consumers to purchase new versions of items they were told to discard years prior. Ultimately, the author advocates for developing a personal style independent of fleeting trends, rather than chasing a 'Regular Millennial Guy Look' that may no longer be comfortable or authentic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI's significant financial commitments are having a profound impact on the tech industry, with Oracle being the latest beneficiary of a massive stock surge. The AI company is reportedly set to spend $300 billion on computing power over five years, a major factor in Oracle's record-breaking quarterly report and soaring backlog. This spending spree has also fueled market cap growth for key partners like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, contributing to record highs for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. However, some analysts express concern over the market's heavy reliance on a single, cash-burning startup for such substantial growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Travel Experts Emphasize Flexibility as Key to Securing Cheaper Airfare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel experts, including the product team at Google Flights, the single most effective strategy for finding affordable flights is to be flexible with travel dates. Data shows that flying midweek—on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday—is typically 13% cheaper than traveling on weekends, which can save travelers an average of $42 per domestic ticket. While many believe the day of the week a ticket is purchased matters, analysis shows this has a negligible effect. Instead, travelers can achieve significant savings by shifting their departure or return by just a day or two and by traveling during a destination's off-season or shoulder season.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially disbanded the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group (CWG), a panel of five climate-change skeptics. The group produced a report, widely criticized by independent scientists as erroneous, that was used to support the Trump administration's efforts to roll back federal climate pollution regulations. The decision to dissolve the group follows a lawsuit by environmental organizations alleging it was created in secret and violated federal law. While Wright claimed the group's purpose was to catalyze debate, critics argue it served only to sow doubt about established climate science, similar to tactics once used by the tobacco industry.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, titled "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," examines the complex cultural legacy of the prefabricated concrete tower blocks common in the former East Germany. These buildings were initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages, providing modern amenities to a large portion of the population. However, after German reunification, they became symbols of economic decline and social problems, including the rise of right-wing extremism. The exhibition uses art to explore these dualities, reflecting on the collective memories, social changes, and painful transformations associated with this divisive architectural style.</p>

Through figures like scientist Xie Xide and diplomat Ji Chaozhu, the book highlights an era of cooperation and shared interests that has since given way to intense competition and distrust. The co-editors argue that these stories serve as a crucial reminder of the benefits of mutual understanding, even as the political dynamics have shifted.

          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, second only to English, as young Turks increasingly look to Germany for higher education and career opportunities. Facing a difficult economic situation and stressful working conditions at home, many students see fluency in German as a pathway to studying at German universities or entering the German job market. This has led to high demand for German courses in Turkish high schools and universities, creating a shortage of qualified teachers. Education experts note a significant shift, with graduates from elite Turkish high schools now choosing to study in Germany at nearly the same rate as in Turkey.</p>

          <p>Colleges across the U.S., such as Roanoke College in Virginia, are adding or reinstating football programs in an effort to increase overall enrollment, particularly among men, whose college attendance rates have been declining. Administrators hope the sport will foster school spirit and attract more students, thereby increasing tuition revenue. However, research indicates that while adding football may cause a short-term spike in male enrollment, these gains often do not persist long-term. Despite the mixed evidence, schools continue to invest in football as part of a broader strategy to remain competitive in a challenging higher education landscape.</p>

          <p>Child development and education experts are urging parents to engage in early and ongoing conversations with their children about the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT. While AI can be a powerful learning aid when used responsibly, it also poses significant risks, including providing inaccurate information or unsafe responses related to mental health crises. Experts recommend that parents learn about AI themselves, use the tools alongside their children, and co-create household rules that encourage ethical use and limit screen time. The goal is not to ban the technology but to foster a critical understanding of its capabilities and limitations.</p>
