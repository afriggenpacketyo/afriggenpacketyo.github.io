          <p>The Los Angeles Metro has temporarily renamed the Hyde Park Station to "Nipsey Hussle Station" in honor of the late rapper on what would have been his 40th birthday. The renaming, which will last through the end of the month, is part of Metro's new Culture Series celebrating influential Angelenos. In conjunction with the tribute, two limited-edition Nipsey Hussle TAP cards have been released for purchase at select stations. The initiative, a partnership with Hussle's estate, recognizes his deep impact on the South Central Los Angeles community where he was raised and invested.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows High Annual Interest Costs for Significant Credit Card Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 14:12:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average credit card interest rates near 22%, carrying a $25,000 balance can result in approximately $5,500 in interest charges annually. This equates to about $456 per month in interest alone, making it difficult to reduce the principal balance when only making minimum payments. The article highlights that relying solely on minimum payments could extend the debt repayment period for decades and accumulate tens of thousands in extra interest. Strategies to mitigate these costs include paying more than the minimum, considering a balance transfer to a 0% APR card, or consolidating debt with a lower-interest loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ed Dwight, the first Black astronaut candidate in the U.S. and, at 91, the oldest person to travel to space, is being considered for the Congressional Gold Medal. A bill introduced by Colorado lawmakers seeks to award him the nation's highest civilian honor for his lifetime of achievements in both aviation and art. After facing racism that led him to resign from the astronaut program in the 1960s, Dwight became a successful entrepreneur and a renowned sculptor, creating over 130 memorials dedicated to Black history. His recent spaceflight with Blue Origin fulfilled a lifelong journey, capping a career defined by trailblazing efforts and community inspiration.</p>

          <p>With two weeks remaining in the summer transfer window, Premier League clubs are on pace to set a new spending record, having already invested £2.26 billion in new players. This figure surpasses last year's total and is approaching the all-time record of £2.36 billion set in 2023. The spending of English top-flight clubs dwarfs that of other major European leagues combined, with a net spend of over £1 billion more than they have earned from player sales. This transfer season has already seen six clubs break their individual transfer records, highlighting the immense financial power of the Premier League.</p>

          <p>Labor Day in 2025 falls on Monday, September 1, marking the unofficial end of summer with a three-day weekend for many Americans. The federal holiday was established in 1894 to celebrate the achievements and contributions of the American workforce, originating from the labor movement's fight for better working conditions. While government offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed, most major retailers, grocery stores, and fast-food chains are expected to remain open, though some may have reduced hours. The holiday is also a popular time for sales events as retailers look to clear out summer inventory.</p>

The deal includes up to $1.4 billion in additional backstop financing from Google, bringing its total potential investment to $3.2 billion. This funding supports the expansion of TeraWulf's Lake Mariner facility in New York, which recently secured major deals to provide computing capacity for AI cloud provider Fluidstack. The strengthened partnership with Google is aimed at building out advanced artificial intelligence infrastructure, reflecting a strategic pivot that has seen TeraWulf's stock rise about 90% in the last week.

          <p>A new study reveals that nearly one-third of individuals using the over-the-counter birth control pill Opill had previously used no method of contraception. The research, published in JAMA Network Open, surveyed users two years after the FDA approved the first non-prescription oral contraceptive. The findings suggest the pill is successfully reaching its intended audience by reducing barriers to access, particularly for those who are uninsured, younger, or live in rural areas. The most common reason for choosing the over-the-counter option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment, underscoring its role in enhancing reproductive autonomy.</p>

The 37-year-old veteran was a full participant, taking part in both individual and team drills with the first-team offense. Coach Sean McVay confirmed Stafford's return but stated there were no further updates on his condition, indicating the team will take his recovery one day at a time. Stafford's return is a positive development for the Rams as they prepare for their season opener against the Houston Texans on September 7.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts strongly recommend that investors utilize dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) to harness the power of compound interest and enhance long-term portfolio growth. A DRIP automatically uses the cash dividends paid by a stock to purchase more shares of that same stock, often including fractional shares. This passive strategy ensures that earnings are continuously put to work, which can significantly increase total returns over time. For example, over a recent 10-year period, the S&P 500's total return with dividends reinvested was 239%, compared to a 185% return based on price appreciation alone. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit accused Newsmax of broadcasting false claims about Dominion's voting machines following the 2020 presidential election. This settlement follows Dominion's landmark $787 million agreement with Fox News for similar claims and another settlement Newsmax made with voting company Smartmatic.

          <p>In a satirical article from The Atlantic, a fictional police unit in Washington, D.C., grapples with the end of its 25-year streak of no sandwich-based crimes. The piece humorously depicts veteran detectives lamenting a new incident where a Department of Justice employee threw a Subway sandwich at a federal agent. The story uses the absurd premise to parody heavy-handed law enforcement tactics and the focus on minor infractions over more serious issues. The detectives of the "sandwich division" pride themselves on community policing and de-escalation, contrasting their methods with the dramatic raid conducted by U.S. Marshals to arrest the sandwich-throwing suspect.</p>

This development follows prosecutors' decision not to seek the death penalty against him.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age to consider a reverse mortgage is typically in one's late 60s to early 70s, though there is no single magic number. The decision should be based on individual circumstances, including income needs, long-term goals, and commitment to aging in place. Since the loan amount increases with age, waiting allows homeowners to access more of their equity. A reverse mortgage can be a useful tool for retirees on a fixed income to eliminate monthly mortgage payments or to supplement income without selling their home, but it also reduces the equity available to heirs.

          <p>State health officials have officially declared that the measles outbreak in Texas, which began in January and resulted in 762 confirmed cases, is now over. The declaration was made after 42 days—double the disease's maximum incubation period—passed without any new reported cases in affected counties. The Texas Department of State Health Services credited a comprehensive response involving vaccination, testing, and public education for containing the highly contagious virus, which led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Officials remain vigilant, however, as ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S. mean new cases could still appear in the state.</p>

The shutdown brought an unusual calm to the normally bustling district as police conducted their investigation.

          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW and will drop the iconic NBC peacock logo. This rebranding is part of a larger corporate restructuring, as the channel spins off from its parent company, Comcast's NBC Universal, into a new entity called Versant. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to establish a separate identity for the network. The move marks a significant shift for the channel founded nearly 30 years ago as a partnership between Microsoft (MS) and NBC, as it aims to build its own modern news organization.</p>

          <p>As President Zelenskyy visits the White House, an analysis of financial aid to Ukraine reveals that while the U.S. is the largest single-country donor, Europe as a whole has contributed more. According to the Kiel Institute, European nations and EU institutions have collectively spent $165.7 billion on Ukraine since the 2022 invasion, compared to the U.S. total of $130.6 billion. This data contradicts claims made by President Trump suggesting a vast disparity in spending. The aid from both sides has been a mix of grants and loans, though the U.S. has provided more direct grants while the EU has offered more loans, some with generous repayment terms.</p>
