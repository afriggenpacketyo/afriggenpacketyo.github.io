        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City is utilizing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate secures a majority, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed based on voters' second choices. This process continues until a candidate reaches a majority, ensuring broad support for the winner. Preliminary results based on first choices will be available shortly after polls close, but the ranked choice tabulations will begin on July 1, with official certification on July 15. This is the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary, with officials hoping for a smoother process than in 2021.</p>

          <p>The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, demonstrating its ability to peer into the universe's depths with unprecedented clarity. The telescope, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, will continuously film the southern night sky for ten years. The observatory is expected to detect killer asteroids, map the Milky Way, and answer questions about dark matter. The observatory's design includes unique mirrors to capture faint galaxies and supernova explosions, and scientists around the world will analyze the data to understand the universe's history and formation.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has released its first images, showcasing its capabilities to capture a vivid time-lapse video of the night sky over ten years. The observatory will collect data on approximately 40 billion stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects, generating about 60 petabytes of raw data. This data will allow astronomers to detect millions of changing objects every night, enabling the study of transient phenomena like exploding stars and asteroids. The observatory has already discovered 2,104 never-before-seen asteroids in just over 10 hours of test observations, and the observatory is expected to revolutionize astronomy by enabling data mining on a massive scale.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Judge Barbara Holmes stated that the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, but acknowledged he would likely remain in custody regardless. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native deported to El Salvador in March despite a 2019 court order, may now be taken into ICE custody. Prosecutors argue he conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status, while the defense claims the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in his case.</p>
