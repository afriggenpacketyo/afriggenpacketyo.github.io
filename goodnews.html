          <p>Tesla's stock has rebounded significantly, closing Monday at a price that erases all its losses for the year. The shares have surged 85% from a low point in April, a recovery bolstered by CEO Elon Musk's recent purchase of approximately $1 billion worth of company stock. Despite this rally, the electric vehicle manufacturer is still navigating a multi-quarter sales slump due to an aging product line and increased competition. The company is also attempting to shift investor focus toward future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots to sustain its growth narrative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to lower its benchmark interest rate, this article explains the indirect relationship between the Fed's policies and mortgage rates. The central bank controls the short-term federal funds rate, while fixed-rate mortgages are more closely tied to long-term instruments like the 10-year Treasury note. Although a Fed rate cut doesn't guarantee an immediate drop in mortgage costs, lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of such moves. Experts suggest that future guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell may have a more significant impact on the market than the cut itself. (not investment advice)</p>

This article outlines several methods for accessing $50,000 in equity, including home equity loans, which offer fixed rates and predictable payments. Other options are home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) for flexible access, cash-out refinances that replace an existing mortgage, and reverse mortgages for seniors over 62.

          <p>Cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave saw its stock jump nearly 8% following the disclosure of a purchase agreement with Nvidia valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. The deal obligates Nvidia to purchase any of CoreWeave's unsold cloud capacity through April 2032, highlighting the immense demand for AI computing resources. CoreWeave, which went public in March and is backed by Nvidia, rents out access to Nvidia's highly sought-after graphics processing units (GPUs).

          <p>Payments from Facebook's $725 million privacy settlement are now being distributed to eligible users who filed a claim. The class-action lawsuit stemmed from allegations that the platform improperly shared user data with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica. Approved claimants are being notified via email and will receive payments through their chosen method, such as PayPal or direct deposit. The average payout is approximately $29, with the final amount depending on how long the user maintained an active Facebook account during the specified 15-year period covered by the settlement.</p>

          <p>Young climate activists who previously won a landmark case against the state of Montana are now challenging President Trump's executive orders that promote fossil fuels. In a federal hearing, the activists argue that the administration's policies, which boost drilling and mining, violate their constitutional rights to life and liberty by exacerbating climate change. Unlike their state-level victory, which was based on Montana's constitutional right to a clean environment, this federal case faces a higher legal hurdle. The outcome could have significant implications for U.S. climate policy, though legal experts believe their chances are longer in federal court.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers are looking to lock in high returns on financial products like certificates of deposit (CDs). This article analyzes the potential interest earnings on a $15,000 CD across various terms, from three months to three years. For example, a one-year CD at a 4.25% rate could earn $637.50, while a three-year CD at 3.97% could yield over $1,800. Since CD rates are fixed, they offer guaranteed returns, making them an attractive option for those seeking stability and predictable growth before rates decline further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have established a framework agreement regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The deal, aimed at addressing national security concerns, is expected to be finalized in a call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development comes as a deadline looms for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American division or face a ban. While details are sparse, the agreement reportedly paves the way for U.S. ownership, though China has stated it will not approve a deal that compromises its companies' interests.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest rates, savers are advised to strategically place their funds to maximize returns. This article suggests three options for moving $10,000 out of low-yield traditional savings accounts. These include opening a high-rate certificate of deposit (CD) to lock in a fixed return, moving funds to a high-yield savings account for better rates with continued liquidity, or using a money market account which combines high interest with check-writing capabilities. Each option offers a way to earn more interest, though savers must consider the trade-offs between fixed versus variable rates and accessibility. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, a crucial date for freelancers, self-employed individuals, and those with investment income. This year's calculations may be more complex for some due to tax changes enacted by the Trump administration, which could lead to overpayment if not properly adjusted. To avoid underpayment penalties, taxpayers should generally pay at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's. Tax professionals recommend running projections to ensure payments for the third and fourth quarters are accurate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have been on a downward trend, recently hitting a near-yearly low, and could fall further this week. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut, which lenders have likely already started pricing into their mortgage offers. While a standard 25-basis-point cut is anticipated, a more aggressive 50-basis-point reduction could lead to a more significant drop in mortgage rates. Prospective homebuyers are advised to monitor the market closely, as these lower rates may not last long, and to ensure their credit score is strong to qualify for the best offers.

          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewables like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark shows that wind and solar are more affordable to generate than fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, or nuclear power. While renewables have high initial capital costs, their operational expenses are very low. The debate over energy policy continues, with the current administration's tariffs potentially increasing costs for projects reliant on imported components, especially battery storage.</p>

          <p>As annuities grow in popularity for retirement planning, understanding how to access the funds within them is crucial for account holders. This article outlines seven strategic ways to get money out of an annuity, including waiting for scheduled payments to begin, making partial penalty-free withdrawals, or surrendering the contract for its cash value. Other options involve taking a loan, using a 1035 exchange to move funds to a new contract, or selling future payments to a third party. Each strategy comes with different tax implications, fees, and impacts on long-term financial security that should be carefully evaluated. (not investment advice)</p>
