          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second consecutive term, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian Prime Minister has done so, indicating a desire for policy stability. The S&P/ASX 200 index closed lower, reversing gains from the previous session, while Taiwan's Taiex also fell. In India, both the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex showed gains. Bloomberg reported that representatives for Gautam Adani discussed the dismissal of bribery charges with officials from Donald Trump's administration, leading to surges in Adani group shares.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Astronomers Claim Ancient Star Catalogue as World's Oldest</h2>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists assert that "Shi‚Äôs Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world‚Äôs oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years to around 335 BC. The claim is supported by new evidence published in the astronomy journal 'Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics,' where researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates. If verified, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, which has been recognized as the oldest known stellar record until now. Experts believe that detailed astronomical studies began in both China and Greece around the same period.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, contrary to the common association of roses with the color red. The study, published in 'Nature Plants,' examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that the common ancestor of Rosa had single-petal flowers with a yellow hue and seven leaflets. Researchers from Beijing Forestry University noted that roses, known as the 'queen of flowers,' have been regarded as symbols of love and beauty throughout history.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. The United States remained the top ODA donor, while Germany ranked second. The decline in Japan's donations was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to the sharp increases in 2022 and 2023. Japan views ODA as a critical diplomatic tool amid China's growing influence, despite facing fiscal challenges. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members fell in 2024 due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.</p>

In March, Trump signed an executive order that effectively cut off its funding via its parent company, the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM).

The issue was cited by nearly 22% of over 4,000 visitors surveyed. The removal of trash bins in recent years is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks. Littering in tourist spots has become a major concern, prompting discussions about potential solutions, such as installing solar-powered trash bins.</p>
