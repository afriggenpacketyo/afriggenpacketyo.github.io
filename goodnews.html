          <p>Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, stated that while their Ascend chips lag behind U.S. chips by a generation, comparable performance can be achieved through techniques like stacking and clustering. In an interview with People's Daily, Ren highlighted China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. He noted the strength of China's power grid and communication networks, emphasizing the potential of open-source software to meet societal needs. This comes amid increasing U.S. restrictions on China and Huawei, with the U.S. Department of Commerce potentially interpreting the use of Ascend chips as a violation of export controls. Optimism regarding Huawei's ability to overcome technological barriers is tempered by ongoing geopolitical tensions. </p>

Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the need for clear communication between agencies to ensure a coordinated response. Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Edmonds highlighted the importance of clarifying when deadly force can be used. The troops, operating under Title 10 status, have been trained in de-escalation and crowd control. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address elevated rice prices, according to farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi. This move will leave the country with a rice reserve of 100,000 tons. The released rice will be directed towards smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers. Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, averaging 4,260 yen ($29) per 5 kilograms in late May, prompting the government to take action to lower overall prices. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kg. (not investment advice) </p>

However, Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C criticized the lack of transparency regarding the project's total cost and the potential impact on consumer bills. The government insists nuclear power is essential for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, though Sizewell C is expected to take at least a decade to complete. </p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world," citing "fundamental flaws" and outdated gender stereotypes. A report by the Women and Equalities Committee calls for bold action and significant investment to improve the system. Statutory paternity leave allows new fathers to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower, which is considered inadequate. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks. The findings coincide with a planned "dad strike" to protest current parental leave policies. </p>

AI should only be used for low-stakes marking, such as quizzes or homework, and teachers must check its outputs. Teachers are also permitted to use AI to draft routine letters to parents. Experts emphasize the importance of teachers learning to use AI effectively, while also acknowledging potential risks such as data breaches and errors. </p>
