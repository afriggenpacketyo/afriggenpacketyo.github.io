          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years and likely splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The mission failed due to a rocket booster malfunction, leaving the spacecraft stranded in Earth's orbit. The article highlights the historical context of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's Venera program, which successfully sent probes to Venus. Experts noted that the re-entry serves as a reminder of past space exploration ambitions and the engineering challenges of sending probes to other planets.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Opera is staging Anthony Davis's Pulitzer Prize-winning opera, 'The Central Park Five,' which recounts the story of five Black and brown teenagers wrongly convicted of assaulting a jogger in Central Park in 1989. The opera also features Donald Trump, who, at the time, called for the death penalty for the accused. The director of the Detroit Opera's production chose to focus on the lives of the wrongfully accused men and their journey, noting that their story is more compelling than Trump's. The opera draws from jazz, blues, and other American musical idioms to tell this story.</p>

          <p>In California's "salad bowl," farmers are investing in housing for H-2A guest workers due to an aging workforce and stricter immigration enforcement. These modern housing complexes aim to alleviate the regional affordable housing crisis, but some community members are skeptical, arguing that local farmworkers are not benefiting from this development. While some see it as a win-win, others point out the need for more affordable housing for longtime farmworkers, many of whom are undocumented. The Trump administration's immigration policies have pushed growers to seek legal avenues for labor, highlighting the challenges and complexities of the agricultural workforce in California.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A veteran pitching coach, Leo Mazzone, argues that baseball's current emphasis on velocity and analytics is detrimental to pitchers' health and the quality of the game. Mazzone, known for his work with the Atlanta Braves, advocates for a focus on movement, change of speeds, and location over raw power. He criticizes the strict pitch limits and reliance on computer-driven metrics, which he believes have led to more injuries and less engaging baseball. Mazzone's traditional approach, which prioritizes craft and control, stands in contrast to the modern game's obsession with maximizing pitch velocity.</p>

The spacecraft, part of the Venera program, malfunctioned during launch, stranding it in Earth orbit for over five decades. While such re-entries are not unusual, Kosmos 482 was built to withstand Venus's harsh atmosphere, making it more likely to survive re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.
