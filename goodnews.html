          <p>In an interview with Sean Hannity following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump characterized the meeting as highly successful, rating it a "10 out of 10" for rapport. He stated that while "no deal is a deal," significant progress was made and that he believes Putin wants to see the war in Ukraine end. Trump also reiterated his belief that the conflict would never have started if he had been in office and advised Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to "make a deal." He indicated openness to a future trilateral meeting with both Putin and Zelenskyy to finalize an agreement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to scale back its takeover of Washington, D.C.'s police force following a legal challenge from the city. After a federal judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the move, a deal was reached ensuring that Police Chief Pamela Smith would remain in command, not the federally appointed DEA administrator. The revised directive still allows the administration to use D.C. police for federal purposes, such as assisting with immigration enforcement, which conflicts with the city's sanctuary policies. This development marks a partial retreat from what local officials had termed a "hostile takeover" of law enforcement.</p>

          <p>South Korean pop group Blackpink delivered a high-energy performance at London's Wembley Stadium, becoming the first K-pop girl band to headline the iconic venue. The two-and-a-half-hour show was part of their Deadline world tour and featured a mix of group hits and solo performances from members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. The concert highlighted the band's global appeal and is part of a tour expected to break their own record for the highest-grossing tour by a female group. The event underscored K-pop's continued worldwide expansion, following in the footsteps of boyband BTS, who played the same venue in 2019.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main property it accompanies. This development comes a year after the city enacted laws to permit such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. ADUs, often called granny flats or in-law units, are seen as a key strategy to address the state's housing crisis by providing smaller, more affordable starter homes. While ADUs accounted for about one-fifth of California's housing growth in 2024, this new model could further accelerate their adoption across the state.</p>

In the early 2000s, he agreed with Bruce Moss, conductor of the Wheaton Municipal Band in Illinois, that he would guest-conduct the band if he reached the century milestone. Though no longer able to travel, Gabriel fulfilled his promise remotely, leading the band via video link from his home in Virginia. The event celebrated his long-standing commitment and passion for music, proving that one's word is their bond.</p>

          <p>This article provides the complete transcript of the public statements made by U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin following their summit in Alaska. Putin's remarks focused heavily on the shared history between the U.S. and Russia, particularly regarding Alaska, and reiterated that peace requires addressing the "primary roots" of the conflict. Trump's statement was briefer, asserting that "great progress" was made on many points but admitting they "didn't get there" on the most significant issues. The transcript captures the leaders' official positions and tone, concluding with Putin's suggestion of a future meeting in Moscow.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Salton Sea Shoreline is a Minor Contributor to Regional Air Pollution</h2>

          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects have focused on the lakebed to combat high rates of asthma and respiratory illness in the region. However, this study suggests that the majority of pollutants come from a wide range of other sources, including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. Researchers now recommend shifting focus from source control to exposure control, such as improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools.</p>

          <p>New research from India is challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes due to their sweetness. Two recent clinical trials found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like white bread, can actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. One study showed that certain mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than bread, while another found that daily mango consumption improved fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation and that these findings are not a license for unlimited consumption of the fruit.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, is generating discussion by depicting late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant in a Dodgers jersey instead of his iconic purple and gold. The artwork is part of a larger mural celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship on the side of a future restaurant. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that while the restaurant chain features a Kobe mural at every location, they wanted this one to fit the Dodgers theme. The piece uses an iconic image of Bryant roaring after a playoff victory but alters the jersey, a creative choice that has drawn both praise and playful criticism from local sports fans.</p>

          <p>At a commemoration for the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, 104-year-old World War II veteran Captain Yavar Abbas delivered a heartfelt, off-script tribute that visibly moved King Charles III and Queen Camilla. Abbas saluted the King for attending the event despite his ongoing cancer treatment, sharing that he himself has been cancer-free for 25 years. Born in British India, Abbas served as a combat cameraman with the British 14th Army in the Burma campaign. In a subsequent interview, he reflected on the futility of war, stating that despite his service, the world seems to have learned nothing from the conflicts of the past.</p>

          <p>Topshop is planning a major comeback to the UK high street, with the managing director confirming that standalone physical stores will be returning. The fashion brand, once a dominant force for young shoppers, saw all its stores close after its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020. Now owned by online retailer Asos, Topshop is leveraging nostalgia and a renewed interest in its signature "London girl" aesthetic to relaunch its physical presence. The brand faces a challenging retail environment with stiff competition from fast-fashion giants, but hopes to attract both its original millennial followers and a new generation of Gen-Z shoppers.</p>

          <p>Liverpool began their Premier League title defense with a 4-2 victory over Bournemouth in a dramatic match at Anfield. New £70m signing Hugo Ekitike made an immediate impact, scoring one goal and assisting another, showcasing his potential as a key striker for the team. However, the win also highlighted significant defensive vulnerabilities, as Bournemouth was able to equalize and expose gaps in Liverpool's midfield and defense. Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah ultimately secured the three points, but the performance suggests head coach Arne Slot has work to do to solidify the team's back line.</p>

          <p>The global bubble tea market, driven by Chinese chains, has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry, with several companies recently launching successful IPOs in Hong Kong. Brands like Mixue Group, which now has more stores than McDonald's, have expanded rapidly through a franchise-heavy model that relies on selling ingredients and equipment to operators. However, the industry faces significant challenges, including market saturation at home, intense price wars, and the difficulty of replicating its supply chain success overseas. These factors are testing the resilience of these brands and raising questions about whether their explosive growth is a sustainable trend or a temporary fad.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a significant resurgence after a nearly three-year downturn caused by inflation and rising interest rates. Recent successful debuts from companies like Bullish, Figma, and Circle, which saw their stock prices soar on their first day of trading, have instilled confidence in investors and venture capitalists. With the Nasdaq reaching record levels, Wall Street anticipates that a large backlog of high-value startups will now proceed with going public. Regulators are also reportedly considering changes to make the IPO process more attractive for companies. (not investment advice)</p>
