          <h2>Best Buy Exceeds Q2 Expectations Amid Tariff Uncertainty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its recent fiscal second quarter, achieving its highest comparable sales growth in three years. Despite this positive performance, CEO Corie Barry maintained a cautious full-year forecast, citing significant uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumer spending and overall business operations. The company is actively addressing market challenges, including reduced demand for large appliances due to higher interest rates, by launching a new third-party marketplace to expand its offerings. Strong gaming sales, particularly from the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, were a key driver, though other categories like home theater saw weaker performance, prompting strategic adjustments for the latter half of the year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department announced that the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a 3.3% annual pace in the second quarter of 2025, an upward revision from the initial estimate of 3%. This stronger growth follows a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, which was mainly caused by a surge in imports preceding new U.S. tariffs. The second-quarter rebound was significantly driven by a sharp decline in imports, contributing over 5 percentage points, alongside improved business investment in areas like AI and increased consumer spending. Despite these positive indicators, economists caution that the substantial import-related boost might temporarily inflate the perceived underlying economic strength.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock turned positive on Thursday, rebounding after an initial post-earnings dip, as investors responded favorably to the chipmaker's better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. The company reported a substantial 56% surge in sales, reaching $46.74 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, both surpassing analyst estimates. Although data center revenue slightly missed projections for the second consecutive period, CEO Jensen Huang underscored the immense and nascent stage of the AI revolution, forecasting trillions in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. Market analysts view these results as consistent with Nvidia's objectives and not indicative of any slowdown in industry-wide AI interest or investments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates are currently offering returns higher than the inflation rate, providing a valuable option for savers. These accounts allow individuals to lock in high rates for a fixed term, and are generally insured by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000, making them safe investments. As of August 27, 2025, national average CD yields vary by term, but top rates from online banks for short-term CDs (6 months to 1 year) are significantly higher, reflecting an inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs is suggested as a strategy to capitalize on these elevated short-term rates while planning for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saving money for future expenses and emergencies is crucial, and high-yield savings accounts currently offer significantly better interest rates than the national average. While the national average savings rate is 0.39% as of August 28, 2025, top high-yield accounts can offer rates exceeding 4%, providing a substantial boost to savings over time due to compounding interest. Online banks are often the best source for these competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, making them accessible even with low minimum deposits and no monthly fees. Comparing different accounts for both rates and fees is essential to maximize earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners seeking affordable borrowing options, Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans present an attractive solution, with rates significantly lower than personal loans or credit cards. As of August 27, 2025, average home equity loan rates hover around 8.23-8.38% for various terms, while HELOCs average 8.12%. These products leverage substantial home equity, currently averaging over $300,000, and their rates are expected to decline further with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Homeowners must compare lenders, understand the differences between fixed-rate loans and variable-rate HELOCs, and acknowledge that their home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dawn Staley, a three-time college national championship-winning coach, disclosed that she would have felt compelled to leave South Carolina to accept the New York Knicks head coaching job if offered. Staley, who interviewed for the position before Mike Brown was hired, emphasized the significance of such a role for women in professional sports. She reflected on her interview, questioning whether her candid inquiry about the organization's preparedness for the unique challenges of hiring the NBA's first female head coach might have impacted her chances. Staley saw the opportunity as a crucial step in breaking barriers for women.</p>

          <p>Jay Roach's "The Roses" is a remake of the 1989 film, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as Theo and Ivy Rose, a couple whose marriage dissolves into a hilariously brutal battle over their California mansion. The script by Tony McNamara delivers sharp, cruel humor, with Colman and Cumberbatch excelling in their roles, particularly Cumberbatch in a rare comedic turn. The article notes that while the original satirized materialistic baby boomers, this version delves deeper into the characters' attempts to make their marriage work, making their eventual dissolution more poignant. Despite a hasty ending and some silly gags, the film is praised for its insight into modern success-driven lives and its potential to revive adult comedies.</p>

          <h2>New Theory Proposes Parenting as a Catalyst for Human Language Evolution</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Madeleine Beekman's new book, "The Origin of Language," posits a novel theory placing child-rearing at the center of human language evolution. Challenging traditional male-dominated evolutionary narratives, Beekman argues that the intense need for assistance in caring for vulnerable early human infants drove the development of complex vocal communication. Biological changes, such as elongated vocal cords and larger brains, set the stage, but the demands of raising helpless offspring spurred the creation of words, syntax, and grammar for cooperation. This perspective suggests language emerged as a survival mechanism, fostering shared understanding and collective care, and has implications for understanding modern isolated parenting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The economics of American college sports are undergoing a monumental shift as the $19 billion industry prepares to pay its athletes for the first time. For decades, college athletes, despite generating massive revenues for universities—such as the University of Michigan's football program, which earned $150 million last year—received no direct salaries. This long-standing amateur model is finally changing, upending traditional practices and potentially reshaping the entire landscape of collegiate athletics. The move marks a significant departure from previous norms, acknowledging the immense value and contributions of student-athletes to a highly profitable enterprise and addressing long-standing debates about fair compensation.</p>
