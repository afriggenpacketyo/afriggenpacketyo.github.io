          <p>President Donald Trump and over 20 other world leaders gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to sign the first phase of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The summit, marked by a "Peace 2025" banner, included leaders from the Palestinian Authority, France, Germany, and key Arab nations, who formally endorsed the document aimed at establishing new rules for the region. Notably, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was absent from the ceremony, citing a Jewish holiday, despite having been praised by Trump in Israel's parliament just hours earlier. The agreement marks a significant diplomatic step, though many questions remain about the future governance and rebuilding of post-war Gaza.</p>

          <p>The first phase of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas commenced with the release of the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the return of some deceased captives' remains. This exchange, which also involved Israel freeing Palestinian prisoners, prompted emotional family reunions after more than two years of captivity. In a live-update format, this article chronicles these developments, including President Trump's declaration at a peace summit that the "war in Gaza is over." However, Israeli officials noted that the return of only four bodies, instead of the agreed-upon 28, represented a failure to meet commitments, highlighting the fragility of the new agreement.</p>

          <p>South Africa's women's cricket team achieved a dramatic comeback victory against Bangladesh, winning by three wickets with just three balls to spare in the World Cup. After their top order collapsed, leaving them at 78-5 while chasing 233, half-centuries from Chloe Tryon and Marizanne Kapp revived their chances. Nadine de Klerk, who finished with an unbeaten 37, ultimately guided the team to their third consecutive win. The match was marked by several crucial dropped catches from Bangladesh, including a pivotal error in the penultimate over that gave de Klerk a second chance to secure the win for the Proteas.</p>

During his remarks at the summit, he stated that the international community had "achieved the impossible" by brokering the deal that ended two years of conflict. The agreement's first phase saw the release of the final 20 living Israeli hostages by Hamas and a pullback of Israeli forces. Trump affirmed that mediators would now begin working on "Phase Two" of the comprehensive peace plan, signaling a shift toward reconstruction and long-term stability in the region.</p>

          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash, but the ability to remain in the home indefinitely depends on meeting specific obligations. Homeowners can stay for life as long as the property remains their primary residence and they continue to pay for property taxes, homeowners insurance, and general maintenance. The loan becomes due and payable if the borrower moves out, passes away, or fails to meet these financial responsibilities, which could potentially force a sale of the home. This article clarifies that while there is no set term, the arrangement is conditional and requires careful financial planning to avoid foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the initial successes of the Gaza peace plan, including the release of hostages and prisoners, significant challenges remain for achieving lasting stability. The next phases of the U.S.-brokered deal must address contentious issues such as the postwar governance of Gaza, Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm, and Palestinian calls for statehood. While an international body is proposed to oversee a new Palestinian security force, the current Israeli government has rejected a two-state solution. The successful implementation of these later stages will depend on fragile negotiations and the ability of mediators to bridge the deep-seated distrust between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>This article clarifies the specific traffic laws in Wisconsin concerning the legality of passing other vehicles on the right side. While it is generally illegal to use a paved shoulder or a designated bike lane to overtake another car, there are specific conditions under which passing on the right is permitted. These exceptions include when the vehicle ahead is making a left turn, or on a multi-lane or one-way street with sufficient unobstructed pavement. The maneuver, often called the "Milwaukee slide" by locals, is a persistent issue in the city, and illegal passing on the shoulder can result in a fine ranging from $30 to $300.</p>

The firm cited positive signs for Meta's core advertising business, including ad load growth and an increasing share of ad budgets, as reasons for their optimism. While the recent launch of OpenAI's video-generation tool, Sora, poses a potential competitive threat, Citi maintains that Meta is its top pick with a price target of $915.

          <p>New guidance for doctors, developed by researchers at King's College London, recommends simple dietary changes as a first-line treatment for constipation. The advice suggests that eating two or three kiwi fruits per day can effectively relieve symptoms, as the fruit's fiber increases stool volume and water content in the gut. Additionally, the guidance indicates that drinking mineral water, which is often high in magnesium, is more beneficial than tap water for promoting bowel movements. This research emphasizes practical, food-based solutions over immediately resorting to a complex high-fiber diet or various supplements for a condition that affects one in ten people.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates averaging over 22%, this article addresses three common and costly myths about managing debt. The first myth is that carrying a small balance helps improve a credit score, which is false and only results in paying unnecessary interest. Another harmful misconception is that making only the minimum payment is an effective debt management strategy, when in reality it can prolong repayment for decades. Finally, the article advises against closing old credit cards, as this can negatively impact a credit score by increasing the credit utilization ratio and shortening the length of one's credit history.
