          <p>A Georgia Steak 'n Shake owner's billboard honoring Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, has gone viral, leading to a significant increase in customers for the chain. The businessman, Wayne Robinson, was deeply affected by Kirk's recent murder and created the tribute, which reads "Charlie Kirk, 1993-2025: Stand up, speak out, stay bold." The billboard's message resonated widely, prompting calls and visits from people across the country to patronize Steak 'n Shake in solidarity. Corporate Steak 'n Shake reportedly appreciated the gesture, considering a national rollout of the tribute.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 22:20:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director Emerald Fennell discussed her new film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights," aiming to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced reading it as a teenager. Speaking at the Brontë Women's Writing Festival, Fennell, known for "Promising Young Woman" and "Saltburn," described the 1847 novel as "difficult, complicated, singular, sexy, horrible, devastating." The film, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, promises a heightened, gothic approach, with Fennell taking liberties to fulfill her 14-year-old self's interpretation while retaining much of Brontë's original dialogue. It is set for release on Valentine's Day next year.</p>

          <p>The inaugural North America’s 50 Best Restaurants list has honored three Los Angeles establishments: Providence, Kato, and Holbox. Atomix in New York City claimed the top spot on this guide, which evaluates restaurants from the U.S., Canada, and parts of the Caribbean. Chefs expressed pride, particularly Gilberto Cetina of Holbox, who saw the recognition as a significant moment for Mexican culture and food, especially amidst current political sentiments. Providence, celebrating its 20th year and recently earning a third Michelin star, also saw its chef-partner Michael Cimarusti win the Estrella Damm chefs’ choice award, further cementing L.A.'s culinary prestige.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown promising results in slowing the progression of Huntington's disease by 75%, offering immense hope for patients and their families. For Gemma Botting, whose husband Matt was diagnosed in 2011, this breakthrough is "like winning the lottery 10 times over," changing their outlook on growing old together. The devastating condition, which combines elements of dementia, Parkinson's, and MND, previously had no treatment. While the therapy is still in early stages and faces regulatory and affordability hurdles, scientists believe its potential implications could extend to other neurodegenerative diseases, providing a significant lift to the entire Huntington's community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles's long-held urban planning ideas, once controversial, are now inspiring the UK government's upcoming announcement of 12 new towns. These developments will emphasize walkability, environmental friendliness, and "gentle density" housing, reflecting the King's philosophy of "harmony" with nature and community-focused design seen in his Poundbury and Nansledan projects. Experts note a shift in architectural consensus towards designs sensitive to local place and public preferences, moving away from past "ego-driven" modernism. The new towns aim to create genuine communities with affordable housing and robust public spaces, learning from the shortcomings of post-war developments.</p>

          <p>A "Great Influencer Experiment" tracked a potter, a historian, and a theatre performer with zero followers as they attempted to gain social media traction over three months. Emily, a stroke survivor potter, found inspiration but also felt overwhelmed by engagement and inauthentic. Alun, a historian, struggled with chasing views, compromising academic integrity, and dealing with cruel comments about his alopecia, though his university's promotion boosted his reach. Danyah, the performer, found content creation addictive and draining. The article highlights the emotional toll, authenticity struggles, and unexpected rewards of navigating the creator economy, which is projected to be worth almost $500 billion by 2027.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance over the Pacific, an event that has captivated public fascination for decades. While the prevailing theory suggests she ran out of fuel and crashed, various unsubstantiated theories, including a spy mission or capture by the Japanese, persist. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had urged the declassification, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart on Saipan. Despite a 1967 security review of Navy files dismissing spy theories, Trump's order aims to address lingering questions surrounding the aviator's fate.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is slated to address hundreds of senior U.S. generals and admirals next week in a rare gathering at Quantico, Virginia, to discuss restoring the "warrior ethos" to the U.S. military. Officials indicate Hegseth will present new standards for achieving this goal and outline how the military will conduct itself. The unusual nature of summoning so many high-ranking officers from around the world has raised questions about security, travel costs, and the specific agenda, especially following Hegseth's earlier announcement of a 20% reduction in four-star officers.
