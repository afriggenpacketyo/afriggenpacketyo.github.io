          <p>Jim Lovell, the astronaut renowned for commanding the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guiding its crew back to Earth in 1970, has passed away at the age of 97. NASA and his family remembered him for his unshakable optimism and for turning a potential catastrophe into one of the space agency's most celebrated successes. As the first person to fly to the Moon twice, Lovell became an American hero, famously portrayed by Tom Hanks in the film "Apollo 13," yet he never had the chance to walk on the lunar surface. His long and distinguished career included service in the U.S. Navy and roles on the Gemini and other Apollo missions.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses are preparing for their upcoming match against France, viewing it as a critical step in their journey towards the Women's Rugby World Cup final. Wing Abby Dow described the team's mindset as climbing "Everest," an analogy reinforced by a talk from a mountaineer who summited the peak. The team is focused on learning from their narrow Six Nations victory over the same opponent, where they nearly let a large lead slip. Head coach John Mitchell has emphasized that the priority is performance over simply extending their 26-match winning streak, as they build towards their ultimate goal in September.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated matchup between two future Hall of Fame pitchers, Clayton Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer and the Toronto Blue Jays. Both veteran aces delivered strong performances, with Kershaw allowing just one run over six innings and Scherzer giving up two. The key moment came when Mookie Betts hit a go-ahead two-run homer off Scherzer in the fifth inning, breaking a scoreless tie. The game was a nostalgic showcase of two of the generation's most dominant pitchers, who are both still competing at a high level for first-place teams.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully synthesized high-purity hexagonal diamonds, a rare variant first discovered in a meteorite in 1967. This type of diamond, which has a distinct atomic structure compared to common cubic diamonds, was long believed to form only under the extreme pressure and heat of a meteorite impact. Publishing their findings in the journal Nature, the researchers detailed how they created macroscopic crystals of the material, a feat that had eluded previous international efforts which often resulted in mixed or impure samples. This breakthrough provides definitive proof of the material's existence and opens new possibilities for advanced material science.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered an impressive performance in his NFL preseason debut, leading his team to a 30-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers. Sanders, a fifth-round draft pick, completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and threw two touchdown passes, earning praise from figures like LeBron James. Despite starting the game fourth on the depth chart, Sanders showed significant poise and led three touchdown drives, potentially improving his standing in the team's open quarterback competition. His counterpart, No. 1 pick Bryce Young, played two effective series for the Panthers before being rested for the night.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from NASA's Crew-10 mission have undocked from the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, commencing their nearly 18-hour return trip to Earth. The crew, consisting of U.S. astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, is scheduled to splash down in the Pacific Ocean. During their 146 days in orbit, the astronauts conducted over 200 scientific experiments, including studies on plant growth and cellular behavior in microgravity. Their departure concludes NASA's 10th successful commercial crew rotation mission to the orbiting laboratory.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a genetically high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease as a "gear shift" in his life's motivations. The discovery, made during a genetic test for his show "Limitless," revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. The 41-year-old star said the news prompted a shift in focus towards living a healthier life and prioritizing time with family, a change reflected in the second season of his show.

          <h2>Economic Uncertainty Fuels 'Treatonomics' Trend of Spending on Small Luxuries and Experiences</h2>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on everything from small pick-me-ups like lipstick to major experiences like concert tours to boost their morale during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon, an evolution of the classic "lipstick effect," sees consumers making everyday sacrifices to afford moments of joy, whether it's a new home accessory or a high-priced ticket to see Taylor Swift. Analysts note that with traditional life milestones like home ownership becoming less attainable for many, people are instead celebrating smaller "inch-stones" and investing in experiences that provide an immediate sense of well-being and enrichment.
