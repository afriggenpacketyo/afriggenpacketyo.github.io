          <p>James Lovell, a decorated NASA astronaut who flew to space four times and famously commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away. Lovell was one of the first humans to orbit the Moon on Apollo 8 in 1968, a mission that captured the world's imagination. His calm and decisive leadership during the 1970 Apollo 13 crisis, when an explosion crippled the spacecraft, was instrumental in the safe return of his crew, turning a potential tragedy into one of NASA's most celebrated triumphs. His iconic message, "Houston, we've had a problem," remains a symbol of grace under extreme pressure.</p>

          <p>George Foreman, the iconic boxer who won the heavyweight title twice and later found immense success as an entrepreneur, has died. Foreman first became champion in 1973 before losing the title to Muhammad Ali in the legendary "Rumble in the Jungle" match. After a religious experience, he retired from boxing to become a minister but mounted an improbable comeback, reclaiming the heavyweight championship in 1994 at age 45. Following his second retirement, he became a household name once again by endorsing the wildly popular George Foreman Grill, cementing his legacy as a beloved cultural figure.</p>

For 11 seasons, she portrayed the dedicated and by-the-book head nurse, a role that earned her two Emmy Awards and widespread acclaim. Swit was instrumental in developing her character beyond the initial comedic foil, infusing Houlihan with depth, strength, and complexity that mirrored the show's evolution from sitcom to poignant anti-war commentary. Her performance helped make "M*A*S*H" one of the most beloved and culturally significant shows in television history.</p>

          <p>A school district in rural Pennsylvania is leveraging technology to make music education more accessible for its low-income students by 3D-printing violins. Superintendent Dr. Laura Jacob initiated the program after discovering the high cost of instrument rentals was a significant barrier for many families. Using models found online, the district now produces violins for about $50 each, providing them to students for free. The initiative has not only equipped over 200 students with instruments but has also fostered a sense of confidence and passion for music within the school community.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the amount of money to place in a certificate of deposit (CD) depends heavily on an individual's overall financial situation, liquidity needs, and the current interest rate environment. While CDs currently offer solid returns, savers should first ensure they have a robust emergency fund before locking money away. With the Federal Reserve expected to lower rates, locking in a higher CD rate now could be advantageous. Strategies like CD laddering, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with different maturity dates, can help balance the need for returns with access to cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated the group's agreement to the latest ceasefire proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators, which outlines a comprehensive two-stage plan for a truce in Gaza. The proposal reportedly involves a 60-day temporary ceasefire during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining Israeli hostages. In exchange, negotiations would proceed on a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the region. There has been no immediate official comment from Israel, which has previously insisted on the release of all hostages as a condition for any deal.</p>

          <p>While the United States remains the largest single national donor to Ukraine, the combined financial, military, and humanitarian aid from European countries has exceeded the total U.S. commitment since Russia's 2022 invasion. According to data from the Germany-based Kiel Institute, European nations have collectively allocated $165.7 billion, compared to the U.S. total of $130.6 billion. This analysis provides context to ongoing debates about burden-sharing among allies supporting Ukraine's defense efforts. The data also indicates that European aid has included a higher proportion of loans, whereas U.S. financial support has primarily been in the form of grants.</p>

          <p>In response to growing pressure to lower drug prices, Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic, for $499 per month to cash-paying patients in the United States. This price is less than half of the medication's current monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy. The move aims to increase access for uninsured or underinsured patients and combat the use of potentially unsafe, unapproved compounded versions of the drug that have become popular amid high demand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study conducted in rural Kenya has found that unconditional cash transfers can be a powerful tool for saving infant lives. Researchers discovered that infants born to families who received a one-time payment of $1,000 were nearly 50% less likely to die compared to those in a control group. The study suggests the money enabled families to afford better healthcare, particularly during childbirth, and improved nutrition. The findings indicate that direct cash aid can be as effective as some traditional medical interventions, offering a simple yet potent method for improving child survival in low-income regions.</p>
