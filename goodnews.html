          <p>The US Air Force has initiated ground tests of its new AI-driven combat drones, signaling an intensification of its technological rivalry with China in the development of unmanned weapons systems. These prototypes, developed by General Atomics and Anduril, are the first unmanned aircraft to receive fighter designations in US military history. General David Allvin, the US Air Force chief of staff, described the tests as a significant milestone for the collaborative combat aircraft program, which reflects a strategic shift towards autonomous aerial warfare. The program features next-generation uncrewed aircraft that can fly alongside crewed fighter jets.</p>

          <p>Brood XIV, a group of periodical cicadas, is poised to emerge from underground after 17 years, affecting ecosystems across large portions of the eastern US. These insects will surface in the billions, from Long Island to central Tennessee, to mate and lay eggs before dying within a few weeks. The emergence of these cicadas will provide a significant food source for various forest creatures, impacting bird populations and hunting patterns. Eastern North America is the only place in the world where periodical cicadas are found, and their emergence shapes ecosystems for years to come.</p>

          <p>Doordash has announced its acquisition of restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion, despite reporting first-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations. The all-cash deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025, with Doordash citing the acquisition as a means to expand its local commerce capabilities. Despite the revenue miss, Doordash reported an 18% increase in total orders for the quarter, reaching 732 million.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly declassified New York Times article reveals that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which he used to justify deporting Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's movements in the U.S. The article highlights the administration's forceful criticism of media coverage that contradicted their claims and the subsequent criminal investigation into leaks, despite the declassification supporting the Times' reporting. The ACLU has requested a judge to order the Trump administration to bring back the Venezuelans for normal immigration hearings, citing evidence that some of the men sent there were likely not gang members.</p>

Sporting director Gian Luca Nani cited the need for change to build on the team's young talent, as the Hornets now seek their tenth permanent head coach since 2020.</p>

Despite raising prices on certain models, Ferrari is navigating the disruptive impact of Trump's trade policy, which has already affected several European auto giants.</p>
