          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos intends to sell up to 25 million shares of Amazon stock over the next year, valued at approximately $4.8 billion. This decision follows Amazon's recent first-quarter earnings report, which exceeded expectations despite a cautious forecast for operating income amid concerns about President Trump's new tariffs. Bezos's previous stock sale occurred last year, when he offloaded about $13.5 billion worth of shares. Since stepping down as CEO, Bezos has focused on his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his climate and biodiversity fund, using Amazon share sales to fund these ventures. </p>

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 seeks to cut 22% of non-defense discretionary spending while increasing defense spending to over $1 trillion. The proposal would slash non-defense discretionary spending by $163 billion from current levels, resulting in the lowest level since 2017. The budget aims to reduce bureaucracy and prioritize American interests, with significant cuts to foreign aid. Spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid remains untouched, although they continue to be major drivers of the federal deficit. </p>

          <p>Netflix's stock is trading at all-time-high levels, marking an unprecedented win streak of 11 consecutive days without a decline.

Netflix has been a top-performing stock during the first 100 days of President Trump's second term, largely unaffected by trade tensions.
