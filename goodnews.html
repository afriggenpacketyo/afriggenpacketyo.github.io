          <p>Bill Gates announced that he will donate virtually all of his wealth, approximately $200 billion, through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years, inspired by Andrew Carnegie's philosophy on wealth distribution. The Gates Foundation, originally intended to operate decades after his death, will now close in 2045. Gates aims to eradicate infectious diseases, reduce childhood mortality, and improve education, with a particular focus on aiding developing countries. He expressed concern over potential setbacks due to aid cuts from the U.S. and European countries, emphasizing the need to maintain and expand global health initiatives to save lives.</p>

          <p>Denmark is holding a landmark trial for two men accused of burning a Quran at a public festival and livestreaming it on Facebook, marking the first case under a new law criminalizing the "inappropriate treatment" of religious texts. The law was enacted in response to international tensions caused by a series of Quran burnings in Denmark during 2023, which led to diplomatic incidents and threats. Critics of the law argue that it infringes upon freedom of expression, while supporters maintain it is necessary to protect national security and prevent provocation. The article also notes similar debates and incidents in Sweden regarding the desecration of the Quran.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged due to economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. Trump accused Powell of being a "fool" and claimed there is virtually no inflation. The Fed stated it would maintain rates until the economic outlook becomes clearer, citing risks of higher unemployment and inflation. Powell responded by stating that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and will not be influenced by political pressure.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade agreements could be announced soon, as his administration faces pressure to strike deals before a 90-day pause on tariffs ends on July 9.
