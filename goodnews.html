          <h2>California Governor Proposes Pausing Immigrant Health Care Coverage Expansion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 21:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits starting in 2026, citing economic uncertainty and a $12 billion budget deficit. Those already enrolled in Medi-Cal will not be affected by the freeze, and children will continue to receive benefits. Starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal will be required to pay a $100 monthly premium, aligning with the average cost paid by those on subsidized health plans through California's marketplace. Newsom's office estimates these changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California will face a 17% increase in home insurance premiums following a judge's ruling and the adoption of the decision by California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. The increase is intended to alleviate State Farm's financial situation following the destructive Los Angeles-area wildfires. The company also agreed to refrain from implementing new block non-renewal programs through the end of 2025. The decision has faced backlash from fire survivors and state senators, who have asked for delays and investigations into insurance payment delays.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced, paving the way for their possible release, the culture and politics of the 1990s, when they were first tried, were scrutinized. Their lawyer argued that the criminal justice policies of that era contributed to their harsh sentences. The case, initially televised nationally, became a cultural touchstone, with the brothers portrayed as spoiled kids who invented sexual assault claims. The shift in media landscape and social attitudes, influenced by Netflix shows and social media campaigns, played a role in re-evaluating their case.</p>
