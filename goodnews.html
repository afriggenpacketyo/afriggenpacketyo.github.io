          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter results that significantly beat Wall Street estimates, largely due to stronger-than-expected trading revenues. The bank's net income increased by 13% year-over-year, reaching $3.5 billion, with notable strength in equity trading. CEO Ted Pick highlighted the bank's consistent earnings over the last six quarters as evidence of its solid performance across various market conditions. The bank's stock has outperformed the S&P 500, rising over 12% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a significant outperformance in its trading division. The firm's traders generated $840 million more in revenue than anticipated, contributing to overall revenue of $14.58 billion against a $13.47 billion forecast. This strong showing reflects a broader trend of major banks benefiting from robust market activity. The positive earnings report has contributed to a 23% rise in the company's stock value this year.

          <p>Bank of America delivered mixed second-quarter results, exceeding earnings expectations but falling short on revenue forecasts. The company's profit saw a modest 3% climb to $7.12 billion, while its revenue of $26.61 billion was slightly below estimates, primarily due to net interest income (NII) missing targets by $70 million. Despite the NII miss, CEO Brian Moynihan pointed to resilient consumer spending and growth in loans and deposits as positive indicators. The bank's stock has seen a relatively modest 5% increase this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Highly-touted Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning has put an end to transfer speculation, stating that leaving the program was never a consideration for him. Despite serving as a backup last season, Manning emphasized his desire to remain at the University ofTexas, citing his connection to the school, the city of Austin, and the football program. Now the team's starter, he is poised to lead the offense after gaining valuable experience last season, where he threw for 939 yards and nine touchdowns in 10 games.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a rebound as investor optimism grew around the potential passage of key stablecoin legislation in the U.S. House this week. Bitcoin and ether both posted gains after a brief dip when the bills initially failed to advance. The proposed GENIUS Act, which has already passed the Senate, aims to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers like Circle. Analysts suggest that the passage of these bills is a matter of 'when,' not 'if,' providing a positive long-term outlook for the industry's stability and legitimacy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in its history, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was decided by a home run swing-off after the game ended in a 6-6 tie.

The new tie-breaking format, introduced in 2022 to avoid exhausting pitching staffs, provided a dramatic and memorable conclusion to the midsummer classic.

          <p>The United Kingdom has lifted a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines, enabling them to apply to resume flights after demonstrating significant improvements in aviation safety. The ban was originally imposed in 2020 following a scandal involving fraudulent pilot licenses and a fatal crash. The decision, which follows a similar move by the EU, is a major boost for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which lost significant revenue from the suspension of its profitable UK routes. The restoration of these routes is also expected to increase the value of the state-owned airline ahead of its planned privatization.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the National Health Service in England has recommended that physician associates (PAs) be renamed "physician assistants" to better reflect their supportive role and avoid confusing patients. The review, prompted by safety concerns and a lack of clarity around the role, also suggests that PAs should not make initial diagnoses and must wear standardized uniforms to distinguish them from doctors. While the doctor's union welcomed the name change, the union representing PAs expressed concern that the new restrictions could worsen patient waiting lists.</p>

          <p>Luxury goods conglomerate Richemont has reported a 15% sales decline in Japan, signaling an end to the currency-driven spending boom the country had been experiencing. For the past year, a weak yen had attracted a surge of tourists, particularly from China, who took advantage of favorable exchange rates to buy luxury items. However, a recent strengthening of the yen has reversed this trend, making goods more expensive for foreign shoppers and impacting sales for brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. Despite the drop in Japan, Richemont's overall global sales still rose by 6%.</p>
