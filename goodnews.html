          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge hit his 350th career home run, achieving the milestone faster than any other player in MLB history. Judge reached the mark in his 1,088th game, surpassing the previous record holder, Mark McGwire, who did it in 1,280 games. Despite the personal achievement, Judge expressed that a team win would have been more satisfying. The two-time AL MVP continues to have a dominant season, leading the major leagues in batting average, home runs, and RBIs. Judge also mentioned having a friendly relationship with McGwire, which began when they discussed injury recovery.</p>

          <p>China's space economy is experiencing rapid growth, with private investment projected to skyrocket and the overall sector forecast to reach US$1.8 trillion by 2035. This expansion is driven by technological advances, lower costs, and state support for private enterprises like i-Space and LandSpace, which have achieved significant milestones in orbital launches. This article suggests that Hong Kong, with its financial and legal expertise, is well-positioned to become a crucial hub for financing and supporting this burgeoning commercial space industry. The growth represents a strategic shift from state-led missions to a more dynamic, privately-fueled aerospace sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Levitt Pavilion's annual summer concert series in Los Angeles' MacArthur Park have confirmed the events will continue despite ongoing immigration raids in the area. After canceling one performance, the series resumed with organizers emphasizing the importance of community and cultural unity during difficult times. To address safety concerns, the organization is hiring private security and will livestream performances for those afraid to attend in person. The area has seen significant enforcement activity, with nearly 2,800 arrests in the L.A. region since the raids began, but organizers are committed to providing a space for joy and resistance through the arts.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is actively promoting the development of what it terms "future industries" to establish a new economic growth model based on technological innovation. First conceptualized by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this strategy targets emerging sectors that have immense potential despite their technologies being in early stages. In 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) identified key areas for this initiative, including humanoid robots, 6G networks, brain-computer interfaces, and next-generation aircraft. This focus on cutting-edge fields is central to China's efforts to secure a leading position in the global technology race and upgrade its industrial capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Lab-Grown Cheese Nears Market, But Faces Consumer and Regulatory Hurdles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Start-up companies like Better Dairy in the UK are on the verge of bringing lab-grown cheese, made using precision fermentation, to the consumer market. This technology uses genetically modified yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats to create cheese without cows. While proponents tout a taste closer to the real thing than current vegan alternatives, the industry faces challenges, including declining sales of plant-based cheeses, consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods, and regulatory approval. Companies are targeting a launch within the next few years, hoping to overcome these obstacles and revolutionize the dairy aisle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The reality TV show Love Island is experiencing a resurgence in viewership, with figures returning to levels not seen in years, and much of this renewed interest is attributed to its massive growth on social media, particularly TikTok. The show's official accounts have gained 1.8 million followers in 2025, with TikTok accounting for a million of them. Many viewers, including former contestants, prefer consuming the show through short-form clips, recaps, and analysis on the platform rather than committing to the daily hour-long episodes. While this boosts engagement, some critics worry that condensing the show into bite-sized content can distort context and take the "reality" out of reality TV.</p>

          <p>Sweden delivered a commanding performance at the Women's Euro 2025, defeating eight-time champions Germany 4-1 to secure the top spot in Group C. The victory marks a significant statement for the Swedish team, which has historically fallen short in major tournaments despite consistent strong showings. Players and fans expressed a renewed sense of belief, with Chelsea midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd stating "there is something different" about the squad this year. Having won all three group matches, Sweden now advances to the quarter-finals with high hopes of finally capturing the European title, a feat they last achieved in the inaugural 1984 tournament.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, barring immigration officials from conducting "indiscriminate" arrests of individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. The order, issued by Judge Maame Frimpong, states there is a "mountain of evidence" of unconstitutional "roving patrols" and prohibits arrests based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were detained. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the order, claiming it undermines the administration's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and remove dangerous criminals.</p>

While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the win, Ohtani's dominant start provided the momentum the team desperately needed.
