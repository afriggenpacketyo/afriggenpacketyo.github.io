          <p>In her upcoming book, Vice President Kamala Harris reveals that her "first choice" for a running mate in the 2024 election was Pete Buttigieg. However, she ultimately decided against it, believing it would be "too big of a risk" for a Black woman to run on a ticket with a gay man. Harris expresses her admiration for Buttigieg's political talents and laments that the political climate made the pairing unviable, ultimately selecting Minnesota Governor Tim Walz instead. This candid admission highlights the complex calculations of identity and electability in modern American politics.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region displayed a mixed performance after the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented an anticipated interest rate cut. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the move as a "risk management cut," suggesting it was a precautionary measure rather than a response to a weak economy. While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi opened higher, Australia's ASX 200 declined. The Fed's signal of potential future cuts is being closely watched by global investors, including those awaiting the Bank of Japan's upcoming policy decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Meteorologists expect the system to intensify, potentially reaching hurricane status over the weekend as it moves northwest. Current forecast tracks predict Gabrielle will remain over open water for several days, posing no immediate threat to land. However, the storm could approach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen, and its long-term path remains subject to change as the system develops further.</p>

          <h2>Wild Chimpanzees Consume Fruit with Alcohol Content Equivalent to Two Daily Cocktails, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fermented fruits containing low levels of alcohol. By testing the figs and plums that make up a significant portion of the apes' diet, scientists determined the average alcohol content was around 0.3% by weight. Given the large quantity of fruit they eat, this amounts to a daily intake of about 14 grams of ethanol for a chimp, the equivalent of nearly two standard alcoholic drinks for a human. The study supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, suggesting our own attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate diets.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Education Select Committee has urged the government not to scrap the current system of education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs and disabilities. These legally binding plans outline the specific support a child is entitled to. Instead of eliminating them, the committee recommends establishing new national minimum standards for support in schools and providing more training for all teachers. The recommendation comes as the government prepares to announce its own reforms to a system that has been criticized as financially unsustainable.</p>

          <p>Liverpool secured a dramatic 3-2 victory against Atletico Madrid in their Champions League opener, thanks to a 93rd-minute header from captain Virgil van Dijk.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold its key interest rate at 4% when it meets on Thursday. This follows a rate cut from 4.25% in August, which brought borrowing costs to their lowest level in over two years. With UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the central bank's target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut that could fuel further price rises. The decision comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its own rates, highlighting differing economic conditions between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Bjorn Borg has revealed he was diagnosed with an "extremely aggressive" and advanced form of prostate cancer. The 69-year-old former world number one, who won 11 Grand Slam titles, stated in his autobiography that he is now in remission following an operation in 2024. Borg described the diagnosis as psychologically difficult but vowed to "fight every day like it's a Wimbledon final." He must undergo testing every six months to monitor for a recurrence, a reality he says he now has to live with while taking life "day by day."</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's de facto central bank has cut its base interest rate for the first time in 2025, lowering it by 25 basis points. The move by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority immediately followed the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its own rates, a standard practice due to the Hong Kong dollar's currency peg to the U.S. dollar. The rate cut is intended to reduce the cost of funding for businesses and ease the burden on mortgage holders in the city. The Fed's action was prompted by signs of a softening labor market in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>
