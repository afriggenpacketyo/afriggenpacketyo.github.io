The FAA confirmed that the event will impact operations at DCA, with temporary flight restrictions in place to ensure safety and security. The military parade is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million and will feature over 100 vehicles, 50 helicopters, and thousands of soldiers.

          <p>The government has banned several water companies from paying "unfair" bonuses to senior executives under new rules. The measures apply to water companies that do not meet environmental and consumer standards, are not financially resilient, or have been convicted of a criminal offense. Six firms are banned from paying bonuses this year, including Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water. The ban, backdated to April 2024, allows the regulator Ofwat to force firms to claw back bonuses or face enforcement action. The article addresses growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills. The government will look into companies trying to circumvent the ban by raising executives' base salaries.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Manila and Beijing should improve their diplomacy despite the ongoing sea dispute, as June 9 marks the 50th anniversary of Philippines-China relations. The overemphasis on the intractable sea dispute has polluted broader connections, stunting economic cooperation and stigmatizing people-to-people exchanges. Allowing security issues to dominate relations is neither wise nor strategic, and confining ties to maritime tensions limits their scope and potential. The article suggests that both countries should work together in areas where they can without compromising their positions. China's economic success and potential for cooperation are highlighted. The piece emphasizes the importance of effective diplomacy between the two nations.</p>
