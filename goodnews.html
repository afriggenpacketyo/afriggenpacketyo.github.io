          <p>The consumer price index (CPI) indicated that inflation retreated to 2.3% in April 2025, the smallest annual increase since February 2021, driven by lower prices for groceries, gasoline, used cars, and clothing. Economists, however, caution that tariffs imposed by President Trump could reignite inflation, potentially impacting the May CPI report. A Yale Budget Lab report estimates that current tariff policies could cost the average U.S. household an additional $2,800 in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump declared that the U.S. would remove all sanctions on Syria to give the country "a chance at greatness," during an appearance in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Trump highlighted the new Syrian government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former Al Qaeda member, hoping it would stabilize the country. Sanctions had been in place since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011 after a crackdown on anti-government uprisings. The removal of sanctions signifies a major shift in U.S. policy towards Syria after years of civil war and violence.</p>
