          <p>Disney's shares experienced a 10% increase following the release of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, which surpassed expectations due to better-than-anticipated subscriber growth for Disney+. The company has updated its fiscal 2025 guidance and reported revenue growth across all its business segments, including announcing a new theme park and resort in Abu Dhabi. Disney+ subscriptions rose by 1.4 million, reaching a global base of 126 million, and revenue for the direct-to-consumer business increased by 8% to $6.12 billion. The company now anticipates full-year adjusted EPS of $5.75, marking a 16% increase compared to fiscal 2024.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts, to stimulate economic growth amidst trade concerns. The People's Bank of China will reduce the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting 1 trillion yuan ($138.5 billion) into the market. These measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, and a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care will be established. However, some economists believe these measures may have a limited impact on boosting domestic credit demand. </p>

          <p>Indian markets have largely shrugged off tensions with Pakistan following military strikes by New Delhi within Pakistani-controlled territory, with investors remaining optimistic about India's growth prospects. Progress in trade talks with major partners, including a free trade agreement with the U.K., has also bolstered market confidence. Analysts anticipate a swift de-escalation of tensions, limiting any potential fallout, though they acknowledge that a wider conflict could have a more significant impact. The benchmark Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex remained relatively unchanged following the military operation.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have recently reached extraordinary levels, prompting discussions about potential factors that could trigger a price drop. Experts suggest that profit-taking by investors, a sharp strengthening of the U.S. dollar, economic recovery reducing safe-haven demand, cooling political and economic tensions, a breakout equity market rally, and deflationary pressure could all contribute to a decline in gold prices. However, they caution against waiting for the perfect entry point and emphasize that investing in gold should be a long-term strategy (not investment advice).</p>
