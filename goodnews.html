          <p>The UK and EU are holding their first bilateral summit since Brexit, aiming to reset relations amidst global concerns like Russia, China, and US defense priorities. Negotiations continue over key issues such as fishing rights and defence contracts, with expected announcements including a joint declaration on foreign policy priorities, a security and defence pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. While these trade measures represent a modest reset promised by Prime Minister Starmer, they are limited by Labour's red lines against rejoining the customs union or single market. The UK is also seeking to reduce trade barriers sector-by-sector, such as with a plant and animal health deal, while the EU insists on long-term fishing rights in UK waters.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine but restricted its use to older adults and those with high-risk medical conditions, a decision that has sparked controversy. This restriction limits access for healthy individuals under 65 and requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects, potentially costing the company millions. Experts express concern that these restrictions, influenced by vaccine skepticism, may hinder vaccine availability and accessibility. Some argue that the decision deviates from established norms, as the CDC typically determines vaccine recommendations, raising questions about the future of vaccine infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>Paleontologists Discover 500-Million-Year-Old Three-Eyed Predator</h2>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old predator with three eyes, named Mosura fentoni, in the Canadian Rockies. This 'sea moth' had a pencil sharpener-like mouth and intimidating claws, providing new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period. The discovery revealed that Mosura was more complex than previously thought, with a segmented body and gills similar to modern arthropods. The well-preserved fossil also showed the creature's open circulatory system, shedding light on the diversity of life before the Cambrian explosion.</p>
