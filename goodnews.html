          <p>Nvidia reported robust second-quarter earnings and revenue, surpassing analyst estimates, primarily due to a 56% surge in its data center business, signaling sustained demand for AI infrastructure. The company projects over 50% sales growth for the current quarter, despite U.S. restrictions on H20 chip shipments to China impacting potential sales. Net income increased significantly, with data center sales for GPU chips and networking parts driving the growth, benefiting from large cloud providers' investments in AI. The board also approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases, reflecting strong financial performance and confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration successfully executed a major narcotics bust in Franklin, New Hampshire, leading to the arrest of 27 individuals. The operation seized significant quantities of fentanyl and methamphetamine, with investigators directly linking the drugs to Mexico’s powerful Sinaloa Cartel, tracing the supply through Lawrence, Massachusetts. This concerted effort targeted the criminal networks responsible for exacerbating the nation’s fentanyl crisis, which accounts for over 70,000 overdose fatalities annually. Authorities emphasize the ongoing nature of the investigation to further dismantle these illicit drug operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a nearly 90% likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, savers holding Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts are advised to make strategic moves to maximize earnings. A rate cut would reduce future CD interest rates, impacting savers who have benefited from a higher-rate environment. Experts recommend shopping online for the highest rates, precisely determining an affordable deposit amount to avoid early withdrawal penalties, and opting for the longest-term CD that fits one's budget to secure current rates and protect principal. These proactive steps can help savers navigate the changing economic landscape effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners seeking additional financing may find a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) particularly advantageous this September, as it currently stands as one of the cheapest borrowing options. HELOCs offer lower interest rates compared to personal loans and credit cards, with potential tax deductibility for eligible home projects. The likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September could further reduce HELOC rates, making them even more attractive. Additionally, rising home equity levels mean homeowners have more capital available to borrow against, providing a substantial funding source for various needs. (not investment advice)</p>

The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance, reflecting an improved outlook, and revised its earnings per share guidance upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender acknowledged challenges from lower- and middle-income customers trading down, but highlighted ongoing initiatives to reintroduce popular sections, expand exclusive brands, and overhaul discount strategies to win back shoppers.

          <p>Depositing $40,000 into a Certificate of Deposit (CD) account can yield substantial interest earnings, ranging from approximately $423 for a 3-month term to over $9,000 for a 5-year term, based on current high rates. While stock market investments might offer higher returns, CDs provide a safe and predictable way to grow money, protecting principal from volatility. Savers are advised to act soon, as impending Federal Reserve rate cuts could lead banks to reduce their CD offerings. The decision to open a CD depends on individual financial goals, budget, and the ability to commit funds for the full term without incurring early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley confirmed he will not play in next month's tournament, acknowledging that the decision "hurts" but emphasizing the immense honor of leading the team. Despite a recent win that briefly made him reconsider, Bradley ultimately prioritized his captaincy, a role no one has combined with playing since Arnold Palmer. The demands of the captaincy, including shaping pairings and managing team dynamics, make a player-captain role impractical in modern golf. Bradley's self-sacrifice aims to inspire his selected team, which includes four rookies, as they prepare for a hostile Bethpage environment against a formidable European side.</p>

          <p>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has issued a long-awaited formal apology to Greenlandic Inuit women and their families who were victims of a forced contraception campaign in the 1960s and 70s. Thousands of women and girls, some as young as 12, were fitted with IUDs without their consent or knowledge, severely slowing Greenland's population growth. The scandal, brought to light by an investigative podcast, led to a lawsuit from 143 women seeking compensation and prompted a formal inquiry. Frederiksen acknowledged the "systematic discrimination" and "physical and psychological harm," with Greenland's Prime Minister also recognizing responsibility and emphasizing the need for truth and future prevention.</p>

Initially, Brady was prohibited from attending production meetings with coaches and players, but this restriction has been lifted, allowing him to participate remotely. He remains barred from team facilities for these meetings but can conduct off-site player interviews. The league also maintains a rule against "egregiously criticizing officials," which Brady adhered to in 2024.

          <p>For 2025, the maximum Social Security payment for a retiree at full retirement age is $4,018 per month, increasing to $5,108 for those who delay claiming until age 70. Achieving this maximum requires exceptional lifetime earnings at or above the taxable maximum for at least 35 years. Given that most retirees receive significantly less and rely heavily on Social Security, additional income streams are crucial. Options like reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62+ to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, while annuities can provide guaranteed retirement income. These strategies are vital for financial security beyond Social Security benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
