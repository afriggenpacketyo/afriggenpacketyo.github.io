          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump to discuss economic developments, including growth, employment, and inflation. Powell emphasized that monetary policy decisions would depend on incoming economic data and its impact on the outlook, stressing that analysis would be careful, objective, and non-political. The meeting occurred amid Trump's repeated calls for the Federal Open Market Committee to lower interest rates, using his Truth Social media outlet to express his views. This was their first meeting since Trump began his second term, during which Powell confirmed he would not initiate a meeting with the President.</p>
