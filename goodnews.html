          <p>Shares of Affirm, the buy-now, pay-later company, increased by 15% in after-hours trading after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. The company announced earnings of 20 cents per share on $876 million in revenue, outperforming estimates and marking a significant turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. Gross merchandise volume also saw a substantial 43% rise to $10.4 billion, reflecting strong consumer use of its services despite a competitive market that includes partners like Amazon and a recent shift by Walmart to a rival service.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones defended the decision to trade star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating it gives the team a "chance to be better" both now and in the future. Jones emphasized the acquisition of Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark in the deal, which he believes will address the team's long-standing weakness in stopping the run. In addition to Clark, the Cowboys received two future first-round draft picks, which Jones views as valuable assets for acquiring multiple outstanding players. He maintained that the trade was a consensus decision and not a result of animosity over failed contract negotiations.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region displayed mixed results, diverging from the gains seen on Wall Street as investors processed new economic data from the area. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 and Topix both experienced slight declines after Tokyo's core consumer price index showed a slower increase in August, though it remained above the central bank's target. Conversely, South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq indices saw modest gains, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also edged higher. The varied performance reflects differing local economic signals, including a slight decrease in Japan's unemployment rate, which are influencing investor sentiment across the region.

          <p>Conservation scientists are studying the DNA of ancient oak trees, such as the 800-year-old Druids Oak in Buckinghamshire, to uncover the genetic secrets behind their remarkable longevity and resilience. By analyzing the genomes of these survivors, researchers from The Woodland Trust hope to identify genes that help the trees withstand climate change, disease, and other threats. This knowledge could be crucial for selecting the most robust saplings for future planting, aiding in the restoration of Britain's woodlands. Ancient oaks are vital ecological keystones, supporting over 2,300 species and playing a central role in nature recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>Starting in January 2026, the NHS will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales, a move aimed at preventing the common but sometimes severe illness. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost. Health officials hope the program will protect children from rare but serious complications like encephalitis and save parents from taking time off work to care for sick children, which costs the UK economy an estimated £24 million annually.</p>

In his announcement, the 45-year-old retired first baseman stated his commitment to defending President Trump's "America First agenda," Texas families, and individual liberty. He is entering politics in a heavily Republican district, which could provide a more favorable path than that of fellow former ballplayer Steve Garvey, who recently lost a Senate race in deep-blue California.</p>
