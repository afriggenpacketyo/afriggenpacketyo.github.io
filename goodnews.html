        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have officially confirmed the details of a new trade framework aimed at de-escalating economic tensions. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, Beijing will review and approve applications for items under its export control rules, while Washington has agreed to cancel a range of restrictive measures. This agreement, which builds upon earlier talks in Geneva and London, seeks to stabilize the fraught relationship, though experts advise caution, noting a lack of clarity on the specifics of relaxing rare earth export curbs. The deal aims to resolve disputes that caused a previous 90-day tariff suspension to falter.</p>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei stock index closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, driven by easing concerns over potential U.S. tariffs. The market responded positively to a White House announcement that President Trump might extend a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which was set to expire. Investor sentiment was also bolstered by a holding ceasefire between Israel and Iran, contributing to a broader sense of stability in international affairs. The U.S. dollar strengthened against the yen as the Japanese currency, typically a safe-haven asset, was sold amid hopes for progress in trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retired Welsh rugby winger George North, now 33, recently reflected on his memorable 2013 British and Irish Lions tour in Australia, particularly an iconic moment from the second Test. During the match, North famously lifted Australian player Israel Folau onto his shoulders while continuing to run, a display of power that has become part of Lions folklore. North, who is now playing in France, stated that this moment, along with his spectacular solo try in the first Test, is what fans most frequently remember. He considers the 2013 tour, which the Lions won 2-1, the period where he played the best rugby of his career.</p>

The experts suggested that to harmonize its trade relationships and ensure sustainable growth, China needs to boost internal demand.

          <p>The Chinese city of Chongqing is experiencing a massive tourism boom, particularly from Southeast Asia, driven by viral social media clips showcasing its "cyberpunk" architecture and unique topography. Online travel platforms report that flight bookings to the city have surged, with Klook noting a nearly twelve-fold increase in demand compared to other Chinese cities. Young travelers are drawn to sights like a monorail passing through a residential building and the city's multi-dimensional, hilly landscape. This trend is part of a broader rise in China's popularity among young travelers, who are attracted by cultural experiences and improved travel amenities.</p>
