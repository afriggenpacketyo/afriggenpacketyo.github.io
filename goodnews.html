          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD experienced a significant drop after the company announced price reductions on several of its electric and plug-in hybrid models. Analysts anticipate a surge in dealership visits due to these price cuts, but do not foresee significant market share erosion for BYD's competitors. The price reductions, affecting 22 models, are expected to stimulate sales growth in the new energy vehicle sector, particularly for vehicles priced below 200,000 Chinese yuan, where competition remains moderate. This move reflects the ongoing competition and potential price war in the Chinese automotive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Energy provider Octopus has apologized to a customer in Hartlebury, Worcestershire, after wrongly pursuing him for an outstanding gas bill of over ¬£6,000 for nearly four years. Peter Holden, 67, repeatedly informed the company of the error, which stemmed from a data issue causing his meter to share a serial number with another account. Despite assurances and apologies from Octopus staff, the erroneous bills and debt collection attempts persisted, causing significant stress to Mr. Holden. The company has promised further staff training to prevent similar mistakes in the future, with the commercial director personally apologizing and vowing to restore the customer's faith.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated a revised rice sales system to reduce soaring prices, aiming to bring them down to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice via direct contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system that was seen as contributing to higher costs. The new measures also waive previous requirements for suppliers to return an equivalent amount of rice to the government. This action follows criticism of the government's previous efforts to control rice prices, with the public showing optimism that the new farm minister can effectively lower prices.

          <p>Businesses are utilizing a legal workaround called the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs, allowing U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price from the factory to the vendor. This rule, around since 1988, has gained traction amid recent tariff regimes, particularly for higher-value consumer goods and luxury products. Companies must meet specific criteria, including multiple sales, independent parties, proof of U.S. destination, and documentation of the first sale price. Italian luxury fashion brand Moncler has noted the significant benefit of the first sale rule to its cost structure.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep serves as the brain's natural mechanism for cleaning out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, found that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. Excess build-up of these free radicals disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation, offering insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative conditions.
