          <p>S&P Global maintained its AA+ rating on long-term U.S. sovereign debt, anticipating that federal revenue from President Trump's tariff policies will offset revenue weakness from the tax-and-spending bill. While affirming the rating, S&P warned that rising deficits or political developments impacting American institutions could lead to a downgrade in the next two to three years. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on the dollar's status as the world's leading reserve currency if political factors undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. The Treasury Department reported a significant increase in customs duty collections due to Trump's tariffs, though the federal budget deficit also grew. (not investment advice)</p>

While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., North Carolina's Outer Banks are under storm surge and tropical storm warnings, with possible coastal flooding triggering evacuation orders. The storm was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane after previously reaching Category 5 strength. Coastal areas along the Eastern Seaboard are expected to experience dangerous rip currents and high waves, with officials urging people to heed warnings and avoid swimming. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a CNBC Fed Survey, President Trump is likely to appoint his economic advisor Kevin Hassett as the next Federal Reserve chair, although respondents believe Kevin Warsh is more qualified for the position. While Hassett leads as Trump's likely pick, Warsh is favored among respondents for his expertise, followed by Christopher Waller and James Bullard. Concerns were raised about Fed independence if Hassett is appointed, given the Trump administration's push for lower interest rates. The survey indicates expectations of two rate reductions this year, but also high inflation, suggesting the Fed will face challenges in balancing political pressure and economic realities.

          <p>Experts anticipate that mortgage rates this fall will be influenced by several factors, including the Federal Reserve's decisions, inflation and labor data, investment activity, and geopolitical changes. The Federal Reserve's commentary and projections are expected to impact mortgage rates, with potential rate cuts leading to lower mortgage rates. Inflation and unemployment data will also play a crucial role in the Fed's decisions, while investment activity in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds can influence daily rate fluctuations. Geopolitical uncertainty and economic changes can further impact mortgage rates, with experts predicting a slight decrease in rates by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commercial real estate facilities managers are prioritizing property resilience due to increasingly intense storms and costly damage, with technology playing a crucial role. Companies like Site Technologies are using drones to identify vulnerabilities in properties before hurricanes hit. The images captured by drones are analyzed by Site's artificial intelligence platform, which incorporates expertise from its staff and provides condition and risk reports for the exterior of each facility. The AI identifies how money should be spent over the next three to five years to ensure facilities are in good condition, allowing managers to focus on the highest-risk properties.</p>

          <p>Due to safety concerns, Israeli football clubs are playing their European matches in Serbia, as UEFA deems Israel unsafe for continental competition. Serbia maintains stable diplomatic relations with Israel and has a tradition of cooperation, making it a politically viable option. Serbia also maintains relative neutrality in conflicts and possesses the necessary sporting infrastructure. This arrangement reflects a broader trend of former Yugoslav republics hosting Israeli clubs in various sports, and is based in antipathy towards sporting sanctions for political or military actions.</p>
