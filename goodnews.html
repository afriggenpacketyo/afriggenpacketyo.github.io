          <p>An electric passenger plane has successfully landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) for the first time, marking a significant milestone in aviation history. The Beta Technologies aircraft, piloted by CEO Kyle Clark, flew from East Hampton to JFK with four passengers on board, covering approximately 70 nautical miles in just over half an hour. This achievement demonstrates the practicality and potential of electric air travel, offering quieter and more cost-effective transportation options. Electric aircraft are being considered for short city trips and could revolutionize urban commuting by reducing traffic and emissions.</p>

          <p>Baseball, a sport celebrated for its statistics, teaches valuable lessons about dealing with failure, as even the best hitters fail a majority of the time. The concept of a "perfect game" highlights the rarity of flawlessness, emphasizing the importance of accepting errors as part of the game. The author reflects on Clayton Kershaw's dominant no-hitter, marred only by a single error, and Lou Gehrig's grace in the face of a devastating illness. Embracing imperfections and learning from transgressions are essential for personal growth and success in life.</p>

          <p>Medication abortion, involving pills to end a pregnancy, now accounts for 63% of all abortions in the U.S. Self-managed medication abortion, obtaining abortion pills without a prescription and taking them without a doctor's oversight, has gained traction. Studies show self-managed abortions are safe and effective in the first trimester, leading organizations like the World Health Organization and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to support it. Telehealth prescriptions and hotlines provide support, but legal and political challenges persist, highlighting the ongoing evolution of abortion access.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband in 2001, has been exonerated after new evidence cast doubt on the original blood evidence presented at trial. The prosecution had claimed that blood found in the Dorotiks' bedroom was Bob Dorotik's, but subsequent testing revealed that some stains were not blood and others were never tested. After spending years in prison, Dorotik was temporarily released due to COVID-19, and the charges against her were eventually dropped due to insufficient evidence. The case highlights the importance of thorough investigation and reliable evidence in criminal trials.</p>
