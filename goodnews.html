        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season in 2025, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 becoming hurricanes and 3 to 5 intensifying into major hurricanes. This outlook is influenced by factors such as the neutral phase of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation cycle, warmer ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear. NOAA emphasizes technological advancements for more accurate forecasts and urges communities in storm-prone areas to prepare proactively. The agency's forecasting model, HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade to increase storm tracking accuracy by about 5%.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, exceeding expectations and reaching the highest level since January 2023, driven partly by rising rice prices. Headline inflation remained steady at 3.6%, staying above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled intentions to raise rates, while also closely monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs on the economy.</p>

          <p>Judith Hope Blau, known as the "Bagel Lady," passed away at 87 due to congestive heart failure. In the 1970s, she transformed stale bagels into art, creating necklaces, napkin rings, and more, eventually leading to a career as a children‚Äôs book author, illustrator, and toy designer. Her creations, inspired by her grandfather, a bagel baker, became popular, leading to a family business and collaborations with companies like McGraw Hill and Hasbro. Blau also designed dolls and bedding, and advocated for environmental education through her "Treetures" program.</p>

          <p>Amazon shareholders rejected a proposal to require the separation of the CEO and board chair roles, with about 82% voting against it. The proposal sought to codify the current structure, where Jeff Bezos is executive chairman and Andy Jassy is CEO. The Accountability Board argued that the split allows the board to focus on governance while the CEO focuses on business. Amazon urged shareholders to vote against the proposal, saying the current policy enables the board to determine the right leadership for the company.</p>
