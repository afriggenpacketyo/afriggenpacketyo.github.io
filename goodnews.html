          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 08:42:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uber has entered a major six-year partnership to deploy over 20,000 robotaxis, investing $300 million in electric vehicle maker Lucid. The deal also involves autonomous vehicle startup Nuro, which will develop the self-driving technology for the Lucid vehicles. This collaboration aims to launch a new fleet of purpose-built, Level 4 autonomous robotaxis in a major U.S. city starting next year. The move positions Uber to compete more directly with rivals like Waymo and represents a significant expansion into the autonomous ride-hailing market, causing Lucid's stock to surge following the announcement.

          <p>Two men who were wrongly convicted in the 1970s based on fabricated evidence from a corrupt British Transport Police officer have had their names cleared by the UK's Court of Appeal. Errol Campbell and Ronald De Souza were victims of Detective Sergeant Derek Ridgewell, who systematically framed young, predominantly Black men for crimes they did not commit. Mr. Campbell, who has since passed away, was jailed for theft, while Mr. De Souza was detained for attempted robbery. Their exoneration is part of a larger review that has so far overturned all 13 referred cases linked to Ridgewell's misconduct.</p>

          <h2>Disney's 70-Year Strategy of Integrating IP into Theme Parks Continues to Drive Profits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 08:31:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Disneyland celebrates its 70th anniversary, an analysis highlights how integrating intellectual property (IP) has been the cornerstone of Disney's successful theme park strategy. From early attractions based on classic films to modern lands dedicated to Star Wars, Marvel, and Avatar, the company has consistently leveraged its vast story catalog. This approach has turned the experiences division into a primary profit driver, with operating income far surpassing its content-centric entertainment unit. Despite some fan criticism over the replacement of classic rides, this IP-fueled strategy continues to broaden the parks' appeal and is central to a planned $60 billion investment over the next decade.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed its plan to lower the voting age to 16 for all UK-wide elections before the next general election, which must occur by 2029. This change, a key promise from the Labour party, will enfranchise approximately 1.5 million teenagers. The reform package also includes expanding the list of acceptable voter IDs to include bank cards and moving toward an automated voter registration system. The move aligns the entire UK with Scotland and Wales, where 16-year-olds can already vote in local and devolved parliament elections.</p>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars is adjusting its U.S. strategy to mitigate the impact of trade tariffs, announcing plans to produce its best-selling XC60 SUV at its South Carolina plant starting in 2026. Simultaneously, the company is phasing out its sedan and station wagon models in the U.S. market due to waning demand and unfavorable tariff conditions. The move is a direct response to U.S. tariffs on European and Chinese-made vehicles, which have forced automakers to reassess their product portfolios. The company's CEO affirmed their commitment to the U.S. market, emphasizing the need to fully utilize their American factory.</p>

          <p>DeFi Development, a firm aiming to emulate MicroStrategy's bitcoin strategy but with Solana, is expanding internationally by franchising its treasury model. Through its "DFDV Treasury Accelerator," the company will partner with regional entities to operate their own Solana treasuries, while DeFi Development retains an equity stake. This innovative approach has garnered support from major investors like Pantera Capital and comes amid a growing trend of companies adopting crypto treasury strategies. In addition to accumulating SOL tokens, the company will also acquire and stake validators to earn rewards on the network. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A DW fact-check debunks recent social media claims that using sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer. Health authorities and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this assertion; in fact, UV radiation is the primary cause of melanoma, and sunscreen helps protect against it. The article explains that the rising incidence of skin cancer in countries with high sunscreen use is misunderstood. This correlation is better explained by factors like increased awareness, better diagnostics, more time spent outdoors, and the use of older, less effective sunscreen formulas in past studies.</p>

          <p>An article from DW explores the science behind smartphone addiction and offers evidence-based methods to combat it. With the average person spending over four hours a day on their phone, problematic use is linked to mental health issues like depression and anxiety. Scientists recommend a multi-pronged approach, including creating physical distance from the device by leaving it out of the bedroom, reducing notifications, and using apps that limit screen time. The article emphasizes that these behavioral retraining techniques, similar to those used for other addictions, are most effective when used in combination to break the cycle of dependency.</p>

          <p>Russian authorities have announced the seizure of 1,800 pounds of cocaine, valued at over $153 million, that was discovered hidden within a shipment of bananas from Latin America. Russia's customs service and the FSB security service conducted the bust, which they called their largest of the year. The cocaine packages were found in a concealed compartment, disguised in briquettes with the label of a luxury fashion brand. This incident is part of a growing global trend where drug traffickers use banana shipments as a common method for smuggling large quantities of cocaine.</p>

          <p>The United States has constructed a new naval facility in Oyster Bay, Philippines, intended to enhance Manila's maritime defense capabilities amid rising tensions in the South China Sea. According to the U.S. embassy, the site will provide repair and maintenance services for small Philippine military watercraft and is not a formal U.S. military base. However, some analysts believe the facility will directly strengthen the Philippine Navy's ability to confront China and could pave the way for shared use of naval facilities by U.S. forces. The development signals deepening military cooperation between the two allies.</p>

          <p>For decades, a Kentucky resident nicknamed the "River Cowboy" has led a grassroots effort to remove thousands of discarded tires from the state's rivers. Russ Miller began his cleanup work in the 1980s after noticing the Red River was becoming a "conveyor belt of trash," and has since co-founded the group Friends of Red River. The article highlights the persistent problem of illegal tire dumping in rural areas, driven by a lack of convenient disposal options and historical habits. Despite the daunting scale of the pollution, Miller's dedication has inspired more volunteers and raised legislative awareness.</p>
