          <p>Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding has officially announced his campaign for Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District. He aims to succeed Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who recently stated he will not seek re-election in 2026. Harding, who positions himself as a husband, father, and businessman, launched his bid with a message focused on bringing Heartland values to Washington D.C. He received an endorsement from U.S. Senator Deb Fischer and praised the outgoing Rep. Bacon for his decade of service and integrity. Bacon, a moderate Republican known for his staunch support of U.S. aid to Ukraine, will complete his current term before retiring from Congress.</p>

          <p>Marking his first month in office, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung has emphasized his commitment to pragmatic diplomacy, pledging to swiftly improve relationships with both China and Russia. Lee stated that his priority is safeguarding peace and national interests, which involves not only maintaining a strong alliance with the United States but also restoring stable ties with its regional neighbors. This diplomatic overture has been met with a favorable response from Pyongyang regarding the suspension of loudspeaker propaganda. Furthermore, China has reportedly invited President Lee to a significant military parade in Beijing, a move that his office is currently considering as part of this broader diplomatic strategy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the modern American road trip, questioning whether its spirit of discovery has been diminished by technology and political polarization. The author, a professor who teaches a course on the topic, describes a personal cross-country journey where the experience felt insulated and predictable, a stark contrast to the literary adventures of Kerouac or Steinbeck. However, a stop in the small town of Shamrock, Texas, on the Fourth of July restores his faith. The warmth of an immigrant family running a motel and the shared, simple moment of watching fireworks with diverse travelers provided a profound reminder of shared humanity and the enduring, hopeful promise of the open road.</p>

          <p>A new musical subgenre, dubbed "toddler techno," is gaining popularity, with DJ Lenny Pearce hosting sold-out "baby raves" for children and their parents across the U.S. These events feature remixes of classic children's songs like "The Wheels on the Bus" with heavy electronic dance beats, creating an experience that bridges generational tastes. While some critics question the association with rave culture, many parents find the music more tolerable than traditional kids' songs, and experts note it can promote family bonding and joy. The events are carefully managed, with controlled sound levels and advice for parents on preventing overstimulation, reflecting a growing trend of adapting adult cultural experiences for a family-friendly audience.</p>

          <p>A coalition of tribal leaders, activists, and environmentalists is advancing a plan to restore a portion of California's historic Tulare Lake, which was drained for agriculture over a century ago. The proposal involves acquiring nearly 24,000 acres of farmland to create a reservoir and wetlands, providing flood protection for nearby towns and reviving critical wildlife habitat. For the Santa Rosa Rancheria Tachi Yokut Tribe, restoring the lake, known as Pa‚Äôashi, holds deep cultural and spiritual importance. While the estimated $1 billion project faces significant hurdles, including securing funding and landowner cooperation, supporters see it as a historic opportunity to rethink the region's relationship with water and adapt to climate change.</p>

Fogerty also discussed the enduring urgency of the anti-war anthem "Fortunate Son," expressing his complex feelings about its political use today.

          <p>Following his surprising Democratic primary win for New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani's platform has been labeled as radical, but this analysis argues his key policies are more tested than extreme. Proposals like a rent freeze on stabilized apartments, city-owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses have been implemented in various forms elsewhere with some success. For instance, rent freezes occurred three times under a previous NYC mayor, and publicly owned stores operate in several states. The article suggests that Mamdani's agenda is less about a sweeping ideological overhaul and more about using government to tangibly improve quality of life, a message that resonated strongly with voters seeking effective governance.</p>

          <p>This BBC Verify article examines three key claims surrounding President Trump's controversial "big beautiful bill." Regarding its cost, independent analyses, including from the Congressional Budget Office, contradict White House claims of deficit reduction, projecting it will add over $3 trillion to the national debt over ten years. On healthcare, despite Trump's assurances, studies show the bill would make significant cuts to Medicaid, with the Kaiser Family Foundation estimating a $1 trillion reduction over a decade, potentially causing millions to lose coverage. Finally, the article scrutinizes the president's claim that failing to pass the bill would cause a 68% tax hike, noting the White House did not provide a calculation for this specific figure.

As the nation's second carrier, following the retrofitted Soviet vessel Liaoning, the Shandong represents a significant step in China's military modernization and its ambition to project power beyond its immediate coastal waters.

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is making a notable return to international rugby after being called up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia. He will replace Elliot Daly, who suffered a fractured arm in a recent match. The decision is somewhat controversial, as Farrell has not played for England in nearly two years and has been sidelined with a concussion for nine weeks. Despite this, coach Andy Farrell, his father, cited Owen's extensive Lions experience and leadership qualities as key reasons for his selection. The move brings a seasoned veteran into the squad at a critical moment, though it has raised questions about overlooking other in-form players.</p>

The announcement follows comments from Saudi boxing official Turki Alalshikh, who also claimed the "Gypsy King" would return to the ring.

While some fans have found it works in devices like a PlayStation, many who purchased the physical media to listen to it are frustrated. The record label, Universal Music Group, has reportedly offered returns to affected customers. This issue follows Lorde's previous decision to forgo a CD release for her 2021 album due to environmental concerns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of being a glucose "dipper," where blood sugar crashes below baseline levels a few hours after eating carbohydrates, leading to fatigue, mood swings, and increased hunger. Research shows these dips can cause people to consume hundreds of extra calories throughout the day, potentially hindering weight loss. Experts suggest that individuals can manage these fluctuations without a continuous glucose monitor by paying attention to how they feel after meals. To stabilize blood sugar, nutritionists recommend "clothing" carbs by pairing them with protein, fiber, and healthy fats, spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day, and eating the protein and fiber components of a meal first.</p>

          <p>After a difficult spring marked by widespread flight delays and cancellations, Newark Liberty International Airport is showing signs of improved performance. The earlier problems, caused by runway construction and air traffic control outages, led to a 20% drop in passenger traffic in May. However, recent data indicates a significant turnaround, with Newark having fewer cancellations and better on-time departure rates than other New York City airports in June. This improvement is attributed to the completion of runway work and better equipment functionality. While many travelers remain wary from past experiences, the positive trend offers hope for a smoother travel season, though afternoon thunderstorms can still pose a challenge.</p>
