          <p>Fellow musician Tom Morello shared reflections on Ozzy Osbourne's final performance, suggesting the iconic Black Sabbath frontman, who died at 76, may have sensed his end was near. Morello described Osbourne's life as "on-the-edge," deeming his longevity a "miracle" given his lifestyle. Despite increasing frailty, Osbourne reportedly rallied to attend an afterparty and served as musical director for a benefit concert just weeks before his death, demonstrating his enduring passion. The article confirms Osbourne's official cause of death as cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and Parkinson’s disease, noting he was with family and surrounded by love.</p>

          <p>Fifteen young climate activists in Wisconsin, aged 8 to 17, have filed a lawsuit against the state, challenging its pro-fossil fuel policies. The lead plaintiff, Kaarina, shared her traumatic experience of being displaced by climate-exacerbated flooding, which inspired her involvement. The lawsuit targets two state laws that restrict the public service commission from considering air pollution when permitting new fossil fuel plants and from requiring increased carbon-free electricity. Represented by Our Children’s Trust and Midwest Environmental Advocates, the plaintiffs argue these laws violate their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and the public trust doctrine, amidst mounting climate impacts in Wisconsin.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court has ordered the release of Kilmar Ábrego García from criminal custody in Tennessee, enabling the Maryland father to finally return to his family. Ábrego García was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March, despite a 2019 court order, after the Trump administration incorrectly alleged MS-13 gang affiliation. Upon his return to the U.S. in June, he was charged with human smuggling, which his lawyers contend was a "vindictive and selective prosecution" for challenging the government's actions. His release, following a magistrate judge's order, represents a crucial step in his legal battle, with his criminal trial still slated for January.</p>

          <p>Intel shares rose significantly following reports that the Trump administration is preparing to take an equity stake in the chipmaker, with President Trump publicly stating the government should acquire approximately 10% of the company. While the White House indicated ongoing discussions and no finalized agreement, this move signifies a notable shift in U.S. industrial policy, where the government actively participates in corporate America. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the pursuit of a non-voting equity stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, as Intel adjusts its factory construction plans in Ohio due to market conditions.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, speaking at Jackson Hole, cautiously indicated that future interest rate cuts "may warrant" adjustments to policy, citing "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies that are altering economic risks. While acknowledging a resilient labor market, he noted rising downside dangers and the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation, presenting a complex challenge for monetary policymakers. Powell emphasized the Fed's ability to "proceed carefully" given the current restrictive policy stance and reaffirmed the central bank's commitment to its 2% inflation target, underscoring the importance of Fed independence amidst political pressure for cuts.

          <p>Canada announced it will remove many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, marking a significant de-escalation in trade tensions after Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump held their first call since a missed trade agreement deadline. Effective September 1, the tariffs on various products will cease, though 25% levies on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum will remain in place. This decision aims to restore free trade for most goods under the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA), which faces a review next year. The White House welcomed the "long overdue" move, indicating continued discussions on outstanding trade and national security concerns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines three often-overlooked factors that can reduce Social Security benefits for millions of American retirees, highlighting the importance of understanding these pitfalls for retirement planning. Firstly, working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an earnings test, temporarily reducing payments. Secondly, Medicare Part B premiums are automatically deducted, with high-income earners facing additional Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA) that can significantly increase costs. Lastly, federal income taxes can apply to up to 85% of benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds, surprising many retirees. The article suggests options like reverse mortgages, part-time work, or annuities to supplement income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are adapting to President Trump's increased tariffs, implementing creative strategies to avoid widespread price hikes for consumers. While some costs have been passed on, companies are diversifying sourcing, pushing back on vendors, and strategically managing discounts. Consumer spending has largely remained steady, though lower-income shoppers show more sensitivity to price changes. The article notes that while tariff costs are rising for retailers, the impact hasn't been as severe as initially feared, with many executives expressing a measured tone. Strong brands and new revenue streams, such as advertising and marketplace businesses, are proving crucial for weathering the uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Her journey highlights the interplay between physical travel and internal discovery, connecting her animist-leaning Quaker perspective to Japan's Shinto traditions.
