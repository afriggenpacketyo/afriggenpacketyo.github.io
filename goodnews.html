Jones will face Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares in November, while the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor remains undecided. Abigail Spanberger will run for governor against Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, marking a key race that will be seen as a referendum on the party in power in Washington. With a history of the party holding the presidency typically facing defeat in Virginia's statewide races, Democrats are positioned to make gains, although the state has become more of a swing state in recent years.</p>

The ruling allows individuals to choose their gender identity on passport applications, including selecting "X" for those who do not identify as male or female. This decision expands an earlier ruling and addresses a lawsuit filed by transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs who claimed the Trump administration's policy was discriminatory.

          <p>Tom Homan, the Trump administration's border czar, asserts that President Trump's policies have resulted in the most secure border in U.S. history, citing a record low of 95 illegal immigrant encounters in a single day. Homan contrasts this with the Biden administration, which he claims released the "vast majority" of encountered illegal immigrants into the U.S., while under Trump, zero were released in May. Homan advocates for the passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" to complete the job, including a major deportation operation. These claims highlight a trend since Trump's return to office, with significantly reduced releases of illegal immigrants compared to the Biden years.</p>

The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is around 31,512 yuan (US$4386), with more experienced roles commanding even higher wages. This stands in contrast to a subdued hiring landscape in other industries, where economic slowdown and corporate earnings pressure have led to layoffs and pay cuts.

While mobile species are expected to cope better, static creatures like sea pens may lose habitat, and the ocean quahog clam could struggle.
