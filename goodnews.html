The move contrasts with expectations for the broader retail sector, which is projected to see the lowest level of seasonal hiring since 2009. Amazon stated that these full- and part-time seasonal positions will offer an average pay of over $19 per hour.</p>

          <p>A significant prisoner and hostage exchange took place as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, signaling a major step toward ending the two-year war in Gaza. The initial phase of the deal saw Hamas return all remaining living Israeli hostages, while Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The exchanges prompted emotional reunions and celebrations in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. While this marks a crucial development, many challenges remain for the later phases of the peace plan, including disarmament and future governance.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has announced a new initiative to invest up to $10 billion over the next decade into companies crucial for U.S. national security interests. The plan targets four key areas: defense and aerospace, frontier technologies like AI and quantum computing, energy technology, and advanced manufacturing. CEO Jamie Dimon stated the move is a response to the U.S. becoming "too reliant on unreliable sources" for critical products. This initiative is part of a larger plan to facilitate $1.5 trillion in funding for these strategic sectors.</p>

          <p>The brokering of a ceasefire in Gaza is being framed as a significant diplomatic achievement for U.S. President Donald Trump, who took a victory lap at a peace summit in Egypt. The event, attended by numerous world leaders, celebrated the end of two years of intense conflict. However, this analysis piece suggests that while the first phase of the peace plan involving a hostage exchange has been successful, the next stages, including Hamas's disarmament and Gaza's reconstruction, present formidable challenges.

          <p>U.S. stocks saw a significant rebound, recovering from a sharp plunge on Friday after the president adopted a more conciliatory tone regarding trade with China. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% after investors were previously spooked by the announcement of a new 100% tariff on Chinese imports. Weekend comments suggesting that "all will be fine" helped ease fears of an escalating trade war, prompting a risk-on sentiment in the market. Analysts noted that while the immediate tension has lessened, the potential for future trade-related volatility remains a concern. (not investment advice)</p>
