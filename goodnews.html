          <h2>Boeing Shows Signs of Stabilization Under New CEO Kelly Ortberg</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 06:37:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over a year ago, Boeing is beginning to stabilize after a period of intense crisis, with company shares rising over 30% this year. The manufacturer has increased aircraft production and deliveries, and analysts anticipate it will report halved quarterly losses and potentially its first annual profit since 2018 next year. Despite these gains and improved relations with airline customers like Ryanair, Boeing still faces significant challenges, including an FAA production cap on the 737 Max and ongoing delays with other models. Ortberg's hands-on approach is credited with improving the company's culture and operational consistency.</p>

          <p>Following mediation talks in Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to end recent border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000. The agreement was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who chaired the ASEAN-led discussions. The conflict, which erupted after a landmine explosion, had led to diplomatic recalls and border closures. The deal came after international pressure, including from the United States, which warned that trade deals could be jeopardized if hostilities continued, signaling a significant step toward de-escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, showcasing the fine margins that define the championship battle with his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris.

          <p>An Iowa baby named Nash Keen, born 133 days early at just 21 weeks gestation, has been recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's most premature baby to survive. Nash, who weighed only 10 ounces at birth, recently celebrated his first birthday, defying immense medical odds. His survival is a testament to the advanced care provided at the University of Iowa Health Care Stead Family Children’s Hospital, which supports infants born as early as 21 weeks. Despite ongoing health challenges, including a minor heart defect and the need for a feeding tube, Nash is reportedly growing stronger with therapy.</p>

          <p>Chinese jewelry company Laopu Gold saw its shares fall despite forecasting a nearly threefold increase in net profit for the first half of 2025. The company, popular with younger consumers for its unique designs, also projected a significant revenue increase, attributing the growth to both online and offline expansion. However, the stock, which has surged over 2,000% since its listing last year, declined as investors appeared to lock in profits. Analysts suggest the drop is due to a reset in market expectations and concerns over rising gold prices, though some believe the company's valuation has become more attractive.

          <p>Skygazers are encouraged to look for meteors this week, as the Southern Delta Aquariids and Alpha Capricornids showers are set to peak on the night of July 29th. These showers offer a better viewing opportunity than the more famous Perseids this year, as the latter's peak in August will be obscured by a bright moon. While the Delta Aquariids may produce 20 to 30 meteors per hour, the Alpha Capricornids are known for less frequent but more spectacular "slow fireballs." For the best experience, viewers should find a dark location away from city lights after midnight.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, "Jeopardy!" champion and host Ken Jennings discussed his lifelong passion for general knowledge and his new book, "The Complete Kennections." He emphasized that trivia is not just about recalling facts but about making connections and fostering cultural literacy, a skill he believes is diminishing in a society of specialists. Jennings also expressed serious concerns about the rise of artificial intelligence, warning that over-reliance on AI could lead to the spread of misinformation controlled by a select few. He believes that fostering curiosity and a love for learning is the best way to counteract these modern challenges.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Carpool Detectives," chronicles the true story of four Los Angeles mothers who, with no law enforcement background, solved a decades-old double homicide. The women began investigating the mysterious deaths of an older couple during the COVID-19 pandemic, dedicating over two years to piecing together evidence that had stumped police. Their successful investigation, which involved navigating dead ends and earning the respect of law enforcement, has given them a new sense of purpose. The group is now tackling an even larger case involving a potential serial killer from the 1970s and '80s.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Renmin University indicates that the international use of China's yuan grew by approximately 11% in 2024, strengthening its position in the global financial system. While the U.S. dollar remains dominant, its influence slightly decreased, whereas the yuan now ranks ahead of the British pound and Japanese yen. The report suggests that promoting the yuan's internationalization is a key strategy for China to mitigate geoeconomic risks and reform the global monetary system. However, the rise of U.S.-backed stablecoins is identified as a potential threat to the currency's continued expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting in July 2026, Minnesota will require social media platforms to display a pop-up warning to users about the potential mental health hazards of prolonged use. The new law, the first of its kind in the U.S., aims to encourage more thoughtful engagement with social media, especially among young people. Supporters, including mental health advocates, see it as a crucial step in addressing rising rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm linked to social media. Tech industry group NetChoice opposes the law, arguing it compels private companies to carry the state's message and may pursue legal action to block it.</p>

          <p>Psychologists and nutrition experts are highlighting that some children have a naturally strong food reward drive, making them more susceptible to overeating ultra-processed foods. These children often feel hungry, eat quickly, and struggle with satiety signals, which can lead to health problems in an environment where such foods are ubiquitous. This article suggests that standard advice may not work for these kids and offers tailored strategies for parents. Recommendations include keeping ultra-processed foods out of the home, limiting variety, and teaching children to make healthier choices in social settings, rather than completely forbidding certain foods.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, former presidential contender Pete Buttigieg warned that the Democratic party should not aim to simply restore the government to its pre-Trump state. He argued that Democrats have been too attached to a status quo that was already failing many Americans, which contributed to their 2024 election defeat. Buttigieg believes that while the current administration is damaging key institutions, it is also wrong to assume those institutions were perfect before. He advocates for a forward-looking approach that embraces change and fundamentally rethinks how government agencies and policies should function to better serve the country.</p>

          <p>England has added fast-bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton to its squad for the final and decisive Test match against India at The Oval. The move provides cover for a pace attack that was heavily utilized during the drawn fourth Test in Manchester. Captain Ben Stokes noted the potential need for "fresh legs" due to the tight turnaround between matches and his own injury struggles. Overton, who has one previous Test cap, joins Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue as reserve pace options, with England needing to avoid defeat to secure a series victory.</p>
