          <p>This New York Times article reports that House Republicans made last-minute changes to their fiscal package, including a provision to provide $1,000 to newborns, which would be deposited into a "Trump account." Children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested on their behalf in financial markets. While the benefit of the initial investment is clear, the accounts have puzzled tax experts, as they function much like typical investment accounts rather than tax-advantaged accounts.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics, driven by restrictions on visas introduced by the Conservative government and the ongoing impact of the pandemic. There was a large drop in the number of students bringing family members to the UK, and the end of global travel restrictions caused people who delayed their intention to move away to finally go through with their plans. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said there had been a "300,000 drop in net migration since the election" and promised the government would "further reduce net migration."</p>

          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing from June 1, following a similar warning from Adidas about hiking costs due to US tariffs. While Nike did not explicitly cite US tariffs as the reason, the company stated it regularly makes "price adjustments". Almost all of Nike's goods are made in Asia, a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs. The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing more than $100, as well as clothing and equipment, while popular Air Force 1 trainers and children's products will be exempted.</p>
