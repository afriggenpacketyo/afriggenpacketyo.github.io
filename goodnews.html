          <p>A large, bright meteorite, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, was observed streaking across the sky in Georgia and South Carolina. NASA reported that the object, traveling at 30,000 miles per hour, eventually exploded over Georgia with the force of approximately 20 tons of TNT. This explosion created a significant pressure wave that resulted in loud booms heard by residents on the ground. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the event, which experts suggest could be part of the rare Beta Taurid meteor shower, making it a particularly uncommon daylight fireball sighting.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a neighborhood suffering from the urban heat island effect, a local environmental group is pioneering a "cool block" project to combat extreme temperatures. The initiative involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with lighter, heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. These measures are designed to cool the dense urban environment, where temperatures can be up to 20 degrees hotter than in greener areas. This project serves as an urban laboratory, providing a potential template for other cities to address rising heat waves and improve livability as climate change progresses.</p>

          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in the fashion world for over three decades, is transitioning from her direct editorial role at the U.S. edition of Vogue. The 75-year-old will remain Vogue's global editorial director and Cond√© Nast's chief content officer, but the American publication will recruit a new head of editorial content. This change aligns the U.S. version with other international editions of the magazine, which already have their own editorial heads.

He used his mother and a friend to cash campaign checks, and also set up a sham charity to embezzle funds.

The newly licensed treatment, taken as a twice-daily tablet, works by targeting a specific enzyme, allowing the immune system to function correctly. This breakthrough represents a remarkable journey from the discovery of a disease to the approval of a targeted, life-changing treatment on the NHS within just 12 years.</p>

While 90% of products sold in the U.S. are made domestically, many key ingredients like black pepper must be sourced from various international markets. Foley noted that the company has done a "nice job" managing the tariff impact so far and will continue to adapt its global sourcing strategies. He also highlighted that consumer demand for flavor remains strong, with at-home cooking levels still above pre-pandemic figures, which benefits the company's portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of retiree income reveals that upper-class households typically live on a monthly income ranging from $7,000 to $20,000. This income is generated from a combination of sources, including Social Security benefits, withdrawals from investment portfolios, and passive streams like rental income or dividends. While the median income for households over 65 is about $4,190 per month, the upper-class threshold is approximately double that, at around $8,380. The article emphasizes that for affluent retirees, achieving this lifestyle is not just about a savings number, but about building a comprehensive and sustainable monthly income plan.
