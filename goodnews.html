          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power effectively silenced them, Afghanistan's women's refugee football team is set to compete internationally again in the FIFA Unites: Women's Series. For the players, now living in countries like the UK and Australia, the tournament is more than about sports; it's a powerful act of representation for women whose rights have been stripped away in their homeland. The team's defender, Najma Arefi, describes it as a responsibility to be a voice for the silenced and to show resilience. This event marks a significant step toward their official recognition by FIFA and symbolizes hope and defiance against oppression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the week following a policy speech by Taiwanese President William Lai, whom Beijing has labeled a "troublemaker," China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has not conducted any major military exercises near the island. According to Taiwan's defense ministry, daily PLA sorties ranged from seven to 27, a significantly lower number compared to the large-scale drills seen in the past. For instance, a previous exercise in April involved 76 sorties in a single day as a "serious warning" to what Beijing considers independence forces. The current relative calm suggests a period of observation from Beijing rather than immediate military escalation.</p>

          <p>The British government has unveiled a comprehensive strategy to bolster the UK's clean energy workforce, promising the creation of 400,000 additional jobs by 2030. The plan aims to double employment in renewable sectors like wind, solar, and nuclear by targeting 31 priority occupations, including plumbers, electricians, and welders. Key initiatives include establishing five "technical excellence colleges" for specialized training and launching programs to match military veterans and ex-offenders with careers in the green economy. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the plan will bring well-paid, secure industrial jobs to communities across the UK and help lower energy bills.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece praises two federal district court judges for blocking President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The article highlights the judges' courage in ruling that the administration's rationale for the deployments was "untethered to the facts" and not conceived in good faith. The author contrasts these lower court actions with what they describe as the Supreme Court's craven deference to Trump, arguing that Judges Karin Immergut and April Perry demonstrated a vital commitment to constitutional law over martial law. The piece frames their rulings as a crucial defense of democracy against executive overreach.</p>

          <p>Amid a persistent cost-of-living crisis, UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has hinted that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills. While refusing to speculate on the upcoming November Budget, Miliband acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The potential tax reduction is one of several measures being weighed to provide financial relief to households facing high energy costs. Miliband also reiterated Labour's long-term pledge to lower bills by investing in home-grown clean energy to reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets.</p>

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, beneficiaries are advised to carefully review their options, with the added complication of an ongoing federal government shutdown.

It is recommended that individuals wait to finalize their 2026 coverage decisions until the government reopens to ensure they have all necessary information. The article also provides guidance on weighing the tradeoffs between original Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans, which now offer more detailed benefit information.</p>

          <p>As pickleball's popularity has exploded in the United States, so have related injuries, with a new study in JAMA Ophthalmology highlighting a dramatic increase in eye trauma. Researchers estimate that the incidence of injuries like corneal abrasions and lacerations has risen by approximately 405 cases annually from 2021 to 2024, with adults over 50 being the most affected group. The study's authors call for the development of standardized guidelines for protective eyewear, which can prevent up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries. They emphasize that despite the use of a lightweight wiffle ball, the fast-paced nature of the game on a small court creates significant risk.</p>
