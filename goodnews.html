This move places Meta among other tech giants like Microsoft and Nvidia that have seen their market valuations soar due to their advancements in AI.

          <p>A booming coffee culture in China is expanding beyond major cities and into the countryside, leading to a surge in rural and suburban cafes. This trend caters to a growing domestic demand, with China's coffee industry now valued at $42 billion and consumption expected to continue its rapid rise. Many new cafes leverage unique natural settings to attract social media-savvy customers.

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made adjustments to their roster following the departure of key role player Dorian Finney-Smith, who agreed to a four-year, $53 million deal with the Houston Rockets. Finney-Smith, an important defensive contributor for the team, had opted out of his contract with the Lakers. In response, the Lakers quickly signed forward Jake LaRavia to a two-year, $12 million contract. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing player, demonstrated strong shooting percentages with Memphis and Sacramento last season, providing the Lakers with a new option on the perimeter.</p>

          <p>The British government has launched a "landmark" review of its parental leave and pay systems, aiming to modernize policies for maternity, paternity, and shared leave. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated that the current system has not been seriously examined for decades and needs to better serve modern working families. Campaigners have praised the review, noting that the UK's statutory paternity leave is among the least generous in Europe and that many fathers cannot afford to take it. The review will examine the duration of leave and the statutory pay rates for new parents.</p>

His support is crucial for the legislation's passage in the narrowly divided Senate. The bill continues to face a marathon of amendment votes, with Democrats highlighting its cuts to social programs and its impact on the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has suggested that a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing the stock market by favoring innovative, idea-driven companies over established giants. He argues these investors are drawn to companies with bold visions, such as Robinhood's use of blockchain for trading private company stocks, and are less focused on traditional metrics like stock buybacks. According to Cramer, this has created an "idea market" where the narrative and potential of individual stocks like Reddit and DoorDash are valued more highly than broad market trends or Federal Reserve policies.

Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace helps keep prices stable, as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share. He also discussed the transformative impact of AI, predicting that most consumers will have robots in their homes within the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

However, analysts caution that prices are unlikely to fall much further and could be impacted by geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East. With bills still significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, consumers are encouraged to explore fixed-rate deals for more payment certainty, as the long-term outlook for energy costs remains unpredictable.

          <p>The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has removed producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list" after he paid over $630,000 to resolve a long-standing judgment. The dispute originated from his former company's failure to pay compensation and benefits to four writers for a television project that fell through in 2019. Being on the list effectively prevented WGA members from working with him, complicating his current film projects.
