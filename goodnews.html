          <p>Burberry has announced organizational changes that may lead to a reduction of 1,700 roles globally by 2027 as part of CEO Joshua Schulman's turnaround strategy to revive the brand. The cost-cutting measures across procurement and real estate are estimated to save ¬£60 million, adding to the ¬£40 million already announced in November. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future, while CFO Kate Ferry addresses the dynamic impact of potential U.S. tariffs on the company's diversified business.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the removal of all U.S. sanctions on Syria, aiming to provide the country a chance at greatness. This decision follows the toppling of the Assad regime by anti-Assad militia groups in December 2024, leading to the establishment of a transitional government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa. The U.S. sanctions, which were the most severe, had been hindering economic progress and aid efforts, according to the United Nations and other organizations.

          <p>President Donald Trump's policies, including tariffs and rhetoric against renewable energy, are injecting uncertainty into the U.S. clean energy sector. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, the sector faces potential headwinds from tariffs on imported components, particularly from Southeast Asia. While clean energy has grown significantly in recent years, Trump's focus on fossil fuels and attempts to halt funding for green energy projects could slow this progress. Analysts believe that clean energy will continue to grow, but at a slower pace, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to remain competitive in the global transition to cleaner energy sources.</p>

          <p>Climate data from oyster fossils challenges the belief that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period. Research indicates that the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere experienced seasonal temperature changes comparable to today, and polar ice was present. The findings suggest the Early Cretaceous greenhouse Earth had brief glacial periods. Applying these findings to the present day offers insights into climate change, as the world transitions from perennial glacier ice to seasonal ice or a 'blue' planet.</p>

          <p>British businesses are warning that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules will lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors reliant on migrant staff. The government's proposals aim to prioritize British workers, but businesses fear that they cannot fill the gap created by likely worker shortages. The care industry, which heavily relies on foreign workers, is particularly concerned about the impact of the new rules. Industry leaders acknowledge the importance of boosting training among British workers but emphasize the need for a responsive immigration system.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, setting the stage for their potential release after more than three decades for killing their parents.

The brothers' futures now depend on Governor Newsom and state parole officials, who will consider their eligibility for release.</p>

          <p>A group of white South Africans arrived in the U.S. as refugees, admitted under a program initiated by President Trump, who claims they face racist policies and a "genocide". However, this claim is disputed by South African officials and experts, who state there is no persecution of white Afrikaners. The situation is viewed by some as Trump positioning himself as a savior of white privilege and Christianity globally. The move has strained relations between Pretoria and Washington, particularly following South Africa's lawsuit against Israel at the International Court of Justice.</p>

The former employee also discussed how Palantir's culture and business practices fostered a founder-friendly mindset. The company instilled founder-friendly mindsets, such as telling employees to solve one customer's problem first because that solution could later be expanded to bring in more business.</p>

This plan would act as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and then shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from other countries providing oversight. Unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, this joint venture plan would be permanent, and President Trump has stated that a diplomatic resolution with Iran would make the region safer.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced their first month-to-month drop since October 2024, declining to an average of $5.12 per dozen in April. Despite the decrease, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu, which has wiped out flocks of egg-laying hens. President Donald Trump has focused on lowering egg prices, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing to help farmers improve biosecurity measures. The U.S. has also increased imports of eggs from other countries to stabilize the supply.</p>
