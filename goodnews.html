          <p>During a visit to Saudi Arabia, President Trump criticized Western intervention and nation-building efforts, urging Middle Eastern nations to chart their own destinies. He expressed a desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and for a nuclear deal with Iran, and Trump met with Ahmed al-Shara, the new leader of Syria, a former jihadist who led the rebel alliance that ousted Bashar al-Assad. Trump's remarks and actions during the trip signal a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy towards the region. The article explores the reactions to Trump's speech, including both praise from those who feel the U.S. has overstepped its role in the Middle East and concerns about the potential impact on human rights.</p>

          <p>Faced with a $12 billion budget deficit, California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing a pause on enrolling new low-income immigrants without legal status in the state's healthcare program starting in 2026. Those already enrolled would not be affected, but starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" would have to pay a $100 monthly premium. Newsom attributes the budget shortfall to economic uncertainty and federal tariff policies.

          <p>Following the Trump administration's decision to cut $450 million in grants to Harvard University, Harvard President Alan Garber will take a voluntary 25% pay cut. This action follows pledges from dozens of tenured professors to donate 10% of their salaries to support the university's legal challenge against the funding cuts. The dispute stems from allegations of pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment on campus, which the administration claims Harvard has failed to address.
