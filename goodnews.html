          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 18:00:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>GE Appliances is accelerating its plan to move its washer and dryer manufacturing from China to the United States, citing former President Trump's tariffs as a key factor. The company announced a $490 million investment in a new Kentucky plant, a move that is expected to create 800 new jobs in roles like engineering and supply chain management. While the company states the decision aligns with its long-term strategy of producing goods closer to consumers, executives acknowledged that the tariffs expedited the process. The new Kentucky facility is projected to be fully operational by early 2027.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Significant Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 17:59:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial concerns, former President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory to 'front-load' before tariffs took effect and some businesses absorbing initial cost increases to avoid losing customers. Additionally, the use of bonded warehouses and various tariff exemptions has kept the effective duty rates lower than the announced figures. However, experts warn that price increases could still materialize later in the year as these buffers diminish. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to lift a portion of the financial sanctions imposed on Syria, a move intended to help stabilize the country following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. The order terminates a 2004 program that froze Syrian government assets but keeps other sanctions in place, including those targeting reconstruction funds under the Caesar Act. The action directs the administration to evaluate further sanctions relief and review Syria's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. Syrian officials welcomed the decision, stating it opens the door for economic recovery and the return of displaced citizens.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has applied for a national trust bank charter with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. If approved, this would allow Circle to establish the First National Digital Currency Bank, enabling it to offer institutional custody services for blockchain-based assets and further integrate into the traditional financial system. The move follows a successful IPO for Circle and comes amid growing optimism for stablecoin regulation, such as the Senate's GENIUS Act. This proactive step aims to strengthen USDC's infrastructure and align with emerging U.S. financial regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

Many of these entrepreneurs, like a salon owner in Illinois, are motivated by a desire to create inclusive, safe spaces and have a positive impact on their communities.

          <p>Senator Mike Lee has withdrawn a controversial provision from the Republican spending bill that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in 11 Western states. The proposal, intended to create land for affordable housing, faced strong opposition from Democrats, conservation groups, and several fellow Republicans from states like Idaho and Montana. Lee stated he removed the measure because he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations like BlackRock. The removal marks a significant change to the bill as it navigates the Senate.</p>

The decision is part of a broader cost-saving initiative to ensure 'value for money,' as revealed in the annual report on royal finances. A single two-day journey on the train last year cost over ¬£44,000, and it was used on only two occasions. The Keeper of the Privy Purse stated that while it is a fond farewell, the monarchy must adapt and not be bound by the past.
