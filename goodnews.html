          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a controversial plan for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a project aimed at stimulating economic growth. The £2.2 billion privately-financed expansion involves converting the airport's northern runway for regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the government touts the creation of thousands of jobs and billions in investment, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local communities concerned about increased noise and carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial conducted by Ascletis Pharma in the US has indicated that its drug candidate, ASC47, can significantly boost the weight loss effects of semaglutide, a popular ingredient in drugs like Ozempic. In a 28-participant study, the combination therapy resulted in a 56% greater relative reduction in body weight compared to using semaglutide alone. The company also reported that ASC47 substantially improved gastrointestinal tolerability, with the incidence of vomiting dropping from 57% with semaglutide monotherapy to just 6.7% with the combined treatment.</p>

          <p>China has successfully built and tested the world's largest known radiation-proof robot, designed for maintenance tasks inside future nuclear fusion reactors, often called "artificial suns." The remote handling platform features three arms, with the main arm capable of lifting a 60-tonne payload with remarkable precision, positioning it accurately to within four millimeters. This advanced robotic system represents a significant step forward in China's pursuit of clean, near-limitless energy through nuclear fusion, surpassing the capabilities of existing robots used in the nuclear industry.</p>

          <p>Sea moss, a type of red seaweed, has become a popular superfood on social media, with influencers and celebrities claiming it improves skin, digestion, and energy. However, dietitians and health experts caution that there is little scientific research in humans to support these widespread claims. While sea moss is a good source of fiber, antioxidants, and minerals, these nutrients are also available in many other foods. Experts also warn of potential risks, such as the accumulation of heavy metals from contaminated waters and excessive iodine intake, which can affect thyroid function.</p>

          <p>Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn (DB), has appointed Evelyn Palla as its new chief executive to address persistent issues with reliability. Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder announced new punctuality goals, aiming for at least 70% of long-distance trains to be on time by 2029, up from the current rate of around 60%. The government plans to invest billions from a special infrastructure fund into the railway, with €10 billion earmarked for digitalization alone. The appointment of Palla, who previously headed DB's regional subsidiary, has been welcomed by the train drivers' union.</p>

          <p>Shares of India's Adani Group companies experienced a significant rally, with Adani Power surging nearly 20% after a five-for-one stock split became effective. The broader rally was also fueled by a decision from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which cleared the conglomerate of some allegations of stock manipulation and fraud that were made by short-seller Hindenburg Research in 2023. While SEBI's investigation into other allegations continues, the partial clearance has reportedly renewed investor confidence in the group's stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the 45th Ryder Cup approaches, analysts emphasize the critical importance of the opening Friday morning foursomes session for both Team Europe and Team USA. The US has chosen to start with the alternate-shot format, which has historically been a strong indicator of the overall match outcome and a format where home teams often dominate. For Europe to succeed, they will need to reverse their poor performance in recent away match foursomes. A strong start could quiet the home crowd and build crucial momentum for the visiting European team.</p>

Citing research that shows 70% of athletes feel climate change impacts their training and competition, he believes a collective rethinking of the international calendar is becoming inevitable.</p>
