          <p>Authorities in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of individuals missing after recent devastating floods, lowering the count from nearly 100 to just three. This positive development follows extensive verification efforts by local, state, and federal agencies, confirming that most of the initially unaccounted-for people are safe. The update provides a measure of relief to the community, although the overall death toll from the floods across Texas remains high at 134. The focus now shifts to recovery and supporting those affected by the disaster.</p>

          <p>Advanced consumer technology played a pivotal role in solving the 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Wisconsin. Her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was initially the prime suspect but was exonerated when data from his Fitbit tracker corroborated his alibi, showing minimal movement during the time of the murder. Investigators later identified another man, George Steven Burch, through DNA evidence found on the victim's clothing. Burch's location data from Google Dashboard then placed him at the crime scene, leading to his arrest and subsequent conviction for first-degree intentional homicide.</p>

          <p>Animal rescue organizations discovered more than 400 guinea pigs living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions at a home in South Los Angeles. Volunteers described a distressing scene with some animals found dead and others suffering from medical issues like ringworm and open wounds. The tenant, who was facing eviction, was reportedly unable to properly care for the large population of animals. Rescue groups are now urgently seeking public assistance for fostering, adoptions, and donations to cover medical care and supplies for the rescued guinea pigs.</p>

          <p>Players in the WNBA All-Star Game made a unified statement by wearing warmup shirts that read “Pay us what you owe us.” This protest was a direct response to the failure to reach a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the league. The players, who opted out of their last CBA, are seeking a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and improved benefits. The public demonstration highlights the growing tensions, with some players suggesting a potential walkout if a new agreement is not reached by October.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense to target individuals who are preparing for mass casualty attacks but do not have a clear ideological motive that would classify them as terrorists. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that the new law aims to close a gap that became apparent after incidents like the Southport attack. This legislation would grant police powers to apprehend and charge suspects for preparatory acts, such as researching a target, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. The goal is to ensure that plots for mass violence are treated with the same seriousness, regardless of the perpetrator's motivation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and help families struggling with "holiday hunger." However, opponents, including many teachers, emphasize the need for a long break to recharge and plan, while also questioning whether it would truly lower holiday costs. While some school districts have already moved to a five-week summer, a recent consultation in Wales showed the proposal remains highly divisive.</p>
