          <p>China's top chipmaker, SMIC, is projecting confidence in the face of a potential 100% U.S. tariff on chip imports, stating the impact on its operations would be minimal. Co-CEO Zhao Haijun explained that the company's production capacity is already fully utilized with demand exceeding supply, and its exposure to the American market is limited. Despite reporting a year-over-year decline in net profit, the company asserts that it has already helped clients build up inventory, anticipating a typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter.

          <p>Concerns over a potential price increase for Germany's beloved döner kebab have been alleviated following the settlement of a wage dispute at Birtat, a major producer of döner skewers. Strikes at the production plant had sparked fears among restaurant owners and consumers about a possible shortage of the essential meat component, which could have driven up costs. The resolution comes as a relief during the "silly season" of summer news, ensuring the continued availability of the popular street food at stable prices for the time being.</p>

Traveling at an incredible 130,000 mph, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will pass closer to Mars. The new observations have helped astronomers refine the size of its icy core to be no more than 3.5 miles across. The images reveal a teardrop-shaped plume of dust and a faint tail, offering a rare glimpse into a visitor from another star system.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to a significant error after he reported a boat of charity rowers near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, as "illegal migrants." Lowe had posted on social media about the "dinghies coming in," alerting authorities and vowing to ensure their deportation. It was later confirmed by the HM Coastguard that the crew was attempting to row from Land's End to John O'Groats for charity. In response to the mix-up, Lowe pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause.</p>

          <p>A 75-year-old plane owner in Southern California is at the center of a bizarre mystery after his 1958 Cessna Skyhawk was stolen, flown on joyrides, and then returned on multiple occasions. The owner, Jason Hong, discovered his plane missing, only for it to be found at a different airport. After he removed the battery to disable it, the plane vanished again and reappeared at another airfield with a new battery installed. Police are baffled by the case, which involves an unknown pilot with the skills to fly and maintain the aircraft.</p>

          <p>In a podcast conversation with Garry Kasparov, geopolitical strategist George Friedman argues for a realist, interest-based view of foreign policy, shaped by his family's experience fleeing Nazism and Communism. Friedman analyzes the current global landscape, suggesting Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a predictable, albeit failed, attempt to create a buffer zone and that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is militarily unfeasible. He interprets the Trump presidency not as incoherent, but as a disruptive force deconstructing an obsolete post-WWII system, predicting that this "storm" will ultimately lead to a calmer, reinvented America.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested a 22-year-old Iranian man in Birmingham suspected of being part of a criminal group smuggling people across the Channel in small boats.

The investigation began after a chaotic and deadly boat launch in April where five people, including a seven-year-old girl, were killed.</p>
