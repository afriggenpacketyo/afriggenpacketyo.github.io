          <p>The New York Knicks kept their season alive with a 111-94 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals.

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, won the 100th Scripps National Spelling Bee, defeating eight other finalists to earn over $50,000 in cash and prizes. The competition came down to Faizan, Sarv Dharavane, and Sarvadnya Kadam, with all three finalists misspelling words in the initial final round. After several rounds, Faizan correctly spelled "√©claircissement" to win the Bee, marking his success after being last year's runner-up. The first National Spelling Bee began in 1925, and this year's competition included 243 young spellers who qualified through local and regional bees.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man, Kell Morris, survived being pinned by a 700-pound boulder in an icy creek for three hours with only minor injuries, thanks to his wife's quick thinking and a stroke of luck. Morris's wife, Jo Roop, held his head above water to prevent him from drowning while waiting for rescuers to arrive after the boulder crashed onto him during a hike near Godwin Glacier. A sled dog tourism company overheard the 911 dispatch and offered its helicopter to ferry rescuers to the scene, which was inaccessible by all-terrain vehicles. After rescuers arrived, it took seven men and inflatable airbags to lift the boulder off him as he drifted in and out of consciousness.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for their approaches to welfare policies, accusing them of "fantasy economics." Badenoch argues that both leaders are engaging in a "race to the bottom" by considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy introduced by the Conservatives. She contends that this would force taxpayers to fund unlimited child support, which the country cannot afford. Her remarks come after Labour indicated it was looking at potentially scrapping the two-child benefit cap, while Reform UK has pledged to remove the cap without detailing how they would fund it.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's time in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is ending after 129 days marked by significant changes and controversy.

His presence also raised questions about conflicts of interest due to his companies' business dealings with the US government. Musk's tenure also saw the elimination of many USAID programs, reflecting the administration's "America First" approach, and his promotion of conspiracy theories sparked further controversy.</p>

Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, which were imposed after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
