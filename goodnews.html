          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership, citing concerns about due process. The article indicates that the ruling suggests skepticism among the justices regarding the fairness of the deportation proceedings, particularly under the Alien Enemies Act. The court has sent the case back to an appeals court to examine the migrants' claims and determine the necessary level of notice required for deportation challenges. The New York Times article also summarizes other news, including a blocked Republican megabill and a New Jersey Transit strike.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, dramatically reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second time ever for their Chicago office. The article describes the event, noting that winds of 60 to 70 mph carried dust from dry farmlands into the city, impacting travel and outdoor activities, such as a high school graduation ceremony. The dust storm caused ground stops at Midway International Airport and backed up expressways as drivers struggled with near-zero visibility. The article also includes personal accounts from residents who described the experience as "something out of the history books."</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge's case, charged with helping an undocumented immigrant evade ICE, has parallels with a Massachusetts case involving Judge Shelley Joseph, who allegedly helped an undocumented man escape through a back door. The article explains that Joseph faced federal charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice, but the charges were later dropped. The article discusses differing views on whether such cases represent federal overreach or necessary enforcement of immigration law. The NPR article explores the balance between a judge's prerogative in their courtroom and federal officials' authority to enforce immigration laws.</p>
