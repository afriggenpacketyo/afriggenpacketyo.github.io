          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 16:13:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are rushing to dealerships to capitalize on federal tax credits for electric vehicles before they expire at the end of September. The credits, $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones, were established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act but are being phased out by new legislation. This deadline has fueled a surge in EV sales, with dealers offering additional incentives to clear inventory. While September is expected to be a record sales month, industry experts are concerned about a potential sharp decline in demand once the credits are gone.</p>

          <p>In a significant change of stance, President Trump stated he believes Ukraine is now in a position to win back all of its territory from Russia. This declaration, made after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Ukraine should consider ceding land for peace. Trump asserted that the ongoing war is causing Russia significant economic trouble, making it appear like a "paper tiger" and creating an opportune moment for Ukraine to act. The statement came amid other administrative news, including a new probe into the White House border czar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly payments for home equity loans have slightly decreased, making them a more accessible source of funding for homeowners. The article provides calculated examples for a $40,000 loan over 10 and 15-year terms, comparing current costs to those from earlier in the year and the previous fall. It also contrasts these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), noting that while HELOCs currently offer lower payments, their variable nature introduces long-term financial uncertainty.

The new 24-hour store in New Baltimore offers a wide range of food, drinks, and fuel services. While the company's expansion has been met with excitement from many customers, it has also faced opposition from some local residents and business owners in various townships. Concerns raised include increased traffic, light pollution, and the potential negative impact on existing local businesses.</p>

          <p>A tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl is set to honor the late singer Minnie Riperton, half a century after her iconic song "Lovin' You" topped the charts. The event, featuring artists like Stevie Wonder and George Benson, celebrates the enduring influence of Riperton, who passed away from breast cancer at age 31. Despite her short career, her unique vocal style and serene musicality have left a lasting impact, influencing generations of artists from Prince to SZA. The concert aims to reintroduce her work to a new audience and solidify her place as an underappreciated icon of soul music.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after becoming trapped in a 9-foot-deep abandoned well in Pembroke, Maine. The animal was discovered by the landowner, who promptly alerted the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. A team of wardens and a biologist responded, sedating the moose before using an excavator and straps to carefully lift it out of the well. The entire operation took five hours, after which the moose, appearing unharmed, ran off into the woods once the sedation wore off.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) system starting in the 2026 season, officially bringing "robot umpires" to the highest level of the sport. The system will function as a challenge mechanism, with human umpires still calling balls and strikes but teams receiving two challenges per game to have a call reviewed by the ABS technology. The move, approved by MLB's competition committee, aims to improve accuracy and is expected to reduce ejections related to ball and strike disputes. The technology has been tested extensively in the minor leagues since 2019.</p>

          <p>A potential massive aircraft order from China is being viewed as a significant positive development for Boeing, according to financial analyst Jim Cramer. The deal is reportedly in the final stages of negotiation as part of a broader trade agreement between the U.S. and China. This follows a pattern where recent trade deals with countries like Japan, South Korea, and Qatar have included substantial orders for Boeing jets. The prospect of renewed business with China, a major market, is seen as a key reason for a bullish outlook on the company's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

His comments come amid an intense battle over the Fed's independence, with the administration attempting to reshape its board of governors.
