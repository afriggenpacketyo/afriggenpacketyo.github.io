          <p>Shares of South Korean semiconductor giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix surged dramatically after announcing a partnership with OpenAI for its Stargate initiative. SK Hynix's stock reached a 25-year high, while Samsung's hit its highest point since early 2021. The collaboration is set to scale up the production of advanced memory chips, such as HBM4, which are crucial for powering next-generation AI models and expanding data center capacity. The deal solidifies SK Hynix's leading position in the AI memory chip market and provides a significant boost to Samsung as it competes for dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's main stock index, the KOSPI, climbed nearly 3% to achieve a new record high, propelled by a major rally in its largest technology companies. The surge was led by Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, whose shares soared after they announced a significant partnership to supply advanced memory chips to OpenAI. This positive momentum in the tech sector overshadowed concerns about a slight increase in the national consumer price index. The performance of the KOSPI reflects strong investor confidence in the country's semiconductor industry and its central role in the global artificial intelligence supply chain.

          <p>A significant number of Chinese healthcare and biotechnology firms are seeking to go public in Hong Kong, capitalizing on a surge in investor interest in the sector. In late September alone, eleven companies, including well-known names like We Doctor Holdings and Betta Pharmaceuticals, filed for initial public offerings. This influx brings the total number of applications from the sector for the month to at least 23. The trend is bolstered by the strong performance of the Hang Seng Biotech index, which has more than doubled in value this year, signaling a robust recovery and high investor confidence in the industry's growth prospects.</p>

          <p>Dozens of hand-sewn American flags intended for Donald Trump's recent state visit to the UK had to be replaced at an estimated public cost of £52,800 because the red stripes were the wrong shade. According to a government supplier, the U.S. embassy objected to the standard red used, requesting a brighter "cherry red" instead. This resulted in the procurement of 66 new flags for display along the Mall and at Windsor Castle. The incident highlights the meticulous and costly diplomatic preparations involved in hosting a state visit, particularly one for a sitting U.S. President invited for an unprecedented second time.</p>

          <p>Online fast-fashion retailer Shein is expanding into physical retail by opening its first permanent outlets in France. The company will establish "shop-in-shop" concessions within major department stores, starting in Paris before expanding to five other French cities. This move marks a significant strategy shift for the primarily e-commerce brand, which has previously only used temporary pop-up stores. Shein stated that it chose France's influential fashion market as a natural testbed for physical retail, aiming to revitalize city centers while facing ongoing criticism regarding its environmental impact and labor practices.</p>

          <p>The upcoming PFL lightweight title rematch between champion Usman Nurmagomedov and challenger Paul Hughes is being hailed as one of the most significant fights in the promotion's history. Their first encounter in January was a dramatic, back-and-forth battle that saw the undefeated Nurmagomedov pushed to his limit before winning by unanimous decision. Commentator and former fighter Dan Hardy highlighted the Northern Irishman's confidence as a key factor that unnerved the champion. The rematch, set for Friday in Dubai, is expected to be a world-class contest, with analysts anticipating a more wrestling-focused strategy from Nurmagomedov.</p>

          <p>Paris is experiencing a boom in authentic Chinese restaurants, driven by a new generation of establishments catering to a younger, more diverse clientele. These restaurants are moving beyond traditional Cantonese fare to offer regional specialties, such as the seasoned meat skewers known as kaochuan from northeastern China. Establishments like Tonton Mao are focusing on authenticity, even flying in chefs from specific regions in China to replicate traditional flavors accurately. This culinary expansion is diversifying the city's food landscape, introducing Parisians and tourists to a wider array of genuine Chinese cuisine in settings that evoke different eras of Chinese history.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has put forward a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances and fund improvements. Thames Water, which serves a quarter of the UK population, has faced severe criticism and massive fines for sewage discharges and leaks. The investors' plan aims to rebuild the company without taxpayer funding, contingent on achieving more realistic performance targets set by the regulator, Ofwat.</p>

          <p>Despite unprecedented success, including an FA Cup win and a strong start to the Premier League season, Crystal Palace faces uncertainty regarding the future of its manager, Oliver Glasner. The Austrian coach's contract expires at the end of the season, and he has yet to sign an extension offered over the summer, reportedly waiting to assess the club's commitment in the transfer market. With key players also potentially leaving, there is concern that the architect of the club's transformation may depart. While the club hopes to persuade him to stay, sources suggest Glasner's ambitions may not align with the club's transfer strategy.</p>

          <p>Switzerland's Defense Minister, Martin Pfister, is urging lawmakers to relax the country's strict arms export laws to enhance international security cooperation. He warned that the current restrictive stance, which has blocked the re-export of Swiss-made weapons to Ukraine, undermines trust with security partners. The proposed revision to the war materials act aims to make Switzerland a more reliable partner while addressing emerging threats like cyber attacks and drone incursions. The minister emphasized the need for improved defense capabilities and stable relationships with other armed forces, particularly as a neutral, non-NATO country potentially vulnerable to external pressures.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda made landfall in Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, bringing powerful winds and heavy rainfall to the island before weakening to a Category 1 and moving further into the Atlantic. As of early Thursday, the storm's center was moving away from the archipelago, with sustained winds of 90 mph. Forecasters expect Imelda to continue weakening and transition into an extratropical cyclone. While a hurricane warning remained in effect, there were no immediate reports of significant damage from the storm, which was predicted to drop 2 to 4 inches of rain. Swells from Imelda are also causing life-threatening surf conditions along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

The project aims to advance embodied intelligence technologies for deep-space exploration, as these underground lava tubes are considered prime locations for establishing future human bases on the moon due to their protection from radiation and extreme temperatures.</p>

          <p>Major European defense contractors like Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall have welcomed the political momentum behind creating a multi-layered "drone wall" to protect the EU's eastern border from Russian threats. The initiative follows a series of airspace incursions by suspected Russian drones into several NATO countries. Defense firms say they stand ready to contribute to the collaborative effort, which would involve a network of radars, sensors, and countermeasures. While the plan is seen as a crucial step to address a rapidly growing security challenge, some experts express concern that bureaucratic delays could hinder its implementation at the required speed.</p>

According to Wolf, a breakthrough scientist seeks a novel, unlikely truth, whereas today's AI aims for probable, consensus-based outputs.
