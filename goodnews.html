          <p>Amazon reported mixed first-quarter results, with slower overall sales growth since the pandemic's peak, particularly in its North American retail business. Sales rose 9% to $155.7 billion, while profit increased 64% to $17.1 billion. The company expects sales between $159 billion and $164 billion for the current quarter, with operating profits potentially shrinking. CEO Andy Jassy noted that tariffs and trade policies add uncertainty to forecasts, and the company is focused on managing prices. The article also highlights the growth in Amazon's cloud computing and advertising sectors, while noting challenges related to data center capacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to hold intense ministerial-level tariff talks around mid-May, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal soon. Following meetings in Washington, Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa reported "progress" in discussions on nontariff barriers, bilateral trade expansion, and economic security cooperation. Japan is expected to offer proposals to increase purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and simplify the screening process for imported cars. The U.S. has prioritized striking early tariff deals with Japan, India, and South Korea to gain leverage over China in the Indo-Pacific region, and the Trump administration's new tariffs on goods imported from Japan have been paused until early July.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio, the former senator from Florida, has accumulated four titles in the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Acting Archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration, and Interim National Security Advisor. This unusual accumulation of roles raises questions about Rubio's ability to effectively manage all responsibilities. The article notes that Rubio's close relationship with Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, may have contributed to his appointment to these positions. The situation has sparked debate regarding potential conflicts of interest and the practicality of one individual leading multiple government bodies.</p>

          <p>As President Trump pushes for a second baby boom, more couples are choosing a life without children, citing various reasons. These reasons range from lifestyle factors to concerns about climate change and career priorities.

          <p>Venmo is showing momentum in the peer-to-peer payments market, while Cash App has hit a rough patch, according to recent quarterly results. Venmo's revenue jumped 20% in the first quarter, driven by growing adoption of features like the Venmo debit card and integration into online checkout. PayPal is focused on monetizing Venmo as a key part of its turnaround plan. Meanwhile, Block, the parent company of Cash App, reported disappointing revenue and guidance, causing its stock to plummet. Venmo and Cash App are competing to attract more consumers and add services to monetize their user base.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will be manufactured in India. This shift aims to mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese-made goods. Apple has relied on Chinese factories for years, but the tariff situation has forced the company to rethink its strategy. Vietnam will be the primary country of origin for iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPod products sold in the U.S. Despite the shift, China will remain a key manufacturing hub for Apple products sold outside the U.S.</p>

          <p>Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks discussed the toy maker's efforts to diversify its supply chain and adapt to President Trump's tariff hikes on China. Hasbro aims to source 40% of its global production outside of China by the end of 2026, and the company has shifted some manufacturing to countries including the U.S., Turkey, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Despite diversification efforts, China will remain an important place for Hasbro to source products. While Cocks expects prices to go up, he believes that the increases might be lower than peers because of "sourcing flexibility."</p>
