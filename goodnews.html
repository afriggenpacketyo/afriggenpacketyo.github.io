          <p>Exit polls indicate that liberal candidate Lee is poised to win South Korea's presidential election. The election comes after the previous president was impeached for trying to overturn the constitution, shaking public confidence in democracy. Lee maintained a lead over his conservative opponent throughout the race, but has faced allegations of corruption which allowed the Conservative Party to close the gap. The election outcome is significant for the future direction of South Korean politics and its relationship with neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>Nutrition experts have compared the nutritional benefits of tacos and sliders, offering tips for healthier preparation. Both tacos and sliders can be part of a healthy diet with careful planning and portion control. Tacos are generally considered the healthier option due to the ease with which they can be made with fresher, whole, and leaner ingredients, such as lean proteins, whole-grain shells, and fresh toppings. The experts recommend using soft corn tortillas and lean meats to keep tacos on the healthier side.</p>
