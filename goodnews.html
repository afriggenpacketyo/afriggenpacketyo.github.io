          <p>A 2008 public service announcement featuring Hilary Duff discouraging the use of the word "gay" as an insult has become a cult classic, resonating with a generation that grew up watching it on television. The "Think B4 You Speak" campaign, spearheaded by GLSEN, aimed to combat ambient anti-LGBTQ language, and Duff's ad, along with a similar one featuring Wanda Sykes, gained traction on social media and linear TV. Data suggests the campaign made inroads in curbing the term's use, with GLSEN's 2021 school climate survey showing a decrease in students hearing "that's so gay." The article highlights the ad's impact on LGBTQ+ representation and allyship, noting its continued relevance in media and culture.</p>

          <p>The recent approval of lenacapavir, a highly promising HIV prevention drug, in the US is being overshadowed by concerns that budget cuts to public health agencies and global aid programs could undermine efforts to end the HIV epidemic. Experts worry that these cuts will limit access to the drug for vulnerable populations, such as low-income individuals, gay and bisexual men, and sex workers. The Trump administration's cost-cutting measures have affected key agencies like the NIH and CDC, as well as global initiatives like USAID and PEPFAR. These changes could reverse progress made in combating HIV both domestically and internationally.</p>
