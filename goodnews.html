          <p>This article analyzes the recent U.S.-China trade truce reached in Geneva, cautioning against excessive optimism as it may only be a temporary respite in a larger trade conflict. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged the prior escalation as an embargo, signaling the need for sustained dialogue. The agreement includes a rollback of tariffs to 30%, a temporary lifting of China's rare earth export curbs, and a pledge for continued talks, but the underlying trade relationship remains fragile. The author emphasizes that businesses should use this window to fortify supply lines and diversify strategies to reduce dependence on China, as the back half of the trade storm could be severe.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's plan to restructure in a way that maintains non-profit control has received the endorsement of SoftBank, a major investor, contingent on the restructure being completed by the end of the year. This endorsement is crucial as SoftBank's $30 billion investment hinged on this structural change, however, Microsoft, another significant investor, has yet to approve the plan. The proposed restructuring involves the non-profit arm retaining control while the limited liability company transitions into a public benefit corporation, allowing for profit generation alongside social good.

          <p>New research from Dutch scientists indicates that the universe may end much faster than previously estimated, revising the timeline from 10 to the power of 1,100 years to 10 to the power of 78 years. The scientists calculated the evaporation time of white dwarf stars based on Stephen Hawking's theory of radiation, extending it to other celestial bodies. This research also aligns with recent findings suggesting that dark energy, which drives the universe's expansion, may be weakening, potentially leading to a "Big Crunch."

          <p>The article discusses the resurgence of gold as a safe-haven asset, driven by economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and trade wars. Consumers and central banks are increasing their gold holdings, with demand growing so much that traders are sending gold bars from London to the U.S. to meet demand. Despite recent price declines, analysts expect gold prices to continue rising, with factors such as central bank buying and trade tensions pushing bullion prices higher. The article highlights the metal's appeal as a stable and universally recognized asset in times of economic and political instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan conducted its first test of new US-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), marking a significant step in bolstering its asymmetric defenses against China. A total of 33 rockets were fired from 11 HIMARS at Jiupeng military base, showcasing the system's capability to counter coastal landing strikes. The HIMARS, which have a range of up to 70km, are expected to play a critical role in any potential conflict with mainland China, enhancing Taiwan's defense capabilities amid increasing tensions.</p>

          <h2>India's Inflation Rate Continues to Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 06:44:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's headline inflation eased to 3.16% in April, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline, driven by a dip in food inflation to 1.78%. This figure is lower than both March's data and economists' expectations, indicating a continued trend of moderating prices. Despite concerns that rising gold prices could push core inflation higher, food prices are expected to remain stable, contributing to overall economic stability. The ongoing decline in inflation provides a positive outlook for the Indian economy, though potential risks from global trade tensions remain.</p>

          <p>The United States has returned 25 rare smuggled artifacts to Egypt, including sarcophagus lids, a Greco-Roman portrait, and parts of Queen Hatshepsut's temple, following a three-year recovery effort. The collection spans centuries of Egyptian civilization and includes jewelry, figurines, and a gold coin dating back to Ptolemy I. The artifacts were seized in separate investigations and held at Egypt's consulate in New York before being returned to Cairo. While details of how the artifacts left Egypt remain unclear, the return underscores ongoing efforts to combat looting and trafficking of cultural heritage.</p>
