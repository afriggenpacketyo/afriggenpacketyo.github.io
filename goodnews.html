          <h2>Tesla Stock Rebounds After Trump-Musk Conflict Caused Significant Drop</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla shares experienced a climb in premarket trading following a significant drop fueled by tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts cited a report that Trump had scheduled a call with Musk to broker a truce, though the White House denied these plans. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives suggested that reconciliation between Musk and Trump would benefit Tesla shares, which he believes were oversold due to the conflict. Investors are closely monitoring the situation as Musk and Trump's relationship impacts market sentiment.</p>

          <h2>Resentment: The Silent Relationship Killer and How to Address It</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Resentment, a silent weapon in relationships, stems from perceived wrongs and broken expectations that are not addressed, leading to bitterness. Experts say that resentment often arises when one feels inferior or experiences repeated injustices, causing them to harbor negative emotions without taking action. Over time, resentment can grow into contempt, leading to detachment, passive-aggressive behavior, and a desire to undermine the other person. To address resentment, experts recommend communicating needs directly, focusing on feelings without blaming, and finding solutions to preserve and improve the relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was overshadowed by Trump's spat with Elon Musk, yet it was considered a success for Merz. Analysts suggest the distraction may have helped Merz avoid controversial topics during the meeting. Merz addressed strengthening relations between the U.S. and Germany, tariffs, U.S. support for Ukraine, and NATO defense spending with Trump. Merz also gifted Trump his grandfather's birth certificate, highlighting the familial connection between Trump and Germany.</p>

Researchers are also exploring new materials and designs to climate-proof infrastructure for the future.</p>
