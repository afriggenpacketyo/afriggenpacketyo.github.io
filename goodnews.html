          <p>Anticipation for Christopher Nolan's next film, "The Odyssey," has prompted Universal Pictures and Imax to release tickets for select screenings a year before its July 2026 premiere. The advance sales are for Imax 70mm showings in 16 theaters across the U.S., with several locations selling out almost immediately. This marketing strategy capitalizes on the immense hype for the star-studded adaptation of Homer's epic and the proven box office success of the premium Imax format, which was instrumental in the nearly $1 billion global gross of Nolan's previous film, "Oppenheimer."</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults, after he experienced mild swelling in his legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that a comprehensive examination, including ultrasounds, confirmed the benign condition and ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The diagnosis occurs when leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing pooling and swelling. Leavitt also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, asserting that he remains in excellent overall health.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other board members have settled a shareholder lawsuit related to the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The class-action suit, which sought $8 billion, alleged that company leadership failed to disclose the risks of user data being misused and violated a 2012 FTC consent order by sharing personal data without consent. The settlement was reached just one day after the trial began and ahead of testimony from Meta board member Marc Andreessen. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, and Meta declined to comment on the agreement.</p>

          <p>NBCUniversal has agreed to a proposed $3.6 million settlement with Los Angeles County to resolve allegations that its Peacock streaming service violated consumer protection laws. The legal action stemmed from consumer complaints that the service made it difficult for subscribers to cancel and did not clearly disclose its auto-renewal terms. As part of the settlement, Peacock will pay civil penalties and fund consumer protection enforcement. The company must also make its subscription and cancellation policies more transparent and provide an easy, immediate method for customers to terminate their service without obstructive additional steps.</p>

          <h2>Cultural Critics Analyze the 'Princess Treatment' Trend and Its Regressive Undertones</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 14:58:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The viral "princess treatment" trend on TikTok, where women expect partners to perform all manner of services from ordering their food to paying their fines, is sparking a debate about modern relationship dynamics. This article explores how the trend, while often playful, promotes a high-maintenance and passive role for women, framing traditional gender norms as a form of empowerment. Relationship experts suggest these expectations may be an extreme reaction to the poor treatment many women have experienced or witnessed. However, they also warn that such transactional tests can hinder genuine connection by reducing dating to a series of self-focused demands.</p>

          <p>The FDA has announced a recall for over 67,000 cases of Power Stick roll-on antiperspirant deodorants due to manufacturing defects. The recall, initiated by manufacturer A.P. Deauville, affects three specific products: Power Stick for Her Powder Fresh, Power Stick Invisible Protection Spring Fresh, and Power Stick Original Nourishing. The issue is cited as deviations from "current good manufacturing practices," a set of guidelines for pharmaceutical production, though the specific nature of the defects was not detailed. The recalled products were sold nationally across the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the TSA's rules on carrying liquids in carry-on bags may soon be revised. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning the current 3.4-ounce limit and that a new announcement on liquid sizes could be forthcoming. This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, enhancing security while potentially allowing for more relaxed rules.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a warning that children under seven should not consume shop-bought slushy drinks due to the health risks associated with glycerol. This sugar substitute, used to create the slushy texture, can cause headaches, sickness, and in some cases, more severe effects like shock in young children if consumed in large amounts. The updated guidance also recommends that children aged seven to ten should limit their intake to one small slushy per day. The FSA is advising vendors to use minimal amounts of glycerol and to display written warnings at the point of sale.</p>

          <p>Disneyland is celebrating its 70th anniversary, marking seven decades since it revolutionized the amusement park industry with its immersive, story-driven attractions. The Southern California park, which opened on July 17, 1955, has grown from a former orange grove into the world's second-most visited theme park. The summer-long celebration includes the debut of a new show with a lifelike Walt Disney animatronic and the return of the popular "Paint the Night" parade. Despite a famously disastrous opening day, the park's focus on detailed storytelling continues to define the Disney brand and its global resorts.</p>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb and its partner Pfizer will begin selling their blockbuster blood-thinning medication, Eliquis, directly to patients at a significant discount. The move, which offers the drug at a 40% discount to its list price through a support program, allows the companies to bypass pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Analysts believe this direct-to-consumer model may not negatively impact the companies' net pricing, as the drug is already heavily rebated to these middlemen. This strategy could also curry favor with the Trump administration amid ongoing threats of drug pricing reform and tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, stating it would share details on new innovations soon, the news caused ADM's stock to drop by as much as 6% in premarket trading. The Corn Refiners Association warned that such a switch would cost American manufacturing jobs and increase foreign sugar imports, while the CEO of rival PepsiCo noted that a government strategy to make sugar more affordable would facilitate such a transition.
