          <h2>DNA Analysis of 9,000-Year-Old Skeletons Suggests Matrilineal Society in Neolithic Turkey</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 04:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Genetic analysis of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey has provided strong evidence of a matrilineal social structure. Researchers found that individuals buried under the same house were often related through their mother's side, suggesting that men moved in with their female partner's family. This finding, published in the journal Science, supports long-held archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. The study also noted that grave goods were significantly more abundant with female remains, further indicating an elevated societal status for women in one of the world's oldest inhabited places.</p>

          <p>The top flight of English domestic rugby, newly rebranded as the 'Prem,' will begin its 2025-26 season with a Thursday night fixture for the first time in its history. The opening match will see Sale Sharks face Gloucester on September 25, kicking off a season that aims to attract a younger audience with a more informal branding. The opening weekend's schedule is adjusted to avoid a clash with the Women's Rugby World Cup final, with no matches scheduled for Saturday. The move to a midweek opener follows a similar decision by the men's Six Nations, signaling a shift in scheduling for major rugby competitions.</p>

          <p>British pub chain JD Wetherspoon has reported a 5.1% increase in like-for-like sales over the past three months, with total sales volume now surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The company highlighted strong performance in draught sales, with Guinness being a 'standout performer,' alongside a significant rebound in demand for breakfasts and chicken dishes. Despite facing a projected £60 million hit from higher labor costs and other business expenses, the company expects to meet its annual profit forecasts. Wetherspoon also announced plans to continue investing in its existing pubs and aims to open an additional 30 locations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal is set to debut new midfielder Martin Zubimendi, a highly-rated 26-year-old from Spain, after completing a £60 million transfer from Real Sociedad. The deal was reportedly orchestrated a year in advance, with manager Mikel Arteta praising the club's long-term planning to secure both Zubimendi and his former teammate Mikel Merino in consecutive years. Zubimendi, who was a key player in Spain's Euro 2024 victory, stated that Arteta's meticulous coaching style was a major factor in his decision to join the Premier League club. He is expected to play a crucial role as a number six, bringing balance and passing prowess to the team's midfield.</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate held steady at 0.8% in June, remaining at its lowest point in over four years and coming in below economists' expectations. Core inflation, which excludes volatile transport and accommodation prices, was also unchanged at 0.6%. These soft figures provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with room to potentially ease its monetary policy to support the nation's export-dependent economy amid an uncertain global trade environment. The MAS has expressed concern about a subdued domestic growth outlook for the second half of the year as global consumption is expected to soften. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies like LVMH, Celine, and Giorgio Armani have recently launched coffee shops within their retail locations in cities like Shanghai and Beijing. This trend, dubbed 'retail-tainment,' aims to create a more engaging environment and encourage longer visits at a time when consumer spending is sluggish. Analysts note that the high profit margins on beverages and the relatively low operating costs of cafes make it a cost-efficient marketing tactic for these high-end retailers.</p>
