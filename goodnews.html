        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of ether has surged, outperforming bitcoin, as Congress passed the GENIUS Act, a significant piece of stablecoin legislation now awaiting the president's signature. This bill is considered the first major crypto-focused law in the U.S., a development that has boosted investor confidence and led to record inflows for ether-based ETFs. Analysts note that momentum may be shifting from bitcoin to ether, which has seen its strongest two-week gain since 2021. The legislation is seen as a symbolic victory that could deeply embed stablecoins into the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a major stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the Stabroek Block oil development. Exxon, which disagreed with the interpretation but respected the ruling, will now partner with Chevron in the venture. The resolution of this high-stakes dispute removes significant uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Consumer Inflation Expectations Fall to Pre-Tariff Levels, Michigan Survey Shows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 13:30:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent University of Michigan survey indicates that consumers' fears about tariff-driven inflation have subsided, with outlooks for the next one and five years falling to their lowest levels since February. The one-year inflation forecast dropped significantly to 4.4% from 5% in the previous month, while overall consumer sentiment saw a slight increase. This suggests that while consumers still perceive future inflation risks, they may view the impact of tariffs as temporary. The data provides an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve, as well-anchored inflation expectations are a key factor in monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite leading the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers face significant challenges as they enter the second half of the season. Key questions revolve around the health of their pitching staff, particularly the ability of starters like Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell to stay on the field and key bullpen arms to return from injury. Another major uncertainty is how the team will manage Shohei Ohtani's return to pitching and whether he can handle a full starter's workload. The team also needs its star hitters, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, to break out of slumps to ensure the offense performs to its potential in the postseason.</p>

          <p>This article explains how retirees on Social Security can qualify for credit card debt relief, a growing concern as fixed incomes struggle to keep up with inflation. While being on Social Security doesn't disqualify individuals, eligibility for programs like debt management, consolidation, or settlement depends on demonstrating financial hardship and having some capacity to make payments. The article notes that options like debt management plans or credit card hardship programs often align well with the realities of a fixed income. It emphasizes that Social Security income is protected, providing a stable foundation for pursuing a viable debt relief strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the airline industry shows that Delta and United are significantly outperforming their competitors, accounting for over 86% of the profits posted by the seven largest U.S. airlines last year. Both carriers have successfully weathered a challenging market by focusing on premium travel, international routes, and lucrative loyalty programs. While the industry as a whole faces pressure from falling domestic airfares and weaker demand, Delta and United's strategies have provided a buffer. Their CEOs have expressed confidence, pointing to the strength of their premium cabins and partnerships as key drivers of their continued success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the life and work of Andrea Gibson, the late poet laureate of Colorado, who passed away on Monday. It highlights Gibson's career, which began in spoken-word and evolved to a significant online presence, particularly on Instagram, where their work reached a broad audience. The piece praises Gibson's accessible and emotionally direct style, which centered on themes of love, queerness, and anxiety. It argues that by prioritizing a direct connection with the listener, Gibson's unashamedly sentimental and gentle verse resonated deeply with people who might not typically read poetry, creating a powerful and inclusive legacy.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Reports 30% Reduction in Asylum Hotel Bill</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government spent £2.1 billion on hotels for asylum seekers in the last fiscal year, a 30% decrease from the £3 billion spent the previous year, according to new Home Office figures. This saving was reportedly driven by moving asylum seekers into cheaper accommodations, such as shared housing, and increasing room sharing in the remaining hotels. However, experts warn that a recent surge in small boat crossings could increase the reliance on hotels again. The report also confirmed that £270 million paid to Rwanda for the now-scrapped deportation scheme will not be refunded.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Defend Abbott Laboratories Stock, Calling Recent Sell-Off 'Too Punitive'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a significant 8.5% drop in Abbott Laboratories' stock, analysts are defending the company, with Jefferies upgrading it to a "buy" rating. The sell-off was triggered by a slight cut in the company's growth outlook, which analysts and Abbott's CEO have called an "overreaction." They view the headwind from a slower-than-expected recovery in its diagnostics business in China as transitory and remain positive on the company's strong fundamentals. Analysts see the potential for accelerated growth in 2026, suggesting the market's punitive reaction was not justified by the minor guidance change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk and challenger Daniel Dubois had a tense final face-off at their weigh-in ahead of their rematch at Wembley Stadium. Usyk, who weighed in at a career-heavy 16st 3lb, repeatedly tried to upstage Dubois by stepping in front of him and playing to the largely pro-Usyk crowd. The mind games appeared to perturb Dubois, who is seeking to avenge his 2023 stoppage loss to the undefeated Ukrainian. The highly anticipated bout will see Dubois attempt to become the first Briton to be the undisputed heavyweight champion in the four-belt era.</p>
