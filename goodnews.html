          <p>British lender Barclays has upgraded its full-year financial guidance and announced a surprise £500 million ($667 million) share buyback, targeting a Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) exceeding 11%. This positive outlook comes despite a 7% decline in third-quarter pre-tax profit, primarily due to a £235 million charge linked to the UK's car loans scandal. CEO C. S. Venkatakrishnan emphasized the bank's consistent capital generation and its intention to move to quarterly share buyback announcements, laying foundations for greater performance beyond 2026. Strong investment banking returns have significantly propelled European financial stocks this year, with Barclays shares surging over 35% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rangers chairman Andrew Cavenagh has vigorously defended the club's head coach appointment process, asserting that it was not "screwed up" despite external perceptions of being "clunky." Cavenagh clarified that while high-profile candidates like Steven Gerrard and Kevin Muscat were close to being appointed, their eventual non-selection was primarily due to complex timing issues on their part and the club's. He emphasized that Danny Rohl, who ultimately took the role, was one of five strong candidates pursued simultaneously, not a third choice. The chairman reiterated the club's current focus is on Rohl's leadership, dismissing past speculation.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading on Wednesday as investors evaluated Japan's latest trade data and the country's new political leadership. Japanese exports for September saw a 4.2% year-on-year increase, driven by robust growth in shipments to Asia, although this figure slightly missed analysts' expectations. Concurrently, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and her new cabinet were sworn in, notably including Japan's first female finance minister. South Korea's Kospi index continued its strong performance, setting a new closing record, while Japan's Topix index also reached an all-time high. Shares of LG Chem notably soared following activist investor calls for corporate changes. (not investment advice)</p>

Saunders will play Joan, the sister of Lumley's character Felicity and aunt to the titular Amanda. Her new character is humorously described as a "ball of country-living, enthusiastic upper-class bluster," offering a stark contrast to Felicity. Saunders expressed her delight at joining the "fabulous Amandaland gang," anticipating a laugh-filled family reunion. This collaboration is expected to excite fans of the iconic duo, known for their Bafta-winning performances in "Ab Fab."</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly facing considerable engineering hurdles in the development of its ambitious foldable 18-inch iPad, leading to a potential delay in its debut until 2029 or beyond. The device, internally designated J312, is estimated to cost around US$3,000, making it significantly more expensive than current iPad Pro models. Key challenges revolve around optimizing its weight, integrating advanced features, and perfecting the complex 18-inch organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display technology. This foldable tablet is part of Apple's broader initiative to bring innovative products to market, alongside new iPhones and other advanced gadgets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study has, for the first time, ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, revealing substantial differences in their impact on patients. Academics from King's College London and the University of Oxford analyzed 30 common drugs, identifying notable variations in weight gain (ranging from a 2.4kg drop to a nearly 2kg gain), heart rate changes (up to 21 beats per minute difference), and blood pressure alterations within the initial eight weeks of treatment. Researchers stress the clinical importance of these findings, advocating for a personalized approach to antidepressant prescriptions based on individual patient preferences and co-existing health conditions.</p>

          <h2>India Considers Reducing Russian Oil Imports for US Trade Deal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering a reduction in its oil purchases from Russia, potentially in exchange for the US substantially slashing tariffs on Indian exports, as the two nations move closer to a trade deal. Indian media suggests US tariffs could drop from 50% to 15-16%. This development follows pressure from US President Donald Trump on Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding India's significant Russian oil imports since the 2022 Ukraine war. The trade agreement, which also involves India possibly increasing non-GMO corn imports from the US, is expected to be finalized around the upcoming ASEAN summit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix is fully committed to integrating generative artificial intelligence across its streaming platform, aiming to significantly enhance various aspects of its operations, including title recommendations, its advertising business, and the creation of movies and TV content. The company has already demonstrated AI's utility in distributed films like "Happy Gilmore 2" for de-aging characters and in pre-production for series such as "Billionaires' Bunker" to explore design concepts. While acknowledging widespread industry concerns regarding AI's potential to displace human workers, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos affirmed that AI will empower creators to tell stories more effectively and innovatively, rather than replacing fundamental creativity.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani is gearing up for the final debate, strategically aiming to maintain control of the race by focusing on local issues and mobilizing his base. Concurrently, former Governor Andrew Cuomo is aggressively campaigning to convince Republican voters to shift their support from Curtis Sliwa to his independent candidacy, portraying Sliwa as a "spoiler." Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder, has forcefully rejected calls to withdraw and has, in turn, escalated his criticism of Cuomo. The debate represents Cuomo's critical last opportunity to sway conservative and moderate voters, while Mamdani seeks to balance defensive maneuvers with his campaign's optimistic vision.</p>

          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder marked their championship banner unveiling and ring ceremony with a dramatic 125-124 double overtime victory against Kevin Durant and the Houston Rockets, with MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander sealing the win. Durant, still a target of boos from Thunder fans, fouled out late in the second extra period. In another NBA season opener, the Golden State Warriors defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 119-109. Despite a stellar 43-point performance from Luka Doncic, the Lakers struggled with turnovers and poor third-quarter play, particularly in the absence of an injured LeBron James, who missed his first career season opener.</p>
