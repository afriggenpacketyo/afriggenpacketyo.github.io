          <p>This article presents an optimistic view of China's economy, arguing that it is undergoing a profound restructuring driven by a dynamic new generation of entrepreneurs, rather than facing collapse. Unlike previous cohorts, these business leaders, primarily born post-famine, are technically trained, highly innovative, and focused on co-creation with government and other partners. Having matured during China’s reform era, they effectively blend experiences of past scarcity with current market opportunities and technological advancements, fostering increased competitiveness and continued integration into global systems. This internal dynamism is highlighted as a key factor in China's ongoing economic resilience and transformation.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace Football Club has achieved a remarkable milestone, setting a new club record with a 19-game unbeaten streak across all competitions, including their historic first away victory in European play. This impressive run marks a significant turnaround for the Eagles, who were struggling in the Premier League just a year prior, and now sit third in the top flight with an unbeaten record this season. Under manager Oliver Glasner, the team has demonstrated exceptional hunger and ambition, securing notable results against top clubs like Liverpool and Manchester City. This period is being hailed as a golden era in the club's 120-year history, with the team now considered joint favorites to win the Conference League.</p>

          <p>Treasure hunters from a shipwreck salvage company have uncovered an estimated $1 million worth of long-lost Spanish treasure off Florida's aptly named "treasure coast." The discovery includes over 1,000 silver and gold coins, believed to have been minted in Spanish colonies and lost when a powerful hurricane wrecked a fleet of ships on July 31, 1715. Many coins still bear visible dates and mint marks, offering valuable historical insights for both historians and collectors. This rare and extraordinary find provides a tangible link to the rich maritime history of the Spanish empire's golden age, exciting researchers and enthusiasts alike.</p>

          <p>CBS News Miami entertainment reporter Lisa Petrillo has publicly shared her deeply personal 10-month battle with breast cancer during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, after keeping her diagnosis private. Her early-stage detection was a direct result of her persistence: after a routine ultrasound for her left breast, she insisted doctors also examine a lump she found during a self-check on her right side. Following a lumpectomy and 15 days of radiation, Petrillo is now in remission and feeling well, though she will continue medication for five years. She hopes her story will empower others and is actively partnering with CBS Miami to promote free mammogram screenings across South Florida.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Lucumí: Afro-Caribbean Spirituality as a Path to Survival and Balance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean spirituality rooted in Yoruba cosmology, highlighting its profound role as a practice of survival and care. Developed by enslaved Africans in Cuba as an act of resistance and remembrance, Lucumí emphasizes character, balance, and connection to divine orishas, often misunderstood and demonized due to anti-Black beliefs and colonial vilification. Scholars are actively working to destigmatize the religion, underscoring its core principles of holistic health, well-being, and community, and dispelling pervasive myths about "black magic" or sensationalized animal sacrifice, which is often a prayerful and communal act. The article asserts that Lucumí honors nature, uplifts ancestors, and provides essential tools for collective survival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fair Isaac, the creator of the widely used FICO score, saw its stock surge over 20% after unveiling a new pricing model that will allow mortgage lenders to bypass traditional credit bureaus for credit scores. This strategic change enables FICO to license its scores directly to mortgage resellers, aiming to eliminate "unnecessary mark-ups" and provide lenders with more flexible pricing options. While Fair Isaac's shares rallied significantly, major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax experienced declines, as the move is expected to disintermediate their current role in score distribution. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte praised FICO's initiative as a step towards generating "Creative Solutions" for American consumers and fostering greater market competition.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that Democrats are actively and effectively resisting the Trump administration's agenda, often through less visible procedural means in Congress and robust legal challenges, despite a perception among their voters of inaction. Congressional tactics include employing Senate filibusters, forcing individual roll call votes, delivering marathon speeches, and implementing "blanket holds" on nominees to delay legislation and appointments. Outside the legislative branch, Democratic-led lawsuits have proven highly successful in blocking, reversing, or significantly delaying numerous administration moves. The perceived disconnect between these efforts and voter satisfaction is attributed to the low-profile nature of procedural resistance and the inherent power limitations of a minority party against a unified executive and legislative branch.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has successfully finalized a secondary share sale totaling $6.6 billion, enabling current and former employees to sell stock at an impressive $500 billion valuation. This significant transaction, involving major investors such as Thrive Capital and SoftBank, solidifies OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable privately held company, now surpassing SpaceX. The share sale, marking the second major tender offer in less than a year, is viewed internally as a strong vote of confidence in the company's long-term prospects and a strategic move to retain top talent without pursuing an immediate initial public offering. This achievement comes amid intensifying competition for AI talent and continued rapid growth in the artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Osbourne expressed frustration over his physical limitations but cherished the opportunity to say a proper goodbye to his devoted fans.

          <p>The Vatican's Swiss Guard, renowned as the world's smallest army and tasked with protecting the Pope and the Holy See, has unveiled a new non-ceremonial, formal uniform. This refashioned attire, featuring yellow and white stripes and gold buttons, is designed for events outside the Vatican, such as embassy parties or official dinners, replacing the previous practice of wearing non-uniform suits. The return to a distinct formal uniform is intended to reinforce the Swiss Guard's identity as a military corps, while their iconic Renaissance-style uniforms will continue to be worn within the Vatican.
