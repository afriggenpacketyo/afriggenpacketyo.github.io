          <p>United CEO Scott Kirby addressed recent air traffic control radar outages at Newark International Airport, assuring the public that flying remains safe due to backup procedures and pilot training. Despite these safety measures, the outages have caused disruptions, including holding patterns and flight diversions. United has proactively reduced flights from its schedule in coordination with the FAA to mitigate potential customer impact. Kirby acknowledged a possible financial impact on United due to the schedule adjustments but emphasized that safety and customer service remain the top priorities. The CEO also expressed optimism about long-term improvements to the air traffic control system with bipartisan support and funding initiatives.</p>

          <p>The article explores the growing trend of parents choosing to raise their children near or with close friends, creating intentional "villages" for support. In a society lacking structural support for families, these arrangements offer parents much-needed help with childcare, emotional support, and shared responsibilities. While such setups require coordination and can present challenges like differing parenting styles, many parents find the benefits of having friends nearby outweigh the difficulties. The article highlights various examples of families living near one another, sharing homes, or participating in co-housing communities.</p>

          <h2>British Plane Parts Expected to be Exempted from US Tariffs in Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are set to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the evolving trade agreement with the Trump administration. This agreement would provide certainty to a ¬£40 billion sector supporting 450,000 jobs in the UK. The deal also includes relief for the car and steel industries, with car tariffs potentially decreasing from 27.5% to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles annually and steel tariffs being eliminated. The aerospace and aviation industry has been lobbying the White House to retain a 45-year-old treaty that allowed aircraft and parts to be traded duty-free.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a century of progress, US life expectancy has declined, but science is revealing ways to reverse this trend. Experts recommend knowing and lowering biological age through proteomic clocks and DNA-methylation scores, adopting a Mediterranean diet rich in whole grains and vegetables, prioritizing deep sleep, incorporating strength training, and fostering social connections. These steps are based on evidence and do not require futuristic technologies. The article also mentions optimism around GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic, which have shown potential in reducing the risk of diseases associated with aging.</p>
