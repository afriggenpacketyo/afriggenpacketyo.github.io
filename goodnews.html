          <p>Millennials are often characterized as entitled complainers, but this is an unfair assessment because they have faced significant economic challenges. A study found that millennials have 30% less wealth at age 35 than boomers did. They have been hit with multiple financial crises, including the Great Recession and the pandemic, while also facing high student loan debt. Finding a trusted financial advisor may help millennials navigate these obstacles and maximize the longevity of their future nest egg or any other long-term financial goals.</p>
