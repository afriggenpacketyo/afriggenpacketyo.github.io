          <p>After a seemingly routine foot surgery, Amber Meade experienced debilitating, persistent pain that upended her life. It took nearly a year for doctors to diagnose her with chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and incurable disorder characterized by extreme pain signals. Through a combination of specialized physical therapy, relaxation exercises, and ketamine infusions, Meade has been able to regain some functionality and improve her quality of life. While she still faces daily challenges, she is now able to participate more in family activities and is grateful for the progress she has made.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely maintained restrictions on federal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, upholding a lower court's finding that the operations appeared to unconstitutionally target people based on race or language. The ruling requires federal agents to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone and prohibits them from basing arrests solely on factors like ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or location. The decision stems from a lawsuit over widespread raids in June that caused significant fear in the region's Latino community. Pro-immigrant advocates praised the ruling as a protection against indiscriminate and fear-inducing enforcement tactics.</p>

The facility, completed ahead of schedule, is designed to help Namibia develop its space infrastructure and technical expertise. It will process remote sensing data for applications like environmental monitoring, agriculture, and disaster management. As part of the partnership, China will also train Namibian engineers, aiming to build the country's capacity to operate the station independently and foster its nascent space program.</p>

The terminal, which will be JFK's largest and dedicated solely to international travelers, is now weathertight, and key infrastructure like baggage systems is being installed. As part of a larger $19 billion airport overhaul, the new facility is designed to be flooded with natural light and will feature its own resilient microgrid. The project aims to modernize the aging airport infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic, with the opening timed for the 2026 World Cup.</p>

With around 95% of restaurants now offering at least one spicy option, companies are leveraging social media trends and collaborations to create buzz. This culinary shift reflects an effort to adapt to changing consumer tastes and combat slower spending in the restaurant industry.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, named Endeavour, has successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a new four-person crew for a long-duration mission. The international team includes two NASA astronauts, Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, alongside Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. Their arrival marks the beginning of Expedition 73 and will allow the previous Crew 10 astronauts to return to Earth next week. The mission comes as NASA considers extending crew stays from six to eight months amid potential budget changes affecting ISS operations.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management has taken a significant position in Equinix, a global data center operator, following a stock drop triggered by the company's revised financial forecast. While short-term investors were spooked by increased capital expenditure and lower near-term profit projections, Elliott, with its deep experience in the data center sector, likely sees long-term value. The activist firm could push Equinix to improve market communications regarding its AI strategy, optimize its cost structure, and enhance shareholder returns. Elliott's history as both an activist and an operator in the industry suggests it may seek a collaborative role, potentially including a board seat. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As airlines like Southwest move towards assigned seating, travel experts highlight the primary reason to pay for early boarding: securing overhead bin space for carry-on luggage. With limited space available, being in a later boarding group often means having to gate-check bags. Experts suggest that travelers who prioritize keeping their carry-ons with them should consider the upgrade. Alternatives to paying for the add-on include gaining elite status with an airline, often achievable through co-branded credit cards, or booking more expensive premium economy fares, which typically come with priority boarding privileges and other perks.</p>

          <p>Following a bladder cancer diagnosis, NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders underwent a neobladder reconstruction, a complex surgical procedure to create a new bladder. Surgeons use a segment of the patient's own small intestine, which is reshaped into a sphere and connected to the kidneys and urethra. Because the new organ is made from the patient's tissue, there is no risk of rejection, and patients do not require immunosuppressant drugs. While the procedure is a life-saving advancement, patients must retrain themselves to use the restroom as the neobladder cannot signal the brain, often leading to challenges with incontinence.</p>

However, the decision is complex, influenced by factors like security concerns, housing destruction, and job prospects. While over a million have already returned, like Iryna Schestova who found reintegrating abroad too difficult, many others hesitate due to the ongoing conflict and daily threats. Aid groups are working to prepare for a future mass return, but emphasize that a comprehensive government strategy and, most importantly, an end to the war are the critical factors for encouraging refugees to come back.</p>

Jim had been managing kidney issues for two decades, but his condition worsened after complications from a procedure, placing him on the long transplant waiting list.

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against the notion that the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA championship, won in the Orlando "Bubble," is somehow less legitimate. The author argues that dismissing the title ignores the immense courage and mental fortitude required for players to compete under the unprecedented circumstances of a global pandemic. Far from being easier, the months of isolation, daily testing, and emotional strain of the COVID-19 crisis made the victory uniquely challenging. The piece contends that instead of an asterisk, the championship deserves an exclamation point for the resilience shown by the players during one of modern history's most difficult periods.</p>

The author expresses the absurdity and fear of the situation, where a man simply selling fruit becomes a fugitive in his own community. After weeks of silence, Ivan messages to say he was lying low after a family member was taken, but that he would return when things calmed down. The essay closes with the author's relief upon seeing the vendor's rainbow umbrella back on the corner, a small but powerful symbol of resilience.</p>

Speaking to the BBC, Warner suggested that England's success will depend heavily on their bowlers making an impact on Australia's top order. The comments add a bit of classic pre-Ashes rivalry as both teams prepare for the highly anticipated contest for the urn this winter.</p>

          <p>A new comic explores the common social awkwardness many people feel when receiving a compliment and the science behind this reaction. According to social psychologists, whether a person accepts or dismisses praise says a lot about their self-perception and can also impact the feelings of the person giving the compliment. The piece explains the behavioral science of why it can be difficult to accept kind remarks. It ultimately makes the case for graciously accepting praise, benefiting both the receiver and the giver in the social interaction.</p>
