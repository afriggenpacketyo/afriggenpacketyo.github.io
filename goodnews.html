        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and Congress are seeking to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry through subsidies and penalties on foreign-built ships, particularly those from China. However, the industry faces significant obstacles, including higher costs and longer production times compared to Asian shipyards. The Philadelphia yard, acquired by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha, aims to increase production through methods like automated welding, but it requires a steady stream of orders and government support to compete effectively. Critics argue that previous government efforts have largely failed, and a strategic fleet could be assembled more efficiently using vessels from allies like Japan and South Korea.

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the Trump administration does not intend to harm Apple with tariffs, despite President Trump's suggestion that iPhones made outside the U.S. would face a 25% tariff.

          <p>Donald Trump's plan to impose a 100% tariff on films produced in foreign lands has sparked concerns within the U.S. film industry, with shares in major production companies falling. While some support the idea of bringing productions back to the U.S., others question the practicality and potential consequences of such tariffs. The industry has already been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, economic downturns, and strikes, with on-location filming in Hollywood declining. Critics argue that tariffs could lead to a content trade war and may not make anyone more prosperous.</p>
