          <h2>UK Airspace Redesign Aims for Quicker Flights and Reduced Delays</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. Ministers claim the redesign, the largest since the 1950s, will allow planes to climb faster during takeoff and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impact. The changes also aim to pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis, with the goal of a sustainable future for the aviation industry. UKADS is expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, and Airlines UK expresses eagerness to collaborate for a swift implementation by the end of the decade. This article presents a positive outlook for the future of air travel in the UK. </p>

          <p>Princess Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh, a British-born Sikh princess, openly lived in a same-sex relationship in 1900s Germany and defied social norms by helping Jewish families escape Nazism. The daughter of the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, she used her privilege and resources to provide letters of recommendation, financial support, and guarantees for immigration documents. She sheltered Jewish refugees in her home in England and advocated for those interned as "enemy aliens." Her legacy, recently brought to light by biographer Peter Bance, showcases her courage and humanitarian efforts during a tumultuous period. Her story will be featured in a Kensington Palace exhibition titled "Princesses of Resistance" in March 2026. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, *The Family Dynamic* by Susan Dominus, explores the profound impact of sibling relationships on a person's life trajectory, including birth order and achievements. Research suggests that eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests due to increased parental attention. Sibling influence can drive individuals to pursue different fields, consciously or subconsciously differentiating themselves from one another. Age gaps between siblings can also complicate these dynamics, as younger siblings may adopt a mix of their older siblings' interests. Ultimately, siblings act as vivid mirrors, reflecting both the best and worst traits of one another. </p>

          <p>Germany's former foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, is poised to become the next president of the United Nations General Assembly for a one-year term starting in September. The role, primarily ceremonial, involves organizing plenary sessions and is considered a stepping stone for future positions. Baerbock's nomination faced some internal criticism, as Germany had initially intended to nominate diplomat Helga Schmid. Baerbock, a Green Party member, had previously served as foreign minister and is known for her commitment to a "value-based foreign policy," though her outspokenness sometimes led to diplomatic challenges. Her appointment reflects Germany's continued engagement in international diplomacy. </p>

          <p>Despite an uncertain global economy, the aviation industry is expected to improve in profitability in 2025. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts increased revenue, operating profits, and net profits for the industry. Net profits are projected at $36 billion for 2025, up from $32.4 billion in 2024, with a net profit margin forecast to rise to 3.7%. The better results are mainly attributed to lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency, with passenger load factors expected to reach an all-time high. Recent financial data show minimal fuel hedging activity over the past year, indicating that airlines will generally benefit from the reduced fuel cost. (not investment advice)</p>
