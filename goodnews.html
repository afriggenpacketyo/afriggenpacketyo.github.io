          <p>Kenton Cool, a 51-year-old British mountain guide, has successfully scaled Mount Everest for the 19th time, setting a new record for the most ascents by a non-Sherpa guide. Cool's climbing journey began in 2004, with only interruptions in 2014 due to an avalanche that killed 16 Sherpa guides, in 2015 due to an earthquake-triggered avalanche, and in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. This achievement underscores his extensive experience and expertise in navigating the world's highest peak, as hundreds of climbers and guides aim to summit Everest during the spring climbing season before the weather deteriorates with the monsoon. Kami Rita, a Nepali Sherpa guide, holds the overall record with 30 climbs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed an AI-powered tool that allows doctors to observe blood clot formation in real time, offering a non-invasive method to monitor platelet activity. The tool uses a high-powered microscope and AI to analyze blood cell movement, distinguishing between single platelets, clumps, and white blood cells. This technology could significantly improve treatment for coronary artery disease by allowing doctors to directly assess the effectiveness of anti-platelet drugs, potentially leading to more personalized and safer treatments. While the technology is not yet ready for widespread use, it holds promise for transforming patient care in the future.</p>

          <p>Small, religiously affiliated colleges in rural areas are increasingly facing financial challenges due to declining enrollment and demographic shifts, leading some to consider mergers or closures. St. Ambrose University and Mount Mercy University are exploring a partnership to avoid this fate, reflecting a broader trend among religious institutions seeking collaborative solutions. While some religious colleges are experiencing enrollment gains due to growing political divisions and a desire for values-based education, many continue to struggle with rising costs and limited access for low-income students. These institutions often serve as vital educational resources in rural communities, offering a personal touch and a sense of belonging for students from small towns.</p>

          <h2>Simple Brick Stacking Technique Could Reduce Air Pollution in Bangladesh</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that a simple change in how bricks are stacked in kilns could significantly reduce air pollution in Bangladesh, where brick kilns contribute substantially to the country's poor air quality. By stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow and ensuring more consistent coal fueling, kilns can operate more efficiently and reduce fuel consumption by approximately 23%. This low-cost intervention not only decreases pollution but also improves worker conditions and increases profits for kiln owners, presenting a feasible solution for a country grappling with severe air pollution issues. The research team is now collaborating with the Bangladeshi government to expand the implementation of this training.</p>

          <p>A recent presentation by activist investor David Webb has ignited discussions about the legal system that will govern Hong Kong after 2047, when the "one country, two systems" framework is set to expire. Webb questioned whether Hong Kong law students should continue studying the existing system or begin learning mainland law, particularly concerning contract law and land leases. While some express concerns about the transition, others urge calm, recalling similar anxieties leading up to 1997. The debate highlights the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Hong Kong's autonomy and its integration with mainland China.</p>

          <p>A recent internal survey by the German military's Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences (ZMSBw) indicates that the Bundeswehr does not have "systemic" extremism within its ranks, with only a small percentage of soldiers exhibiting right-wing extremist attitudes. However, the study did identify problematic chauvinistic and xenophobic views among some soldiers, and external researchers remain skeptical due to past incidents of far-right networks and terrorist plots involving military members. Despite safeguards and anti-extremism measures, concerns persist about the potential for extremist attitudes to infiltrate the military, particularly given the normalization of right-wing views in wider society.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody, bare footprints, led to a decades-long search for justice in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. The investigation took a turn in 2015 when forensic scientists identified an unknown DNA profile repeating itself at the crime scene, which eventually led to Jerry Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy. Westrom was convicted of the murder after his DNA matched the unknown profile, and footprint analysis confirmed his presence at the scene. This case highlights the power of forensic science and genetic genealogy in solving cold cases.</p>

          <p>Despite a broader pullback in luxury spending, the world's wealthiest individuals continue to invest in high-end jewelry, but are becoming more selective, favoring top brands.
