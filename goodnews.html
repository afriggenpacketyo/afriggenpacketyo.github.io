          <p>The iconic Honey Deuce cocktail at the U.S. Open, priced at $23, has seen its cost rise faster than the general rate of inflation over the past decade. Since 2015, the price of the popular vodka-based beverage has increased by approximately 53%, while the broader Consumer Price Index has risen by about 36% during the same period. This price hike means that if the drink's cost had matched inflation, it would be around $20.33 today. Despite the high price, the event sold over 550,000 cocktails last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores the artistic and romantic relationship between painter Alex Katz and his wife, Ada, who has been the subject of nearly 300 of his portraits over their 50-year marriage. Coming of age during the abstract expressionism movement, Katz developed his own unique style of realism, with Ada serving as his primary muse. Curators note that his interest lies more in capturing style, appearance, and the play of light rather than deep emotional introspection. This enduring collaboration between artist and muse is celebrated in an exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum, showcasing the evolution of his distinctive work.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Arundhati Roy's first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," delves into the author's complex and formative relationship with her mother, Mary Roy. The passage reflects on her mother's recent death and the profound, often tumultuous, impact she had on the author's life and perception of her home state of Kerala. Roy describes her mother as a formidable figure, woven into the very landscape of her memory, who was known for her unpredictability and a landmark legal battle for equal inheritance rights for Christian women. The excerpt captures the author's sense of loss and puzzlement at the intensity of her grief.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece explores the ethical dilemma of feeling personal happiness while being aware of widespread global suffering, from humanitarian disasters to political turmoil. The author draws on historical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, where one member's suffering is felt by all. However, the article argues that this interconnectedness also means we should experience the joys and successes of others, a concept known as 'sympathetic joy' or 'freudenfreude.' It concludes that acknowledging both the world's horrors and its delights is a form of resistance and a way to avoid both cynicism and naive positivity.</p>

          <p>This article presents an excerpt from "Heart the Lover," the latest novel by award-winning author Lily King, known for "Writers & Lovers." The selection introduces the narrator reflecting on a pivotal moment in a college literature class, where a professor reads her uniquely written essay aloud. This event catches the attention of a quiet, scholarly classmate named Sam, who begins to sit beside her and walk her to her next class. Their initial conversations are academic and stilted, but the passage culminates with Sam asking her to see a movie, hinting at the beginning of a significant and complicated youthful relationship.</p>

          <h2>IRS Clarifies Eligibility for EV Tax Credit Beyond September Deadline</h2>

          <p>The IRS has provided guidance clarifying how consumers can still qualify for the up to $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit even after its official expiration on September 30. According to the new document, a taxpayer who enters into a "written binding contract" and makes a payment for an EV on or before the deadline is eligible for the credit, even if they take physical possession of the vehicle later. This clarification provides a crucial loophole for buyers facing vehicle delivery delays, allowing them to secure the tax break by ordering and putting down a deposit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly exploring a last-minute move for Aston Villa's World Cup-winning goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, before the transfer deadline. The club has been actively seeking to strengthen its goalkeeping position and has also been in negotiations for Royal Antwerp's young Belgian keeper, Senne Lammens. While Lammens is a promising talent, the 31-year-old Martinez offers extensive high-level experience, including 197 Premier League appearances and two FIFA Goalkeeper of the Year awards. The potential acquisition reflects United's urgency to address performance issues in the position, as acknowledged by head coach Ruben Amorim.</p>

          <p>In a rare commercial contract with a North American company, a Chinese Kinetica-1 rocket has successfully launched two miniature satellites for the Mexican startup ThumbSat. The satellites, each weighing less than 100 grams, represent Mexico's first commercial mission to low Earth orbit and aim to demonstrate the viability of small, meaningful satellite technology. The launch provider, CAS Space, highlighted the mission as a milestone for China's entry into the North American launch market. The collaboration showcases growing international interest in China's commercial space capabilities, which offer a balance of cost-effectiveness and reliability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece draws on Toni Morrison's 1995 analysis of fascism to argue that its roots in America are deeply tied to racism and are not exclusive to one political party. The author contends that the historical struggle of Black Americans against racial oppression provides a model for contemporary resistance, characterized by belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of protest, and profound faith. Rather than succumbing to cynicism, the article calls for learning from this legacy of resilience. It highlights how Black resistance has historically pushed the nation closer to its stated ideals, offering hope and a strategy for combating today's autocratic threats.</p>

          <p>Although the Democratic Party's public approval ratings have hit a 30-year low, with many voters finding its leadership weak, there are emerging signs of optimism for its future. Polls indicate a growing lead for Democrats in the 2026 congressional elections, and potential presidential candidates are actively campaigning against former President Trump, whose own popularity is declining. Strategists suggest the party's path to recovery involves focusing on economic issues like affordability, organizing for midterm victories, and leveraging voter dislike of the opposition. Despite current disarray, a deep bench of new talent and a renewed offensive strategy could signal a turnaround.</p>
