          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating the data privacy rights of state residents. The lawsuit, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in 2022, accused Google of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data. Google did not admit any wrongdoing, stating that the settlement involves allegations related to the Chrome browser's incognito setting, location history disclosures on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photo. The company asserts that all policy changes related to these allegations have already been announced or implemented.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled that her continued detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa in March, allegedly due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. The judge stated that the government's only evidence against Ozturk was the op-ed and that there was no evidence of violence or advocacy of violence. Ozturk will return to her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, with no travel restrictions, and Tufts University has expressed its support for her return to campus.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years and is now spiraling back to Earth. While most estimates suggest it will re-enter on Friday or Saturday, the exact time and location remain uncertain. The spacecraft, protected by a heat shield, is likely to survive its descent, although the risk of injury on the ground is considered low.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates after an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff spotted a suspicious invitation to a meeting earlier on Friday and realized it was "spear-phishing" - which impersonates a trusted source. Parents have been sent texts telling that them students' passwords have been reset as a precaution - meaning pupils studying for exams do not currently have access to their school's learning resources. The council said no data had been compromised by the attempted attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada due to concerns that a heatwave will damage domestic crops. The purchases come after Henan province, a major wheat-producing region, issued a risk warning about hot, dry weather affecting its fields. The bookings from Australia were the first made by China from the country since last year. While China has delayed shipments from Australia earlier this year, the country has also been known to be one of the world's biggest wheat importers.</p>

          <p>The stage adaptation of Yann Martel‚Äôs ‚ÄúLife of Pi‚Äù is praised for its inventive puppetry and magical simplicity, offering a profound exploration of belief and survival. The story follows Pi Patel, a 17-year-old boy who survives a shipwreck and spends 227 days at sea with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The production transitions dreamlike fashion from the hospital to Pondicherry, India, where Pi grew up in a happy, hectic ferment of adolescence. Through masterful staging and compelling performances, the play delves into themes of faith, imagination, and the choices that shape our reality.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola has confirmed that Erling Haaland is "ready and fit" to return from injury. Guardiola has led City to six Premier League titles since joining the club in 2016, while he also won both La Liga and the Bundesliga three times apiece with Barcelona and Bayern Munich respectively. This season is just the fourth time in his illustrious managerial career that he has failed to finish top of the league. City beat rivals Manchester United to claim the Community Shield last summer but they can end a disappointing season on a high by finishing in the top five, as well as having an FA Cup final to play for against Crystal Palace on Saturday 16 May.</p>
