          <p>Google Cloud experienced widespread global outages on Thursday, impacting various cloud-based services and causing disruptions for numerous users. The outages, which began in the late morning, affected several Google Cloud products across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. This incident is a setback for Google, which is striving to compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in the cloud infrastructure market, particularly as demand for AI products and services grows. Services such as Amazon's Twitch, CoreWeave's Weights and Biases, Elastic, GitLab, LangChain, Microsoft's GitHub, Replit, Intuit's Mailchimp, Shopify, and Cloudflare were also affected, but Cloudflare confirmed the issue stemmed from Google Cloud. The situation prompted a spike in searches for "Firebase," a Google developer platform. </p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is aiming to move forward from the controversy surrounding David Hogg, who announced he would not seek re-election as vice chair after internal disagreements arose from his efforts to primary older incumbent Democrats. The DNC voted to redo the vice-chair election, leading to Hogg's decision to step back, allowing the party to refocus on more pressing matters. DNC Chair Ken Martin thanked Hogg for his activism but acknowledged the need to address the distractions caused by the internal conflict. The controversy stemmed from Hogg's pledge to support primary challenges against older House Democrats, which led to an ultimatum from Martin to either rescind his vice-chair position or forego his political influence. </p>

          <p>A widespread technology outage impacted several major platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Google, OpenAI, and Spotify, causing disruptions for tens of thousands of users on Thursday. Cloudflare, which provides services to many affected companies, reported intermittent failures and investigated the issue. Google Cloud was identified as the source of the outage, affecting a limited number of Cloudflare services. While services began to recover later in the afternoon, intermittent errors were expected as systems handled retries and caches were filled. The outage affected a range of sites, including Discord, Google Meet, Snapchat, Character AI, YouTube, Box, Etsy, and Shopify.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) revealed new details about its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, set to launch next year, during an event with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The MI400 chips can be assembled into a full server rack called Helios, allowing thousands of chips to function as a unified "rack-scale" system. OpenAI plans to utilize the AMD chips, providing feedback on the MI400 roadmap. AMD aims to compete with Nvidia on price and operational costs, offering aggressive pricing and lower power consumption, and has invested in several AI companies to build full-stack solutions. </p>

          <p>Chime shares experienced a significant surge in their Nasdaq debut, jumping 37% after the company's IPO priced above the expected range, valuing the online banking service provider at $11.6 billion. The company raised approximately $700 million in the offering, with existing investors selling an additional $165 million worth of shares. While the IPO valuation represents a decrease from the company's valuation in 2021, it signifies a positive sign for the fintech IPO market after a prolonged freeze. Chime reported substantial revenue growth in the most recent quarter, attributing its success to serving Americans earning $100,000 a year or less. </p>

The wreck site, dubbed "Camarat 4," is largely preserved intact due to its depth, which prevented looting.
