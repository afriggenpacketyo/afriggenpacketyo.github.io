          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced significant bipartisan backlash from senators and House members, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated he withdrew the proposal due to an inability to guarantee the land would not be sold to foreign interests or large corporations. Conservation advocates celebrated the decision as a victory but remain vigilant against future attempts to privatize federal lands.</p>
