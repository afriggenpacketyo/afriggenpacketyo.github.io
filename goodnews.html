          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the amount in 2022. The rise in fake reviews is attributed to Tripadvisor's stricter policies against "incentivized reviews" and improvements in the company's detection systems. Boosting and member fraud constitute the majority of fake reviews, while paid reviews, often originating from Asia, are considered more problematic. Tripadvisor employs AI and behavioral biometrics to identify patterns and penalize violators.</p>
