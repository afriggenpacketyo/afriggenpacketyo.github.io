        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, fueled by optimism surrounding ongoing trade talks with the U.S. This positive performance contrasted with broader losses across other Asia-Pacific markets, which faced intensifying fears over the banking sector and trade tensions. Specific regional movements included Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares falling despite a strong earnings report and Chinese automaker BYD's stock dropping due to a significant vehicle recall of around 115,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports saw a sharp rebound in September, jumping 6.9% from a year earlier, defying expectations and reversing a previous decline. U.S. stock futures also experienced slight declines overnight, tracking Wall Street's concerns over regional bank loan practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>English Winemakers Seek Export Growth After Record Summer, Eyeing Global Markets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 02:08:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>English winemakers are increasingly relying on surging exports to sustain their once-novelty product, especially after domestic sales growth has slowed. A record-warm summer this year, attributed to climate change, has optimized growing conditions, leading to an award-winning sparkling wine that recently outcompeted French Champagne for a prestigious industry award. While British demand has driven past growth, the industry body WineGB aims to double export volumes to 18% of total sales by 2030, with Norway currently being the top international buyer. However, the article notes that while warmer temperatures benefit English viticulture, climate change also brings more unpredictable weather events, posing future challenges for producers.</p>

          <p>Francesco Camarda, a 17-year-old AC Milan forward, is rapidly ascending in Italian football, breaking multiple records for youngest appearances and goals in Serie A and European competitions. Currently gaining experience on loan at Lecce, he recently became the youngest player to score for Italy's U21 team, showcasing exceptional composure and scoring instinct with a cheeky Panenka penalty. Experts and former coaches praise his natural talent, hunger for goals, and ability to perform under pressure. Milan has secured him with a contract until 2028, fending off interest from top European clubs, as he continues his remarkably precocious career.</p>

Evan McPherson kicked the winning field goal from 36 yards with just seven seconds left on the clock, sealing the win at home. In a rare matchup of two 40-plus quarterbacks, Joe Flacco of the Bengals threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns, connecting notably with Ja'Marr Chase for a franchise-record 16 receptions. Aaron Rodgers of the Steelers contributed 249 yards and four touchdowns but was intercepted twice, ultimately falling short in the high-stakes divisional bout.</p>

          <p>EU heads of state are set to press for accelerated action on utilizing immobilized Russian assets to finance Ukraine, influenced by increasing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. A draft document indicates calls for the European Commission to present concrete proposals for using approximately 175 billion euros in matured cash from these assets to support Kyiv's pressing military and defense needs. While profits are currently used for aid, further measures face financial and legal concerns, particularly from Belgium, which hosts a significant portion of the frozen funds. The EU also emphasizes fair burden-sharing with G7 partners amidst reduced U.S. financial support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Former members of the military in England and Wales will soon be able to apply for a digital version of their identity cards, a move ministers hope will serve as a case study for a planned UK-wide digital ID scheme. This optional digital card, downloadable to smartphones, will allow veterans to more easily prove their status for accessing public services, healthcare, housing support, careers advice, and various discounts. The government aims for a broader mandatory digital ID scheme by 2029 to combat illegal working, with this veteran initiative addressing legitimate concerns around privacy and security.</p>

Once a source of shame, particularly in Western marketing, sweat is now increasingly embraced in popular culture, fashion, and even professional networking settings like saunas. Experts suggest this shift is driven by a blend of body positivity, changing social norms, and the beauty industry's evolving narratives. However, some critics argue that commercial interests might be co-opting this trend for profit, raising questions about genuine acceptance versus marketing strategies.</p>
