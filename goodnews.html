          <p>Walmart executives publicly warned that President Trump's tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers, a shift from their initial downplaying of the issue. This outspoken response, while risky given Trump's history of attacking companies, highlights a growing willingness among corporate leaders to criticize trade policy. Walmart's CFO stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases was too large for any retailer to absorb. The company affirmed its commitment to low prices, but acknowledged the reality of small retail margins. This situation illustrates the delicate balance businesses must strike between appeasing customers, shareholders, and a transactional White House, as Trump's trade policies create uncertainty.

The service will begin with approximately 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with the latest version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, known as FSD Unsupervised. Musk emphasized a cautious approach, starting with a small number of vehicles to ensure safety and reliability before scaling up to thousands. Since 2016, Musk has been promising self-driving capabilities, and this launch marks a significant step toward fulfilling that vision.</p>

The house, once belonging to Malcolm X's brother and sister-in-law, Wilfred and Ruth Little, is where Malcolm Little transformed into Malcolm X and embraced his Muslim faith during the 1950s. The home has been carefully restored to reflect its 1950s appearance and will become a public museum.

The legal case, brought forward by a former financial ombudsman, argued that shoppers were charged higher prices due to wrongly levied fees on transactions made between 1992 and 2008. Consumers who lived in these regions for at least three months during June 1997 and June 2008 and purchased goods or services from UK businesses accepting Mastercard are eligible to claim compensation.</p>

The measure establishes rules for stablecoin issuers, mandating that firms hold reserves of assets underlying the cryptocurrency to protect consumers. Supporters say the bill will formalize a key segment of the cryptocurrency industry and offer safeguards for consumers. Critics, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, argue that it is a weak set of regulations that fail to adequately protect consumers and police illicit trading, especially in light of potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>With gold prices rising significantly, investors are exploring ways to safely invest in the precious metal. Limiting gold investments to a maximum of 10% of an overall portfolio is a recommended strategy, as gold primarily serves as an income protector rather than an income producer. Investors should avoid riskier gold investment types like mining stocks, opting instead for gold bars, coins, or gold IRAs. Monitoring the economic climate and portfolio performance is crucial to identifying potential selling opportunities and ensuring gold's effectiveness as a hedge against inflation.
