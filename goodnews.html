          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams is set to make history at the upcoming U.S. Open as the oldest singles competitor in the tournament since 1981. At 45 years old, she received a wild card invitation for what will be her 25th appearance in the singles championship. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion and two-time U.S. Open winner, continues a trend of longevity in professional tennis, where athletes often compete well into their 30s and 40s. Her participation follows a recent victory at the DC Open, where she became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004.</p>

          <p>Three rare, hand-labeled aluminum audition records made by Dame Vera Lynn 90 years ago are set to be released for the first time. The recordings were discovered by her daughter, Virginia Lewis-Jones, after she donated her mother's record collection to the British Library's Sound Archive. The discs, along with a rare copy of her first 1935 record, offer a glimpse into the very beginning of the career of the singer who would become known as the "Forces' Sweetheart" during World War Two. A single from the collection will be released to mark the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, with a full album of rare tracks to follow in November.</p>

The collaboration, launched ahead of the Rugby World Cup, will initially feature merchandise like t-shirts and hoodies rather than dolls. As part of the deal, toy maker Mattel will donate £20,000 to the Rugby Football Union (RFU) to support girls' access to clubs and coaching. The partnership also supports the RFU's Girls' Activity Days, which aim to introduce more young girls to the sport across the country.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to exit the market, even if it appears frothy with speculative activity. He argued that unlike the dot-com bubble, today's market has enough rational, positive stock stories to balance out the irrational hype surrounding some recent IPOs and speculative companies. Cramer pointed to strong fundamentals and disruptive initiatives from companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly as examples of rational market drivers. He suggested that while there is "magical thinking" in some sectors, the legitimate moves in great companies provide a solid reason to stay invested. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brentford has reached an agreement on a club-record deal to acquire forward Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth for a fee that could reach £42.5 million. The 23-year-old Burkina Faso international is scheduled for a medical in London after expressing a desire to leave Bournemouth due to a less prominent role at the club. Last season, Ouattara demonstrated his scoring ability with nine goals in 37 appearances across all competitions for the Cherries. The move comes after Nottingham Forest, another interested party, secured a different player, leaving the path clear for Brentford's record-breaking signing.</p>

          <p>As economic growth slows and spending habits tighten in China's major cities, the country's smaller, lower-tier cities and counties are becoming a crucial new engine for consumption. With lighter financial burdens and faster income growth, the expanding middle class in these areas is demonstrating stronger purchasing power and a greater willingness to spend. This shift is vital for China's goal of transitioning to a consumption-driven economy. Experts note that the consumption potential in these previously overlooked markets is largely untapped, representing a significant opportunity for future economic growth.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down two Trump administration directives aimed at eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education violated procedural requirements when it threatened to cut federal funding for institutions with DEI initiatives. The ruling follows a lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers, which argued the government's memos created a "sea change" in regulation and caused educators to fear punishment for lawful speech. The judge's decision nullifies the guidance but does not rule on the merits of the anti-DEI policies themselves.</p>

          <p>Despite a rocky consumer launch that led to criticism, OpenAI's new AI model, GPT-5, is rapidly gaining traction in the lucrative enterprise market. Companies are adopting GPT-5 for its improved performance on complex tasks like coding and its lower price point compared to competitors like Anthropic's Claude. Enterprise customers such as Box have praised the model as a "breakthrough" for its advanced reasoning capabilities. OpenAI has strategically built a large enterprise sales team to capitalize on this demand, signaling a major push to monetize its technology beyond the consumer-facing ChatGPT.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reversed its attempt to use expedited removal proceedings against Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul, a woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years. Her lawyers filed a lawsuit arguing that the fast-track deportation, which bypasses an immigration court hearing, was illegal for a long-term resident. A federal judge dismissed the case after the government agreed to move her to regular deportation proceedings, where she can plead her case before a judge. The case raised concerns that the Trump administration was attempting to expand the use of expedited removal to speed up deportations.</p>

          <p>A regulatory filing has revealed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a new stake in the beleaguered insurer UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares worth approximately $1.6 billion. The investment is notable given UnitedHealth's stock has fallen nearly 50% this year amid public backlash over healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation. However, the move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in troubled companies. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's stock rose 6% in extended trading, as the investment signals confidence from one of the world's most respected investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI-powered software company Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge since its 2020 public debut, with its stock growing over 1,700% and its market valuation exceeding $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been lucrative government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its astronomical valuation, which dwarfs that of tech giants with far greater revenue, the company's commercial business is also showing strong growth. The stock's high forward price-to-earnings ratio indicates that investors are paying a significant premium based on high expectations for its future in AI. (not investment advice)</p>

After brief stints with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars, Rees-Zammit failed to secure a breakthrough in American football.

          <p>New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology advise a more aggressive approach to treating high blood pressure and recommend abstaining from alcohol. The updated recommendations suggest that individuals with systolic blood pressure between 130 and 139 should first try lifestyle changes, but begin medication if levels don't improve within three to six months. This is a shift from the previous threshold of 140. Citing growing evidence of alcohol's negative impact on blood pressure, the guidelines now suggest complete abstinence as the ideal, a change from previous advice on moderate consumption.</p>
