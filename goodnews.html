Additionally, Trump announced that the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will be held at the Kennedy Center in December.</p>

          <p>With trillions of dollars in real estate expected to be passed down to younger generations, wealth advisors are highlighting strategies for a smooth transfer that minimizes taxes and family conflict. Experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust at death to take advantage of a "step-up in basis," which reduces capital gains taxes for heirs if they sell. Using legal structures like LLCs can also protect the property from lawsuits and allow for clear operating agreements that dictate usage, maintenance costs, and buyout provisions.

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes the subtle political messaging behind Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's choice of clothing for his recent meeting with President Trump at the White House. After being criticized for his "bunker-chic" look during a previous combative visit, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black blazer and collared shirt, seemingly signaling a desire for a more serious conversation. The article compares this to historical examples, like Winston Churchill's air-raid suit, to argue that what politicians wear can be a powerful, non-verbal tool in high-stakes diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The latest season of the animated show "South Park" is garnering record ratings for its direct and scathing critique of the Trump administration, with parodies of figures like Kristi Noem and JD Vance. The show's creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are launching this unrestrained satire at a sensitive time for their parent company, Paramount, which has been under intense pressure from the administration. Despite this, a billion-dollar streaming deal for the show suggests that its business value as a popular franchise is currently outweighing political considerations for the company.</p>

          <p>In the face of increasingly powerful hurricanes, some Florida residents and developers are focusing on building more resilient communities further inland and at higher elevations. The town of Babcock Ranch, which bills itself as "Florida's first storm-proof town," was designed with features like native landscaping to absorb water and reinforced homes, allowing it to withstand Hurricane Ian with minimal damage. Meanwhile, non-profits and city programs in areas like Miami are helping low-income residents rebuild their homes with hurricane-proofing features to protect them from future storms.</p>

          <p>A wave of younger, social-media-savvy Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against some of the party's most senior incumbents, citing a need for generational change and greater urgency. These challengers argue that the party's aging establishment has grown complacent and out of touch, failing to effectively counter the threats posed by the Trump administration. Frustrated by what they see as a party "sleepwalking into dystopia," they are no longer willing to wait their turn and are pushing for new energy and vision in Congress.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has fulfilled a lifelong goal by receiving his high school diploma, decades after his education was cut short by the severe abuse he suffered at Florida's notorious Dozier School for Boys. Horne attended the brutal reform school in the 1960s and later dropped out of high school to support his family. He was able to earn his diploma through a state compensation program for victims of abuse at Dozier, and he hopes his story inspires others to overcome obstacles and never give up.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists are highlighting a key benefit of tinted sunscreens: they protect against visible light, which standard sunscreens do not. Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, conditions involving dark patches on the skin that are more common in people of color. The key ingredient is iron oxide, which gives the sunscreen its tint and blocks this type of radiation, making it a more effective choice for individuals concerned with these specific skin issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, resumed its eruption on Friday, with its north vent shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet into the air. The activity, which is the 31st such display since December, is currently contained within the summit crater and poses no threat to homes. The eruption provides a spectacular show for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, with scientists explaining that the dramatic fountains are caused by gas-rich magma rising rapidly through narrow vents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of recent devastating fires in Los Angeles County, residents are taking soil cleanup into their own hands due to what they see as an inadequate government response. With concerns about contaminants like lead from burned homes, many are attending workshops on bioremediation, which uses plants, fungi, and minerals to detoxify the soil. This grassroots movement provides a sense of empowerment and an environmentally friendly alternative to the standard method of scraping and removing topsoil, which often just moves the problem to another location.</p>
