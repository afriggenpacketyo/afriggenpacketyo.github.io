          <h2>China Agrees to Resume Japanese Seafood Imports Following Fukushima Wastewater Release</h2>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japanese authorities expect China to issue a public notice easing the ban and opening registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue seeking the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. This move is seen as a positive step towards resolving tensions between the two countries, though the registration and radiation checks may take several months before shipments can begin.</p>

          <p>Businesses near Fort Bragg, North Carolina, are facing financial burdens due to the installation's name changes. Ralph Rodriguez, owner of a pawn and gun shop, initially named his business Fort Liberty Pawn & Gun, anticipating support from the military community, however, the installation was rechristened Fort Bragg, this time in honor of World War II paratrooper Roland Bragg of Maine. This decision requires him to spend approximately $30,000 to update signage, uniforms, and other materials. While some businesses are sticking with the name Liberty, others are reverting to Bragg to avoid alienating customers, highlighting the challenges of navigating local sentiments amidst political changes.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man survived after being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. Kell Morris' wife held his head above water while waiting for rescuers, who were eventually transported to the remote location by a sled dog tourism company's helicopter. Rescuers used inflatable airbags and brute force to lift the boulder off Morris, who was then airlifted to a local hospital by an Alaska National Guard helicopter. Morris attributes his survival to luck, his wife's quick thinking, and divine intervention.</p>

          <p>President Trump has teased Elon Musk's departure from his official role in the Trump administration, stating it will be his "last day, but not really" at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's government service is ending due to the legal 130-day limit for his "special government employee" designation, during which DOGE has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts. Despite criticism from Democrats in Congress, markets have welcomed Musk's return to the private sector, and he plans to allocate more time to Tesla and SpaceX (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is expected to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of construction to reinforce tracks subject to landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction, which includes placing 5,900 tons of large boulders and up to 240,000 cubic yards of sand along the rail line. The total cost of the projects is estimated to be about $300 million, addressing recurring interruptions to passenger rail service. Service on the Pacific Surfliner and Metrolink are scheduled to resume normally starting June 7.</p>
