          <h2>Study Reveals Nontraditional Factors in Heart Attacks Are Often Overlooked, Especially in Women</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 15:14:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Mayo Clinic study finds that over half of heart attacks in women under 65 are caused by factors other than clogged arteries, such as arterial tears (SCAD) and embolisms. These nontraditional causes are frequently misdiagnosed, leading to less effective or even harmful treatments. The research highlights a significant difference from men, for whom clogged arteries account for 75% of heart attacks. Experts emphasize the need for clinicians to be more aware of these varied causes to improve diagnosis and long-term outcomes for younger patients, particularly women.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after her iconic song "Lovin' You" topped the charts, the late singer Minnie Riperton will be honored with a tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl. The event will feature performances by Stevie Wonder, who co-produced her seminal album "Perfect Angel," along with George Benson, Lizz Wright, and others. Riperton, known for her five-octave vocal range, died of breast cancer in 1979 at age 31, but her influence continues to resonate with contemporary artists. The concert aims to celebrate her unique musical legacy and introduce her work to a new generation of listeners.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after falling into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on forested land in Pembroke, Maine. The property owner discovered the trapped animal and alerted the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. In a five-hour operation, wardens sedated the moose and used an excavator to carefully lift it to safety. The animal was unharmed and ran off after the sedative wore off, and the family has since capped the well to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Health officials worldwide, including the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization, are refuting President Trump's recent claims linking acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, to autism. These organizations reiterated that available evidence does not establish a causal link and that the painkiller remains an important and safe option for pregnant women when necessary. They also pushed back against Trump's discredited suggestions about vaccines causing autism. Medical experts warned that untreated fever or pain during pregnancy can pose significant risks to both the mother and the fetus.</p>

          <p>England has named its squad for the 2025 Ashes tour in Australia, featuring what is being described as its most hostile group of fast bowlers in decades. The attack, which includes Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Josh Tongue, is designed to counter Australia's powerful batting lineup on their home pitches. The article notes that with talismanic captain Ben Stokes recovering from injury, the team's success may hinge on the durability of this pace-focused bowling unit. The selection strategy marks a clear shift from previous tours, aiming to fight Australia's aggressive style with similar intensity.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball's competition committee has approved the use of an automated ball-strike (ABS) system, often called "robot umpires," starting in the 2026 season. Human umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams will now have the ability to challenge two calls per game using the ABS technology. The system, which has been tested extensively in the minor leagues, is expected to increase accuracy and reduce on-field arguments and ejections related to ball and strike calls. Teams will retain their challenge if an appeal is successful.</p>

          <p>An article explains the "Medigap birthday rule," a provision in some states that allows Medicare beneficiaries an annual window to switch their supplemental insurance plans without medical underwriting. This rule provides a crucial opportunity for seniors to change to a more affordable or suitable plan, even if they have developed pre-existing conditions that would normally prevent them from doing so. Currently available in about 18 states, the rule's specifics vary, but it generally allows switching to a plan with equal or lesser benefits around the time of the beneficiary's birthday.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, homeowners may find Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) to be an attractive borrowing option. A financial analysis shows that a $60,000 HELOC at the current average rate of 8.05% would result in monthly payments of approximately $730 for a 10-year term or $575 for a 15-year term. The article suggests that with the potential for further rate cuts, the variable rate of a HELOC could lead to even lower payments in the future, making it a flexible tool for financing major expenses.
