          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Guoqing recently toured the Zhejiang province, urging manufacturers to integrate advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and large language models into their operations. He emphasized the importance of supporting specialized firms that focus on novel and unique products, such as all-solid-state batteries, to build the nation's manufacturing strength. The visit highlights China's strategic push towards developing "new quality productive forces" by increasing R&D investment and fostering expertise in niche industrial sectors. This initiative is part of a broader national focus on both high-tech advancement and social issues.</p>

          <p>China is undertaking the construction of a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet, a venture described as a "project of the century" due to its immense engineering challenges and cost. The railway will traverse extremely difficult terrain, including mountain ranges and permafrost zones, at an average altitude of over 4,500 meters. The total investment for the project could reach an estimated 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), making it one of the most expensive rail lines ever built in the country. A state-owned company has been established to oversee the construction and operation of this strategically significant infrastructure project.</p>

          <p>The European Union has started the phased introduction of its new digital border system, known as the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track when non-EU citizens enter and leave the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces manual passport stamping, requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, upon their first entry. While EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long run, there are concerns about potential delays during the initial registration process at ports, airports, and rail terminals. The system is expected to be fully operational at all Schengen border crossings by April 2026.</p>

          <p>The Welsh political party Plaid Cymru has affirmed its commitment to creating a formal plan for Welsh independence, though party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has clarified this would not occur within the first term of a Plaid-led government. At the party's conference, members endorsed a proposal to establish a "standing commission" to engage the public on Wales's constitutional future and prepare a white paper on independence. This represents a shift from a previous pledge to hold a referendum within five years, signaling a more long-term strategic approach to the question of Welsh sovereignty. The party also advocates for devolving the power to call a referendum to Wales.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to lead the national team to the World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the painful 2022 play-off defeat to Ukraine. With Scotland currently level on points with Denmark in their qualifying group, Clarke is focused on securing a victory against Belarus to strengthen their position. He has successfully guided the team to the last two European Championships, ending a long major tournament drought. However, the memory of missing out on the last World Cup remains a powerful motivator for the coach and his squad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the genetic process that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a complete new plant. Their research, published in the journal Cell, identifies two genetic switches that can revert a differentiated somatic cell back to an embryonic state, a phenomenon known as somatic embryogenesis. This ability was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. The breakthrough by researchers from Shandong Agricultural University, BGI-Research, and Radboud University provides fundamental new insights into one of biology's most profound regenerative processes.</p>

          <p>Despite being the all-time leading goalscorer for both England and Tottenham Hotspur, and continuing his prolific form at Bayern Munich, there is a debate over whether striker Harry Kane receives the recognition he deserves. The article examines his record-breaking career, including winning a Bundesliga title and reaching 100 goals for Bayern faster than superstars like Haaland or Ronaldo did for their clubs. Pundits suggest that his understated personality and England's lack of major tournament victories may contribute to him being undervalued. However, they emphasize his complete skill set and consistent brilliance, placing him among the world's elite players.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted US$5 billion in Chinese loans, originally taken to finance its Standard Gauge Railway, from US dollars to Chinese yuan. The Kenyan Treasury announced the move is expected to save the country US$215 million in annual debt-servicing costs. This strategic financial decision is seen by analysts as a potential model for other debt-distressed African nations. By shifting its debt denomination, Kenya not only gains immediate financial relief but also potentially deepens its economic ties with China, signaling a broader geopolitical trend on the continent.
