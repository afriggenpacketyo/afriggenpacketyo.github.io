While he acknowledged having initial concerns regarding the administration's market-roiling tariff policies, he ultimately expressed his trust in the president's leadership and noted a general decline in geopolitical market risk during his tenure.

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat experienced a massive rally, jumping 47% on Tuesday after having already surged over 127% on Monday in its best trading day ever. The dramatic price increase was triggered by the stock's addition to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a significant short squeeze, as over 63% of its available shares had been sold short by investors. This marks a remarkable turnaround for the former penny stock, which also benefited from a concurrent announcement of an expanded distribution deal with Walmart across the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

In his measured response, Amodei emphasized that Anthropic shares the administration's key goals of ensuring AI benefits all Americans and maintaining the nation's leadership in the field, stating the company is willing to work collaboratively with anyone serious about AI policy.</p>
