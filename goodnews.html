          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, at 76, has performed his final concert, reuniting with his Black Sabbath bandmates for a farewell show in Birmingham, England. The event featured an all-star lineup of musicians, including members of Metallica and Guns N’ Roses, paying tribute to the iconic heavy metal vocalist. Despite his ongoing health issues, including Parkinson's disease, Osbourne performed several of his hits while seated on a throne. The show marks the end of his touring career, which he had previously cancelled due to his physical condition, concluding a celebrated and influential chapter in rock music history.</p>

The team's win was anchored by a dominant defensive performance from Funmi Fadoju, who was named player of the match. This victory prevented Loughborough Lightning from achieving a third consecutive title and marked a historic moment for the victorious club in front of a crowd of 10,000 fans.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina early Sunday morning. The system brought heavy rain to the region, and while tropical storm warnings have been canceled, concerns about potential flash flooding persist as it moves into North Carolina. The National Hurricane Center forecasts the system will continue to weaken as it moves northeast. South Carolina's emergency management division had previously warned residents about the possibility of minor coastal flooding and isolated tornadoes, urging caution on water-covered roads as the storm passed through the area.</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the general outlines of new trade deals are becoming clear ahead of a key tariff deadline this week. With a 90-day pause on sweeping U.S. tariffs set to expire, the administration is finalizing agreements and preparing to send letters to countries where negotiations are not sufficiently advanced. Hassett indicated that a number of deals have been negotiated and that the president's threat of high tariffs is successfully encouraging companies to move production and investment into the United States, thereby creating jobs.

          <p>Leaders from the BRICS group of developing nations convened in Rio de Janeiro, using the summit to criticize unilateral US trade tariffs and call for an updated system of global governance. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva highlighted the "unparalleled collapse of multilateralism" and stated the bloc must help reflect a new multipolar reality. The summit is notably missing Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who participated via video link. In his remarks, Putin claimed the model of liberal globalization is becoming obsolete as economic activity shifts toward emerging markets.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won a chaotic and rain-affected British Grand Prix, marking his first victory at his home race at Silverstone. Norris inherited the lead after his teammate Oscar Piastri, who had been leading, received a 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety-car restart. The dramatic race, held in front of a record crowd, also saw Nico Hulkenberg secure his first-ever podium finish for Sauber. The victory narrows the gap in the drivers' championship between Norris and the leader, Piastri, to just eight points after an action-packed and memorable event.</p>

          <p>Andrew Williams, a 6-foot-5 athlete from Fremont High in South Los Angeles, is hoping to inspire other inner-city players after committing to play football for USC. Once an unknown prospect without any recruiting rankings, Williams received a scholarship offer directly from the Trojans' coaching staff, which he quickly accepted. With a 3.8 GPA, he aims to challenge the perception that talent has diminished in the L.A. City Section, which was once a recruiting stronghold for major college programs. Williams hopes his journey serves as an example that hard work can create opportunities for underprivileged student-athletes.</p>

          <p>Experts with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) are advocating for structural changes to effectively counter the growing threat of unmanned aerial vehicles. In an article in the PLA's official newspaper, they suggest that China's military will likely need to establish specialized counter-drone combat units capable of rapid responses. This call for reform comes as drones have played an increasingly decisive role in recent conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and clashes in the Middle East. The proposed changes would focus on integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into the military's existing structure.</p>
