          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed Micah Parsons' claim that Jones never contacted him after Parsons was traded to the Green Bay Packers. Jones stated he stopped calling Parsons because the player had previously asked him to remove his number. Despite the 40-40 tie between the Cowboys and Packers, Jones expressed satisfaction with the trade, believing it was the right move for the team. Parsons recorded one sack and three tackles in his return to Dallas, reflecting on the 'painful' experience of playing against his former quarterback.</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old man attempting a 20-mile marathon swim from Santa Catalina Island to San Pedro was bitten by a 3-to-4-foot shark early Tuesday. The "rare attack" resulted in non-life-threatening injuries to the swimmer's leg and foot, who was awake and conversing when rescued. Emergency services quickly responded, transporting him to a non-trauma facility. Authorities noted the swimmer and his crew departed at midnight to avoid busy shipping lanes, and an LAFD captain remarked on the unusual nature of a shark attack in that area.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly integrating robotics into its society and economy, installing nearly 300,000 new robots last year, exceeding the rest of the world combined. This push is seen as a direct path to achieving independence in core AI technologies, with a focus on embodied intelligence and a complete physical AI supply chain. Beijing's cohesive long-term policy framework, including initiatives like Made in China 2025, promotes widespread robotics adoption across various sectors. This strategy aims to cultivate massive domestic demand for advanced AI capabilities and its own AI chips, exemplified by Huawei's open-source initiatives.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to reduce disaster relief and anti-terrorism funding for states with "sanctuary" policies. California, alongside ten other states and D.C., argued these cuts illegally cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. The states contended that the funding, authorized post-9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, is crucial for first responders and disaster preparedness, distributed evenhandedly for decades. Attorney General Rob Bonta hailed the decision as a victory against unlawful, politically motivated funding grabs, emphasizing the life-and-death stakes involved.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Considers Raising Minimum Wage for Residential Construction Workers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Los Angeles is exploring a proposal to raise the minimum wage for residential construction workers to over $32 an hour, plus an additional healthcare credit. The motion, introduced by councilmembers Curren Price and Hugo Soto-Martinez, aims to attract workers amid pressures to rebuild units lost in the Palisades fire and fears of immigration raids. Supporters, including construction unions and housing groups, argue that higher wages and benefits are essential to protect non-union, often foreign-born, workers vulnerable to exploitation. A study will analyze the economic effects of this proposed wage increase.</p>

          <p>Nike achieved a surprise 1% sales growth in its fiscal first quarter, exceeding expectations, yet its turnaround strategy remains a work in progress. Despite the revenue increase, profits fell 31% and gross margin declined, signaling continued challenges in clearing old inventory. CEO Elliott Hill noted progress in wholesale, running, and North America sales, but acknowledged struggles in other business areas like direct sales and China. The company is restructuring its corporate divisions and focusing on innovation and women's consumer growth, with efforts like the Skims partnership.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the Trump administration, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. Judge William Young issued a scathing 161-page decision, asserting the administration's actions constituted an "unconstitutional suppression of free speech." He criticized the use of masked agents for detentions and President Trump's "palpable misunderstanding" of free speech. The State Department defended its right to revoke visas for those deemed a risk, but the ruling is a significant legal rebuke.</p>

While a single state law may not prevent all disasters, it aims to regulate rapidly advancing AI before it outpaces oversight.
