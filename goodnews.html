          <p>A Soviet space probe, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, reentered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean after a malfunction prevented it from reaching Venus. The probe, part of the Venera program, was intended to deliver a lander to study Venus's surface and atmosphere. Roscosmos confirmed the reentry, stating that the spacecraft no longer exists, while the European Space Agency supported this conclusion.

Miran also highlighted the administration's focus on deregulation to encourage domestic production and competitiveness, while refuting claims that tariffs will inevitably raise costs for consumers, suggesting businesses will adapt supply chains.</p>

          <p>The Channel Islands, often called California's Galapagos, are home to a diverse underwater ecosystem protected by marine protected areas (MPAs). These areas, covering roughly 21% of the islands' waters, serve as a refuge for thousands of species. However, the California fish and game commission is conducting a review of these MPAs, considering proposals to either expand or reduce protections. Scientists and conservationists hope the thriving biodiversity will demonstrate the value of preservation, while commercial fishers express concerns about restricted access.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, which failed to launch to Venus in 1972, has plunged back to Earth after 53 years stuck in orbit. The spacecraft had an uncontrolled reentry, with its remains potentially surviving the descent due to its sturdy construction.
