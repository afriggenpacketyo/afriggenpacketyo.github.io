          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners at the Orgreave coking plant, a pivotal event during the year-long miners' strike. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to address unanswered questions that have persisted for 40 years. The investigation will examine the events of the day and the subsequent failed prosecutions of 95 miners, which collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought this for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the decision to finally uncover the truth behind one of Britain's most contentious industrial disputes.</p>

          <p>In response to persistent deflation and an uncertain economic outlook, Chinese investors are increasingly turning to bond-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Assets under management in these funds have surged from $10 billion to over $50 billion since early last year, with corporate bond ETFs showing the fastest growth. Investors are attracted to the lower costs, diversification, and potentially higher returns compared to direct bond investments. This trend reflects a broader shift towards low-risk, fixed-income assets as a hedge against economic instability and weak domestic consumption in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from approximately 30 major companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage new domestic investment. The "Made for Germany" initiative aims to restore confidence in the nation's economy, which has struggled through two years of recession. While the government has approved billions in tax relief and a large infrastructure fund, it emphasizes that private sector participation is crucial for recovery. This high-level meeting signals a concerted effort to combat inflation, high energy prices, and global competition affecting Europe's largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, following the completion of critical infrastructure projects led by Chinese firms. For years, logistical challenges, particularly the lack of railways connecting remote mines to ports, have hindered exports from these African nations. In Guinea, the massive Simandou mine is now on track to start shipments, while a new railway will connect Algeria's Gara Djebilet mine to Mediterranean ports. These developments highlight China's strategic investments to secure vital industrial resources from the continent.</p>

          <p>Despite years of facing stringent U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese technology giant Huawei has strategically pivoted to become a leader across China's artificial intelligence landscape. The company has expanded beyond its traditional telecom focus into AI chips, data centers, and large language models, creating a comprehensive "full-stack" AI portfolio. Nvidia's CEO has identified Huawei as a "formidable" competitor, particularly in developing alternatives to U.S. AI hardware like the Ascend 910B chip.

Officials hope the Luobei Airport will stimulate the local economy by improving connectivity and boosting trade, particularly with neighboring Russia. The airport is expected to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually, representing a significant gamble on infrastructure-led growth.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison where he was serving a 34-year sentence. His gang is blamed for much of the escalating violence in Ecuador and is suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. This extradition represents a major step in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime and was enabled by a recent referendum.</p>

          <p>A new class of popular weight loss and diabetes drugs, known as GLP-1s, may be a game-changing treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Some patients in early studies and anecdotal reports have experienced significant improvements in PCOS symptoms, including weight loss, regulation of menstrual cycles, and reduced androgen levels. Experts believe the drugs work indirectly by improving insulin sensitivity, which is often disrupted in women with PCOS. While more extensive research is needed, this development offers new hope for managing a complex condition for which treatment options have been limited.</p>
