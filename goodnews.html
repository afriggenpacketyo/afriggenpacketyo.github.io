          <p>The highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 launched on Thursday, experiencing shortages and special store opening hours due to high demand. Nintendo hopes the new console will sustain its stock rally, which has increased fivefold since the original Switch's release in 2017. Analysts predict strong sales, with some forecasting 20 million units in the first year, surpassing the original Switch's debut. Despite potential tariff uncertainties, Nintendo aims to sell 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026, reflecting confidence in the console's success.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a record decrease in April, primarily due to a significant drop in import demand as companies and consumers reduced purchases ahead of President Trump's tariffs. The deficit decreased to $61.6 billion, a $76.7 billion reduction from the previous month, surpassing economists' expectations. This shift follows a surge in imports preceding Trump's announcement of widespread tariffs. While a reduced deficit might seem positive, some economists caution that it reflects decreased international trade, which has generally benefited the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously sided with an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who claimed she was discriminated against by her employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services, due to her heterosexual orientation.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, writing for the court, stated that Ames was unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group.

          <p>President Trump has issued a new travel ban for people from 12 countries, aiming to avoid the legal challenges faced by his original ban. Key differences include a broader scope and clearly defined exemptions, making it more legally robust. While there are similarities to the 2017 ban, the new order does not expressly target Muslim-majority states, potentially increasing its chances of being upheld by the Supreme Court. Legal experts note that Trump appears to have learned from the past, crafting a ban that is more likely to withstand legal scrutiny.</p>
