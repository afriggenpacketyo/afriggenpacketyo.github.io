          <p>BP announced second-quarter profits of $2.35 billion, significantly exceeding analyst expectations amid volatile energy prices. The strong performance aims to rebuild investor confidence after a period of underperformance compared to its peers. The British energy major also revealed its largest oil and gas discovery in 25 years off the coast of Brazil, providing a substantial boost as the company continues to focus on hydrocarbon exploration and production. This news comes as BP has been the subject of takeover speculation, though rival Shell has denied any intention of making an offer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a drop in second-quarter revenues, attributing the decline to lower prices for crude oil and refined chemical products. Despite this, the company's adjusted net income of $24.5 billion surpassed analyst forecasts, and CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism for a strong second half of 2025, anticipating a significant increase in oil demand. The results come as crude prices remain under pressure from an uncertain global economic outlook and U.S. tariffs. The company plans to boost investor returns through a base dividend and a performance-linked dividend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the new Fantasy Premier League season approaching, BBC Sport has compiled advice from FPL experts and last season's league winner to help managers succeed. Key strategies include planning transfers in blocks of fixtures rather than week-to-week, balancing premium players, and quickly rectifying mistakes. Experts also advise watching full matches to gain context beyond statistics, a method that last year's winner used to great effect by relying on gut instinct and the 'eye test' over data analysis. Other tips include prioritizing players who take penalties and set-pieces and not overspending on defensive options to allow for greater flexibility elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Following a narrow series loss to India, analysis points to England's heavy reliance on captain Ben Stokes for success in the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. Despite concerns about his recurring injuries, Stokes is seen as the central figure whose performance, leadership, and fitness will determine England's chances of winning on Australian soil for the first time since 2010-11. The article notes that England's batting lineup appears strong but that the team's success is deeply intertwined with Stokes' presence. The challenge is immense, as Australia holds a strong home record and boasts a formidable bowling attack.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a new plan to strengthen its domestic cattle industry in response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports. The policy, announced by the nation's top economic planner and nine other government departments, aims to increase local beef production and promote consumption through a new quality-grading system. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to enhance key agricultural sectors and improve the nutritional balance of residents' diets by increasing the intake of high-quality proteins. Wholesale beef prices have rebounded slightly from an eight-year low but remain significantly below pre-2023 levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been instructed to stop deportations under President Trump's asylum ban. The directive came after a D.C. Circuit Court panel partially limited the ban, ruling that it cannot be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. According to CBS News, Customs and Border Protection officials were told over the weekend to cease deportations related to the ban and instead process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law. This development is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the administration's broad restrictions on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a defense deal valued at $6.5 billion. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described it as the largest defense-industry agreement ever made between the two nations, emphasizing their close strategic alignment. The advanced, stealthy warships are equipped with long-range missile capabilities. The first three frigates will be built in Japan, with the remaining eight to be constructed in Western Australia. This purchase is part of Australia's broader military restructuring to counter China's expansion and aims to more than double its fleet of major warships over the next decade.</p>

Officials noted that UPS was cooperative and had already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs.

          <p>Researchers have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle, in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The find was part of a project surveying caverns and sinkholes, which also uncovered evidence of the area being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. The project, a partnership between archaeologists and local cavers, aims to better understand the long history of human farming and land use on the fells. These discoveries help shed light on the prehistoric life of those who lived and farmed in the region thousands of years ago.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump praised the retailer's marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a Truth Social post, Trump endorsed the 'HOTTEST' ad, which had faced online criticism for allegedly promoting eugenics, and encouraged his followers to buy the jeans. The president contrasted the campaign with what he called 'woke' advertising from other brands. The stock rally is the latest development in a meme-driven surge for the company, which has been facing significant financial challenges, including a recent withdrawal of its full-year guidance due to slow sales.
