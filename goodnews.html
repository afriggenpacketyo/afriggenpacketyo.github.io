          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 17:51:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Commerce Department report indicates that U.S. inflation slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% year-over-year, down from 2.3% in March. Core prices, excluding food and energy, rose 2.5%, also a decrease from March. Despite rising incomes, American spending slowed, potentially reflecting consumer caution in response to higher goods prices. The report suggests that President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted prices, although some economists anticipate a reversal in the inflation trend later in the year as companies pass along tariff costs to consumers.

          <p>President Trump lauded Elon Musk for his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), despite the program achieving fewer cost savings than initially projected. During a joint appearance, Trump presented Musk with a golden key to the White House, praising his efforts to reform government operations. Musk vowed that his departure was "not the end" of DOGE and expressed confidence in achieving $1 trillion in savings. The initiative faced criticism from labor unions and Democrats, who protested against mass firings and unorthodox cost-cutting methods.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has contradicted Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policy by keeping its advice that children may receive COVID-19 shots.

          <p>Wall Street has developed a trading strategy known as the "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out) to profit from President Trump's tariff announcements. Investors have observed that markets often decline when Trump announces new tariffs, but he frequently lowers or delays the measures, leading to a subsequent market rally. This pattern has allowed traders to buy the dip and profit from the rebound. Trump has expressed anger over the expression, indicating that the traders' assessment of his negotiating style may be accurate.</p>

She credited the new leadership regime of Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards for helping to take the pressure off. Edwards' tactical decision to promote Jones back up the order proved successful, as she repaid the faith with a stellar performance.</p>
