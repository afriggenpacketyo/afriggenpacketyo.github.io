Researchers from The Woodland Trust and Arboricultural Association are analyzing its DNA, hoping to understand how oaks can live for over 1,000 years. This knowledge aims to inform future tree planting strategies to restore depleted woodlands and boost biodiversity, as ancient oaks support over 2,300 species.

          <p>Starting January 2026, all young children in England and Wales will receive a free chickenpox vaccine through the NHS, administered in two doses alongside the existing MMR jab. This initiative aims to protect children from severe complications, reduce lost income for parents, and will include a catch-up campaign for slightly older children. Health officials anticipate a dramatic reduction in cases, with the highly contagious varicella zoster virus causing serious illness in rare instances. Experts emphasize the vaccine's potential to be a "life saver" for some, offering near-zero risk of contracting the disease.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after World War II, China-Japan relations exhibit a complex "love-hate dynamic," influenced by historical trauma, geopolitical factors, and economic ties. A harrowing Chinese film on the Nanking massacre has reignited memories of wartime atrocities, grossing over $377 million and drawing millions of viewers. Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan surged, making China Japan's top source of inbound visitors.
