          <p>China is intensifying its efforts to become the global leader in the critical technology sectors of artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. The country's strategy in AI leverages vast amounts of data to train new models, which could give it a significant advantage in the industry's expansion and innovation. Simultaneously, China's electric vehicle market is experiencing a fierce price war, a move aimed at solidifying its dominance both domestically and internationally. These parallel pushes highlight a concerted national strategy to control key future technologies and their associated global supply chains.</p>

          <p>Indian captain Shubman Gill scored a monumental 269 runs, the highest score by an Indian batter in England, to put his team in a commanding position against England in the second Test at Edgbaston. India amassed a total of 587 runs, after which their bowlers swiftly dismantled England's top order, leaving them at 77-3 by the close of day two. The performance gives India a significant advantage as they aim to level the series. England now faces an immense challenge to avoid defeat, requiring an extraordinary comeback to overcome the massive first-innings deficit.</p>

          <p>The United States labor market demonstrated continued resilience in June, adding 147,000 jobs and surpassing economists' expectations. This steady growth lowered the national unemployment rate to 4.1 percent, its lowest point since February. The government and healthcare sectors saw the most significant gains, although federal employment continued to decline due to agency cuts. Despite the positive report, economists remain cautious, anticipating a potential slowdown later in the year due to trade policy uncertainties and the potential impact of tariffs on inflation and economic activity.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 15:03:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen for the fifth consecutive week, with the average 30-year rate now at 6.67%, providing a potential window of opportunity for prospective homebuyers. This downward trend comes as markets anticipate the Federal Reserve may cut its benchmark rate later this year, which could further lower borrowing costs. Financial experts advise that current buyers should prepare by checking their credit reports for accuracy, researching qualified real estate agents, and getting pre-approved for a mortgage. Taking these steps now could position buyers avantageously before a potential market flood if rates continue to drop. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, 45, has revealed that she suffered for years from extreme period pain and anemia that doctors dismissed before she was properly treated for uterine fibroids. Williams described her symptoms as debilitating, yet was repeatedly told her discomfort was normal. She finally sought specialized treatment after seeing an ad on social media, leading to a myomectomy surgery that successfully removed the fibroids. Williams is now sharing her story to raise awareness and encourage other women to advocate for their health and not accept dismissive medical advice.</p>

          <p>A new documentary titled "Nobu" chronicles the life and career of Nobu Matsuhisa, the world-renowned sushi master behind the iconic restaurant empire. The film traces his journey from humble beginnings in Japan and Peru to establishing a global brand synonymous with high-end dining, aided by co-founder Robert De Niro. While the documentary offers a gentle chronological look at his life, some critics note it focuses more on his personal story and celebrity connections than the specifics of his culinary innovation. The film highlights how precision and exclusivity were key to his success in the power-dining scene of 1980s Los Angeles.</p>
