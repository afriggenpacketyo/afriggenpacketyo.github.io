          <p>Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP), led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, secured a landslide victory in the general election, marking Wong's first election as prime minister.

The election took place against a backdrop of economic challenges, including slowing growth and trade uncertainties, with Wong having previously cautioned about a potential recession in 2025.

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships avoid legal marriage due to the country's surname law, which mandates that couples share a last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, an organization advocating for separate surnames, indicates that this concern is particularly prevalent among people in their 20s, with approximately 40% citing it as a barrier. The Justice Ministry acknowledges that Japan is the only country, to its knowledge, that requires couples to adopt a single surname upon marriage. This issue continues to be a point of contention, with differing views among political parties regarding potential reforms.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's 'golden passport' scheme, ending the practice of selling EU citizenship in exchange for investments. The court deemed such schemes a 'mere commercial transaction' that undermines the solidarity and mutual trust among EU member states. While the ruling targets citizenship-for-investment programs, concerns remain about 'golden visas,' which offer residence permits for significant investments. Anti-corruption advocates hope the decision will lead to greater scrutiny and regulation of these residency-by-investment schemes, highlighting risks of money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption.</p>
