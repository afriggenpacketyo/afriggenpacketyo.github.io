          <p>Rupert Lowe, formerly a Reform MP for Great Yarmouth, will not face criminal charges related to an allegation of threats. The Crown Prosecution Service made the decision after a thorough review of evidence, concluding that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Lowe had been suspended by the party in March amid claims of threats towards the party's chairman. The CPS considered witness statements before reaching its decision.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry plans to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, to combat the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy would fully cover normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes childbirth as it is not considered a medical condition. Medical institutions currently set their own prices for deliveries, leading to significant cost variations across prefectures. Obstetricians have raised concerns about potential financial strain on medical institutions due to reduced revenue under the unified pricing system.</p>

          <p>Market volatility is creating concern for college savers, but financial experts advise against panicking and liquidating 529 accounts. Families should check their asset allocation and consider de-risking a portion of their portfolio, while avoiding shifting entirely to cash. Recent changes have made 529 plans more worthwhile, including the ability to roll over unused funds to a Roth IRA and use funds for continuing education or student loans. For those needing to withdraw for tuition, using income or savings outside the 529 and reimbursing later could allow the market time to recover (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs President John Waldron indicated that investors have reduced their U.S. dollar assets, returning to a more neutral position on the currency. This shift follows increased tariff volatility, prompting investors to reposition portfolios.

Despite concerns about U.S. policymaking volatility, investors have not yet significantly reduced their holdings. Waldron noted demand for access to Chinese equities and fixed income products, stating that American firms are still able to operate in China.</p>
