          <p>A major retrospective exhibition in Bonn, Germany, is celebrating the five-decade career of acclaimed filmmaker Wim Wenders as he turns 80. The article explores his signature themes of movement, discovery, and finding connection in unfamiliar places, which are central to his work in film, photography, and writing. From his influential road movies in the New German Cinema movement to classics like "Paris, Texas" and "Wings of Desire," Wenders' art has consistently explored what it means to be a traveler in the world. The exhibition highlights his enduring creative journey and his philosophy that getting lost is a way to truly see.</p>

          <p>Japan's SoftBank Group has reported its second straight quarter of profit, exceeding market expectations with a net income of 421.8 billion yen ($2.87 billion). The positive result was largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its technology-focused Vision Fund investment arm. This financial performance comes as SoftBank continues its aggressive spending on artificial intelligence, including a major investment in OpenAI and the proposed acquisition of chip firm Ampere Computing. The company's recent profitability has been supported by gains from its older investments in companies like Alibaba and T-Mobile. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has expressed cautious optimism for the industry, signaling a recovery from a recent historic crisis. After two seasons of poor yields led to soaring prices, a bumper olive harvest in Spain has helped restore stability, causing a significant drop in raw material costs. This has allowed the company to lower shelf prices for consumers and increase investment in marketing to stimulate demand. The improved market conditions suggest a shift from a period of extreme volatility and scarcity to a more normalized and balanced landscape for the sector.</p>

          <p>China's trade data for July showed surprisingly strong performance, with exports growing 7.2% year-over-year, beating estimates. Imports also saw their largest increase in a year, rising 4.1%, which suggests a potential recovery in domestic demand. This robust trade activity, particularly strong exports to regions like Southeast Asia, has helped support China's economy amid ongoing tariff disputes with the United States. However, exports to the U.S. continued to shrink significantly, falling by 21.7%, highlighting the persistent impact of the trade tensions between the two economic giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring after a 25-year career, less than five months after returning from a challenging test flight on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The mission, intended to be brief, was extended to over nine months after the Starliner experienced multiple thruster failures and gas leaks en route to the International Space Station. Due to safety concerns, NASA ultimately decided to return Wilmore and his crewmate Suni Williams on a SpaceX capsule instead. Wilmore's retirement follows a distinguished career that included flights on the Space Shuttle, Soyuz, and Crew Dragon, marking him as a key figure in space exploration.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Contrast China's Controlled Debt with Rising US Federal Debt Concerns</h2>

          <p>While international concerns have long focused on China's "hidden" local government debt, some experts now argue that Beijing is successfully managing the risk through a sweeping restructuring campaign. A debt-swap program has allowed local governments to extend repayment periods, bringing a degree of control to the situation. In contrast, these analysts express growing alarm over the debt challenges in the United States, where the burden sits at the federal level. This perspective suggests a shifting financial landscape where China's state-controlled approach to its debt may be proving more stable than previously thought. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British athletics icon Jonathan Edwards has reflected on his triple jump world record of 18.29m, set 30 years ago, expressing surprise that it still stands. He suggests that the record's longevity might not be a positive sign for the health of track and field, questioning if the sport has kept pace with others in terms of professionalization and rewards for athletes. Edwards, who remains Britain's only world record holder in a regularly contested track and field event, also discussed his unique technique and the evolution of shoe technology. Despite his concerns, he admits it would be nice if the record, now a long-standing part of his identity, continues to endure.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has identified 37 young "de novo" genes, which are unique to humans and may be responsible for both advanced cognitive abilities and a susceptibility to cancer. These genes, which evolved from previously non-functional DNA, were found to have significantly increased expression in tumors. The research, published in Cell Genomics, suggests these unique genetic elements act like "dormant bombs," playing a key role in human evolution while also creating vulnerabilities. The findings provide one of the most rigorously validated catalogs of young human de novo genes to date, opening new avenues for understanding human-specific traits and diseases.</p>

          <p>This weekend, Jen Pawol is set to make history as the first woman to umpire a regular-season Major League Baseball game, working the series between the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves. The 48-year-old has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016 and has worked MLB spring training games for the past two years. Her debut marks a significant milestone, placing her among other pioneering female officials who have broken barriers in major men's professional sports leagues. The article also recognizes other women who were the first to officiate in the NFL, NBA, and at the men's World Cup.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Naturally Occurring Lithium is Vital for Brain Health and May Prevent Alzheimer's</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 22:58:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major new study from Harvard Medical School suggests that lithium, an element naturally present in the body, plays a critical role in brain health and could be key to preventing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that depleting lithium in mice led to brain changes associated with aging and accelerated Alzheimer's symptoms, while maintaining normal levels was protective. The study proposes that beta-amyloid plaques in the brain bind to and deplete available lithium, creating a downward spiral of neurodegeneration. This discovery could pave the way for new low-dose lithium treatments, though scientists caution against self-medication pending human trials.</p>

          <p>Eddie Palmieri, the legendary bandleader and pianist whose innovative style reshaped Latin music, has died at the age of 88. In the 1960s and 70s, his orchestra La Perfecta fused Afro-Caribbean rhythms with jazz, creating a new, highly percussive sound. Born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, Palmieri became a central figure in the city's burgeoning salsa and Latin jazz scene. Over a career spanning decades, he won multiple Grammy awards and was recognized as an NEA Jazz Master, leaving a legacy as one of the most influential and dynamic artists in the history of the genre.</p>
