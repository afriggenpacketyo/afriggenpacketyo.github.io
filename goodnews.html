        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Game 1 of the Western Conference finals, the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 114-88, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 31 points. After a slow start, Gilgeous-Alexander scored 20 points in the second half, while Julius Randle led Minnesota with 28 points. Anthony Edwards struggled, scoring only 18 points on 5-of-13 shooting, as the Thunder packed the paint defensively. Oklahoma City's victory came shortly after eliminating Denver in Game 7, while Minnesota had a week-long break before the game, and Minnesota will need to adjust their offensive strategy to counter Oklahoma City's defense in Game 2.</p>

          <p>Heavy storms are impacting the East Coast, with a Nor'easter heading toward New England, potentially disrupting Memorial Day weekend travel. The Nor'easter is expected to bring cold, windswept heavy rain to New England, including Boston, with gusts up to 50 mph and minor coastal flooding possible. Elsewhere, the Southeast is experiencing scattered severe storms, while the Mid-Atlantic region, including Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, is facing rain showers. Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania are under a flood watch due to the potential for heavy rainfall.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 07:21:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor National Park in Devon, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued permission was needed. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to access the commons for open-air recreation, including camping. The Dartmoor National Park Association hailed the decision as a landmark victory for access rights, emphasizing the importance of responsible camping. Campaigners are now calling for the right to wild camp to be extended to other parts of England.</p>

          <p>A team of doctors and vets in Pakistan is administering at least 400 pills a day to two elephants, Madhubala and Malika, suffering from tuberculosis. The medication, the same used to treat TB in humans, is hidden inside food like fruits and Pakistani sweets. The elephants initially resisted the treatment, but have gradually adapted to the procedure. The team is taking precautions to avoid contracting the contagious illness, which is endemic in Pakistan and can be transmitted from humans to elephants.</p>

          <p>Fragments of West Nile virus have been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to health officials. The virus was found in two samples of Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023. While there have been no human cases acquired in the UK to date, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says the risk to the general public is "very low". The detection is attributed to climate change, which is pushing mosquitoes and the diseases they carry further north.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla plans to deploy robotaxis on the streets of Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The robotaxi service will initially start with about 10 vehicles in Austin and scale up rapidly if the launch is successful. The vehicles will be Model Ys equipped with a forthcoming version of FSD, or full self-driving, known as FSD Unsupervised. Musk has been promising self-driving capabilities for years, though Tesla does not yet offer a vehicle safe to use without human supervision.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for Congress to pass President Trump's tax reform bill, highlighting its potential to reward hard work, bring jobs back home, and rebuild the American economy. The bill aims to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, and provide tax relief for seniors. It also includes measures to hold elite universities and nonprofits accountable, end Biden-era tax breaks, and ensure taxpayer-funded benefits serve citizens.

          <p>Lowe's has maintained its full-year forecast, attributing the stability to increased sales among home professionals, which offset slower demand from do-it-yourself customers. The company's first-quarter earnings beat estimates, though sales fell slightly short of expectations. Investments in stores, technology, and customer service are credited with helping the retailer navigate economic uncertainty and housing market challenges. Lowe's expects full-year total sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, with comparable sales being flat to up 1% year over year.</p>
