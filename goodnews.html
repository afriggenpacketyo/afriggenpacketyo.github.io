          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has candidly revealed the mental toll of the team's poor performance last season, admitting he often traveled to games with a sense of dread. Presiding over the club's worst season in decades, Amorim felt before matches that his team would struggle to be competitive, a feeling he described as deeply frustrating. Now, with a new season underway, he states he is changing the culture by enforcing stricter rules and holding players accountable, expressing a renewed belief that the team can improve and that he hopes to remain in the job for 20 years.</p>

The system is built using 960 proprietary Darwin 3 neuromorphic chips, which simulate more than 100 billion synapses, mimicking the structure of a biological brain. This groundbreaking computing system has already been used to power a brain-like large language model from the AI company DeepSeek. The university states this achievement is a significant step toward developing more advanced, human-like artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Top-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler, known for his dominant but stoic on-course demeanor, is earning praise for his comedic cameo in the new film "Happy Gilmore 2." The article suggests that while Scheffler's consistent excellence can make tournaments less dramatic, his self-effacing performance in the movie reveals a more fun-loving personality. In the film, he playfully references his real-life arrest at the PGA Championship earlier this year. This appearance is seen as a positive move for his public image and for the sport of golf, making the world's best player more relatable to fans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As major donors like the United States and the United Kingdom reduce their foreign aid budgets, a few other countries, notably Spain, are increasing their commitments. A decade after receiving a bailout, Spain is more than doubling its aid budget, aiming to reach the UN's target of 0.7% of gross national income by 2030. Ireland, South Korea, and Italy are also boosting their contributions, though these increases are not enough to fill the gap left by the larger nations. This shift could reshape global development, potentially leading to a more collaborative and less paternalistic approach to foreign aid.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study led by Chinese and Canadian scientists suggests that earthquakes could be a key energy source for microbial life in Earth's deep biosphere. This vast, hidden ecosystem is estimated to contain up to one-fifth of the planet's total biomass. The research proposes that seismic activity generates hydrogen gas from water reacting with fractured, silicon-rich rocks. This hydrogen can then be used as fuel by deep-dwelling microbes, providing a mechanism for survival in environments completely cut off from sunlight and surface nutrients, thus solving a long-standing mystery of deep-earth biology.</p>

          <p>In California's highly competitive 13th Congressional District, voters from diverse political backgrounds are united in their demand for the full release of government files on Jeffrey Epstein. Despite disagreeing on President Trump, both his supporters and detractors express frustration that his administration has not been more transparent, especially after campaigning on the issue. The sentiment, shared in interviews across the Central Valley swing district, reflects a broad, bipartisan desire for accountability for Epstein's powerful associates. This rare point of agreement underscores a deep-seated public expectation for the government to reveal all it knows about the case.</p>

          <h2>New Biography Aims to Offer a More Nuanced Portrait of Elvis Presley's Manager, Colonel Tom Parker</h2>

          <p>Peter Guralnick's new biography, "The Colonel and the King," delves into the complex life of Elvis Presley's controversial manager, Tom Parker. The book seeks to move beyond the common perception of Parker as a simple villain who exploited the music icon. Guralnick, a renowned rock historian who knew Parker, uses extensive research to explore his subject's origins as an undocumented Dutch immigrant and his rise as a tireless carnival hustler and music promoter. The review suggests the book is a comprehensive, if sometimes overly sympathetic, effort to provide a more complete understanding of the man who shaped Elvis's career.</p>

          <h2>Essay Reflects on George Washington's Unsung Leadership in Forging the Continental Army</h2>

          <p>This essay reflects on the crucial, undramatic work of George Washington in the summer of 1775, a period that was essential for the success of the American Revolution. After taking command of a chaotic assembly of militias outside Boston, Washington methodically built a true American army. He overcame his own prejudices to appoint talented New Englanders to key posts and established the discipline and organization needed to face the British. The author argues that this quiet, foundational leadership, rooted in character and judgment, was more vital than tactical genius and remains a powerful, if often overlooked, example of greatness.</p>

          <p>Despite heavy rain, tens of thousands of protesters, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge for a pro-Palestinian demonstration. The "March for Humanity," which called for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid for Gaza, proceeded after a last-minute Supreme Court decision authorized the event over police safety objections. The court ruled that while safety concerns were valid, the urgency of the humanitarian situation was compelling. The protest, one of the largest public assemblies to close the bridge in recent years, caused major traffic disruptions but remained largely peaceful.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed rating for each player on the 2025 British and Irish Lions rugby tour to Australia. While the Lions secured a 2-1 series victory, the analysis suggests it was a hard-fought win against an underprepared but resilient Wallabies team, and the Lions were not a "great" team. Standout performers like Tadhg Beirne and Tom Curry received high marks for their immense work rate and impact. The piece also reflects on the mixed fortunes of other players, including those whose tours were cut short by injury and those who struggled to find their best form.</p>

          <p>A couple in Guernsey who knew their home was built on the site of a German gun emplacement from World War II have unearthed a large, intact bunker buried beneath their driveway. Acting on a tip from a former resident, Shaun and Carrie Tullier hired a digger and uncovered the structure, which had been sealed since the 1960s. The bunker contains two large rooms with original features, including tiled floors and German writing on the walls. The couple plans to convert the space into a games room and gym while preserving its historical elements.</p>
