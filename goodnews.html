        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With economic uncertainties impacting retirement savings, annuities are gaining traction as a means to secure financial stability during retirement. These financial products involve investing money with an insurance company in exchange for regular income payments. Experts highlight the guaranteed lifetime income and market volatility protection as key advantages, while noting fees and limited access to funds as potential drawbacks. Before investing, it's crucial to balance investments, research the company's financial strength, create a retirement budget, and review current economic conditions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The bust of Jim Morrison, which adorned his grave in P√®re Lachaise cemetery, has been recovered by French police 37 years after it was stolen. The sculpture by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin was found during a search related to a fraud case. Morrison's grave remains a popular site for rock fans, and the circumstances surrounding his death in 1971 are still debated, with some accounts claiming he died of a heroin overdose at a nightclub.

          <p>ESPN's Stephen A. Smith discussed the Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese incident, suggesting that the intense focus on their rivalry extends beyond a simple foul due to their history and racial dynamics.

He also draws parallels to the Larry Bird and Magic Johnson rivalry, emphasizing that embracing the competition can elevate both athletes' popularity and the sport as a whole. Smith encourages both Clark and Reese to embrace the competitive spirit and rivalry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sleep specialists suggest that dietary habits significantly impact sleep quality, recommending practices such as incorporating foods rich in tryptophan, swapping sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables, and avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon and evening. Tryptophan, found in foods like almonds and turkey, converts to serotonin and melatonin, promoting sleep. Fruits and vegetables provide sleep-supporting nutrients and fiber, while limiting caffeine and alcohol intake before bed can prevent sleep disruption. Avoiding heavy meals close to bedtime also aids digestion and improves sleep.</p>

          <p>Portugal's center-right Democratic Alliance is set to govern again in a minority government following recent elections; however, the surge of the hard-right Chega party marks a significant shift in the country's political landscape. Chega, with its anti-immigrant platform, garnered over 22% of the vote, establishing itself as a potent force that will likely influence government policies. This outcome reflects a broader trend in Western Europe, where hard-right parties are gaining traction. The Democratic Alliance has refused to form an alliance with Chega, emphasizing its commitment to governing independently.</p>

Dan has promised to strengthen the rule of law and will hold talks with democratic parties to form a government.

          <p>Nigerian women are advocating for a new 'Reserved Seat for Women bill' to increase their representation in parliament, where they are currently underrepresented. Advocates argue that women are systemically excluded from the political process, and the bill could address this by reserving a specific number of seats for women in federal and state legislatures. Supporters believe that more women in government could lead to more equitable policies and a more stable economy, drawing inspiration from countries like Rwanda that have seen positive outcomes with greater gender equality.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a significant agreement aimed at enhancing security cooperation and reducing trade barriers introduced after Brexit. The deal includes a new defense partnership and reduced checks on food and drink. British people will be allowed to use electronic gates in Europe when crossing borders, and traveling with pets will be easier too. While politically contentious, the agreement reflects British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's ambition to reset relations with the EU.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU have reached a 'reset' deal, with claims of a 'huge' potential boost to growth. The deal dismantles a fraction of the trade barriers erected post-Brexit and those producing and selling foodstuffs between Britain and the EU are celebrating a reduction in red tape and checks. By agreeing to follow EU rules, the government has faced accusations of selling out on sovereignty. The agreement on plant and animal health, or sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), goes further than envisaged a few months ago. By doing away with some of the paperwork and inspections, the government claims this agreement - and the one centred on energy - will be worth ¬£8.9bn to the UK by 2040 (not investment advice).</p>
