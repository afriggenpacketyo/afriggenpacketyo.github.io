          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the preliminary design for the CFR-1000, its first commercial fourth-generation gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor. The project, which is now awaiting final approval, is expected to become operational after 2030. This development places China alongside other major nuclear powers like Russia and the United States, which are also developing advanced reactors. The goal is to create a more fuel-efficient and sustainable source of power, marking a key milestone in the country's energy strategy.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Explore Using Sharks to Improve Hurricane Forecasting Data</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are pioneering a new method for hurricane forecasting by equipping sharks with sensors to gather crucial ocean data. Led by the University of Delaware, the project aims to use sharks as mobile data collectors, measuring water temperature and conductivity in areas often inaccessible to traditional equipment. Since warm ocean temperatures fuel hurricanes, this data could enhance prediction models for storm intensity and trajectory. While still in early stages, the research hopes to eventually tag dozens of sharks annually, turning these apex predators into valuable, swimming ocean sensors.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Offense Shows Signs of Revival in 5-2 Victory Over Red Sox</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 22:15:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 win against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. After a period of low scoring, the team has now scored at least five runs in seven of its last ten games. Outfielder Teoscar Hernández was a key contributor, hitting a two-run homer and drawing a bases-loaded walk, while Andy Pages also had a strong performance with a double and a sacrifice fly. The improved hitting provided solid support for pitcher Emmet Sheehan and the bullpen, which delivered its first scoreless effort since early July.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier talent, including PhD candidates from U.S. universities who face funding cuts and stricter visa policies. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract scientists and engineers essential for harnessing AI and expanding globally. This trend is fueling the rapid growth of China's quant sector, which now represents the world's second-largest yuan-denominated market. The influx of brainpower is helping these firms compete with established global giants for a larger share of the investment market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small business owner is preparing for a crucial hearing in her trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the Leicester-based salon 'nkd', is fighting to re-register her business's trademark after L'Oréal opposed it. The French firm, which owns a product line called 'Naked', claims that the 'nkd' trademark would cause consumer confusion. Having already spent over £30,000 in legal fees, Dowdeswell states she is in a stronger position and is ready to continue the fight, asserting that L'Oréal's opposition is an attempt to bully a smaller competitor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a significant increase in the populations of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. According to the Royal Horticultural Society, the warm weather caused a boom in aphids, which are a primary food source for ladybirds. Butterfly Conservation also reported an extraordinary year for early sightings of numerous species, a stark contrast to the record low numbers seen in 2024. However, experts caution that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago's sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the city's limits on cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents illegally thwarted federal law enforcement. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled that Chicago's policies are protected by the Tenth Amendment and do not unlawfully interfere with federal operations. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the ruling, affirming the city's right to focus its law enforcement resources on local needs rather than federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the Hollywood blacklist, a dark period in American history when entertainment professionals were ostracized for alleged Communist ties. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. It explores the widespread impact of the anti-Communist fervor, which compelled many to name names to save their careers and extended beyond Hollywood to affect teachers and union members, raising enduring questions about free speech and democracy.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are undertaking a significant effort to save the bighorn sheep population in Texas, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. Wildlife biologists from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep from the state's only remaining disease-free herd. These animals, including pregnant ewes, were relocated over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, healthy population. Recent observations have confirmed the presence of newborn lambs, indicating the monumental rescue mission is showing early signs of success.</p>

          <p>This article explores the science and practicality behind popular health guidelines, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, and sleeping eight hours a night. Experts weigh in, suggesting that while these targets provide useful guidance, strict adherence isn't always necessary for a healthy life. For instance, one kidney specialist argues that thirst is a reliable guide for hydration for most people. The consensus among the experts is that it is better to incorporate a generally healthy outlook into daily life rather than fixating on achieving specific, rigid numerical goals.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how the female body is uniquely affected by elite athletic activity. Researchers are studying topics that were once taboo, such as the biomechanics of breasts and how a proper sports bra can improve performance by up to a mile in a marathon. Other areas of focus include the impact of the menstrual cycle on performance and the higher risk of certain injuries, like ACL tears, in female athletes. This new wave of research marks a significant shift from a past era when female athletes were often treated simply as "mini-men."</p>
