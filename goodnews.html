          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a scholar on Chinese law and US-China relations, suggests that the current strained relationship between the two nations has historical parallels that indicate it can be repaired. Drawing a comparison to the period after 1989, he notes that American students and scholars are once again beginning to return to China following the disruptions of the pandemic. Mahboubi believes the warm reception of these returning groups signals a potential for renewed connection and understanding between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Actor Vin Diesel has indicated that the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise could feature the return of Brian O‚ÄôConner, the character played by the late Paul Walker. Speaking at an event, Diesel stated that bringing the character back was one of his conditions for the film, slated for an April 2027 release. Walker's last appearance was in "Furious 7," completed after his death using a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins. This potential return raises ongoing ethical debates about posthumous digital performances in film.</p>

          <p>A contentious proposal to mandate the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced strong bipartisan backlash from both senators and House representatives, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated he withdrew the provision because he could not secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families. Conservationists celebrated the move as a victory but warned of ongoing threats to federal lands.</p>
