          <p>China has announced a "kinetic impact demonstration mission" aimed at testing the feasibility of defending Earth from asteroids. The mission, which officials hope to launch this year, will target a small asteroid millions of kilometers away. A chief designer of the country's lunar program stated the goal is to deflect the asteroid's orbit by a few centimeters using both an impactor and an observer spacecraft. This plan highlights China's growing ambitions and capabilities in deep space exploration and planetary defense.</p>

          <p>Following a report on Zambians losing access to HIV medication due to U.S. foreign aid cuts, the Zambian government has partnered with local community leaders to restore care. Initially, U.S.-funded clinics closed, leaving thousands without life-saving drugs and creating a sense of despair reminiscent of the height of the AIDS crisis. After officials verified the situation, they established a system allowing community volunteers to connect patients with government-run facilities for free medication. While access to drugs has improved, challenges like food insecurity and unemployment for laid-off clinic workers persist.</p>

Both known for their powerful playing styles and emotional on-court presence, they have split their two matches this year.

          <p>The Harlem Hellfighters, the New York National Guard's predominantly Black 369th Infantry Regiment, have been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their heroic service in World War I. Despite their celebrated bravery on the battlefield alongside French forces, the unit faced intense discrimination and was largely ignored by the U.S. military at the time. The ceremony, held amid a national debate on how American history is remembered, was praised as long-overdue recognition for soldiers who fought for freedoms they were denied at home. The medal will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing use of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is causing a measurable shift in consumer grocery spending, posing a new challenge for the snack food industry. Recent research indicates that users of these drugs reduce overall grocery spending and are trading ultra-processed snacks and sugary drinks for healthier options. In response, retailers are beginning to adapt their strategies, reformulating ready-meals with higher protein and more vegetables. While indulgence is unlikely to disappear, the trend suggests a move toward greater moderation, even during high-consumption events like NFL tailgating.</p>

          <p>Terry Riley, the influential American composer widely regarded as the father of musical Minimalism, has turned 90, prompting reflection on his vast and varied career. His 1964 work "In C" launched a movement that reshaped classical, rock, and pop music with its mesmerizing rhythmic and harmonic structures. Despite this legacy, Riley's own journey has been maximalist, exploring everything from Indian raga to jazz standards and graphic scores from his current home in Japan. His work, characterized by a spirit of improvisation and communal music-making, continues to influence new generations of musicians and composers.</p>

          <p>An article from The Motley Fool identifies four technology companies as potentially strong investments for September, including Alphabet and The Trade Desk. The analysis suggests Alphabet appears undervalued given its strong revenue and earnings growth, despite initial fears about AI's impact on its search business. The Trade Desk, an advertising technology firm, is presented as a long-term opportunity after its stock price fell due to slower growth during a platform transition. The article frames these as opportunities for investors looking for growth in the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare move, the U.S. government has taken an approximately 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, becoming its largest single shareholder. This action, converting grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into equity, is aimed at bolstering domestic production of cutting-edge microchips to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC. The strategy is driven by national security concerns and economic competition with China, particularly in the race for artificial intelligence dominance. While government backing has proven successful in other countries, experts note that such direct involvement carries risks, including potential political pressure on the company's business decisions.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito of Japan, nephew of the Emperor, has marked his official entry into adulthood with a traditional coming-of-age ceremony. As the first male royal to reach adulthood in 40 years and second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status highlights the ongoing debate over Japan's male-only succession law. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the future of the world's oldest continuous monarchy is uncertain. Public support has grown for allowing female succession, which would place Emperor Naruhito's daughter, Princess Aiko, in line, but conservative factions remain opposed.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, amid political pressure from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD has criticized the centennial for "glorifying" the movement, echoing the Nazi party's denouncement of Bauhaus as "degenerate art" before shutting it down in 1933. Despite these attacks, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with a year of exhibitions and events focused on modern materials and sustainable design. The foundation's director expressed concern about the party's rise but noted that, unlike in the 1930s, the institution now has significant public support.</p>

          <p>An essay explores how adopting the Buffalo Bills as a favorite team can illuminate the deep connection between a sports franchise and its city's identity. The author describes how the team embodies the spirit of Buffalo—a city known for its resilience, tough luck, and a quiet revival after its industrial boom times. The Bills' history of near-misses, including four consecutive Super Bowl losses, has forged an exceptionally loyal and bonded fanbase. For the author, who had never followed sports, being welcomed into this community provided a powerful sense of belonging and a new understanding of what "home" can mean.</p>

          <p>Scotland began its World Cup qualification campaign with a hard-fought draw against Denmark in Copenhagen, a result that manager Steve Clarke described as a promising start. The performance, built on strong defensive work, earned a valuable point against the team considered their main group rival. This result puts early pressure on Denmark and marks a positive departure from Scotland's previous qualifying campaigns, which have often been derailed by early losses. The team's resilience was notable, with several key players delivering strong performances despite having limited recent club-level game time.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita performed his legendary "scorpion kick" save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium, creating one of football's most iconic moments. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita was a pioneer of the sweeper-keeper role, famous for his flamboyant style, risk-taking, and goal-scoring ability. The audacious save encapsulated a unique career that also saw him lead his club to a Copa Libertadores title, make a costly error in the 1990 World Cup, and serve time in prison for his involvement in a cartel kidnapping. His legacy endures as a revolutionary figure who changed perceptions of what a goalkeeper could be.</p>
