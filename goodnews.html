          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on funding cuts and stricter visa policies in American universities to hire top-tier PhD talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive, and sometimes superior, salaries compared to US counterparts to attract scientists and engineers. This brain drain is fueling the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector, which leverages artificial intelligence and aims to compete on a global scale. The trend highlights a significant shift in the global competition for financial and technological expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A salon owner from Leicester is preparing for a crucial hearing in her trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of 'nkd' salon, faced opposition from the French firm when she tried to re-register her trademark in 2022. L'Oréal, which owns the 'Naked' makeup line, argues that the 'nkd' name could cause consumer confusion. Despite spending over £30,000 in legal fees, Dowdeswell remains determined to fight for her brand name, stating she is in a stronger position now that a hearing with the UK's Intellectual Property Office has been scheduled.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 20:53:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a significant increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The abundance of aphids, a key food source, has particularly benefited ladybirds, while butterflies have been sighted weeks earlier than average. However, experts express concern that the prolonged dry conditions could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying out wetlands and preventing eggs from being laid. This short-term boom contrasts with the long-term trend of declining flying insect populations across the UK.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the city's policies unlawfully restrict local law enforcement from sharing immigration information with federal agents. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins sided with the city, a decision praised by Mayor Brandon Johnson, who stated that Chicago is safer when its police focus on local needs rather than federal immigration enforcement. This ruling represents a significant legal victory for cities with sanctuary policies against federal pressure to cooperate with immigration agents.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the story of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 with the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It showcases personal artifacts, such as letters from screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's daughter, and highlights how the anti-Communist fervor extended beyond Hollywood, impacting many ordinary Americans and raising enduring questions about free speech and democracy.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's current trip to Scotland for the opening of a new golf course highlights his unique relationship with the sport, which he uses as a tool for business, networking, and political maneuvering. Unlike past presidents who used golf for leisure, Trump views it as a competitive venture and a way to forge connections with allies, rivals, and foreign leaders. The article notes that his golf properties, like Turnberry, are prestigious assets that attract wealthy businesspeople and offer a private setting for transactional discussions away from public scrutiny. This approach intertwines his political and business identities on the global stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to save Texas's dwindling bighorn sheep population, wildlife biologists have undertaken a significant rescue mission. The population had been decimated by 50% in the last five years due to a disease spread from non-native animals. Last fall, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep, including pregnant ewes, from the state's last disease-free herd. The animals were airlifted over 200 miles to an isolated, disease-free mountain range. A recent follow-up revealed the relocated herd is not only surviving but growing, with newborn lambs spotted, marking a monumental success for the conservation program.</p>

          <p>Health experts are examining the necessity of rigidly following popular daily health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water or taking 10,000 steps. While the NHS recommends seven to nine hours of sleep, some specialists argue that for hydration, thirst is a reliable guide for most healthy individuals. Similarly, while 150 minutes of weekly exercise is advised, experts suggest that consistency and finding an achievable routine are more important than hitting a precise number. The article concludes that while these benchmarks are useful guides, a balanced and less fixated approach to health is often more sustainable and less stressful.</p>

          <p>Tejano singer Bobby Pulido is officially exploring a 2026 congressional bid as a Democrat in South Texas, aiming to challenge Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz. Pulido, who studied political science before his music career, stated he is tired of politicians who put party before people and wants to address issues like immigration reform and the local economy. His potential candidacy sets up a primary challenge against Dr. Ada Cuellar, another Democrat who has already launched her campaign. Pulido acknowledged that the Democratic Party has been negligent in the district, contributing to recent Republican gains.</p>

The impact of the menstrual cycle on performance is also a major area of research, with teams and athletes now openly discussing and tracking cycles to optimize training. Additionally, scientists are investigating why female athletes have a higher risk for certain injuries, like ACL tears, and developing training strategies to mitigate these risks.</p>

          <p>The asteroid 2024 YR4, once considered the riskiest space rock ever observed with a potential to hit Earth, has now been ruled a miss for our planet. However, updated trajectory calculations suggest it has a 4.3% chance of striking the moon in late 2032. Such an impact could create a crater a kilometer wide and be visible from Earth, but it also poses a risk by sending lunar debris toward our planet. While this debris would not harm people on the ground, it could damage the vital satellite infrastructure we depend on for communications and navigation.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after 'Big Brother' first aired, a new perspective is emerging on the impact of reality television. While often criticized as superficial, some sociologists and psychologists argue the genre can be a tool for greater social understanding. By showcasing diverse demographics and raw, unfiltered emotions, reality TV can expose viewers to different lifestyles and perspectives, potentially reducing feelings of isolation and alienation. It has also sparked national conversations on complex issues like gaslighting, racism, and disability awareness, suggesting that even constructed scenarios can prompt valuable self-reflection and societal debate.</p>
