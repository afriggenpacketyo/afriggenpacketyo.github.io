        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been publicly ranked in new league tables, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The system, which grades trusts on metrics including patient wait times and financial performance, aims to increase transparency and identify where support is needed. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the goal is to end the "postcode lottery" in healthcare quality. However, organizations like NHS Providers and the Nuffield Trust have raised concerns that the rankings could lead to trusts focusing on metrics over patient care and may not accurately reflect performance.</p>

          <p>On the 25th anniversary of her debut album "Not That Kind," singer Anastacia recounts her challenging path to fame, which began after a breakthrough performance on MTV's "The Cut" in 1998. She recalls how record executives initially struggled to market her unique voice and look, and shares anecdotes from her career, including being asked by Arnold Schwarzenegger to sing the same song 12 times at his birthday party. Despite never achieving major chart success in her home country of the U.S., she found massive popularity in Europe and continues to tour extensively.

The market rally in Japan mirrored overnight gains on Wall Street, where tech stocks led the Nasdaq Composite to a record close. The Japanese yen also saw a slight strengthening against the U.S. dollar amid the political transition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates a 46% increase in cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older between 2021 and 2023, reflecting a diminishing stigma as the substance becomes legal in more states. Many seniors are turning to cannabis, often in the form of edibles, to manage issues like chronic pain, PTSD, and anxiety. However, some medical professionals express caution, pointing to research linking cannabis use to potential cardiovascular health risks. Despite the warnings, some older users view it as a viable alternative for managing their health conditions in a landscape where many common substances carry risks.</p>

          <p>Infielder Max Muncy was activated from the injured list and immediately placed back in the Los Angeles Dodgers' starting lineup on Monday. Muncy had missed 23 games due to an oblique injury, during which the team struggled offensively and posted a losing record. His return is seen as a significant boost as the Dodgers head into their playoff stretch drive. Manager Dave Roberts highlighted Muncy's presence as adding crucial length to the lineup. Muncy is the first of several key players expected to return from injury soon, providing needed reinforcements for the team.</p>

          <p>To meet growing demand, a port operator in Dalian, China, is establishing a new transit center and a "durian express" shipping service for the popular fruit from Southeast Asia. This initiative aims to reduce shipping times to northeast China from as long as twelve days down to just six, ensuring greater freshness for consumers in the region. The project addresses logistical challenges for a market of roughly 100 million people that has been relatively underpenetrated compared to southern China. The new service is expected to handle approximately 10,000 shipping containers of fresh durians annually.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill aimed at closing a loophole in the state's ban on selling commercially bred dogs by targeting online pet dealers and brokers. The legislation, AB 519, will bar websites and middlemen who resell dogs bred by others for profit, a practice that has grown since a 2019 law banned pet stores from selling "puppy mill" dogs. The bill follows a Los Angeles Times investigation that exposed how resellers import dogs from out-of-state commercial breeders while posing as small, local operators. The measure now goes to the governor for consideration.</p>

          <p>England Test cricket coach Brendon McCullum has expressed frustration with what he calls "disrespectful" misconceptions about his team's aggressive style of play, often labeled "Bazball." He argues that the perception of his players as simply swinging the bat hard without strategy undermines the hard work and determination within the team. McCullum, who took over in 2022 and revived a struggling side, emphasizes that his coaching philosophy is about creating an environment that allows players' talent to flourish under pressure. He clarified that his messaging focuses on mindset rather than a rigid, high-risk playing style.</p>

          <p>Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has secured a second term in office after his Labour Party emerged as the winner in the country's parliamentary election with approximately 28% of the vote. The result allows Stoere to maintain his governing coalition with the support of four other left-wing parties, securing a narrow majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The election campaign focused on domestic issues such as the rising cost of living and public services, as well as the stability of an incumbent government amid international turmoil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer reviewed several recent pessimistic narratives on Wall Street, arguing that many fears surrounding major technology companies have proven to be overblown. He pointed to concerns about a potential government-forced breakup of Alphabet, which did not materialize, and theories that Amazon's web services were falling behind, which the market has since overlooked. Cramer also noted that worries about Apple's AI strategy and competition for Nvidia have not stopped their stocks from performing well. He suggested that negativity can be easily generated in the market, but the subsequent positive resolutions often go unacknowledged. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has demonstrated a remarkable ability to reduce pollution while continuing to industrialize, a process described as "industrialisation-driven decarbonisation." According to environmental research, the average annual level of PM2.5 air pollution fell by over 35% nationwide between 2015 and 2022, a reduction comparable to what the U.S. achieved in three decades. This success is attributed to the deployment of advanced green technology, extensive real-time environmental monitoring, and massive investments in green infrastructure. Water quality has also seen significant improvements, with over 90% of national control sections now rated as fair to excellent.</p>
