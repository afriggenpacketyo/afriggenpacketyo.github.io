          <p>This article provides a summary of various news items, including the Supreme Court's extension of a ban on the Trump administration's use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelans. It also mentions that the Department of Homeland Security is considering a reality TV show where immigrants compete for American citizenship. Senate Democrats oppose weapons sales to Qatar and the U.A.E. due to financial ties to Trump. The article also touches on a tornado in St. Louis, an escape from a New Orleans jail, and Moody's downgrading of the United States' credit rating. Finally, it covers the education secretary's desire to end the Trump administration's standoff with Harvard. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisors emphasize that long-term care costs can be a significant financial burden, often exceeding $100,000, and many Americans are unprepared for this expense. A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report indicates that over half of Americans turning 65 today will require long-term care due to disabilities. Many are unaware of the potential costs, with a majority of workers who anticipate needing to provide long-term care underestimating the future expenses. Experts recommend considering long-term care insurance, particularly hybrid policies that combine life insurance with long-term care benefits, as health insurance and Medicare often do not cover these services.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's Middle East tour advanced policies aligning with Israeli interests, despite not landing in Israel. Trump emphasized Israeli priorities such as condemning Hamas, urging Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and warning Iran about its nuclear ambitions. Some analysts believe Israel missed an opportunity to leverage U.S. arms deals with Saudi Arabia and the lifting of sanctions on Syria to advance its interests. Concerns persist over Iran's nuclear program, with some viewing it as a historic window to stop it, potentially by force. The need for Israel to shape events proactively and anchor itself in a regional bloc is also emphasized.</p>

          <p>A leading US clinic, the Mayo Clinic, is utilizing a fecal waste biobank to uncover how the microbiome affects cancer treatment responses. Researchers aim to personalize medicine by understanding how the microbiome changes patient reactions to cancer medications. The biobank contains over 2,000 stool samples, with the goal of identifying which drugs patients are most likely to respond to based on their microbiome and genes. This work is part of broader efforts to understand the gut microbiome's role in cancer treatment, including experiments with fecal transplants and other innovative approaches. However, the scientific community faces challenges due to proposed cuts to scientific institutions by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>An 18-month-old spider monkey named Violeta was rescued from a Vallejo home during a methamphetamine bust and is now receiving care at the Oakland Zoo. The suspect faces charges related to illegal possession of exotic animals and controlled substances. Owning primates as pets is illegal in California, and baby spider monkeys, an endangered species, require specialized care. The Oakland Zoo is providing Violeta with medical treatment and socialization before finding her a permanent home in an accredited zoo or sanctuary.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Los Angeles Lakers should focus on drafting an experienced, mature player who has demonstrated the ability to handle the temptations of money and fame in college. The columnist suggests that the league's economic shifts have made "high ceiling" players the most sought-after quality, but the Lakers should instead consider a 24-year-old college graduate with NIL money in the bank and a good head on his shoulders. The article highlights the importance of resiliency and maturity, which cannot be measured at the combine, and points to the success of Austin Reaves, who went undrafted as a 23-year-old senior in 2021. The author concludes that while the Lakers need a big man, they should also prioritize drafting a grown-up.</p>

The move aims to protect core city services like tree trimming, street resurfacing, and sanitation. While Mayor Bass expressed optimism about avoiding layoffs entirely, she cautioned against pitting police hiring against the preservation of other jobs, describing it as a "Sophie's Choice."</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. While details are scarce, the UK government is considering setting up the scheme as part of a new partnership agreement with the EU. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg reports that an agreement in principle is expected to be announced at the upcoming summit. Prior to Brexit, young people in the UK had the right to travel and study freely in the rest of Europe and vice versa, and a new deal could see a return to a similar state of affairs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering expanding insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF) to military members and those insured through the Affordable Care Act. This is in response to a report on combating infertility. The White House has consulted with industry leaders and conservative policy groups, but not the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. However, the goal is complicated by differing views within Trump's base, as some Christian conservatives oppose IVF due to concerns about the disposal of embryos.
