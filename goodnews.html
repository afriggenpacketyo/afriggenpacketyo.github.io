          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte affirmed the U.S.'s commitment to the alliance, emphasizing that President Trump and senior U.S. leaders are fully dedicated to NATO. Rutte addressed concerns about Washington potentially abandoning the bloc due to frustrations over uneven defense spending among member states. He urged European allies to focus on increasing defense investments and supporting Ukraine, rather than worrying about the U.S.'s commitment. The summit addressed defense spending targets and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Optimism surrounding the summit is tempered by existing tensions and the need for member states to meet their financial obligations.</p>

          <p>Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis unveiled a framework for regulating digital assets, aiming to provide clarity and prevent illicit activities. The framework seeks to define cryptocurrencies as either commodities or securities, enabling crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It also intends to reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) regulatory oversight of digital currencies. The proposed bill includes measures to combat money laundering and sanctions evasion, building on recent bipartisan momentum in the crypto space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* makes the case that reading fiction is valuable for men. It argues that reading fiction is not about learning or self-improvement, but about the thrill of the experience. The article emphasizes that reading fiction can help men escape from their own consciousness and surroundings. It also points out that reading is a subversive act, allowing men to occupy a space that is totally for themselves.</p>
