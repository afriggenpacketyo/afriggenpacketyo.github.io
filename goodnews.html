          <p>Donald Trump has reignited a feud with CBS by reposting a video on Truth Social claiming that the network "deleted" his 2015 interview with Stephen Colbert, despite evidence showing clips from the interview are still available on YouTube.

Trump has repeatedly criticized CBS, including suing the network for $20 million over its 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, alleging "deceitful editing."

          <p>CBS News explores the frustrating phenomenon of corporate buzzwords, noting how they are often used to mask simple ideas and create a false sense of inclusion.

The article suggests that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money and encourages people to use plain language instead. The piece is a lighthearted commentary on workplace communication.</p>
