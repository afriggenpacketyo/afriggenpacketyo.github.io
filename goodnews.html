        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing expectations and narrowly avoiding a technical recession. The growth was primarily driven by a significant surge in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products, as companies reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. However, economists express caution, noting that while domestic consumption showed a slight recovery, the overall pace of growth is unlikely to be sustained due to softening global trade and slowing investment. Future economic performance may be challenged by the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has declared former President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. The ruling states that the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued that the "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the policy, which has been on hold amid numerous legal challenges since it was signed.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which analysts view as an indirect strategy to reshape regional supply chains and counter China's economic influence. Under the new terms, imports from the two Southeast Asian nations will face a 19 percent tariff, while U.S. exports to them will be duty-free. While not explicitly targeting Beijing, the deals are seen as a way to contain China's regional dominance. However, experts note that Chinese firms are already ahead, having increasingly localized their production within these countries, potentially mitigating the impact of the new U.S. arrangements.

          <p>Reveille X, the beloved collie mascot for Texas A&M, is recovering after undergoing surgery to remove her right eye due to a glaucoma diagnosis. University President Mark A. Welsh III stated the procedure was successful and that the "First Lady of Aggieland" is resting comfortably. The veterinary team performed the surgery as a precautionary measure after discovering abnormal tissue and noting the dog's discomfort. Reveille X, the tenth in a line of mascots dating back to 1931, is expected to take time off from her duties but should return to her campus activities by the fall.</p>

The company's revenue surged over 35% year-over-year, with its dominance in the HBM market, where it supplies key clients like Nvidia, being the primary driver of its success. SK Hynix anticipates continued growth, expecting to double its HBM sales for the full year and increase capital expenditure to meet future demand. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the U.S. housing market remains competitive for sellers, some realtors are observing a slight shift that could offer a small advantage to buyers. An increase in housing inventory, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May, is contributing to this change, though it has not yet stopped prices from rising to record highs. Experts note that homeowners with low-interest mortgages are hesitant to sell, keeping overall inventory tight and prices elevated, particularly for updated, move-in-ready homes. Location remains a key factor, with markets in Texas and Florida favoring buyers, while areas like New Jersey and Long Island remain heavily skewed towards sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati has emerged as a hero at Euro 2025, scoring the decisive extra-time goal against Germany to send her team to the final. Her triumph is particularly remarkable given she was discharged from a hospital just days before the tournament began after a bout of viral meningitis. The two-time Ballon d'Or winner was eased back into the lineup but delivered a world-class performance when it mattered most, securing Spain's first-ever appearance in a Women's Euro final.

          <p>The International Court of Justice has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent significant environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions. The unanimous decision, prompted by a campaign led by the island nation of Vanuatu, affirms that existing international laws and treaties compel nations to protect the climate and provide reparations for damages caused. While the opinion is not legally binding, it is expected to set a powerful legal precedent for thousands of climate-related lawsuits against governments and corporations worldwide. The ruling is seen as a major victory for climate justice advocates and vulnerable nations disproportionately affected by climate change.</p>

The mission aims to provide a better understanding of "space weather," the phenomena that can disrupt GPS, communications satellites, and power grids on Earth. The identical satellites will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun is transferred into Earth's environment. The launch also carried several other small satellites for various missions, including testing new communication technologies and measuring Earth's energy balance.</p>
