          <p>Personal data is a valuable commodity, constantly collected by social media, online shopping, and mobile apps, then aggregated and resold by data brokers. These brokers build extensive profiles from public records and online activity, selling them to marketers, insurers, and background checkers, leading to targeted ads, identity theft, and harassment. To regain control, individuals can review privacy settings, use privacy-friendly tools like ad blockers, and be cautious about sharing personal details. Opting out of data broker lists or using data removal services are also effective methods to limit exposure to this pervasive industry.</p>

          <p>Umpire Nico Helwerth, who officiated a match at Wimbledon marred by an electronic line-calling error, is "having a rest day," according to the All England Club. An "operator error" caused the ball-tracking technology to deactivate during a crucial game, leading Helwerth to replay the point, a decision criticized by player Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. The AELTC defended Helwerth, stating he "followed the established process," while Pavlyuchenkova argued umpires should have the authority to overrule in such situations. The incident sparks debate about the role of human judgment versus technology in professional tennis.</p>

          <p>Engineering students at Johns Hopkins University have invented a specialized printer that adds braille writing to beer labels for a Maryland brewery, in collaboration with Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM). This innovative machine punches braille text onto plastic labels, a material commercial braille printers cannot accommodate, and is designed for easy operation by BISM employees with low or no vision. The students also created software to integrate with BISM's existing word processing and design tools. This invention will significantly streamline the production of braille labels, supporting BISM's mission and employees.</p>

Collaborating with Compassionate Hospice, the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance arranged this special behind-the-scenes encounter, allowing Garcia to interact with the animals she had long wished to see.

A successful apology requires acknowledging the situation early, following up with a thoughtful response, and demonstrating authentic emotion rather than reading from a script. Disingenuous or passive language can erode trust and harm company culture, making a human-centered approach vital.</p>

          <p>Netflix continues to attract renowned Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese and Greta Gerwig, despite its disinterest in wide theatrical releases, viewing the model as "outdated." The streaming giant offers lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to over 300 million subscribers, making it an appealing alternative for filmmakers. This strategy also serves as a haven for auteurs whose high-budget or niche films might not be greenlit by traditional studios due to box-office risks. By bypassing theatrical marketing costs and prioritizing direct subscriber access, Netflix maintains its unique position, even as other media companies reconsider theatrical value.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill, granting parents the legal right to unpaid bereavement leave following a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. This significant change aims to provide crucial time for grieving, as current laws only offer leave for losses after 24 weeks or for children under 18. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized that no one experiencing pregnancy loss should be forced back to work prematurely. This legislative update, widely welcomed by campaigners and those affected, acknowledges the profound grief associated with early pregnancy loss, challenging a long-standing taboo.</p>

This inclusion is significant, as the city invited all countries with diplomatic missions or UN representative offices, a category Taiwan was initially not considered to fit.
