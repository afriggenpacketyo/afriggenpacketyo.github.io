          <p>Huawei Technologies has significantly increased shipments of smartphones and tablets running its HarmonyOS operating system, reaching over 103 million devices, nearly half of which were shipped in 2024. This pivot to its in-house OS serves as an alternative to Google's Android, driven by US sanctions imposed in 2019. The company has expanded HarmonyOS beyond mobile devices, launching laptops running on the system after its license to use Microsoft Windows expired. This move represents a strategic shift towards platform autonomy and technological sovereignty for Huawei, marking a watershed moment in its goal to establish a fully self-sufficient hardware-software ecosystem.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the Democratic Party's efforts to regain support from young men after President Trump won a narrow victory among men ages 18 to 29 in the 2024 election. Emerging Democratic leaders are prioritizing policies and messaging tailored to young men, addressing their concerns about mental health, economic opportunities, and feeling heard by government officials. The Speaking with American Men (SAM) project suggests Democrats invest more time in online spaces frequented by young men, offering authentic engagement rather than overly politicized messaging. The article explores how Democrats can build connections with this demographic and address their specific needs and frustrations.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, drawing attention as a precursor to the upcoming House of Councillors race. With no single party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can maintain its seats amid fluctuating approval ratings. Parties are utilizing social media to appeal to voters, particularly those unaffiliated, addressing issues such as rising living costs and political funding scandals. The election results will be closely watched as an indicator of public sentiment ahead of the national upper house race.</p>

          <h2>India Aims to Develop Rare Earth Reserves as Alternative to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 04:19:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is seeking to develop its domestic rare earth element (REE) supplies to counter China's export restrictions. Experts suggest that with substantial reserves, India could become an important alternative to China in the REE sector, but it requires more public and private investment. The recent REE shortage has highlighted China's dominance in the sector, producing roughly 60% of the world's supply and processing almost 90%. India possesses the world's third-largest share of REE reserves, but lacks advanced separation and refining technology, contributing to less than 1% of global REE production.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is launching a 100 billion yen ($700 million) policy package to attract foreign researchers, particularly those potentially leaving the United States due to research funding cuts. The measures aim to create an elite research environment in Japan, focusing on fields like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. The government also plans to utilize profits from a 10 trillion yen investment fund to support internationally competitive research at universities. The policy package will fund existing programs, raise salaries for researchers, and reduce administrative burdens, aiming to make Japan a global hub for scientific innovation.
