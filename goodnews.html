          <p>After a prolonged shutdown caused by inflation and high interest rates, the market for technology initial public offerings is experiencing a significant resurgence. Companies like Bullish, Figma, and Circle have seen their stock prices surge on their market debuts, signaling strong investor appetite. This renewed optimism is clearing a backlog of high-value startups, with exchange leaders at the NYSE and Nasdaq reporting a healthy pipeline of companies preparing to go public. However, some analysts caution that the market may be overheating, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble despite the stronger fundamentals of today's companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a lawsuit from the District of Columbia, the Department of Justice has agreed to scale back the Trump administration's federal takeover of the city's police force. The agreement ensures that D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command, reversing a directive that had appointed a DEA administrator as emergency police chief. The DOJ also consented to rewrite an order that had ended the city's "sanctuary" rules limiting police cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This development came after a federal judge indicated she would likely intervene if the administration did not alter its course.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a new electric pickup truck designed to be highly affordable by simplifying its base model and allowing extensive customization. The company's strategy focuses on keeping manufacturing costs low with a spare, two-seat design, while offering over 100 accessories and an "open source" platform for third-party add-ons. Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, but the expiration of these incentives raises the price to around $27,000. This shift positions the truck against established competitors, creating uncertainty about its market competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI is reportedly arranging a secondary stock sale of around $6 billion, which would value the company at approximately $500 billion. The deal would allow current and former employees to sell shares to investors, including existing backers like SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, and Thrive Capital. This potential valuation marks exponential growth for the company since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, building on a previous funding round that valued it at $300 billion. The discussions follow the recent release of OpenAI's advanced GPT-5 model, which has had a mixed reception from some users.</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their best single-day performance since March 2020, soaring 12% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new stake in the company. The filing revealed a holding of 5 million shares valued at about $1.6 billion, providing a significant vote of confidence in the embattled health insurer. UnitedHealth's stock had been down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and a disappointing earnings outlook. The investment from Buffett, along with new stakes from other prominent investors, helped lift the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average to an intraday high.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully negotiates an end to the war in Ukraine without forcing Kyiv to concede territory to Russia. Speaking on a podcast, Clinton emphasized that a true resolution must not validate Vladimir Putin's aggression or his vision of a "greater Russia." She expressed hope that Trump, motivated by any number of reasons including the prize itself, would stand up to Putin on behalf of Ukrainian, European, and American security interests. Trump responded to the comments, calling them "very nice."</p>

          <p>At just 21 years old, all-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket. He will lead an understrength T20 squad during a tour of Ireland in September, as regular captain Harry Brook and other senior players are being rested. The selection is a significant show of faith in Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer and has never captained at the full senior level before. The previous record for the youngest men's captain was held by Monty Bowden, who was 23 when he led the team in 1889.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson, who was ordered to pay $250,000 in damages. A federal judge issued a default judgment after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit, which cited his public accusations that Patel was a "Kremlin asset" and had planned the January 6 Capitol attack. The judge ruled that Stewartson acted with malice and that punitive damages were warranted to deter similar defamatory behavior. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to pursue his own case against Patel.</p>

          <p>Erin has strengthened into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season and is forecast to intensify further, potentially becoming a major hurricane early next week. Currently a Category 1 storm, Erin is moving west-northwest and is expected to pass near the northern Leeward Islands, prompting tropical storm watches in the region. Forecast models show the hurricane is likely to curve northward, keeping it well offshore of the U.S. East Coast. The National Hurricane Center is urging those in the Caribbean to monitor the storm's progress due to the potential for heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor, a move that follows a recent surge in the company's stock price and a pressure campaign from investors. The company's stock has risen dramatically since June but its latest earnings report failed to assure investors of a successful turnaround. In her announcement, Wheeler stated that stepping aside would allow the company to focus on its future without distraction. Activist investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, had been publicly calling for her departure. The company has named its technology chief as interim leader.</p>

The relocation includes plans for a new Playboy Club and multimedia studios in Miami Beach, a city Kohn praised as being very supportive of business. This move marks a strategic return to South Florida for the company, which previously operated a club and hotel in the area during the 1960s and 70s.</p>

          <p>After a six-month pause and a legal challenge from over a dozen states, the Trump administration has agreed to resume a federal program that funds the installation of high-speed electric vehicle chargers along highways. The Department of Transportation had frozen the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, created by a 2021 bipartisan law, which the president has criticized as wasteful. While the funds will now be released, the administration has removed several Biden-era requirements, such as those related to community engagement and labor standards, in a move it claims will cut red tape and speed up the rollout.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a direct government intervention in Intel by taking an ownership stake in the struggling semiconductor company. The news, which caused Intel's stock to climb, aligns with the administration's goal of bolstering domestic chip manufacturing for national security reasons and reducing reliance on foreign producers like TSMC. While details remain unclear, the intervention could be funded through the CHIPS Act. Some technology analysts argue that such a move, while unusual, is essential to revive the company and secure the nation's technological and military capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>
