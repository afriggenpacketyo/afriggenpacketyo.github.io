          <h2>Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment Projected to be Lower in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 15:24:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be around 2.4%, which would be the lowest annual increase in five years, according to estimates from policy analysts and senior citizen groups. This potential decrease is based on current inflation data, although the final COLA will depend on inflation rates in the coming months. The annual adjustment is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year, using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W has increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced a new rule to protect travelers from hidden and unwanted add-on fees in the short-term lodging industry. This rule targets deceptive fees, such as resort or destination fees, that are applied to amenities like pools or gyms. Short-term lodging businesses, including hotels, motels, vacation rentals, and Airbnb, must now include all mandatory charges in their advertised prices upfront. Marriott has already implemented transparent pricing, and the American Hotel & Lodging Association supports the new rule for bringing clarity to the marketplace.</p>
