          <p>Polish tennis star Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive victory over American Amanda Anisimova in the women's singles final. Swiatek won the match in a swift 57 minutes with a commanding 6-0, 6-0 score, demonstrating her prowess on a grass court where she had not previously advanced past the quarterfinals. This victory marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title, adding the prestigious Wimbledon trophy to her existing collection of French Open and U.S. Open wins. Anisimova, who had an impressive run to the final, struggled to find her footing against the formidable former world number one.</p>

          <p>England hooker Jamie George has been called up to the British and Irish Lions squad as they prepare for their first Test match against Australia. The call-up comes after Luke Cowan-Dickie sustained a suspected concussion during a recent match, making him unlikely to be available for the game in Brisbane. Additionally, center Garry Ringrose has been officially ruled out of the first Test due to his own concussion. George, a two-time Lions tourist, will leave the England squad in Argentina to join the team, providing crucial depth at a key position ahead of the highly anticipated series.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine distribution and weapons smuggling. Macias, the head of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June following a dramatic prison escape that triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador. During a virtual court hearing, he accepted the extradition, a process that now requires final approval from Ecuador's president. This move marks a significant step in the nation's fight against organized crime, which has escalated dramatically in recent years.</p>

          <p>A recent economic analysis has identified the top ten U.S. state economies best positioned to withstand a potential recession, considering factors like GDP growth, fiscal health, and exposure to trade wars. Florida, Texas, and North Carolina secured the top three spots, praised for their diverse economies, strong job growth, and manageable dependence on international trade with China. The study also factored in each state's reliance on federal spending, which has become a key risk amid budget cuts. The rankings provide a snapshot of economic stability across the nation during a period of increased uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising trade war tensions, companies are increasingly utilizing U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay, reduce, or eliminate tariffs on imported goods. These zones allow companies to store or assemble products using foreign components without immediately paying duties, which are only collected when the final product enters U.S. commerce. This strategy preserves cash flow and provides a buffer against fluctuating tariff rates. However, a recent executive order ended the "inverted tariff" benefit in FTZs, increasing costs for some manufacturers and driving more businesses toward the flexibility of bonded warehouses.

          <p>After years of debate, new online safety regulations are set to take effect in the UK, legally obligating tech platforms to prevent children from seeing harmful content like pornography and material promoting self-harm. The rules, enforced by the regulator Ofcom starting July 25, will require platforms to implement age verification measures, with heavy fines for non-compliance. However, critics and even government sources acknowledge the rules already need updating to address new challenges like AI chatbots and content on private messaging apps. The ongoing debate centers on whether these measures are sufficient to protect children in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p>

Their victory marks a significant moment for British tennis, as the last time two Britons won a men's doubles Grand Slam was in 1936.

While NASA's Artemis program officially targets a crewed lunar landing by 2027, it faces significant technical hurdles, including the need for unproven in-orbit refueling technology.

          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience has identified four common factors that can quietly damage intimacy in a relationship, many of which are often overlooked. These intimacy blockers include excessive phone use creating emotional distance, unresolved feelings about an ex-partner, a persistent negativity bias that fosters self-rejection, and an unmanaged stress response that can shut down desire. The therapist emphasizes that intimacy is more than just physical and is essential for a thriving partnership. She offers practical advice for couples to address these issues through open communication, setting boundaries, and understanding each other's emotional triggers.</p>

          <p>According to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine, securing a salary increase is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and is more likely to be a process that unfolds over several weeks. She advises employees to initiate compensation discussions during mid-year check-ins rather than annual reviews, as budgets are often set by year's end. The first meeting should aim to open the dialogue and set a date for a follow-up, not to finalize a deal. Valentine stresses the importance of patience, clear documentation, and understanding that negotiation is a collaborative process that requires time for the employer to consider options and crunch numbers.</p>
