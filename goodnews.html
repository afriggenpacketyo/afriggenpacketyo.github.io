          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, calling for international collaboration on trade despite increasing tariffs and other barriers. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and cautioned against politicizing trade or turning it into a security issue. Li stressed the importance of engaging in the international economy to reshape rules and order, urging countries to stay on the "right" path. Adam Tooze, a professor at Columbia University, interpreted Li's comments as a call for a pluralization of global processes rather than focusing on who sets the order. The speech did not specifically address U.S. trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict, but served as a general call for multilateral cooperation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is attending the NATO Summit in The Hague, displaying a more amicable stance towards the alliance, which he has previously criticized. Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, amidst discussions on defense spending and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. Rutte congratulated Trump for increasing European defense spending and brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, with NATO members agreeing to a 5% GDP defense spending target. Despite this progress, Trump raised doubts about the U.S. commitment to NATO's mutual defense clause, while U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker reassured allies of continued U.S. support.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led study suggests that a global interconnected solar-wind energy system could meet the world's energy demands by 2050, producing three times the needed power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. Researchers propose a network leveraging regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents to areas with high demand. The article notes that while such a system could improve energy efficiency and ease decarbonization, its implementation would require navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises. The researchers emphasize that the potential of solar and wind resources vastly surpasses human demand, but intermittency issues need to be addressed to ensure reliable energy supply.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani declared victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo after a strong initial showing, though no candidate reached the 50% threshold to win outright. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum with a progressive platform focused on economic issues and social media virality. Cuomo conceded the primary, expressing intentions to consider an independent run in the November election. The primary outcome is subject to a ranked-choice count, with final results expected in July, and the winner will likely face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly dismissed over a social media post about the war in Gaza. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, leading to an apology from the ABC. Lattouf, who is of Lebanese heritage, said she was punished for her political opinion, and her dismissal triggered public outrage and questions over the ABC's independence. Justice Darryl Rangiah noted the sensitivity of the Israel-Gaza war in his remarks, highlighting the complexities of the case.</p>

Witkoff dismissed concerns that Iran could quickly resume its nuclear enrichment program, stating that it is "not even conceivable."

          <p>Two young bears escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the UK, making their way to the food store where they devoured a week's supply of honey. The park stated that the bears posed no threat to the public and were monitored until they were safely returned to their enclosure. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park attributing the incident to an operational error. The bears, Mish and Lucy, were rescued in 2021 after being abandoned in the Albanian mountains.</p>

          <h2>UK Climate Advisers Report Progress in Heat Pump and EV Adoption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 21:34:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports that electric car and heat pump adoption is increasing, but further progress is needed to meet climate goals. The committee emphasizes the importance of reducing electricity costs to encourage households to switch to cleaner technologies. While electric car sales are rising, heat pump adoption remains below target despite government grants and relaxed planning rules. The CCC suggests removing charges from electricity bills to support renewable energy projects, but notes this could shift costs to general taxation.</p>
