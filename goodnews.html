The article notes that Nike faced declining sales and stalling innovation, while Adidas dealt with the fallout from its partnership with Kanye West, creating an opportunity for On to expand. Despite Nike and Adidas holding a significant market share, On's earnings growth has surpassed both companies in recent quarters.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that eliminating taxes on overtime pay could significantly benefit Republicans in the midterm elections by appealing to working-class voters. The author recounts anecdotes of workers expressing strong support for tax-free overtime, arguing that it would provide a tangible financial benefit and encourage productivity. The article contrasts this with tax cuts on tips, which primarily benefit those in stepping-stone jobs, while overtime pay impacts millions in family-sustaining positions. It concludes that Republicans who champion tax-free overtime could gain substantial political capital.</p>
