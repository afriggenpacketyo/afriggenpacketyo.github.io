          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced its plan to move its primary listing to the United States, a move that presents a setback for the London Stock Exchange. The company intends to establish a dual listing, shifting its main listing hub to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. This strategic move would allow Wise's shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE. Shares of Wise experienced a 7% increase in early morning trading following the announcement.</p>

          <p>The Guardian's writers offer their predictions for the 2025 NBA Finals between the Indiana Pacers and the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder's path to victory lies in their formidable defense and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's scoring prowess, while the Pacers need to maintain their fast pace and protect the ball. The writers are divided on the series outcome, with some favoring the Thunder's depth and defense, while others believe the Pacers' offensive firepower and coaching experience could lead to an upset. Ultimately, the series is expected to be a stylistic clash between two well-coached, homegrown teams.</p>
