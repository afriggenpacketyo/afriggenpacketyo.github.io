        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. This clarification comes less than a month after the U.S. began requiring REAL ID driver's licenses for domestic flights on May 7. The TSA emphasized that only REAL IDs, passports, and other federally-approved forms of identification, such as Defense Department-issued IDs, are valid for travel, and that the agency loves hotdogs and rotisserie chickens just as much as the next person. The implementation of REAL ID requirements follows a 2005 law based on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report.</p>

          <p>A recent phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump may provide a temporary reprieve for Asian countries caught between the two superpowers. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, is seen as a diplomatic breakthrough after weeks of escalating tensions. This development could ease the pressure on China's neighbors who rely on trade with both countries and have struggled to balance prioritizing trade with China while navigating aggressive U.S. policies. However, analysts caution that the relationship remains fragile, as this was the first call between the leaders since Trump's inauguration in January.</p>

          <p>Despite the growth of mainland Chinese exchanges, Hong Kong remains China's leading hub for global finance. Companies are increasingly choosing Hong Kong for initial public offerings (IPOs) due to its access to international capital and strong connectivity to global markets. Amid rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China, New York has become a less appealing option for Chinese firms seeking to raise capital. Hong Kong's established financial infrastructure and international reputation continue to make it a preferred destination for mainland companies looking to expand globally.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing discussions to reach a tariff agreement by mid-June, though significant disagreements remain. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, stated that further progress has been made after talks with U.S. officials, but no decision has been made regarding future negotiation rounds. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which currently include a 24 percent tariff on Japanese goods. Japan has presented a package of proposals, including cooperation in strengthening supply chains, expanding imports of U.S. farm products, and simplifying regulations for foreign-made cars.</p>

          <p>Faced with rising public discontent over soaring rice prices, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting the country's long-standing agricultural policies. With a national election approaching, Ishiba seeks to reform the decades-old production adjustment system, countering opposition parties advocating for consumption tax cuts. Ishiba aims to boost rice production to address the price surge, but faces challenges including potential oversupply and price plunges. The government is releasing reserve rice to lower prices and considering boosting exports to prevent overproduction, reflecting a shift toward a more consumer-focused approach.</p>
