          <p>An unexpected friendship between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is on display as Vance holidays in the UK, staying at Lammy's official country residence. Despite their starkly different political ideologies, the two have bonded over shared experiences of dysfunctional childhoods, prestigious university education, and their Christian faith. This personal relationship is seen as potentially significant in navigating UK-US relations, particularly given the personalized nature of diplomacy under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Director Antonio Negret draws on his multicultural upbringing in his new horror film, "Shaman," which explores demonic possession through an Andean lens in a remote region of Ecuador. The film, a U.S.-Ecuadorian co-production, centers on two missionaries whose son appears to be possessed, forcing them to confront local spiritual beliefs. Negret emphasized authenticity, filming on location near the Chimborazo volcano and collaborating with the local indigenous community to incorporate their language and traditional rituals into the story.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. Investigations show that Epstein's island, Little St. James, did not have an airstrip, making landings by a plane like Trump's impossible; visitors arrived by helicopter or boat. The Facebook user who originated the claim appeared to be wearing a costume pilot pin, further discrediting the assertion, which has been debunked by fact-checkers.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post, in which he called for their immediate deportation. After alerting authorities, it was revealed the boat contained a crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. Lowe later apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause, while the rowers found the incident "hilarious."</p>

          <p>The Canadian government announced it is lowering the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel, joining the European Union and the United Kingdom in the move. This coordinated action is intended to increase economic pressure on Moscow and further limit a key source of revenue funding Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. The policy is part of a broader G7 scheme designed to curtail Russia's war-making capabilities while allowing its oil to reach global markets. (not investment advice)</p>
