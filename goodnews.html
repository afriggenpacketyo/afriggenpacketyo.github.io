          <p>The business travel and expense management startup Navan has officially filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 'NAVN'. The company's S-1 filing reveals a trailing 12-month revenue of $613 million and gross bookings of $7.6 billion, indicating significant growth despite a competitive market. Navan, which touts itself as an 'all-in-one super app,' aims to disrupt the corporate travel sector with its AI-driven platform. The move comes amid a resurgent IPO market, which has seen the most activity since the boom years of the pandemic, signaling renewed investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, is in the process of raising $10 billion, which would place its valuation at an immense $200 billion. This fundraising effort highlights the intense investor appetite for foundational AI model developers, following similar large-scale investments in competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. Although Musk later denied the report on his social media platform X, the news suggests significant capital is being sought to acquire AI chips and build out infrastructure, such as the large AI computer cluster in Memphis.

          <p>Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, has publicly defended Jimmy Kimmel following the host's indefinite suspension by the Disney-owned ABC network. In a social media post, Eisner condemned what he termed 'out-of-control intimidation' from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, whose threats against ABC's broadcast license preceded the network's decision. Eisner questioned the lack of leadership from corporate executives in standing up to such pressure and reaffirmed his support for the First Amendment. He also praised Kimmel as 'very talented and funny,' placing himself in direct opposition to the actions taken by his former company and the current administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields moved higher, with the 10-year note reaching a two-week high above 4.12%, a counterintuitive trend following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate this week. Investors are weighing strong economic signals, including lower-than-expected jobless claims, against the Fed's monetary easing. The rise in long-term yields suggests that the market is pricing in expectations of sustained economic growth and slightly higher inflation, rather than an impending slowdown. Market participants are now looking ahead to the upcoming personal consumption expenditures index for a clearer picture of inflation pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly addressed reports that he collaborates on weekly game plans with team minority owner Tom Brady. Kelly clarified that while he uses Brady as a valuable resource and has discussed football philosophy with him, the seven-time Super Bowl champion is not involved in weekly game planning. The clarification came after an ESPN sideline report suggested frequent communication about game plans, a claim head coach Pete Carroll also called inaccurate. The NFL has confirmed that there are no policies prohibiting an owner from being in the coaches' booth during a game.</p>

          <p>Pattern Group, a leading third-party seller on Amazon, has successfully launched its initial public offering on the Nasdaq exchange. The e-commerce accelerator, which helps brands like Nestle and Panasonic optimize online sales, raised $300 million and was valued at approximately $2.5 billion. The company's stock, trading under the ticker 'PTRN,' closed up 11% on its first day of trading. The debut is another sign of a revitalized tech IPO market, though Pattern noted in its prospectus that its heavy reliance on the Amazon platform and uncertainty surrounding global trade tariffs pose significant risks to its business.</p>

          <p>A new industry forecast from Wolfe Research projects a significant increase in U.S. electricity demand over the next five years, largely driven by the power requirements of new AI data centers. The report estimates that 265 gigawatts of new electricity supply will be needed by 2029, a substantial upward revision from last year's forecast. This bullish outlook is seen as a strong fundamental tailwind for industrial companies like GE Vernova, which manufactures power-generating turbines, and Eaton, which produces electrical equipment for the grid and data centers. The analysis suggests these companies are well-positioned for sustained growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron officially reopened the iconic towers of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, marking a major milestone in the restoration following the devastating 2019 fire. The public can now once again climb the 424 steps to the top for panoramic views of the city, a sign of the remarkable recovery of the historic landmark. The nearly $1 billion reconstruction project, completed within the five-year timeframe promised by Macron, has been a significant success. While the cathedral itself reopened in December 2024, the opening of the towers represents one of the final steps in returning the monument to its former glory.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's 'no tax on tips' initiative. The new provision allows eligible workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 through 2028. The guidance confirms that workers in 'specified service trades or businesses,' such as healthcare and legal services, will not qualify for the deduction. Furthermore, the agencies clarified that automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties at restaurants, will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments. Final regulations will be released after a public comment period.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve implementing another interest rate cut, consumers have several increasingly affordable options for borrowing money. Among the cheapest methods are home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which currently have an average rate of just over 8% and are responsive to further rate decreases due to their variable nature. Home equity loans offer a slightly higher but fixed rate, providing more predictability for borrowers. While personal loan rates remain in the double digits, they are still significantly cheaper than record-high credit card interest rates and do not require putting up a home as collateral.

          <p>In remembrance of Robert Redford, this article explores a consistent theme throughout his extensive film career: the hollowness of victory and the corrupting nature of success. From the arrogant athlete in 'The Way We Were' to the morally compromised politician in 'The Candidate,' Redford often portrayed characters whose triumphs came at a great personal or ethical cost. His 1969 film 'Downhill Racer,' which he championed, is highlighted as a masterclass in depicting the self-centeredness and ultimate fragility of an elite athlete. This recurring focus suggests Redford was deeply aware of the dangers of being seen as an icon, using his art to deconstruct the very idea of 'winning.'</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal is taking steps to win back liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker traffic that was lost during recent years of severe drought. The Canal Authority plans to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers and is developing a new 76-kilometer pipeline to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus, freeing up canal capacity. These initiatives are designed to offer energy companies more flexibility and a reliable alternative route. The move comes as the canal forecasts a decrease in container traffic for the remainder of the year after a period of record-breaking volume.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint failed to meet basic court requirements. The judge stated the 85-page filing was repetitive, contained 'florid' allegations, and violated the rule requiring a 'short and plain statement' for why relief is deserved. The court has given Trump's legal team 28 days to file an amended, compliant version of the lawsuit. The New York Times welcomed the swift ruling, characterizing the original complaint as a political document rather than a serious legal filing intended to stifle independent reporting.</p>
