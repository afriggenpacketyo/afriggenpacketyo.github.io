          <p>China's leading on-demand delivery service, Meituan, announced its daily orders have surged to a new record of 150 million. This milestone indicates the company's success in defending its market share against intense competition from rivals like JD.com and Alibaba. Meituan's founder, Wang Xing, has pledged significant investment to maintain dominance in the instant delivery sector, particularly in the food service industry. The achievement comes as major Chinese e-commerce platforms are aggressively expanding into this highly contested market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As he turns 18, football prodigy Lamine Yamal has become a central figure for Barcelona, already playing over 100 first-team games, a stark contrast to Lionel Messi's nine at the same age. While Yamal deflects comparisons to Messi, his performance has fueled speculation he will inherit the iconic number 10 shirt. Supported by his family, he maintains a balance between his rising stardom and a grounded personal life. Despite his youth, Yamal has shown remarkable maturity and skill, becoming a leader for both his club and the Spanish national team.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon men's final will feature a highly anticipated showdown between the world's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Their rivalry, which has dominated the men's tour, will be renewed just weeks after their classic five-set final at the French Open, which Alcaraz won. While both players are young, they have already won the last six major tournaments between them, establishing a new duopoly in tennis. The final promises another gripping encounter between Sinner's ice-cold composure and Alcaraz's charismatic, all-court game.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all recording their warmest day of 2025 on Saturday. Temperatures are expected to remain high on Sunday before a significant dip on Monday brings cooler conditions and rain to many areas. Amber heat health alerts remain active for southern and eastern England, warning of potential health risks, especially for the elderly and vulnerable. The intense heat has led to hosepipe bans in several regions and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing data from two existing upstream dams offers insights into the potential impact of China's planned mega-dam in Tibet on the Brahmaputra River. Contrary to fears in downstream countries like India that the dam would cause droughts, the research suggests the opposite may be true. Data collected since 2014 indicates that existing dams have significantly increased water levels during the dry season, with low flows rising by over 50 percent in February. This suggests that large-scale dam operations could regulate river flow, potentially alleviating rather than exacerbating water scarcity downstream.</p>
