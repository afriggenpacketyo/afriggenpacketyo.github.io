          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting Emphasizes Attunement and Resilience</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open conversations. This approach involves accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shaming, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents also take responsibility after conflicts by apologizing and reconnecting, creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves authentically. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves doing inner work to understand personal triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame through healthy repair.</p>

After seeing the incident on his security camera footage, Paul was able to recover the truck. He added a humorous touch by posting the footage with Celine Dion‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Heart Will Go On‚Äù as the soundtrack.</p>

          <p>Julie Moore, an Army spouse, is remembered for her efforts to change the military's casualty notification system, ensuring families receive news of a soldier's death in person with support. Inspired by her own experience and the impersonal telegrams sent during the Vietnam War, Moore successfully lobbied for a more compassionate approach. Today, service members personally notify families and offer ongoing support. In 2023, Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore to honor Julie and her husband, marking the first time a military base was named for a civilian.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris secured his first victory since the season-opener in Australia at the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a race win. The race was relatively straightforward for the front-runners, with an early virtual safety car being the only major intervention. Norris, Charles Leclerc, and Oscar Piastri all followed a similar strategy, starting on medium tires and switching to hard tires. Max Verstappen, starting at a disadvantage, finished fourth after a late pit stop.</p>
