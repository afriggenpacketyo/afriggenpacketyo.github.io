          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reiterated his country's support for Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, during a meeting with his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian. Xi stated that China respects Iran's repeated affirmations that it is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons and will continue to promote a solution to the nuclear issue. The meeting, which followed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, occurs as both nations face significant pressure from the U.S.-led international order. The sentiment was echoed by Iran's Supreme Leader, who suggested the two countries could be a transformative power in reshaping the global landscape.</p>

          <p>Authorities in La Salle County, Texas, have arrested a 66-year-old man for the murder of Valerie Laguna, a pregnant woman whose body was found in a cemetery 20 years ago. Laguna, 26, was nine months pregnant when she was killed by blunt force trauma to the head in 2005. The sheriff's office stated that advancements in forensic investigation allowed them to link the suspect, Saul Gonzalez, to the crime. Gonzalez was indicted by a grand jury for capital murder and is being held on a $1 million bond, bringing a significant development to a case that the community has long remembered.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent dip in Chinese auto exports to Russia, analysts believe there is significant room for the two nations to expand trade, particularly using their local currencies. As both countries face increasing economic pressure and tariffs from the United States, Russia is seeking consumer goods and machinery that are now difficult to import from the West. During a visit by President Vladimir Putin to Beijing, the two sides signed over 20 bilateral agreements covering energy, technology, and agriculture. This economic cooperation reinforces their strategic alignment as they seek to build markets independent of the U.S.-dominated global financial system.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a long-serving Democrat from New York, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, ending a 34-year career in Congress. The 78-year-old lawmaker stated his decision was influenced by the need for generational change within the Democratic party, a sentiment he felt was highlighted by the challenges faced by the previous administration. As the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Nadler played a central role in both of President Trump's impeachments. His retirement is expected to open up a competitive primary for his desirable Manhattan district, and he is reportedly likely to endorse a former aide as his successor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists are using drones to protect livestock from gray wolves near the California-Oregon border. The drones are equipped with speakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from films, and live human voices to scare the predators away from cattle herds, particularly at night. The USDA-led project aims to find effective nonlethal methods to reduce human-wolf conflicts as wolf populations recover in the western U.S. While preliminary results show the novel hazing technique can successfully interrupt wolf hunts, questions remain about its long-term effectiveness and whether wolves will eventually become accustomed to the disturbances.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to announce the relocation of U.S. Space Command headquarters from its temporary base in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama. This decision reverses a 2023 move by the previous administration to keep the command in Colorado. Huntsville, known as "Rocket City," is already home to significant military and NASA installations, including the Army's Redstone Arsenal and the Marshall Space Flight Center. The move concludes a prolonged political and logistical battle between the two states over hosting the strategic military command, which oversees U.S. space operations and has significant economic implications for the chosen region.</p>
