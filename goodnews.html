          <p>Indonesian State Secretariat Minister Prabowo Subianto attended China's military parade in Beijing, a visit appreciated by the Chinese foreign ministry. Prabowo is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his one-day trip. It remains unclear whether he will meet with other Southeast Asian leaders like Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim or Myanmar's junta leader Min Aung Hlaing. The visit occurs amidst protests in Indonesia, adding a layer of complexity to Prabowo's diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>A US court ruled that Google is a monopolist in online search but proposed remedies that some view as lenient, leading to scrutiny in Silicon Valley. The judge decided against breaking up Google by spinning off Chrome or imposing court oversight on Android. The emergence of generative AI influenced the ruling, as the judge believes AI companies can pose a threat to Google's dominance. Google must share certain data with qualified competitors and allow them to display Google search results as their own, but can continue paying for distribution. </p>

          <p>Real Madrid has demonstrated a knack for acquiring world-class talent on free transfers, signing players like Trent Alexander-Arnold, David Alaba, Antonio Rudiger, and Kylian Mbappe. The club's allure and history of winning major trophies often convince players to run down their contracts with other big clubs to join Real Madrid. While other clubs have also made notable free signings, Real Madrid's success in attracting top players from rival European teams sets them apart. The club's relentless desire to win and its mystique contribute to its ability to land prized free agents.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that the stock market's decline was due to a court ruling against his tariffs, arguing that the market needs tariffs. However, there's a possibility that Treasurys could benefit from tariffs, as investors may demand higher returns due to fears of a hit to the U.S. government's coffers. In other news, Google will be allowed to keep Chrome, but cannot have exclusive contracts to preload its products, and Kraft Heinz is expected to split into two companies in 2026.

          <p>The US Open 2025 has sparked debates over on-court etiquette, including net cords, underarm serves, and body shots. Jelena Ostapenko accused Taylor Townsend of lacking courtesy for not apologizing for a net cord, highlighting differing views on etiquette. The underarm serve, often used by Nick Kyrgios, is seen by some as disrespectful, while others consider it a legitimate tactic. Hitting an inviting short ball at an opponent who has moved towards the net is another contentious issue, as demonstrated by Stefanos Tsitsipas's actions. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that President Trump cannot use the Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members. The court found that the act, intended for wartime, does not apply to gangs like Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration had deported individuals to a prison in El Salvador, arguing U.S. courts couldn't intervene. The ruling, with one judge dissenting, stated Trump's allegations didn't meet the level of national conflict required for the act.</p>
