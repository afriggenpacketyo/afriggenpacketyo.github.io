          <p>NTT Docomo, a Japanese telecom giant, will discontinue its original emoji set after 26 years, marking the end of a significant era in digital communication. Introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, Docomo's emoji played a crucial role in shaping the visual language of texting, particularly among teenagers in Japan. The company cites the global adoption of Google's emoji as the reason for the change, with new Android smartphones and feature phones adopting Noto Color Emoji or Samsung emoji instead. Docomo's emoji set was recognized by the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016 for its contribution to electronic communication.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert emphasizes that optimism, tailored motivation, and fostering a love for learning are crucial for raising highly successful children. Parents should encourage a sense of possibility, tailor their motivational approach to their child's interests, and recognize that learning and empowerment can happen anywhere, including in everyday tasks. It is also important to foster a genuine love for knowledge, often through travel, and to motivate children with love and support rather than acting as a coach or critic. The expert emphasizes that creating a joyful and supportive environment is essential for children to thrive.</p>
