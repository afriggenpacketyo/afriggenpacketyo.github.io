          <p>The private equity industry is facing pressure as a previously anticipated boom in M&A and IPO activity has not materialized, leading to concerns about its ability to generate top returns. The industry is holding a significant number of unsold companies, impacting returns for investors and stretching resources for fund managers. U.S. tariffs were cited as a factor reducing market risk appetite, while some argue that private equity still outperforms public markets in the long term. Consolidation and new investment strategies are emerging as the sector adapts to changing market conditions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a plan to enhance the disaster resilience of its infrastructure over the next five years, with an expected cost exceeding 20 trillion yen. The plan focuses on addressing aging infrastructure and includes measures to repair sewer pipes and bridges, as well as build disaster prevention infrastructure.

          <p>Job growth is expected to have slowed in May, influenced by President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariffs. Economists predict the U.S. added 125,000 jobs, a slowdown from the previous month, as trade agreements and tariff pauses created uncertainty. Major companies have warned of potential losses due to the tariffs, which could impact consumer spending and trigger layoffs. Despite these concerns, key economic measures have largely defied fears of a downturn, with low unemployment and cooling inflation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Sanctuary cities are being compelled to comply with federal immigration rules through a program called Operation Guardian Angel, launched by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. The program seeks judicial warrants for criminal illegal aliens, ensuring local officials hand them over to ICE. This initiative addresses the loophole in sanctuary city policies that ignore ICE detainer warrants. The operation has already resulted in numerous arrests and aims to remove criminal illegal aliens from sanctuary jurisdictions, restoring immigration law enforcement power.</p>

          <p>Pride celebrations are moving forward despite a corporate exodus that has led to budget shortfalls for organizers. Many Pride events have experienced a 20% to 30% decrease in corporate sponsorship, with some major sponsors withdrawing support. Organizers are attributing these cancellations to financial strain, internal transitions, and fear of backlash from anti-DEI policies. Despite the challenges, Pride celebrations are continuing, but the long-term impact on year-round programming remains a concern.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband announced that most new build homes in England will be required to fit solar panels under new regulations to be published this year. The regulations will require developers to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade. Miliband said the move was "just common sense" and would save the typical household ¬£500 a year on their energy bills. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against burdensome paperwork.</p>
