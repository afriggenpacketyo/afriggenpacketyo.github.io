          <p>Meta is rolling out new default content restrictions for Instagram users under the age of 18, aligning the platform's content appropriateness with the standard of a PG-13 movie rating. The new settings will automatically be applied to teen accounts, blocking them from seeing search results for sensitive topics like "gore" and preventing them from following accounts that post age-inappropriate material. The changes, which require parental permission to opt out of, also extend to Meta's integrated AI, ensuring its responses are age-appropriate. A more restrictive "Limited Content" setting is also being introduced for parents seeking tighter controls.</p>

          <p>Actress and producer Reese Witherspoon is making her debut as a novelist with "Gone Before Goodbye," a thriller co-written with bestselling author Harlan Coben. The book features a female Army combat surgeon, Maggie McCabe, who becomes entangled in an international conspiracy, reflecting Witherspoon's desire to create a female action hero on par with characters like Jason Bourne. Witherspoon drew inspiration from her parents' military medical careers to develop the protagonist. The collaboration is Coben's first with a co-author, and the pair hope to adapt the novel into a film or television series with multiple installments.</p>

          <p>Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is enjoying an exceptional start to the season at Napoli, prompting questions about whether Manchester City let the 34-year-old star leave prematurely. De Bruyne, who joined Napoli on a free transfer after his City contract expired, was among several senior players to depart the club in the past year. Despite his age, his current high level of performance, marked by numerous goals and assists, suggests he could still have been a valuable asset for Pep Guardiola's squad. In contrast, Manchester City has had a solid but less dominant start to their campaign, highlighting the potential impact of his absence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without making monthly payments, but it does not transfer ownership of the property to the lender. The homeowner's name remains on the title, and they are still responsible for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Instead of taking ownership, the lender places a lien on the home to secure the loan, which becomes due when the borrower sells, moves out, or passes away. At that point, the homeowner or their heirs can repay the loan to keep the property or sell it to settle the debt.</p>

          <p>A correspondent traveling with President Donald Trump provides a first-hand account of the diplomatic trip to Israel and Egypt to formalize the Gaza ceasefire and peace plan. The visit was framed as a "historic" victory lap, with Trump declaring the dawn of "everlasting peace" and taking credit for the breakthrough. The article contrasts the celebratory atmosphere, including a fly-by of a "thank you" sign on a Tel Aviv beach, with the fragile reality on the ground and the difficult negotiations still ahead. The narrative highlights Trump's confident, often bombastic style while glossing over the complex details required to secure a lasting resolution.</p>

          <p>Boeing delivered 55 aircraft in September, including 40 of its 737 Max models, bringing its total for the year to 440 planes. This performance puts the aerospace giant on track for its most successful year of deliveries since 2018, before the 737 Max crashes significantly impacted its operations. The company's production is stabilizing, with executives planning to increase the 737 Max output rate to 42 per month by year's end, up from the current cap of 38. The strong month also included 48 net new orders, signaling continued demand for its aircraft. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has announced plans to deploy 50,000 of AMD's new Instinct MI450 AI chips starting in the second half of 2026. This move signifies a major step by cloud providers to offer alternatives to Nvidia's dominant GPUs for artificial intelligence workloads, particularly for AI inference tasks. The deal strengthens the growing partnership between AMD and OpenAI, which recently entered into a massive, multi-year cloud agreement with Oracle. This development indicates a diversification in the AI hardware market, potentially challenging Nvidia's near-monopoly and providing more options for companies building out AI infrastructure.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion judgment against him for defaming the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. Jones had falsely and repeatedly claimed the 2012 massacre was a hoax. His lawyers had argued the massive sum, awarded by a Connecticut jury and judge, amounted to a "financial death penalty" that could never be paid. The court's denial, issued without comment, effectively ends Jones's legal challenges to the defamation damages, ensuring he remains liable for the full amount awarded to the families.</p>

          <p>The island nation of Cape Verde is celebrating a historic sporting achievement after its national soccer team, the "Blue Sharks," qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time. A 3-0 victory over Eswatini secured their spot in the 2026 tournament, sparking jubilant celebrations across the capital, Praia. With a population of just under 600,000, Cape Verde is the smallest African country by population to ever qualify for the World Cup. The accomplishment is seen as a monumental victory for the archipelago nation, which only began participating in World Cup qualifying in 2002.</p>

          <p>The explosive demand for data, driven by AI, is creating a new and valuable asset class in commercial real estate: "powered land." This refers to land that has been prepared with the necessary permits, utility connections, and infrastructure to support power-hungry data centers. Global real estate firms like Hines are now focusing on this front-end work, negotiating with utilities and landowners to make sites "AI-ready" before construction begins. Securing power rights has become more critical than building structures, turning these prepared land parcels into tradable assets sought by tech companies and hyperscalers.
