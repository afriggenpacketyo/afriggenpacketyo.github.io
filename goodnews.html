          <p>Whirlpool anticipates that President Trump's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum will provide a competitive edge against foreign competitors like LG and Samsung. The company manufactures 80% of its products in the U.S. and sources 96% of its metal domestically, resulting in higher prices for consumers. Whirlpool hopes the tariffs will level the playing field by increasing costs for overseas competitors who rely on cheaper imported materials. The company is prepared to increase hiring and leverage AI to enhance worker efficiency if demand for domestic appliances rises. (not investment advice) The author's tone is optimistic.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, met the primary goal in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Patients taking the highest dose experienced a 10.5% weight loss on average over 72 weeks, compared to 2.2% in the placebo group. The company plans to seek regulatory approvals globally and anticipates launching the pill within the next year. While existing GLP-1 injections have shown greater weight loss, an oral option offering over 10% weight loss for patients with both conditions is considered a valuable addition to treatment options.

          <p>The Trump administration, through Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, threatened to withhold millions in federal funding from California, Washington, and New Mexico due to their alleged failure to enforce English language proficiency requirements for truck drivers. This action follows a deadly crash in Florida involving an illegal immigrant truck driver who failed a CDL test after the accident. Duffy stated the states have 30 days to respond with a corrective plan or face funding cuts, with California potentially losing $33 million. The administration aims to ensure road safety by requiring truck drivers to understand road signs and training materials.</p>
