        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data from England reveals a strong correlation between student absenteeism in the first week of the school year and higher rates of persistent absence later on. According to government figures, 57% of pupils who missed some school during the initial week in September 2024 went on to be classified as persistently absent, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged parents and schools to prioritize attendance from the very start of the term to combat what she describes as a critically high national absence rate. This focus comes as schools continue to address the lingering effects of the pandemic on student attendance.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has spoken out about her choice to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad, describing it as a crucial decision for her well-being. The 32-year-old athlete explained that after a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, she felt on the verge of a mental and physical breakdown. Bright realized she could not give her full commitment to the national team and prioritized her health by taking a break, which included knee surgery and starting counseling. She now feels mentally and physically rejuvenated and ready for the upcoming Women's Super League season.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a Trump appointee who served as the political head of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), has stepped down after a four-month tenure, stating his mission was accomplished. His focus was to reframe the U.S. foreign aid agency from a traditional development body into a strategic investment tool aligned with an "America First" agenda. Dasgupta pushed for projects to be evaluated based on their return on investment for the United States and their potential to counter Chinese influence, particularly in securing access to critical minerals. This shift aligns with the administration's broader goal of making foreign engagement more directly beneficial to U.S. national security and economic interests. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite facing death threats and sedition charges, Villanueva provided support and proper burials for the thousands of impoverished individuals killed in the crackdown. Other winners include an Indian foundation that promotes education for girls in underserved villages and a Maldivian diver leading a movement against plastic pollution.

          <p>Three brothers from Scotland—Ewan, Jamie, and Lachlan Maclean—have set a new world record by completing the fastest unsupported, non-stop row across the Pacific Ocean in 139 days. They journeyed 9,000 miles from Peru to Australia, overcoming challenges such as storms, dwindling supplies, and a man-overboard incident. Upon their arrival in Cairns, the trio celebrated their historic achievement, which also marked the first successful row from South America on record. The expedition was undertaken to raise £1 million for The Maclean Foundation, their non-profit organization dedicated to funding clean water projects in Madagascar.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment near the California-Oregon border, biologists are using drones to deter gray wolves from attacking livestock. The drones are equipped with loudspeakers that blast a variety of sounds, including the AC/DC song "Thunderstruck," clips from the film "Marriage Story," and live human voices, to startle the predators. This nonlethal hazing technique was developed by USDA scientists to interrupt wolf hunts, particularly at night when they are most active. While the method has shown initial success in reducing conflicts, its long-term effectiveness is still being studied, as wolves may eventually become accustomed to the disturbances.</p>

          <p>The imposition of 50% tariffs by the U.S. on Indian goods has created a new dynamic for the relationship between India and China, two economic powerhouses with a history of mistrust. With both nations facing economic pressure from Washington, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the SCO summit is seen as a potential turning point. Experts suggest that the shared challenge of U.S. trade policy could incentivize Beijing and Delhi to find common ground and enhance economic cooperation. This meeting could lead to the resumption of direct flights, relaxed visa policies, and a renewed focus on leveraging their respective economic strengths to reshape global trade flows.</p>

          <p>Canadian tennis player Felix Auger-Aliassime secured a significant victory at the US Open by defeating world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in a four-set match. The 25th seed mounted a comeback after losing the first set, ultimately winning 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 in a grueling contest that lasted nearly four hours. This marks Auger-Aliassime's first Grand Slam win against a top-five opponent and propels him into the fourth round of the tournament for the first time since 2021. The result is a major disappointment for Zverev, who was considered a title contender and now faces his earliest exit from the US Open in seven years.</p>

          <p>Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has stated his ambition to create a transaction system for virtual assets that could rival the scale of the traditional Swift network. He predicted in an interview that transaction volume facilitated by his network could surpass Swift's within the next five years, potentially growing to handle hundreds of trillions of dollars. Sun highlighted the speed advantage of blockchain technology, which processes transactions in seconds compared to the days it can take for Swift. This confidence is rooted in Tron's significant and growing role in facilitating global stablecoin transactions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans started their 2025 football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State at the Coliseum. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The offense was explosive, featuring three plays of over 60 yards, while the defense registered five sacks and a pick-six by safety Bishop Fitzgerald. The game marked the most points scored by USC since 1930, though the lopsided nature of the contest against an FCS opponent offered limited insight into the team's true strength for the tougher games ahead.</p>
