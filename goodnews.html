          <h2>China's 'Engineering State' Showcases Grandeur and Tragedy</h2>

          <p>Dan Wang observes that China's infrastructure, from subway stations to high-speed rail, showcases an 'engineering state' with rapid development outpacing the United States. China has built dams, bridges, and high-rises on a massive scale, prioritizing electrical, nano, computer, solar, and space engineering as matters of national security. The country produces significantly more STEM graduates than the US, and most top officials are engineers, contrasting with the US's 'lawyerly state'. Wang's analysis highlights the scale and ambition of China's engineering focus.</p>

          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving from Chicago O'Hare International Airport rolled into a grass area off the runway after landing at Boston Logan International Airport on Thursday. No injuries were reported among the passengers, who exited the Airbus A220 via stairs. The Massachusetts Port Authority stated that the runway was temporarily closed for assessment, and passengers were bussed to the terminal.

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China Earlier Than Previously Thought</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research from Chinese and US archaeologists suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, potentially earlier than previously believed. The study, published in PNAS, analyzed early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region and found evidence of pigs consuming humans' cooked food and waste. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The findings indicate that pig domestication occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient China.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed made an albatross, a very rare golf score, during the first round of the US Open, holing his second shot on the par-5 fourth hole from 286 yards. This marked just the fourth albatross in US Open history since records began in 1983. Despite the albatross, Reed finished the round at 3-over 73, including a triple bogey on the final hole. JJ Spaun leads the tournament after the first day at Oakmont.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are prioritizing overseas expansion to ensure survival amid ongoing trade tariffs imposed by the US. Despite a temporary truce, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Companies are diversifying their production bases, with planned expansions primarily in the Middle East and Africa, followed by the US and Europe. Executives emphasize that localizing production abroad is crucial for long-term sustainability, especially if tariffs increase further.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England will be the first in the world to offer a 'Trojan horse' therapy for the blood cancer myeloma. The therapy, called belantamab mafodotin, delivers toxic drugs directly into cancer cells, halting the disease for nearly three times longer than current treatments. One of the first patients to receive the treatment, Paul Silvester, described it as "life-changing." The drug is an advanced form of chemotherapy that increases the dose to the cancer while reducing side effects.</p>
