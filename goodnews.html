          <p>During a White House meeting, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the possibility of the U.S. supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, potentially in exchange for Ukrainian-made drones. However, Trump expressed hesitation about depleting the U.S. arsenal, stating he hopes the war can be resolved without such an escalation. The meeting occurred shortly after Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he plans to meet in Budapest. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for continued pressure on Russia to achieve peace.</p>

          <p>Amid market volatility and shifting interest rates, many are considering annuities for retirement planning due to their guaranteed income streams. The article identifies fixed annuities as the safest current option, offering predictable returns shielded from market downturns, with many providing rates between 5% and 6%. It also discusses Multi-Year Guaranteed Annuities (MYGAs) for their locked-in rates and Single Premium Immediate Annuities (SPIAs) for lifetime income. The best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. electricity companies are facing a significant challenge in determining the actual power demand that will result from the artificial intelligence boom. While AI firms are planning massive data centers, they are often proposing the same large projects to multiple utilities, making it difficult to get an accurate forecast of future needs. This uncertainty complicates grid planning and could lead to billions in unnecessary infrastructure investment, while electricity prices for consumers are already rising. Experts agree that a historic increase in electricity consumption is coming, but its exact scale remains a multibillion-dollar question for the energy sector.</p>

          <p>The Swiss running shoe company On is being sued in a class-action lawsuit by customers who allege a design defect in its popular CloudTec shoes causes an "embarrassing" squeaking sound with every step. The complaint, filed in Oregon, claims the noise is caused by rubber components in the shoe's unique sole rubbing together. The plaintiffs argue they would not have purchased the premium-priced footwear, which retails for $140 to $180, had they known about the issue. The lawsuit also claims the company has dismissed the problem as "normal wear and tear," refusing returns under its warranty.</p>

          <p>Homebuyers and homeowners may see mortgage interest rates fall before the Federal Reserve's next meeting on October 29, where another rate cut is widely expected. Historically, mortgage rates have often dropped in anticipation of the Fed's official announcements, as lenders "price in" the expected cuts beforehand. This pattern suggests a potential, albeit possibly temporary, window of opportunity for borrowers to secure lower rates in the coming days. To prepare, prospective borrowers are advised to improve their credit scores, shop around for lenders, and monitor the rate environment closely to act quickly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa's women's cricket team secured a decisive 10-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in a match shortened by rain, advancing to second place in the World Cup standings. Chasing a revised target of 121 runs in 20 overs, the Proteas reached their goal comfortably within 15 overs, led by an unbeaten opening partnership between Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits. The win marks South Africa's fourth consecutive victory in the tournament, placing them just one point behind leader Australia. The defeat leaves co-hosts Sri Lanka winless and with slim chances of advancing to the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed a lawsuit against three major plastic bag manufacturers, alleging they are violating state law by falsely marketing their bags as recyclable. The lawsuit claims that the thicker plastic bags sold in stores since the 2014 ban on single-use bags are not, in fact, being recycled in the state. An investigation found that these bags are not accepted at the vast majority of California's recycling facilities and end up in landfills. The state also announced a settlement with four other producers who will stop sales and pay over $1.7 million in penalties.</p>

          <p>The recent record-breaking surge in gold prices is accelerating a move away from the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond investment portfolio. Many financial strategists are now advocating for a 60/20/20 model, which reduces the bond allocation to 20% and adds a 20% share for alternatives like gold and cryptocurrency. This shift is driven by the belief that bonds no longer provide adequate protection against inflation and geopolitical risks, as they increasingly move in tandem with stocks. The trend reflects a growing acceptance of assets like gold as core holdings rather than fringe hedges. (not investment advice)</p>

Qatar aims to maintain its indispensable role as a mediator with close ties to both the U.S. and Hamas's political leadership.

The medication will be available through select online pharmacies, including Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company and Alto Pharmacy.

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon is releasing her first adult fiction novel, a thriller titled "Gone Before Goodbye," co-written with author Harlan Coben. The book centers on a skilled female surgeon, a character Witherspoon says was inspired by her desire to see heroines defined by their unique skills rather than their sex appeal, a critique she developed from watching James Bond films as a child. Witherspoon, who founded the production company Hello Sunshine to champion complex female stories, says she still sees a "gap" in Hollywood for such roles. She and Coben collaborated closely on the novel's development and writing process.</p>

This partnership differs from Apple's MLS Season Pass, as the F1 content will be included in the existing Apple TV subscription without an extra fee.

          <p>Recent aggressive and prolonged Russian air incursions into the airspace of NATO countries like Poland and Estonia have been met with a firm and unified response from the alliance. This resolve, which included scrambling jets and establishing a new coordinated defense initiative called Eastern Sentry, may have backfired on Vladimir Putin's attempts to intimidate and divide NATO members. The article suggests a rare alignment between President Trump and European leaders on pressuring Russia, potentially creating urgency for Putin ahead of a planned summit with Trump. The events underscore a growing European consensus on the need for stronger, integrated defense systems against Russian provocations.</p>
