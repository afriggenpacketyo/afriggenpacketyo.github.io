          <p>Arsenal has signed defender Piero Hincapie from Bayer Leverkusen on a season-long loan, which includes a £45 million option for a permanent transfer next summer. The 23-year-old Ecuador international was part of Leverkusen's Bundesliga and German Cup-winning squad in the previous season. Manager Mikel Arteta praised Hincapie for his physical presence and versatility, stating he will make the squad stronger and more competitive. The signing is seen as a direct replacement for Polish defender Jakub Kiwior, who has been loaned to Porto.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's transfer deadline day bid to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi has collapsed despite the clubs agreeing on a fee of at least £35 million. The deal fell through because Crystal Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement before sanctioning the transfer. Palace had signed one new center-back but wanted a second in place before allowing the 25-year-old team captain to depart. Guehi had been a key target for Liverpool, who sought to strengthen their defense after conceding six goals in their first three games of the season.</p>

          <p>Oman has launched a 'Golden Residency' program, becoming the latest Gulf state to offer long-term visas to attract foreign investment and talent. To qualify, foreigners must invest at least $520,000 in property, bonds, or businesses that create local jobs, granting them fast-track airport services and expanded property ownership rights. The initiative is part of a broader trend among nations competing for wealthy individuals seeking financial security and mobility. Experts note that such programs are increasingly popular among Americans looking for a second residency as an 'insurance policy' against global uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A new film titled 'The Smashing Machine,' directed by Benny Safdie, chronicles the life of pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr, with Dwayne Johnson in the lead role. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores Kerr's personal crisis after his first professional loss, which led to struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. The review praises Johnson's casting as the only conceivable choice for the role and highlights Emily Blunt's performance as Kerr's girlfriend. While solid, the film is said to stop short of reaching the dramatic heights of other sports biopics.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has offloaded two of its high-profile forwards, with Rasmus Hojlund joining Napoli on loan and Antony completing a permanent transfer to Real Betis. Hojlund's deal includes a £38 million obligation to buy next summer, while Antony's move is valued at £21.65 million. Both players, who were expensive signings for United, struggled to find form at Old Trafford and were deemed surplus to requirements by the club's new manager. Antony had a successful loan spell at Real Betis last season, helping them reach the UEFA Conference League final.</p>

          <p>An article examines and refutes persistent social media claims that former U.S. First Lady Melania Trump worked as an escort and met Donald Trump at a party hosted by Ghislaine Maxwell. These allegations, which have circulated since 2016, are unsupported by credible evidence. The article notes that Melania Trump successfully sued the Daily Mail and a U.S. blogger for defamation over similar claims, resulting in retractions and damage payments. Furthermore, reports from multiple sources confirm the couple was introduced by a former modeling agent, not Maxwell, debunking another key part of the rumor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones from southern France has found that the body sizes of wild and domestic species began to diverge significantly during the Middle Ages. Researchers discovered that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like deer and foxes became smaller due to fragmented habitats. In contrast, domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, and chickens grew larger as humans gained more control through selective breeding and specialized management practices. The findings illustrate the profound and lasting impact of human activity on the natural world over the last millennium.</p>

Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, and Jon Rahm were among those chosen to join the six automatic qualifiers, including Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood. Despite the team's continuity, Donald warned against expecting a 'rinse and repeat' strategy, emphasizing that playing on U.S. soil at Bethpage presents a different challenge. He urged his players to embrace the likely raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story to criticize a new policy in the province of Alberta that orders school libraries to remove materials with 'explicit sexual content.' The move came after Atwood's celebrated novel, 'The Handmaid's Tale,' was among over 200 books removed from Edmonton public schools under the new rule. Her new story describes 'very, very good children' who grow up and have a family without ever having sex, mocking the ban's premise. This is the latest action in Atwood's vocal opposition to what she sees as a growing trend of censorship.</p>

Starmer defended Rayner, highlighting her humble background as a 'great story of British success' and dismissing the criticism as attempts to 'talk her down.'

          <p>Algerian Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is legally challenging a mandate from the sport's global federation that requires gender testing for eligibility.

Khelif has filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, seeking to be declared eligible for the upcoming World Boxing Championships without testing.
