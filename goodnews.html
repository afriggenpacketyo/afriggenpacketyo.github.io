          <p>Allied Materials, a Kansas City-based company, is increasing its production of American flags in anticipation of the nation's semiquincentennial celebration next year. The factory, which produces about 1,000 flags daily, is one of the largest vertically integrated manufacturers in the U.S., ensuring every component is American-sourced. Many of its flags are destined for government use and military funerals, a responsibility the company takes very seriously. The company is building inventory to meet the expected surge in demand for what could be the largest flag-flying event in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued another temporary halt to the deportation of eight immigrants to South Sudan, a country embroiled in civil war. This decision came just hours after the Supreme Court had cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with the removal. The case involves men from various countries, only one of whom is from South Sudan, who all have serious criminal convictions. Their lawyers argue they would face perilous conditions upon arrival, and the judge determined their new claims deserved a hearing, transferring the case to another judge in Boston.</p>

          <p>The technology IPO market is showing signs of recovery after a prolonged drought, with a recent increase in public offerings and strong performances from companies like Circle and CoreWeave. Circle, a crypto company, has seen its stock surge sixfold since its June debut, creating significant returns for its venture capital backers. While high-profile companies like SpaceX and Stripe remain private, the renewed activity is providing much-needed liquidity for investors and has sparked cautious optimism that the nearly three-year slump may be ending.

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience has identified five food categories he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term heart health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which contain harmful preservatives. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar spikes and deep-fried foods prepared in unhealthy industrial oils. Instead, he recommends wholesome alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and lean, unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>Competitive eating legend Joey Chestnut made a triumphant return to win the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, consuming 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes. After being banned from last year's event due to a sponsorship dispute, the 16-time champion reclaimed his title to the cheers of a large crowd in Coney Island. While he fell short of his own world record of 76, his victory was decisive. In the women's competition, reigning champion Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs and buns.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie has progressed to the fourth round of Wimbledon after a straight-sets victory over Italy's Matteo Bellucci, making him the last remaining British player in the men's singles competition. Playing on Court One, Norrie overcame a tense first set before taking control of the match to win 7-6, 6-4, 6-3. He credited his win in part to drawing energy from the crowd, a tactic he noted was often used by Andy Murray. Norrie will now face Chile's Nicolas Jarry for a place in the quarterfinals.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the nation's 250th anniversary, acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history. In a CBS News interview, he argued that the revolution "turned the world upside down" by creating the new concept of a "citizen" rather than a "subject," inspiring movements for equality globally. Burns, whose new film on the topic airs this fall, also emphasized the importance of embracing America's complex and often contradictory history, including the fact that the Declaration of Independence's promises did not originally apply to all people.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from the Johnston Atoll wildlife refuge in the Pacific. The decision follows reports and opposition from biologists and environmental groups who warned that the project would cause significant harm to the 14 species of tropical seabirds that nest on the remote island. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in about 90 minutes. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the tests.</p>

          <p>Cars manufactured in China accounted for one in every ten new cars sold in the United Kingdom in June, a record high that reflects the rapid growth of Chinese brands like BYD and MG. This surge, up from 6% a year ago, comes as the UK has so far refrained from imposing the heavy tariffs levied against Chinese electric vehicles by the EU and North America. While the trend offers UK consumers more affordable and innovative options, some industry leaders have warned that it poses a competitive threat to domestic manufacturing. The growth has been particularly strong in the electric vehicle sector.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes showcased the blockchain's growing integration into mainstream finance, with major institutions building on its infrastructure. A key development came from Robinhood, which announced it will allow European users to trade tokenized U.S. stocks via an Ethereum-based network. This trend of "tokenization" is also being pursued by giants like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock, who are leveraging Ethereum for its stability and security. Experts note that institutions are betting on Ethereum not for hype, but as a reliable back-end for the future of financial transactions. (not investment advice)</p>
