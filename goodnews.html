        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Edgar, a respected two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has passed away at 79 due to complications from pancreatic cancer. He is widely credited with guiding the state towards greater financial stability during the 1990s, implementing tough budget cuts and making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent to secure vital funding for public schools. A moderate Republican, Edgar remained an influential party statesman, later growing uneasy with the party's shift to the right and notably not supporting Donald Trump's presidency. His passing marks the end of an era for a leader remembered for his unwavering integrity, pragmatic leadership, and significant contributions to strengthening Illinois state institutions.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United's Struggles Attributed to Player Selection, Not System, Says Danny Murphy</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Football pundit Danny Murphy contends that Manchester United's ongoing issues are rooted in individual player mistakes and incorrect positional deployment, rather than the team's 3-4-2-1 tactical system. While manager Ruben Amorim's side has shown improvements in compactness and defensive structure, these gains are often negated by costly errors leading to conceded goals. Murphy specifically criticizes Bruno Fernandes's defensive shortcomings in a deeper midfield role and Luke Shaw's uncomfortable fit as a center-back. The article concludes that Amorim's selection choices, rather than the formation itself, are hindering United's ability to perform consistently and realize their full potential on the pitch.</p>

          <p>East Los Angeles held its 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade, marked by a powerful sense of defiance and pride amidst the Trump administration's intensified immigration crackdown and a recent Supreme Court ruling authorizing "roving patrols." Despite widespread fears fueled by ongoing ICE raids, many residents felt it was crucial to participate, asserting their rights and identity as Mexican Americans. Mayor Karen Bass expressed strong solidarity with Latino constituents, condemning the raids as "abhorrent" and emphasizing Los Angeles's identity as a city of immigrants. The vibrant event, though potentially smaller than previous years, radiated collective joy and a clear message of resistance against fear and intimidation.</p>

          <p>Scholar Zheng Yongnian advocates for China to develop its own indigenous knowledge system for artificial intelligence, warning against "intellectual colonialism" inherent in relying solely on Western frameworks. He asserts that Western social science theories, derived from Western practices, are insufficient to adequately explain non-Western civilizations like Confucianism, which are vital for understanding society and technology. Zheng emphasizes that China must fully embrace its secular civilization to define its own meaning of technology and society. This strategic shift, he believes, will enable China to carve out a distinct and influential role in the international order and foster a uniquely Chinese approach to AI development.</p>

          <p>Chloé Zhao's film "Hamnet," which delves into William Shakespeare's family life and the profound influence of his son's death on the play "Hamlet," has clinched the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival People’s Choice Award. This accolade is frequently regarded as a significant indicator of future Oscar success, particularly for Best Picture. The film, based on Maggie O’Farrell’s novel and co-written by O'Farrell and Zhao, places Shakespeare's wife, Agnes, at the narrative's core. Other notable festival honorees included Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Rian Johnson’s “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” as runners-up, alongside various winners in documentary, international, and Canadian film categories.</p>
