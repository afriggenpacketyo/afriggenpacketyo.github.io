          <h2>Trump Administration Shifts Priorities for Federal Grants to Local Police Departments</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is altering the focus of a grant program that provides millions of dollars to local police departments, eliminating language that previously encouraged funding for initiatives supporting underserved populations and community violence intervention. The new priorities emphasize immigration and border security, violent crime prevention, and improving the image of law enforcement. A former Justice Department attorney notes that while combating violent crime and opioid abuse are important, encouraging police to apply for funds to "uplift the image of law enforcement" is concerning, as the focus should be on building trust and cooperation within communities. Congressional Democrats have criticized the shift, emphasizing the importance of community policing efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor National Park in Devon, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that permission was needed for camping. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to access commons for open-air recreation, including camping. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the decision, emphasizing the importance of responsible access and respect for landowners and farmers. Campaigners are advocating for the extension of wild camping rights to other parts of England and Wales.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to raise taxes by ¬£3bn to ¬£4bn annually before this year's Spring Statement. While Chancellor Reeves did not implement these measures, the memo highlights ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions. Some Labour MPs have expressed concerns about welfare cuts and are advocating for alternative funding methods like a wealth tax. The Environment Secretary Steve Reed maintains that the cabinet is united behind the government's plan for change, emphasizing increased taxes on the wealthy through changes to the non-dom tax status.</p>

          <p>Indian activist and writer Banu Mushtaq has won the International Booker Prize for her short-story collection, "Heart Lamp," becoming the first Kannada-language author to receive the award; the prize also recognizes the essential role of the translator, Deepa Bhasthi. The book, which explores themes of resilience and resistance through its female characters, draws from Mushtaq's own experiences of despair and her activism in Karnataka's social movements. Mushtaq's work has made her a target of hostility, including a fatwa for advocating Muslim women's rights. The Booker jury lauded Bhasthi's translation as "something genuinely new for English readers."</p>

          <p>The TV anime "Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX" features a surprising turn of events in its second episode, where Char Aznable captures the Federation's white mobile suit, the Gundam. This article explores five elements that contributed to this unexpected outcome, including Gene's actions and whether he had earned Denim's trust. The analysis speculates on how small changes can lead to vastly different outcomes, suggesting that "GQuuuuuuX" places significant importance on these "what if" scenarios. The theme song "Plazma" by Kenshi Yonezu also touches on the concept of "what if," further emphasizing the series' focus on exploring alternative possibilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unveiled plans for a futuristic "Golden Dome" missile defense system, aiming to counter next-generation aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles. The system, partly inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, would consist of next-generation technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. The program would require an initial investment of $25 billion, with a total cost of $175 billion over time. Experts warn that the system is unrealistic to complete during Trump's term, and the huge cost would consume a large chunk of the US defense budget.</p>

          <p>Fragments of West Nile virus have been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

West Nile virus is a vector-borne disease usually found in birds, transmitted through bird-biting mosquitoes, and can rarely be transmitted to humans. The UKHSA spokesman said the risk to the general public is "very low" and advice to healthcare professionals will be issued.</p>

          <p>The charity Women in Sport is urging sports leaders to increase support for young black girls, who face greater barriers to accessing sports and often lose interest during their teens. A new report indicates that twice as many black girls as white girls aspire to become elite athletes, yet black girls are the least likely to participate in sports. Racism, misogyny, and inflexible sporting structures contribute to 48% of black girls falling out of love with sports. The charity advocates for urgent action, including better representation of black women and enforcing anti-racism policies.</p>

          <p>NHS England will launch the world's first gonorrhoea vaccination program in August, targeting primarily gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners or an STI. The vaccine, originally designed for meningitis B, is 30-40% effective and aims to reverse soaring infection rates. While not a perfect solution, the NHS hopes this program will prevent 100,000 cases and save nearly ¬£8 million over the next decade. This initiative comes as gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance.</p>
