          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index for September revealed an annual inflation rate of 3%, slightly below economists' expectations of 3.1%. This data, released during a government shutdown specifically for Social Security adjustments, suggests that the inflationary impact of the Trump administration's tariffs has been somewhat muted. The report complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, as rising inflation conflicts with a slowing job market, though markets still anticipate a rate cut. The data provides a rare glimpse into the economy amid the suspension of most other federal data releases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United forward Anthony Gordon has been a standout performer in the Champions League, recently scoring in his third consecutive game in the competition. However, the 24-year-old has struggled to replicate this form in the Premier League, where he has yet to score or register an assist this season. Manager Eddie Howe and Gordon himself acknowledge the challenge of translating his big-game performances against top European clubs to consistent domestic success. As Newcastle prepares to face Fulham, the focus is on Gordon delivering his high-intensity play week in and week out.</p>

          <p>New research based on fossils from New Mexico suggests that dinosaur populations were diverse and thriving in North America right up until the asteroid strike 66 million years ago. By accurately dating the rock formations, scientists determined the fossils are from just 400,000 years before the mass extinction event. The findings, which include the colossal plant-eater Alamosaurus, challenge the long-held theory that dinosaurs were already in decline. However, some experts caution that this is evidence from a single location and may not represent the global state of dinosaur populations at the time.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed plans to send over 100 federal agents to the San Francisco Bay Area for a large-scale immigration enforcement operation. The decision followed widespread condemnation from California leaders and a conversation with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who reportedly asked for a chance to address the issues locally. The planned deployment to the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda had already sparked protests. This development is part of a broader roundup of news that also touches on escalating trade tensions with Canada and Russia's reaction to new U.S. sanctions.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming segments. Despite the positive results, the company noted that overall sales volume was flat, indicating that inflation-weary consumers are stretching their budgets and reducing purchases in some categories like home and health care. P&G's CFO observed a slowdown in its largest market, the U.S., reflecting a bifurcated economy where shoppers are behaving differently based on income levels. The company maintained its full-year forecast, though it lowered its expected costs from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The portrayal of aliens in popular culture has historically mirrored societal fears and preoccupations, evolving from Cold War-era communist infiltrators to modern anxieties about technology. This analysis traces the trope from the menacing creatures of "Alien," reflecting corporate greed, to the introspective themes of "Arrival." The term "alien" itself, meaning foreign or other, connects these fictional narratives to real-world debates on migration and exclusion. Now, the rise of artificial intelligence is introducing a new kind of non-human, "alien" intelligence, prompting fresh considerations about what it means to be other.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay for the L.A. Affairs column, a writer recounts her journey of trying to arrange a three-way experience with a man she was dating. Using the dating app Hinge, she began connecting with other women with the explicit goal of finding a third partner for a sexual encounter. Instead of the intended outcome, her quest unexpectedly led her to form deep, meaningful friendships with three different women she met through the app. The author reflects that the genuine love and support she found with these new friends was ultimately what she had been searching for all along.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has dismissed concerns about Mohamed Salah's recent dip in goal-scoring form, stating it is the "last thing" he worries about. Salah, who was the team's top scorer last season, has only scored three league goals this term amid the team's struggles. Slot attributes the slow start to the team adjusting to new summer signings and the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold, emphasizing that Salah has a lifelong history of scoring goals. The manager remains confident that the Egyptian winger will soon return to his prolific ways.</p>

          <p>The total assets managed by the global hedge fund industry have reached an all-time high of nearly $5 trillion. This historic growth was driven by the largest quarterly net inflow of new capital in 18 years, with investors allocating $33.7 billion in the third quarter. Strong investment returns, particularly from bets on technology, artificial intelligence, and rising M&A activity, also contributed significantly to the asset swell. Industry experts anticipate that institutional investors will continue to increase allocations to hedge funds to navigate geopolitical risks and policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With persistent inflation, savers are turning to certificates of deposit (CDs) to protect and grow their money, as top accounts offer rates that outpace inflation. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 1.97%, competitive online banks are offering rates well over 4% for terms ranging from six months to five years. Due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs currently provide some of the highest returns. To secure the best rates, savers should compare offers from online banks, which typically have lower overhead costs and can provide more competitive yields than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) offer an affordable borrowing option compared to high-rate personal loans or credit cards. As of late October, the average interest rate for a 10-year home equity loan is 8.28%, while the average HELOC rate is 7.85%. These financial products allow homeowners to borrow against their property's value, often with the benefit of tax-deductible interest for eligible home improvements. However, since the home serves as collateral, it is crucial for borrowers to carefully consider their budget and shop for the best terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a challenging housing market with high rates, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance can still find viable options. As of late October, the national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.34%, while a 15-year fixed mortgage averages 5.71%. To secure the best possible rate, experts advise strengthening one's credit profile, aiming for a score in the mid-to-high 700s, and shopping around with multiple lenders. Locking in a rate is also a critical step to protect against potential increases before closing on the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

This column argues that his history-making achievements should be celebrated as a push against the boundaries of what is considered possible in modern sports. Rather than questioning the viability of being both an elite pitcher and hitter, the focus should be on appreciating the unique spectacle he provides. The author suggests Ohtani's defiance of conventional wisdom is precisely what makes his success so compelling.</p>
