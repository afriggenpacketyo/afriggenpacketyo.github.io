          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting India to deepen the strategic partnership between the two nations, focusing on trade, defense, and technology. Bilateral trade reached a record $33 billion in 2024, yet it remains significantly smaller than Germany's trade with China. The visit aims to explore greater cooperation and encourage the finalization of an EU-India free trade agreement, although challenges such as bureaucratic hurdles in India and disagreements over market access persist. Both countries are also expanding engagement in defense and climate cooperation, navigating global tensions and the influence of US trade policies.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has agreed to a deal with Crystal Palace to sign England international center-back Marc Guehi. The 25-year-old is scheduled to undergo a medical and finalize the terms of a long-term contract in London. The transfer fee was settled after Liverpool's initial offer of £35 million plus a sell-on clause was negotiated. Guehi played his final game for Crystal Palace in a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa, where he served as captain and scored a goal, concluding his tenure of 162 appearances for the club before his move to the Premier League champions.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has adopted a development strategy extending to 2035, aimed at fostering a multipolar global order. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced the plan following a summit, highlighting it as a key outcome that sets a clear direction for the regional bloc over the next decade. The summit also issued a unified message against unilateral actions, implicitly criticizing U.S. trade policies and sanctions under President Trump. The declaration emphasized support for the WTO-centered multilateral trading system and voiced opposition to what it termed as international "bullying."</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. A committee aide stated that the decision was made after learning of health issues that prevent Mueller from being able to provide testimony. Mueller, who is 81, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2021, according to his family. The subpoena was part of a broader investigation into the Epstein case, and Mueller was summoned due to his tenure as FBI Director from 2001 to 2013, a period during which Epstein was under investigation.</p>

          <p>A coronal mass ejection from the sun over the weekend is expected to create a geomagnetic storm, potentially making the aurora borealis visible across parts of Canada and 18 U.S. states on Monday night. According to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the celestial light show could be seen in northern states such as Alaska, Montana, Minnesota, and Maine, and as far south as Nebraska and Illinois. While not anticipated to be as intense as the major storm in spring 2024, it presents a significant opportunity for skygazers to witness the phenomenon. The peak viewing time is forecasted for early Tuesday morning.</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, the CEO of a Polish paving company, has issued a public apology after a video of him taking a hat intended for a young boy at the US Open went viral. The incident occurred after tennis player Kamil Majchrzak won his match and threw his cap towards the child in the stands. Szczerek stated he made a "huge mistake," believing the player was passing the hat to him, and expressed remorse for hurting the boy and disappointing fans. He has since returned the hat, and Majchrzak later met with the young fan to give him a new cap and other merchandise.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the national rail operator of Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares on its trains, making weekday travel significantly cheaper for commuters. This move, aimed at encouraging more people to switch from cars to trains, follows a pilot scheme that ended in 2024. Under the new structure, a peak journey from Edinburgh to Glasgow will be nearly 50% cheaper. First Minister John Swinney stated the policy is a financially sustainable investment that will provide massive savings for people struggling with living costs, with the annual cost of £40-£45 million to be met from the ScotRail budget.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers a potential rate cut, financial experts suggest that short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) currently offer the most attractive returns. Six-month CDs are identified as a "sweet spot," providing savers with competitive interest rates without locking up funds for an extended period. While longer-term CDs historically yielded more, the current inverted yield curve means shorter terms are more lucrative. For those with a longer time horizon, experts recommend a CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading investments across various terms to balance high yields with regular access to funds.

Her new approach involves intentionally scheduling cycles of intense work followed by periods of proactive rest, rather than working until exhaustion forces a break. Goetz emphasizes that it's about creating a rhythm that allows for professional achievement without sacrificing personal well-being, acknowledging that one can have it all, just not all at once.</p>

This stance comes as President Trump has reportedly canceled a planned visit to India due to its refusal to stop purchasing discounted Russian oil.

This positive news offers a boost to the Danish pharmaceutical giant, which has faced challenges in the U.S. market due to tariff uncertainty and competition.

According to the CICC analysis, exporters in China absorb only about 9% of the tariff burden, indicating significant bargaining power. The study found that U.S. importers are unable to fully pass the increased costs to consumers or shift them back to exporters, forcing them to compress their own profit margins. This dynamic suggests that Chinese goods maintain a strong competitive edge in the U.S. market despite the trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>
