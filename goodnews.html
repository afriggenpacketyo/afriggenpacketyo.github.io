          <p>German soccer icon Thomas Müller is set to join the Vancouver Whitecaps, a surprising move to Major League Soccer that has energized the club's fanbase. The 36-year-old World Cup and Champions League winner brings a wealth of experience and a reputation as a cerebral player, known for his on-field intelligence and leadership. While some express concern over his age and the mixed success of other European stars in the MLS, many pundits believe his down-to-earth personality and winning mentality will be a perfect fit for the Canadian team. The signing is seen as a major coup for the Whitecaps, potentially elevating them to championship contenders.</p>

          <p>Scientists in South Korea have developed a discreet temporary tattoo that can detect the presence of the common drink-spiking drug GHB in just one second. The sticker, which functions as a chemical sensor, changes color from yellow to red upon contact with a beverage containing the substance. This innovation offers a fast and subtle way for individuals in social settings to check their drinks for tampering. According to the article, the sensor is highly sensitive, works on various beverages, and the color-changing result remains visible for up to 30 days, potentially serving as evidence if needed.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Natalie Babcock and Samuel Gibson, a couple who transformed their two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles's Beachwood Canyon into a colorful and personalized home. After finding the 1928 Spanish-style unit, they used bold paint choices, thrifted Midcentury furniture, and an extensive art collection to create a unique living space. The couple also made practical, landlord-friendly updates, such as installing peel-and-stick floor tiles in the kitchen. Beyond the decor, they emphasize the strong sense of community they've found in their neighborhood, which has become as important to them as the apartment's desirable amenities like in-unit laundry and a garage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alternative rock band Rainbow Kitten Surprise has announced their new album, "Bones," will be released on September 26. The 10-track collection is described as a raw, "spill-your-guts-out record" that was written quickly, in contrast to their more intricately produced previous work. Frontwoman Ela Melo reveals that the album features more direct lyrics, many of which were ad-libbed in the studio and touch on relationships affected by substance use. Melo, who has been sober for ten months, also discusses how sobriety has influenced her creative process, allowing for a more regulated and truthful form of communication in her music.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock price soared by 20% after the e-commerce company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company also provided a strong forecast for the third quarter, projecting revenue growth in the "mid-to-high twenties percentage rate," signaling confidence despite broader economic uncertainties. CFO Jeff Hoffmeister noted that a potential negative impact from U.S. tariffs, which the company had factored into its guidance, ultimately did not materialize. The robust performance and outlook suggest that Shopify and its merchants are successfully navigating the current trade landscape and maintaining strong consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In their opening match of The Hundred cricket tournament, the Southern Brave secured a decisive six-wicket victory over the Manchester Originals. England bowler Lauren Bell was instrumental in the win, taking three wickets for 28 runs and dismantling the Originals' top order. The Originals struggled to a total of just 95-8, with Seren Smale's unbeaten 40 being the only significant contribution. In response, Southern Brave's chase was anchored by South African captain Laura Wolvaardt, who scored an unbeaten 42 against her former team, guiding her new side to victory with 11 balls remaining.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities as tools for retirement planning, noting that the best choice depends on individual financial goals. CDs are highlighted for their simplicity, safety with FDIC insurance, and suitability for short-term goals, but their returns often fail to outpace inflation. Annuities, conversely, are designed specifically to provide a guaranteed lifetime income stream, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings, a primary concern for many retirees. While annuities offer protection against longevity risk, they are more complex, less liquid, and can come with higher fees and potential inflation risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, Apple has pledged to invest an additional $100 billion in the United States, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion over four years. The announcement, made at the White House with CEO Tim Cook, is intended to encourage more of the company's component manufacturing to be based in the U.S. This move comes as Apple navigates a complex trade environment, having paid over $800 million in new border taxes last quarter due to President Trump's global tariffs. While analysts note that shifting the entire supply chain is a long-term challenge, the investment may help Apple secure more favorable treatment from Washington.</p>

Experts note that women naturally have lower creatine stores than men, making supplementation particularly effective for improving strength, exercise performance, and recovery. The article highlights that creatine can be especially beneficial during certain life stages, such as perimenopause and menopause, by helping to counteract age-related muscle loss and supporting cognitive function. It also discusses how creatine may help manage symptoms like fatigue that are linked to hormonal fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle, offering a range of health advantages.</p>

By sampling the DNA of 150 trees, researchers estimated that an average tree contains approximately one trillion microbial cells, including a vast array of fungi, bacteria, and viruses. The research found that these microbial communities are highly specialized, with different microbes inhabiting distinct parts of the wood, such as the inner heartwood and outer sapwood. This discovery opens a new frontier in forest science, suggesting these microbiomes play a vital role in tree health and resilience.</p>
