          <p>If President Trump were to cancel contracts with Elon Musk's SpaceX, the federal government would face significant challenges in achieving its goals in orbit and beyond. SpaceX has become an integral partner for both NASA and the Defense Department, providing crucial services for space missions and national security initiatives. This dependency highlights the growing importance of private spaceflight companies in supporting governmental objectives. Cancelling these contracts would severely impact the government's ability to execute space-related projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend of offering food products with fewer ingredients is emerging, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). Consumers and retailers are showing increased interest in simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists. However, some nutritionists argue that this focus on fewer ingredients can lead to the exclusion of fortified nutrients, which are essential for public health. The debate highlights the complex relationship between food processing, nutrition, and consumer perceptions of health.</p>

          <p>China has conducted tests to assess the durability of quantum-based network components during space travel, signaling efforts to establish a secure space-ground communication system. A laser module and phase encoding device were launched on a rocket to evaluate their resistance to environmental stresses like vibration and radiation. This test is a crucial step toward building an integrated quantum secure direct communication network, which aims to provide ultra-secure communications without encryption keys. The technology is considered a complement to quantum key distribution, offering potentially more efficient and secure message transmission.</p>

          <p>The government is mandating that most new build homes in England must be fitted with solar panels under changes to be published this year. The regulations, included in the Future Homes Standard, aim to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Developers will be required to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against burdensome paperwork, while the government says the move is just common sense, saving households money on energy bills.</p>
