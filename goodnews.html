          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a straight woman in a job discrimination suit, rejecting a heightened standard for majority groups in employment discrimination cases. The justices overturned an appeals court's requirement that members of majority groups meet a higher threshold to win such cases. This decision clarifies the standard for employment discrimination claims, ensuring that all individuals are subject to the same legal protections regardless of their group affiliation. The ruling promotes consistency and fairness in employment law, and provides a stable legal precedent.</p>
