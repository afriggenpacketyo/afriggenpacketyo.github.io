          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," a violent clash between police and striking miners in 1984. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the inquiry will investigate the events and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners amid allegations of falsified police evidence. The decision fulfills a Labour manifesto promise and has been cautiously welcomed by campaigners who have sought justice for decades. The inquiry aims to address unanswered questions from one of British industrial history's most contentious episodes.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Investors Flock to Bond ETFs, Pushing Assets Above $50 Billion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 02:23:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to deflationary pressures and an uncertain economic outlook, Chinese investors are increasingly turning to bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Assets under management in these funds have surged from $10 billion at the start of last year to over $50 billion by June 2025. Investors are attracted to the lower costs, liquidity, and diversified exposure offered by ETFs, particularly those tracking corporate notes. This trend reflects a broader shift towards low-risk, fixed-income assets as China's central bank maintains loose monetary policy while warning against excessive bond rallies.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from approximately 30 major companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage new domestic investment. The "Made for Germany" initiative aims to restore confidence in the nation's economy, which has faced two years of recession. While the government has approved billions in tax relief and a large infrastructure fund, it emphasizes that private sector participation is essential for revival. This push comes as Germany, once Europe's economic engine, grapples with inflation, high energy costs, and global competition.</p>

          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, following the completion of critical railway and port infrastructure by Chinese firms. For years, logistical challenges prevented the export of resources from significant deposits like Guinea's Simandou mine and Algeria's Gara Djebilet mine. The new railway lines will connect these remote inland mines to coastal ports, unlocking their vast potential. According to mining giant Rio Tinto, a partner in the Simandou project, the first shipments are expected to commence in November.</p>

Huawei's Ascend AI processors and its "CloudMatrix" system are gaining traction as alternatives to U.S. technology, particularly within China. This pivot was largely driven by U.S. sanctions, which inadvertently turned the company into a national champion with significant state backing for its AI ambitions.</p>

The positive outlook is based on the company's progress in robotaxi technology, particularly its seventh-generation model which has entered mass production with significantly reduced costs. The company aims to expand its robotaxi fleet to 1,000 vehicles by the end of 2025 and is developing robotrucks for freight delivery. The analyst noted that Pony AI's proprietary "Virtual Driver" technology provides a key competitive advantage. (not investment advice)</p>
