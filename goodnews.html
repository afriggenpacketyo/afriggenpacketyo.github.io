          <p>At the United Nations General Assembly, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva delivered a speech criticizing Washington for its trade tariffs and military actions while advocating for stronger ties with China. Despite the sharp rebuke, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an unexpected invitation for a meeting, citing "excellent chemistry" during a brief encounter. This development occurred amid heightened tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Brazilian imports. Trump's proposal for a meeting next week suggests a potential diplomatic opening between the two leaders despite their public disagreements.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Nontraditional Factors in Heart Attacks Are Often Missed, Especially in Women</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Mayo Clinic indicates that over half of heart attacks in women under 65 are caused by nontraditional factors that are frequently overlooked or misdiagnosed. While clogged arteries are the most common cause in men, conditions like spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and embolisms are more prevalent in women's cardiac events. Researchers found that SCAD is nearly six times more common in women and is often misdiagnosed, potentially leading to inappropriate treatments. The findings underscore the need for clinicians to consider a broader range of causes for heart attacks, particularly in younger female patients.</p>

          <p>A tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl will celebrate the legacy of singer Minnie Riperton, 50 years after her iconic song "Lovin' You" reached number one. The event will feature performances by Stevie Wonder, who co-produced her seminal album "Perfect Angel," and other artists influenced by her unique five-octave vocal range. Riperton, who passed away from breast cancer at age 31, remains a significant but sometimes underappreciated figure whose work has been sampled by numerous artists and continues to inspire a new generation. Her music is remembered for its blend of sweetness, earthiness, and technical mastery.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker, serving as a judge for this year's prestigious Booker Prize for fiction, described the process of selecting the six-book shortlist as "real agony." The final list includes past winner Kiran Desai, previous nominees Andrew Miller and David Szalay, and a trio of American authors: Susan Choi, Katie Kitamura, and Ben Markovits. Parker, part of a five-judge panel, explained the difficulty of eliminating books from the 13-novel longlist but called the experience of reading and discussing the works a privilege. The winner of the literary award will be announced in November.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after falling into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on a forested property in Pembroke, Maine. The landowner discovered the animal with only its antlers visible and alerted the state's wildlife department. Rescuers sedated the moose, secured it with straps, and used an excavator to carefully lift it to safety in an operation that took five hours. After the sedation wore off, the moose was able to run off, seemingly unharmed. The family, who was unaware of the well's existence, has since capped it to prevent future accidents.</p>

          <p>Health officials worldwide, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, are refuting President Trump's recent assertions that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is linked to autism when taken during pregnancy. Regulators reiterated that available evidence shows no such link and that the medication remains an important and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. Officials also pushed back against Trump's additional claims about vaccines, emphasizing that vaccines are proven to save lives and do not cause autism. They urged the public to rely on scientific evidence rather than political statements.</p>

          <p>England has named its squad for the upcoming Ashes tour in Australia, featuring what is being described as its most hostile group of fast bowlers in decades. The attack, including Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Josh Tongue, is designed to counter Australia's pace on their home pitches, a strategy England has often lacked in past tours. Key concerns remain over the fitness of captain Ben Stokes and the durability of several key bowlers who have recent injury histories. The team's success will likely depend on starting the series strong and the performance of veteran batsman Joe Root, who is seeking his first Test century in Australia.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball's competition committee has officially approved the use of an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) System, set to be implemented in the 2026 season. Under the new rules, human umpires will continue to call balls and strikes, but teams will be allowed two challenges per game, which will be reviewed by the ABS technology. This hybrid 'challenge system' has been tested extensively in the minor leagues and is expected to increase accuracy and reduce on-field arguments over calls. Teams will retain their challenge if an appeal is successful and will receive additional challenges in extra innings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An often-overlooked provision known as the Medigap "birthday rule" offers seniors in approximately 18 states an annual opportunity to switch their Medicare supplemental insurance plans without medical underwriting. This rule allows beneficiaries to change to a plan with equal or lesser benefits during a specific window around their birthday, regardless of pre-existing health conditions. This can lead to significant savings, as seniors are not locked into potentially overpriced plans they chose when first eligible at age 65. The specifics of the rule, including the length of the enrollment window, vary by state, making it crucial for seniors to understand their local regulations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more attractive borrowing option for homeowners. For a $60,000 HELOC at the current average rate of 8.05%, monthly payments would be approximately $730 for a 10-year repayment period or $575 for a 15-year period. A key advantage of a HELOC is its variable rate, which could lead to lower payments if the Fed enacts further cuts as anticipated. Additionally, borrowers only pay interest on the amount they use, providing flexibility in an uncertain economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

The comments come amid an ongoing campaign by the Trump administration to exert more control over the Fed's board. Powell also reiterated that the recent interest rate cut was a response to a challenging economic situation with rising inflation risks and a weakening labor market.</p>
