        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has concluded its investigation into Sentebale, a charity co-founded by Prince Harry, finding no evidence of systemic bullying or misogyny as alleged. However, the regulator criticized all parties involved for allowing a damaging internal dispute to become public, which harmed the charity's reputation. While no sanctions were imposed and the current leadership will remain, the commission issued a regulatory action plan to address governance weaknesses. A spokesman for Prince Harry expressed disappointment that the report did not hold the current chair accountable for her actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal appeals court ruling, U.S. border agents have been instructed to stop deporting migrants under a Trump administration asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to those crossing the border illegally, but the court found it could not completely override laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face torture or persecution. This change reopens access to humanitarian protections, though migrants will likely remain detained during processing. The administration may still appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, seeking to reinstate the controversial ban.</p>

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are turning to AI-powered chatbots for companionship to combat social isolation. For retirees like 75-year-old Jill Smola, who lives alone and has limited mobility, a chatbot named ElliQ provides hours of daily interaction, from playing games to "visiting" new places. While some ethicists express concern that reliance on AI could potentially deepen isolation, users report that the technology provides a meaningful connection. The trend highlights a technological approach to addressing the widespread issue of loneliness among the elderly population.</p>

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is returning to the Los Angeles Chargers after agreeing to a one-year, $8.52 million contract. Allen, who is second in the franchise's all-time receiving yards, was traded to the Chicago Bears last year in a salary-cap move. His return addresses a need for the Chargers, especially after the recent retirement of fellow receiver Mike Williams. The six-time Pro Bowl selection will rejoin quarterback Justin Herbert and is expected to provide experience to a receiving corps that includes younger players.</p>

          <p>Rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is set to start for the Cleveland Browns in their first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. The decision comes as a surprise, as Sanders was listed fourth on the team's depth chart just a day earlier. However, injuries to fellow quarterbacks Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel have created an opportunity for the fifth-round draft pick. Sanders, who had a prolific college career under his father, Deion Sanders, will likely share playing time with newly signed free agent Tyler Huntley as he competes for a roster spot.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime, including a significant 14.9% decrease in murders. Property crimes also fell by 8.1%, with motor vehicle thefts experiencing a record 18.6% one-year decline. While experts note this reflects a continuing downward trend from a post-pandemic spike, they also point out that rates for some crimes, like aggravated assault, remain higher than pre-COVID levels.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is rolling out new family-friendly security lanes at several U.S. airports, including John Wayne Airport in Orange County, to ease the stress of air travel for parents. The "Families on the Fly" program provides a dedicated checkpoint lane for travelers with children, allowing them to proceed through security without needing TSA PreCheck. Officials hope the initiative will expedite screening and improve the overall airport experience for families, particularly at popular tourist destinations. The program also includes a discount on TSA PreCheck enrollment for families.</p>

The initiative comes as the district seeks to reassure families that schools are safe zones amid heightened anxiety in the community. The district estimates it has hundreds of employees whose legal work status is also at risk.</p>

          <p>Michigan's Democratic Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, met with President Trump to discuss key issues affecting her state, including the negative impact of tariffs on the auto industry. During their third meeting, Whitmer also pressed for a three-year delay in proposed changes to the Medicaid program to avoid disrupting care for vulnerable residents. Whitmer has defended her bipartisan approach, arguing that her cordial relationship with the White House has helped secure federal investments for Michigan. The meeting highlights a notable contrast with other Democratic governors who are currently in a standoff with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, OpenAI has released two open-weight language models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, designed as lower-cost alternatives for developers and researchers. Unlike fully open-source models, open-weight models make their parameters publicly available, allowing for greater transparency and customization. The move positions OpenAI to compete with other companies like Meta and Mistral AI that have already released similar models. OpenAI stated it conducted extensive safety testing to prevent malicious use and collaborated with chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD to ensure broad hardware compatibility.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advancements, public perception of weather forecasting accuracy remains mixed, and this article explores why. Meteorologists face inherent challenges due to the "chaotic system" of the atmosphere, where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. Communicating complex data and uncertainty to the public in a concise format also contributes to perceived mistakes. The article discusses how forecasters are improving communication and how new AI-driven models could revolutionize the field by providing more detailed, long-range predictions, though they also present new challenges for communicating uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from fashion retailer Zara, ruling they were "irresponsible" for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog cited the use of shadows, posing, and clothing styles that made the models appear "gaunt" with "protruding" collarbones. Zara, which has since removed the ads, stated the models had medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major UK retailers, highlighting a growing regulatory focus on body image in advertising.</p>

He contended that many companies are successfully managing the impact of tariffs and that corporate profits remain strong. Cramer pointed to the strong quarterly reports from giants like Apple and Amazon, arguing their main challenges are solvable "money issues." He believes the market is resilient and that investors should focus on the strong performance of individual companies rather than a negative overarching narrative. (not investment advice)</p>
