          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House, marking their first face-to-face meeting since February 2024. The 55-minute conversation is being viewed as a potential step toward reconciliation amid a strained family relationship. The last meeting between the two occurred shortly after the King's cancer diagnosis last year. While Prince Harry has been in the UK for charity events, there has been no indication of a meeting with his brother, Prince William, suggesting the wider family rift remains.</p>

          <p>Following a decisive 5-0 victory against Serbia, this article examines the tactical principles manager Thomas Tuchel has implemented for the England national football team ahead of the World Cup. It highlights a shift towards a more aggressive, risk-taking attacking style, utilizing players in roles that suit their club-level strengths and chemistries. The analysis notes Tuchel's emphasis on off-the-ball runs and giving wingers creative freedom in one-on-one situations. While the team's defense against sustained pressure from top-tier opponents remains a question, the overall foundation appears strong and promising.</p>

During a visit to the port of Antwerp with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, De Wever highlighted the port's role as a major European hub for drug trafficking, particularly cocaine. He praised the Trump administration's efforts against cartels and urged for enhanced information-sharing, stating that "drug criminals know no borders." Antwerp has seen record cocaine seizures in recent years, making international cooperation a critical priority for Belgian authorities.</p>

Zoox offers a unique, purpose-built vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals, designed for up to four passengers with face-to-face seating. The company is initially offering free rides from select locations, competing with established players like Alphabet's Waymo.

          <p>A South Korean court has acquitted Choi Mal-ja, now 79, sixty years after she was convicted of grievous bodily harm for biting off part of her attacker's tongue during a sexual assault in 1964. At the time, she was given a suspended prison sentence while her attacker received a lighter one. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi sought a retrial, and the Busan District Court has now ruled her actions constituted "justifiable self-defense." The landmark decision is being celebrated by women's rights activists as a long-overdue victory for a victim who was wrongly criminalized.</p>

          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, contrary to economists' predictions of an increase. This marks the third time this year the gauge has shown deflation, indicating easing price pressures in the production pipeline. The tame inflation reading has intensified market expectations that the Federal Reserve will implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. The report is a key data point ahead of the more closely watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have reported that NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered rocks in a former river channel on Mars that contain the strongest hints yet of potential ancient microbial life. The rock samples, collected from the "Bright Angel" formation, show evidence of organic carbon alongside iron compounds that, on Earth, are byproducts of microorganisms. Researchers emphasize that while non-biological processes could also be responsible, these findings are a compelling candidate for signs of past life. A definitive conclusion requires returning the samples to Earth for in-depth analysis, a mission that is currently being re-evaluated by NASA.</p>

The move is seen as a way to create a more resilient and financially viable model amid economic challenges facing the higher education sector.
