          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a rally after President Trump signed executive orders aimed at overhauling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and accelerating the deployment of new reactors in the U.S. The orders focus on small advanced reactors while also supporting larger plants, forcing the NRC to make licensing decisions within 18 months. These actions also intend to facilitate uranium mining in the U.S. and expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity. The move is seen as a boost for energy independence and national security.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer suggests that President Trump's threat of higher tariffs on Apple could benefit Samsung. If Apple is subjected to higher tariffs, it may need to increase iPhone prices to maintain profits, which would give Samsung a competitive edge. Trump has been pressuring Apple to manufacture iPhones in the U.S., and Cramer believes that a tariff on Apple would act as a subsidy for Samsung. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett argues that it is nearly impossible for Apple to relocate iPhone production to the U.S. in the near term.</p>

          <p>An expert predicts a significant increase in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due to a change from the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows mutual fund managers to offer ETF share classes of existing funds. The number of ETFs is expected to rise from around 4,000 to over 7,000 within a month, requiring investors to conduct thorough research. While the new ETF share class should offer strategies at lower institutional fees, investors should remain cautious about new and complex strategies. The history of active management suggests the returns may not be worth the price. (not investment advice)</p>

Connolly, who oversaw Disney‚Äôs distribution strategy for streaming services and television networks, recently joined YouTube as head of media and sports.

          <p>The Guardian analyzes President Trump's recent tariff threats against the EU and Apple, noting a recurring pattern in his trade strategy. This pattern includes an initial threat, followed by the imposition of tariffs, resulting in market panic, and ultimately leading to a backtrack. Despite the uncertainty created by these actions, investors appear to be taking Trump's tariff threats with a grain of salt. The article suggests that this cycle of threats and reversals has become a familiar routine in global economics.</p>
