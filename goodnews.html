          <p>U.S. drug overdose deaths experienced a significant drop in 2024, with 30,000 fewer fatalities compared to the previous year, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded, according to the CDC. While this decrease is a positive development, overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, particularly among individuals aged 18-44. Experts attribute the decline to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in drug use patterns, and the impact of opioid lawsuit settlement money. Despite these gains, concerns persist that potential reductions in federal funding and public health workforce could impede further progress in combating the overdose crisis.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform HBO Max, reversing a decision made just two years prior when it was changed to Max. The company cites a focus on quality programming and storytelling as the reason for reverting to the original name, aiming to emphasize high-quality content over a vast quantity. This shift comes as Warner Bros. Discovery seeks to improve profitability in its streaming business, which has seen significant growth in subscribers. The move mirrors a similar strategy by Disney, which is also prioritizing quality content in the streaming market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to revise drinking water limits on certain PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," while upholding standards for PFOA and PFOS. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be reconsidered, along with a limit on a mixture of several PFAS types. The EPA will maintain the 4 parts per trillion standards for PFOA and PFOS but extend the compliance deadline for utilities to 2031. While health advocates criticize the move as illegal, water utilities support the decision, citing the high costs of treatment systems and arguing that the EPA lacked authority to regulate PFAS mixtures.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers face significant obstacles in pursuing groundbreaking ideas due to the academic system's emphasis on immediate results and competitive funding. Associate professors spend much of their time on duties other than research, such as supervising student projects. The pressure to secure tenure and funding through awards and reputation discourages researchers from investing in risky, long-term projects. This system, as described by a Chinese professor, favors connections and short-term productivity over original and innovative research endeavors.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold requires a strategic approach, especially in today's volatile economic climate, according to a CBS News article. Experts recommend considering gold's price in context, understanding different gold investment types, looking at liquidity, and being tax aware. Gold can provide portfolio diversification and stability, acting as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. However, investors should be mindful of the nuances of each gold type, such as physical gold bars, gold coins, and gold ETFs, and understand their associated risks and tax implications (not investment advice).</p>
