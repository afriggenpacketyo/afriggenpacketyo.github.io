          <p>Rental car company Hertz is launching a significantly upgraded e-commerce platform that will allow customers to complete nearly the entire car-buying process online, including financing and trade-ins. This strategic move is part of the company's broader turnaround plan, which aims to make retail its primary channel for selling its used fleet and maximize resale values. Previously, the website only listed vehicles, with the purchasing process handled at physical locations. The initiative, promoted by a new campaign with Tom Brady, is a key part of Hertz's "Back-to-Basics Roadmap" as it continues its recovery from its 2020 bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>The city of Berlin has announced plans to rename a central street, Hofjägerallee, after former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who passed away in 2017. Kohl is widely regarded as the principal architect of German reunification in 1990, a legacy for which he was granted honorary citizenship of Berlin. However, a public honor of this nature was delayed for years due to a major party donations scandal that tarnished the end of his political career in 1999. The chosen location is historically significant, situated near the Victory Column and Brandenburg Gate, symbols of German unity that reflect Kohl's historical contributions.</p>

          <p>A recent article advises email users against immediately deleting spam messages, suggesting it is more beneficial to report them first. By reporting junk mail, users provide valuable data to email providers like Gmail and Outlook, which helps them refine their spam-detection algorithms and improve filters for everyone. The article clarifies that clicking "unsubscribe" links in spam can be counterproductive, as it confirms an active email address to spammers and can even lead to malicious websites. Instead, using the "report spam" or "move to junk" function is the most effective way to combat unwanted and potentially dangerous emails.</p>

          <p>World number one Carlos Alcaraz won his eighth title of the season at the Japan Open, defeating Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 in the final. His victory was particularly notable as he had rolled his ankle early in the tournament and was uncertain if he could continue playing. Despite his ankle being heavily taped, Alcaraz demonstrated increasing freedom of movement throughout the week, ultimately triumphing over Fritz, who was himself hampered by a thigh injury during the final. This win continues a remarkable season for Alcaraz, who has now reached nine consecutive finals and solidified his position as the world's top player.</p>

          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly inclined to accept a new Gaza ceasefire plan proposed by the United States, with a formal response expected soon. The 20-point proposal, presented by President Trump, calls for a swift ceasefire, the release of all remaining hostages and numerous Palestinian prisoners, and the establishment of an interim technocratic administration in Gaza. The plan has received public support from the Palestinian Authority and a joint statement of encouragement from several key Muslim-majority nations, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Turkey. The development marks a potentially significant step toward ending the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <h2>Former Boxing Champion Amir Khan Launches Promotional Career with Event in Nigeria</h2>

          <p>Former unified world boxing champion Amir Khan has transitioned from fighting to promoting, with his company AK Promotions set to stage a major professional boxing event in Lagos, Nigeria. Khan sees Africa as an "untouched market" with significant potential for the sport's growth. The event, titled "Chaos in the Ring," follows his promotional debut in Ghana and is part of his strategy to build the sport in Africa and the Middle East before re-entering the UK market. A key theme of his promotion is to provide opportunities for fighters to compete in their ancestral homelands, something he wishes he could have done in Pakistan during his own career.</p>

          <p>Scorability, a sports technology platform aimed at transforming the college sports recruiting process, has raised $40 million in a new funding round. The investment, led by Bluestone Equity Partners, comes as the landscape of college athletics is being reshaped by new rules allowing student-athletes to be compensated for their name, image, and likeness (NIL). The platform acts as a centralized hub for coaches to access recruits' transcripts, stats, and highlights, streamlining a traditionally fragmented system. The company aims to simplify the complex and often challenging recruitment journey for high school athletes and their families.</p>

          <p>At the Lakers' media day, new additions Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart both expressed their enthusiasm for joining a championship-contending team and the opportunity to revitalize their careers. Ayton, a former number one pick whose career stalled in Portland, called the move the "biggest opportunity" of his career and is motivated by feeling disrespected. Smart, a former Defensive Player of the Year coming off injury-plagued seasons, is eager to re-establish his reputation as an elite defender. Both players are seen as key pieces to complement stars LeBron James and Luka Dončić in the team's quest for a title.</p>

          <h2>Essay: Reclaiming a Deeper Jewish Identity as a Defense Against Anti-Semitism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on their journey from identifying as a "cultural Jew" with little knowledge of the tradition to discovering its rich intellectual and spiritual depth. They argue that a superficial Jewish identity, often shaped by assimilation and the legacy of Christian anti-Judaism, leaves one ill-equipped to confront modern Jew hatred. By studying Jewish texts, law, and philosophy, the author found a tradition of debate and wisdom that was far more empowering than a simple ethnic identity. The essay suggests that building stronger, more knowledgeable Jewish communities is a crucial way to withstand and transcend anti-Semitism.</p>
