          <p>Stitch Fix, the online personal styling service, is showing early signs of a successful turnaround after a period of significant decline. Under CEO Matt Baer, the company reported its first revenue growth in three years, driven by increased average order values and better customer retention. The strategy has involved streamlining operations, revamping its private brand portfolio, and offering more flexible service options, including larger curated boxes and an on-demand shopping catalog. While the company's stock remains far below its pandemic-era peak, these positive indicators suggest its focus on core client needs and operational efficiency is beginning to yield results.

          <p>Dame Stephanie Shirley, a celebrated technology pioneer and philanthropist, has passed away at the age of 91. Arriving in Britain as a child refugee fleeing Nazi Germany, she later founded a software company in the 1960s that famously employed women working from home, a revolutionary practice for its time. Known for adopting the name "Steve" to navigate the male-dominated tech industry, she amassed a fortune and dedicated most of it to philanthropic causes, particularly supporting autism research and services. Her life is remembered as an inspirational story of overcoming adversity and challenging gender stereotypes.</p>

          <p>The recent agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of their China-derived revenue with the U.S. government is viewed as a net positive by investors, as it secures market access that was previously blocked. Analysts describe the deal as an "unusual" and transactional move characteristic of the Trump administration, effectively creating an "indirect tariff at source." While it provides short-term certainty for the chipmakers, concerns remain about potential future demands from the U.S. government. The arrangement is seen as specific to the strategic semiconductor sector and is unlikely to be replicated for other industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, located west of the Cabo Verde islands, according to the National Hurricane Center. With maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, forecasters predict it could strengthen into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season. Current projection models show the storm moving westward but indicate it does not pose an immediate threat to land or the United States. This development aligns with predictions for an above-normal hurricane season, which anticipates between 13 and 18 named storms.</p>

This initiative, part of Ford's "Universal EV Program," will begin with a midsize electric pickup truck slated for a 2027 launch with a target starting price of $30,000. CEO Jim Farley described the strategy as a "radical approach" to compete with new global competitors, particularly from China. The new EVs will use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries assembled in the U.S., underscoring a commitment to domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>In its first major move since merging with Skydance, Paramount has acquired the U.S. media rights for the UFC in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion, starting in 2026. The agreement will bring all UFC events, including marquee fights and "Fight Nights," to the Paramount+ streaming service, with some events simulcast on CBS. This deal marks a significant shift away from the pay-per-view model, as subscribers will not face additional fees for the events. TKO Group, UFC's parent company, and Paramount's new leadership see the move as a strategic way to drive subscriptions and secure a valuable, year-round sports asset.</p>

          <p>Despite not yet generating revenue, Amazon's Project Kuiper satellite internet initiative is seen as a promising long-term venture that could become a major growth driver for the company. Positioned to compete with SpaceX's Starlink, Kuiper aims to provide broadband to hundreds of millions of underserved households globally. The strategic advantage for Amazon lies in integrating new internet users into its Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystems. Although the project requires over $10 billion in upfront investment, CEO Andy Jassy has compared its financial potential to that of AWS, signaling strong internal confidence in its future profitability.

The events will focus on informing communities about the impact of current administration policies and building grassroots strategies for voter turnout. The campaign follows a 2024 election cycle where, despite strong support for Democrats, President Trump made gains among Black voters, particularly Black men.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding between a high-yield savings account (HYSA) and a certificate of deposit (CD), financial experts advise considering liquidity needs and interest rate trends. A HYSA is recommended for emergency funds or when easy access to cash is a priority, as it offers flexibility without penalties. Conversely, a CD is better for those who can lock away their money for a set term to guarantee a higher, fixed interest rate, which is advantageous in a falling-rate environment. For those seeking a balance, a strategy of splitting funds between both or using a CD ladder can provide both liquidity and optimized earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace in the Community Shield highlighted both the promise of their new offensive signings and potential weaknesses in their defense. Newcomers Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz showed encouraging signs, with Ekitiké scoring, but the team appeared defensively open, a recurring issue throughout their pre-season matches. The team is adapting to a new 4-2-3-1 formation, and the absence of key midfielders exacerbated issues with their aggressive man-to-man pressing system, leaving gaps in the back line. While the new attacking possibilities are exciting, the analysis suggests Liverpool may face some defensive challenges as they integrate new players and tactics.</p>

Keeping devices in common areas also helps children develop a healthier relationship with technology by fostering better decision-making and encouraging them to share their digital lives with family. Unlike complex restrictions or bans, this single rule is easier to enforce and can help "future-proof" kids by teaching them responsible tech habits.</p>
