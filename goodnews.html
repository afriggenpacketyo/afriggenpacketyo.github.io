        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a crucial phone call to discuss a potential deal to prevent a U.S. ban on the social media platform TikTok. The conversation follows an agreement on a deal "framework" earlier in the week, as confirmed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This high-level communication is seen as a vital step in stabilizing the tense relationship between the two economic superpowers. The call also helps pave the way for a potential in-person summit between the two leaders at the upcoming APEC conference, which would be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump returned to office.</p>

          <p>An opinion article challenges the prevailing narrative of a drastic decline in China's population, suggesting that such gloomy projections should be viewed with skepticism. The author points out the lack of clear justification for forecasts that show China's population plummeting while the U.S. population is expected to grow significantly. In contrast, the article highlights alternative data from Chinese researchers at Renmin and Peking Universities. Their moderate scenarios project China's population to be around 1.12 billion by the end of the century, a far less dramatic decrease than often reported in Western media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As companies like American Express and JPMorgan Chase increase the annual fees on their premium travel credit cards, consumers are prompted to re-evaluate their value. The cards now boast thousands of dollars in annual benefits, primarily through statement credits for specific vendors like Lululemon, Uber, and StubHub. Financial experts advise cardholders to conduct a personal analysis based on their travel patterns, shopping habits, and lifestyle to determine if the high fees are justified. Key considerations include the utility of airport lounge access and whether the available credits align with existing spending, as maximizing these perks requires active engagement from the user.</p>

After condemning the war in Ukraine, Savin fled Russia and re-established his club in Cyprus, investing his own money and securing sponsorships to build a competitive team. The club has become a unifying force for the Russian-speaking immigrant community in Cyprus, bringing together people from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Despite personal hardships, including being separated from his family in Russia, Savin remains focused on his ambitious goal of qualifying for European club competitions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a major crackdown on the U.S. organ procurement system, aiming to increase oversight, accountability, and patient safety. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated the action is meant to restore public trust after years of safety concerns. As a first step, the Department of Health and Human Services is moving to decertify the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency in Miami mid-cycle, citing a history of deficiencies linked to patient harm. Officials highlighted that 100,000 people are on organ waiting lists and that 28,000 donated organs are discarded annually, underscoring the urgent need for reform.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 lineup went on sale worldwide, drawing significant crowds in major cities like Beijing and London. The global launch is a critical test for the company as it faces intensified competition in key markets, particularly from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi in China. Early sales indicators, such as preorder volumes on Chinese e-commerce platforms, appear positive, with customers citing new designs and features as reasons for upgrading. The successful rollout is also important for Apple to reassure investors while it works to deliver on its ambitious artificial intelligence promises, an area where it is perceived to be catching up to rivals.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Alibaba is intensifying its competition with rival Meituan by expanding into the in-store dining market. The company plans to launch a service offering discounted dining vouchers through its Taobao Shangou and Ele.me platforms, starting in major cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai. This move directly challenges a core business of Meituan, which has long dominated the market for local lifestyle and dining deals. The initiative is timed to capitalize on increased consumer spending during China's upcoming "golden week" holiday, signaling a new front in the fierce battle for dominance in China's vast consumer services sector.</p>

          <p>Chinese military researchers are developing a naval "Great Wall" to defend warships against potential attacks from large, coordinated drone swarms. A recent study warns that such swarms could overwhelm traditional defenses through their numbers, stealth, and coordination. The proposed countermeasures involve a layered defense system including high-power microwave weapons, ship-mounted lasers, and long-range hypersonic cruise missiles. The research aligns with a recent display of advanced anti-drone weaponry in a military parade, suggesting that China is actively operationalizing these concepts to counter emerging threats in modern naval warfare.</p>

          <p>After his acute myeloid leukemia returned and no other genetic matches were found, anesthesiologist Nick Mondek received a life-saving stem cell donation from his nine-year-old son, Stephen. The boy agreed to the procedure, becoming what Cedars-Sinai Medical Center believes is its youngest-ever stem cell donor. Due to his age, the donation process was more complex, requiring a central line in his neck. The transplant offers hope that Stephen's cells will build a new, stronger immune system for his father to fight the cancer. Mondek expressed his gratitude and emphasized that he ensured his son made the decision without feeling pressured.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts are advising consumers on whether to refinance existing debts like mortgages, auto loans, and student loans. While the rate cut may offer some relief, its effects on consumer borrowing costs will likely be gradual. Experts suggest that refinancing generally makes sense when there is at least a one-percentage-point difference between a borrower's current rate and a new potential rate. Homeowners who secured mortgages in the last three years at higher rates may see the most immediate benefit, but all borrowers are encouraged to carefully calculate potential savings against closing costs and fees.

          <p>A book review of "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies" critiques the arguments made by AI doomsayers like Eliezer Yudkowsky, describing their case for an AI apocalypse as tendentious and logically flawed. The article argues that the authors fail to provide scientific evidence for their claims, instead relying on shaky analogies and a fundamental misunderstanding of intelligence as a simple, measurable concept. It suggests that the fear of a resource-hungry, exterminating superintelligence is an anthropomorphic projection of no-holds-barred capitalism. Ultimately, the piece concludes that both the doomers and the AI utopians share the same flawed fantasy of an all-powerful technology that will inevitably transform the world.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of large, predatory dinosaur, Newtonsaurus cambrensis, from a 125-year-old fossil that had been housed at the National Museum of Wales. The fossil, a lower jawbone, was discovered in a Triassic-era fossil bed and had been misclassified for decades. Using modern 3D scanning technology, researchers created a digital reconstruction that revealed it belonged to a previously unknown genus. The discovery is significant because the dinosaur's large size is unprecedented for a theropod from the Triassic period, challenging the consensus that large carnivorous dinosaurs only emerged later in the Jurassic period.</p>

          <p>A senior UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the military should be used to stop asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration, a method he has employed at the U.S. southern border. However, UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is the appropriate agency for policing borders and that the military's focus should remain on national defense. He noted that while the navy can be called upon for support, its primary role is not domestic migration enforcement.</p>

Their release was secured through mediation by Qatar, and they were handed over to the UK's Special Envoy to Afghanistan.
