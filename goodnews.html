          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO), intending to trade on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG." This move follows the collapse of a $20 billion acquisition by Adobe, which was terminated due to regulatory hurdles, resulting in a $1 billion fee paid to Figma. The company has demonstrated strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and over 1,000 customers contributing at least $100,000 in annual revenue. The IPO is seen as a positive development for the tech industry and venture capital firms seeking returns after a prolonged market slump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The company ZymoChem is developing a sustainable alternative to a key component in disposable diapers, which are a major source of landfill waste. Using a fermentation process similar to brewing beer, ZymoChem converts sugar from corn into a biodegradable super absorbent polymer (SAP). This bio-based material is designed to replace the fossil-fuel-based plastics that constitute a large portion of typical diapers. The company, which has also partnered with Lululemon to use its materials in apparel, aims to achieve cost parity with traditional manufacturing, offering a more environmentally friendly drop-in solution for hygiene products.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a surge after a controversial tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the major Republican spending bill. The proposed tax would have targeted projects using components from foreign entities of concern, primarily China, adding a potential $7 billion burden to the industry. While its removal provided relief, industry groups like the Solar Energy Industries Association remain critical of the overall bill, which still phases out key production tax credits that have been instrumental in the growth of renewable energy in the U.S. The legislation's ultimate impact on the sector remains a concern for clean energy advocates.

          <p>A bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of genetic testing company 23andMe's assets to TTAM Research Institute, a nonprofit led by co-founder Anne Wojcicki, for $305 million. The sale of the financially troubled company had sparked significant privacy concerns over the fate of genetic data from its 13 million customers. Several states sued to block any sale of data without user consent. However, the judge ruled that the deal would allow Wojcicki to improve privacy practices while honoring customer rights. Once valued at $6 billion, 23andMe filed for bankruptcy amid struggles with revenue growth and a major data breach in 2023.</p>

          <p>R.T. Thorne's debut feature, ‚Äú40 Acres,‚Äù is a post-apocalyptic thriller centered on a Black family struggling for survival in rural Canada after a pandemic wiped out animals and crops. The film stars Danielle Deadwyler as Hailey, a military veteran who leads her family with rigid discipline on their fortified farmstead, fending off hungry cannibals. The story focuses on the tension between Hailey's hardened isolationism, rooted in generational trauma, and her eldest son's desire for human connection. While the film is praised for its tense atmosphere and Deadwyler's powerful performance, some critics find its historical allusions and heavy-handed symbolism occasionally distracting from the core family drama.</p>

Draper, seeded fourth, was leading comfortably with a score of 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 when Baez, a clay-court specialist, could not continue after slipping on the baseline. This marks Draper's third main-draw victory at the All England Club and comes with increased expectations as he is the host nation's leading hope following Andy Murray's retirement. Draper delivered a confident performance, dominating with his powerful serve, and will next face 2017 runner-up Marin Cilic.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare announced it will begin blocking artificial intelligence crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move to protect content creators. The new policy requires website owners to explicitly grant permission for AI bots from companies like OpenAI and Google to access their content for training large language models. Cloudflare, which handles roughly 16% of global internet traffic, is also introducing a "pay per crawl" model to allow publishers to charge for access. This shift aims to restore the traditional internet model where creators benefit from traffic, which AI has disrupted by summarizing information directly for users.</p>

When asked about political pressure, Powell deflected, stating he is focused on his job, a sentiment echoed by ECB President Christine Lagarde, who said she and her colleagues would act in the exact same manner.
