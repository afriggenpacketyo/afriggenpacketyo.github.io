          <p>Japan's craft gin industry is experiencing a boom, with small-scale distillers using homegrown ingredients to create unique and flavorful gins. Domestic shipments have increased significantly, driven by the flexibility of gin production and the ability to convert existing equipment from whiskey and shochu making. Distillers are incorporating local specialties such as bitter gourd, camellia flowers, and burnt lacquer wood, and this trend is prompting major manufacturers to release canned gin products, and gin-focused bars and e-commerce sites are emerging, catering to the growing demand.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 34 years, Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor, now surpassed by Germany, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite Japan's gross external assets rising to a record high due to a weaker yen, Germany's total assets exceeded Japan's, and Japan's net external credit increased for the seventh consecutive year, driven by direct investment in the United States.
