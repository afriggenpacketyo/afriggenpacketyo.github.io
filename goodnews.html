          <p>Joe Root's unbeaten 166 led England to a three-wicket victory over West Indies in Cardiff, securing the three-match series. Root became England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, surpassing Eoin Morgan's record. West Indies set a target of 308, propelled by Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope, but England's sloppy fielding aided their efforts. England recovered from an early setback, with Root partnering with Harry Brook and Will Jacks to chase down the total.</p>
