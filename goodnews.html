          <p>Argentine director and actor Iair Said discusses his new film, ‚ÄúMost People Die On Sundays,‚Äù a comedy-drama about a man confronting personal demons and family loss. Said, who also stars in the film, explains that the character is not entirely autobiographical but allows him to explore emotions and behaviors differently than in his personal life. The film touches on themes of death and the challenges of expressing emotions, using comedy to help the audience process grief. Said also addresses the representation of diverse bodies in cinema and the importance of showing real and imperfect characters.</p>

          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower, being dismantled as part of the Eaton fire investigation, was damaged when it contacted power lines during a helicopter lift. The incident occurred near the Gould substation in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, but no injuries were reported. The cause of the Eaton fire is still under investigation, with induction being considered a leading theory. The tower was being moved to a warehouse for testing as part of an agreement between SCE, county investigators, and law firms.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer announced a new trade deal between the US and UK, but analysts suggest the substantive benefits are limited. While the UK secured some rollback of tariffs on cars and steel, a 10% import tax on most UK goods remains in place. In exchange, the US will see expanded opportunities for sales of American beef, ethanol, and other agricultural products in the UK. The deal is seen as a political victory for Trump, who is eager to showcase trade agreements, but its overall economic impact is expected to be narrow.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain, increasing market access for American farm exports. In return, Britain can export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. with a 10% tariff, and the U.S. will remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. The agreement, hailed as a ‚Äútremendous‚Äù deal, leaves in place a 10% baseline tariff that Trump imposed in April. The deal provides hints for other countries negotiating with the U.S. on trade, showing that Trump intends to keep the 10% universal tariff.</p>

While the use of AI in legal proceedings is uncharted territory, it sparked debate about potential manipulation and deception.

          <p>India appears ready to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S., potentially offering zero tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals. This shift comes after Trump's tariff announcements and could significantly impact India's domestic manufacturing ambitions. While some experts believe certain sectors won't be significantly harmed, others suggest that a deal could lead to a flood of U.S. goods into India. Financials, materials, and healthcare are expected to be the most sensitive to trade headlines.</p>

Zara doesn't advertise and rarely gives interviews, but as it marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, the BBC was given access to its vast campus in Galicia to meet the boss and workers for a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates. Zara has changed the way we shop, sourcing a lot of its clothes closer to home and changing products much more frequently.</p>
