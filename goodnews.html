        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For senior homeowners, a reverse mortgage can be a valuable tool for accessing retirement income, but it comes with specific equity requirements. Most lenders require homeowners to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property to qualify for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), the most common type. The actual amount that can be borrowed depends on factors like the borrower's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits. If a homeowner falls short of the equity threshold, options include paying down the existing mortgage, waiting for equity to build, or downsizing to a less expensive home.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has convicted Ali Muhammad Ali Abd–Al-Rahman, a leader of Sudan's Janjaweed militia, for atrocities committed in Darfur over two decades ago. This marks the court's first conviction for crimes related to the Darfur conflict, which is considered the 21st century's first genocide. Abd–Al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, was found guilty on 27 counts, including mass killings and sexual violence, carried out as part of a government-backed plan to suppress a rebellion. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, while arrest warrants for other Sudanese officials remain outstanding.</p>

          <p>For over six decades, the Bread and Puppet Theater has been a fixture of radical political performance in the U.S., known for its giant puppets at anti-war protests. Founded in 1963 by 91-year-old Peter Schumann, the troupe continues to tour the country with shows that blend medieval play traditions with contemporary political commentary. Their 2025 performance is staunchly pro-Palestinian and also lampoons billionaires and supports labor unions. Despite concerns about free expression in the current political climate, the puppeteers remain committed to their ethos of using art to make "the revolution irresistible."</p>

She explained that some alpha chimpanzees rule through aggression but don't last long, while others use intelligence and cooperation.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a financial aid package of over $10 billion for U.S. farmers, with a particular focus on soybean producers. Farmers have been severely impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans, a key export market. A top White House economic adviser confirmed that discussions have been ongoing and that "big measures" would be announced soon to address the issue. This potential relief follows former President Trump's suggestion last month that revenue collected from tariffs could be used to support farmers affected by the trade disputes.
