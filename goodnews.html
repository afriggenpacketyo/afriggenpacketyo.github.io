          <p>In Altadena, California, residents have formed the "Altadena Dining Club" to help local restaurants recover from the economic impact of the recent Eaton fire. The club, founded by a resident who lost her apartment, brings community members together for weekly meals at struggling, often family-owned, establishments. Many members are also fire victims who find solace and connection by sharing meals with others who understand their loss. The initiative provides a vital economic boost to businesses and has fostered a strong sense of community and mutual support during a difficult recovery process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen emphasize that the U.S. Constitution was designed not as a static relic, but as a dynamic framework intended to be amended and reinterpreted over time. In her new book, Lepore explains that the amendment process was a key demand from the states during ratification, leading to the Bill of Rights. Rosen notes that while the document contains tragic compromises, like over slavery, it was left to future generations to create a "more perfect union." Both express concern that modern political gridlock and over-reliance on the Supreme Court for interpretation have stalled this intended process of evolution.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out a new feature called "Hear the Highlights," which uses artificial intelligence to generate short audio summaries of products. The AI model synthesizes information from the product catalog, customer reviews, and other web sources to create the clips, which are now available for over one million products in the U.S. mobile app. While the feature aims to simplify the shopping experience, concerns have been raised about whether AI can capture the nuance and specific details found in human reviews. There is also a risk of blending marketing language with genuine user feedback, potentially misleading consumers.</p>

          <p>Team Europe's golfers are using an unconventional training method to prepare for their Ryder Cup defense at Bethpage in New York: virtual reality headsets that simulate abuse from the crowd. Captain Luke Donald provided the equipment to players like Rory McIlroy to help them desensitize to the hostile environment they expect to face on American soil. McIlroy confirmed that players could have the simulated heckles "go as close to the bone as you like," noting that nothing can fully prepare them for the real event. This innovative approach highlights the team's detailed preparation for one of golf's most intense competitions.</p>

          <p>With the 2025 WNBA playoffs set to begin, sports analysts are offering their predictions for the postseason. A key topic is the absence of the compelling rookie rivalry between Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark, whose teams did not qualify, which some see as a loss for ratings but a gain for focusing on other league talent. The Minnesota Lynx, who feel they were "robbed" in last year's finals, are seen by many as the team to beat on their "revenge tour," led by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier. Other top contenders include the Las Vegas Aces, Atlanta Dream, and the defending champion New York Liberty.</p>

Cybersecurity company Zscaler is seeing high demand for its AI security and Zero Trust solutions, while software giant Oracle's stock has surged due to massive growth projections for its cloud infrastructure business driven by AI workloads.

          <p>Trade delegations from the United States and China have commenced their fourth round of face-to-face talks in Madrid, Spain. The meeting aims to address the escalating trade disagreements that have intensified since U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his tariff-focused policies in April. The discussions, led by key representatives from both nations, are taking place at the Spanish foreign ministry. These negotiations represent a continued effort by the world's two largest economies to find common ground and de-escalate their ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>With U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled for a state visit to the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing pressure to secure a deal on steel tariffs. A UK-U.S. trade agreement signed in June reduced tariffs on cars and aerospace but left a 25% tariff on British steel in place. The Commons Business and Trade Committee is urging the government to use the high-profile visit to finalize a lasting economic deal that would eliminate this and other potential sectoral tariffs. The visit, Trump's second as president, will include meetings with King Charles.</p>
