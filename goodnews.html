          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has introduced a new visa policy aimed at foreign officials who censor protected speech in the United States, asserting that it's unacceptable for them to issue arrest warrants or demand censorship on American soil. The policy intends to target officials from countries known for targeting dual nationals who criticize their governments on social media. Rubio emphasized that free speech is a fundamental American right over which foreign governments have no authority, reinforcing the U.S. commitment to protecting online expression. The exact implementation and scope of this new policy remain to be seen, but it signals a firm stance against foreign interference in American free speech rights.</p>

          <p>Amid the Trump administration's ban on Harvard enrolling international students, college expert Jamie Beaton advises students to remain steadfast in their goal of attending the university. Beaton suggests that the political strife could create an advantage for Harvard hopefuls, especially those from abroad, as some applicants may turn to other schools. Despite the federal government's actions, Beaton believes Harvard's brand remains strong and resilient, and students should not be deterred from applying. He notes that Harvard's acceptance rate is under 4%, with roughly 18% of the Class of 2028 coming from abroad.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a full pardon to Todd and Julie Chrisley, the reality TV stars convicted of bank and tax fraud offenses in 2022. The couple had been serving prison sentences after being found guilty of conspiring to defraud banks and evading federal income taxes. Trump's decision was influenced by appeals from their daughter, Savannah, who claimed her parents were unfairly targeted due to their conservative beliefs. The pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community, according to their attorney. The Chrisleys' prosecution was tainted by multiple constitutional violations and political bias, as claimed by their lawyer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing income and assets. The survey of over 12,000 Vanguard investors revealed that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while a $500,000 income increased it by 12%, and $1 million in assets boosted it by 18%. This suggests that preparedness for unplanned expenses is more critical for financial security than accumulating wealth. The median cost of an emergency is around $2,000, providing individuals with the confidence to handle unexpected financial stressors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Oklahoma, a military simulation company called MilSim West stages fake battles between NATO and Russian forces, drawing hundreds of participants who pay to engage in a realistic, albeit trauma-free, war experience. The events, which involve plastic pellet guns, blank ammunition, and night-vision goggles, are not intended to be about current events but rather exist in the realm of fantasy. However, many participants use the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a reference point for their uniforms and equipment, sometimes purchasing gear from military surplus stores that source merchandise directly from Ukraine's battlefields. The simulation provides camaraderie and a unique experience for those drawn to airsoft and military reenactments, blurring the lines between fantasy and reality.</p>

One potential reason for GE Vernova's success is that it is earlier in a potential upcycle for revenue and orders compared to Eaton and Vertiv, offering more revenue upside.
