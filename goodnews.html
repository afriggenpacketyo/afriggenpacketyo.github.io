          <p>Google is using its homepage "Doodle" to promote "AI Mode," its new AI-powered search experience. This move highlights the company's effort to increase user exposure to its AI features amidst growing competition from startups like OpenAI and Anthropic. The feature, powered by the Gemini model, aims to provide chatbot-like answers for complex questions using text, voice, or images. This prominent placement, which a spokesperson called a "fun promo," temporarily replaces the traditional doodles that celebrate history and culture, showing Google's strategic focus on AI integration.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO), planning to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "FIG." The filing reveals strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and a net income of $44.9 million. This move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory issues, resulting in a $1 billion fee for Figma. CEO Dylan Field stated the decision to go public is intended to allow the community to share in Figma's ownership and signals the company will continue to "take big swings."

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted that Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta were the standout performers among the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, all finishing the first half of the year at all-time highs. Cramer noted that Microsoft's stock surged after its Azure cloud business beat growth expectations, demonstrating strong performance in a key sector. He attributed Nvidia's rally to its "semiconductor superiority" and persistent demand for its unrivaled AI chips, overcoming earlier concerns. Meta's success was credited to its powerful advertising capabilities, which led to quarterly earnings that significantly surpassed estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay an ¬£8.4 million fee to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold a month before his Liverpool contract expired is already proving to be a shrewd investment. The early signing allowed him to participate in the Club World Cup, where his assist in a key match against Juventus secured an extra ¬£10 million in prize money for the club. While questions remain about his defensive work, the 26-year-old is adapting well to his new wing-back role under coach Xabi Alonso. His attacking contributions and crossing ability have impressed his new team, including goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who called his quality "another level."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed major reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a move intended to spur housing construction by removing significant regulatory hurdles. The changes, which took effect immediately, waive CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise developments in urban areas zoned for multifamily housing, eliminating lengthy environmental studies and the threat of lawsuits from project opponents. Newsom fast-tracked the legislation by tying it to the state budget, forcing a vote on what experts call the most significant CEQA reforms in decades. The goal is to address California's severe housing affordability crisis by removing barriers that have long stifled development.</p>

          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic advanced to the second round of Wimbledon after overcoming physical issues in his match against Alexandre Muller. Djokovic appeared to struggle with a stomach problem early in the third set but recovered after a medical timeout to secure the victory. In other men's singles action, world number one Jannik Sinner dominated his opponent, but third seed Alexander Zverev was a casualty of a major upset, losing to Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech. The early rounds have seen several top-10 players eliminated, setting the stage for an unpredictable tournament.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos has sold over 3.3 million shares of his company, valued at approximately $737 million. The sale is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, under which Bezos intends to sell up to 25 million shares by May 2026. Bezos, who remains Amazon's largest individual shareholder, has regularly sold stock to fund his other ventures, including his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his nonprofit preschool network. The transaction was disclosed shortly after his highly publicized wedding celebration in Venice, Italy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul is now officially eligible to fight for a world title after the World Boxing Association (WBA) placed him at No. 14 in its cruiserweight rankings. The ranking came just days after his victory over a 39-year-old Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. While a remarkable milestone for the social media star, the WBA's decision is seen by many as reflecting Paul's immense financial drawing power more than his boxing resume. The move could pave the way for a lucrative title fight against the current WBA champion, Gilberto "Zurdo" Ram√≠rez, with whom Paul has already had a public staredown.</p>
