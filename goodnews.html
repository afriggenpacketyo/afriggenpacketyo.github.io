          <p>Tesla reported its third-quarter financial results, revealing mixed performance that has captured the attention of investors and market analysts. The electric vehicle manufacturer posted adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share, falling short of the 54 cents per share anticipated by analysts polled by LSEG. However, the company surpassed revenue expectations, bringing in $28.10 billion against a forecast of $26.37 billion. This divergence between earnings and revenue presents a complex picture of the company's profitability and operational efficiency during the period, prompting discussions about its future financial trajectory.

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the thirteenth named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is forecast to bring heavy rainfall to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center predicts these areas could receive 5 to 10 inches of rain, creating risks of significant flash flooding and landslides. As of Wednesday, the storm was moving slowly west with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and could strengthen into a hurricane by Friday. While its long-term track remains uncertain, current projections suggest Melissa is unlikely to have a major impact on the mainland United States.</p>

          <p>Thames Valley Police have released four men without charge after they were arrested for projecting an image of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle. The incident occurred in September during the president's state visit to the UK. The men were arrested on suspicion of offenses including malicious communications and public nuisance. The political campaign group Led By Donkeys claimed responsibility for the nine-minute projection, calling the arrests a "ridiculous overreaction." Authorities have now concluded their investigation and announced that no further action will be taken against the individuals involved.</p>

          <p>General Motors has outlined a strategic plan to integrate a suite of advanced software technologies into its vehicles over the next three years. The initiatives include launching an in-vehicle conversational AI assistant powered by Google's Gemini in 2026, followed by an "eyes-off" driver-assistance system in 2028. This upgraded system, which will debut on the Cadillac Escalade IQ, will utilize lidar technology to allow drivers to disengage under certain conditions. These announcements are part of GM's broader vision to transform its vehicles into intelligent assistants and secure a leading position in the future of transportation.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates this fall, credit card borrowers face a strategic decision between waiting for potential relief or pursuing immediate debt forgiveness options. While anticipated rate cuts could total less than a full percentage point, their impact on high-interest credit card debt, currently averaging around 21%, is likely to be minimal. Credit card rates are influenced by multiple factors and do not always follow the Fed's lead, especially downwards. Given that interest continues to compound daily, many borrowers may find that proactive debt relief solutions offer a more tangible and immediate financial benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League has signed a multi-year licensing agreement with prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket, marking a first for a major U.S. sports league. The deal grants the platforms access to official NHL data and logos, while the league gains brand exposure and what it describes as enhanced customer protections. The move, aimed at reaching new fan demographics, has drawn criticism from the American Gaming Association, which argues these platforms operate as unregulated gambling. Kalshi's CEO hailed the partnership as a "seminal moment" that validates prediction markets, hinting that similar deals with other leagues may follow soon.</p>

          <p>In an interview, acclaimed documentarian Ken Burns explores the multifaceted nature of the American Revolution, coinciding with his new film on the subject. He argues against simplistic, binary interpretations, suggesting the event was simultaneously a triumphant fight for liberty and a tragic civil war that victimized Indigenous and enslaved populations. Burns emphasizes that a nuanced understanding, which acknowledges figures like George Washington as both heroic and flawed, ultimately enlarges the power of the Revolution's core ideas. He contends that embracing this complexity is essential for understanding America's origins and its ongoing identity struggles.</p>

          <h2>Homebuyers Consider Pros and Cons of Locking Mortgage Rates Ahead of Expected Fed Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 14:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates again in October and December, potential homebuyers are weighing whether to lock in current mortgage rates or wait for them to fall further. Locking a rate now, around 6.3%, provides certainty and protects against unexpected market spikes, allowing for confident budgeting. However, waiting could lead to additional savings if the Fed's actions push rates lower, though there's no guarantee this will occur or that lenders haven't already priced in the cuts. Homebuyers should also consider potential "float down" fees from lenders if they lock a rate and then wish to secure a lower one later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Parliament has awarded the 2025 Sakharov Prize to Andrzej Poczobut, a Belarusian journalist and outspoken critic of leader Alexander Lukashenko. Poczobut, a correspondent for a Polish newspaper, was arrested in 2021 and sentenced to eight years in a penal colony on charges including harming national security. He has consistently refused offers of freedom that would require him to beg for mercy and leave Belarus. The prestigious award honors his courageous and principled stance, though it remains uncertain whether the international recognition will improve his situation, as Lukashenko's regime often responds to pressure with increased repression.</p>

          <p>Nia DaCosta's new film adaptation of "Hedda Gabler," titled "Hedda," offers a sharp and rollicking modern take on the classic play, with a marvelous lead performance by Tessa Thompson. The film reimagines the story within a single, debaucherous 1950s party, tightening the narrative and amplifying its rage against the societal constraints placed on women. Thompson portrays Hedda as a clever, viciously bored newlywed who channels her frustrated ambitions into manipulating those around her. The adaptation boldly layers in themes of race and sexuality, creating a vibrant and compelling psychological drama that feels both timeless and fiercely contemporary.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 14:25:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For married retirees considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their income, it is crucial to understand how the process works for couples. Ideally, both spouses should be listed as co-borrowers, which requires both to be at least 62 years old and meet other eligibility criteria. This ensures that the surviving spouse can remain in the home if one passes away. The loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which can result in access to less equity than if calculated for an older, single borrower. Couples must carefully weigh these factors and undergo mandatory counseling to ensure the loan aligns with their long-term financial plan.</p>
