          <p>An opinion article challenges the validity of recent projections suggesting a drastic decline in China's population by the end of the century. The author points out a lack of clear justification for why forecasts predict population decreases for China and Russia while anticipating significant growth for the United States. The piece argues for skepticism, citing alternative data from Chinese researchers at Renmin and Peking Universities. These domestic forecasts present a more moderate scenario, estimating China's population could be around 1.12 billion, questioning the widespread narrative of a severe demographic collapse.</p>

          <p>Yevgeny Savin, a former Russian professional footballer turned YouTuber, has successfully led his football club, Krasava ENY Ypsonas, to Cyprus's top division. After condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Savin left his home country, where he was later sentenced in absentia for "discrediting" the army. He re-established his club in Cyprus, investing his own money and building a team and fan base primarily from the post-Soviet immigrant community. Despite personal hardships, including separation from his family, Savin has created a unifying force for Russian-speaking expatriates and now aims to qualify for European competitions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced a major reform of the nation's organ procurement system. This "historic crackdown" aims to restore public trust by increasing oversight and accountability, addressing long-standing patient safety concerns and inefficiencies. For the first time, the department is moving to decertify an organ procurement organization (OPO) mid-cycle, targeting the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency in Miami for significant deficiencies. Officials highlighted that thousands of donated organs are discarded annually, and these reforms are intended to save more lives by modernizing the system.</p>

          <p>Apple has released its new iPhone 17 series worldwide, with new models including the iPhone 17 Pro and the thin iPhone Air drawing crowds from Beijing to London. The global launch is a critical test for the company as it faces intensified competition, particularly from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi in the key Chinese market. While initial preorders and sales appear strong, Apple is also under pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises after a previously underwhelming rollout. The success of this launch could reassure investors and solidify Apple's position in the competitive smartphone landscape.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group Holding is intensifying its competition with rival Meituan by expanding into the in-store dining market. The company plans to launch a service offering discounted dining vouchers through its Taobao Shangou and Ele.me platforms, starting in major cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai. This move directly challenges a core business of Meituan, which has dominated the sector since merging with Dianping in 2015. The initiative, launching ahead of China's "golden week" holiday, represents a significant strategic push by Alibaba to capture a larger share of the consumer services market and leverage its vast e-commerce ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old boy named Stephen has become one of the youngest known stem cell donors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to save his father, Nick Mondek, who is battling acute myeloid leukemia. After his cancer returned and no other matches were found, Mondek's son was identified as a compatible partial match. Following careful explanation of the procedure, the young boy agreed to undergo the donation process, which was specially adapted for his age. The transplant offers hope that the new stem cells will build a stronger immune system for his father to fight the cancer, a process that could take over a year to confirm.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts are advising consumers on when it might be beneficial to refinance existing debts like mortgages and auto loans. While the rate cut offers potential relief from high borrowing costs, its effects may be gradual. Experts suggest that refinancing generally makes sense when there is at least a one-percentage-point difference between a current rate and a new one. Homeowners who secured mortgages in the last few years at higher rates may see the most immediate benefit, while those with older, lower-rate loans are advised to crunch the numbers carefully.

          <p>A new book by AI researchers Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares, titled "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies," argues for a complete shutdown of AI research to prevent human extinction. A review of the book critiques its core premise, asserting that both AI doomers and the tech utopians they oppose are misguided. The reviewer argues both camps are rooted in the flawed idea of a singular, measurable "superintelligence" and a fantasy of technological salvation. The article suggests that the fears of an all-powerful, resource-hungry AI simply mirror the behavior of today's ultra-wealthy tech oligarchs, rather than reflecting a likely technological reality.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been freed after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months without charge. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived and run a charity in the country for 18 years and remained after the Taliban's 2021 takeover. Their release was secured through mediation by Qatar, following months of lobbying by their family, who had raised serious concerns about their deteriorating health in prison. The Taliban claimed the couple had violated Afghan law but never specified the charges, highlighting the precarious situation for foreign nationals in the country.</p>

          <h2>Virologist Explains Why COVID-19 Severity Varies Among Healthy Individuals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Five years into the pandemic, experts are clarifying why COVID-19 affects healthy people with such varying degrees of severity. According to Professor David Matthews, a virologist at the University of Bristol, a key factor is the initial viral dose a person is exposed to. A low-dose exposure, such as from a contaminated surface, may lead to mild symptoms, whereas inhaling a high dose from a cough can result in a more severe illness. While new variants continue to emerge, he notes that widespread immunity from vaccination and prior infection means the virus is settling into a more predictable seasonal pattern, similar to the flu.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Dartmouth's president argues that despite public skepticism and the rise of AI, residential higher education is more crucial than ever. The author contends that the primary purpose of a university is not just knowledge transfer but teaching students *how* to think and cultivating essential human skills like critical thinking, empathy, and dialogue. In an age of information overload and online polarization, in-person communities provide a unique environment for difficult but enlightening conversations and for practicing engagement across differences. The article concludes that as AI accelerates, higher education must double down on its human-centric mission.</p>
