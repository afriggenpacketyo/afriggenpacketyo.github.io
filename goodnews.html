        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest Japan's turbulent political climate could undermine its diplomatic efforts, potentially stalling progress in trilateral summits with China and South Korea. The instability arises from the fragmented political landscape, where no single party can maintain a stable government. Takaichi's pursuit of becoming Japan's first female prime minister faces challenges in securing the necessary votes, highlighting the uncertainties within the political system. This situation could diminish Japan's ability to effectively participate in major diplomatic events and impede momentum in its relationships with key regional partners, affecting overall geopolitical dynamics. The country's diplomatic commitments could be cast in doubt. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security will impose a $1,000 immigration fee on migrants paroled in the U.S. to ensure accountability and prevent misuse of the parole system. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated that the Biden Administration abused America’s immigration system and turned parole into a de facto amnesty program, thereby allowing millions of unvetted illegal aliens into the U.S., no questions asked, to the detriment of all Americans. The fee, which may be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index, will be collected by Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The new fee seeks to deter misuse and strengthen oversight. </p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index hit a fresh record high for the third consecutive day due to optimism surrounding ongoing trade talks with the U.S., diverging from broader losses in Asian markets. The Kospi was the only market in positive territory, reaching an intraday high of 3,794.87, while other Asia-Pacific markets traded weaker amid fears over the banking sector and trade tensions. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports also showed a sharp rebound in September, defying expectations of a drop and reversing a previous decline. The Kospi's performance reflects investor confidence in South Korea's economic outlook amid trade negotiations.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former members of the military are now able to apply for a digital version of their identity cards, allowing them to prove their status more easily and access public services. The digital ID can be downloaded to a smartphone and is optional, with physical veterans' cards continuing to be issued. The government says it will allow former service personnel to show their entitlement to services such as GP and mental health support, supported housing, careers advice as well as reduced entry prices at museums and money off their shopping. Digital government minister Ian Murray said the veterans' digital ID could also help address "legitimate concerns around privacy and security" of the UK-wide scheme. </p>
