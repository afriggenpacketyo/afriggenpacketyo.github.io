          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that despite disagreements with Trump's approach to the Ukraine war, his influence could push both sides toward a much-needed ceasefire. The editorial acknowledges Trump's correct observations about the war's tragic human cost and the potential for economic benefits from its end. Instead of withdrawing, Trump should increase pressure on Russia and Ukraine to reach a deal, potentially including Russia retaining controlled territories in exchange for lifted sanctions and security guarantees for Ukraine. The article underscores the importance of the U.S. demonstrating resolve to prevent further Russian aggression and end the conflict, emphasizing the need for a settlement that allows Ukraine to thrive and sends a message to potential aggressors.</p>

          <p>Conflict resolution facilitator Priya Parker suggests using "magical questions" to cut through small talk and reveal people's personalities in group settings. These questions are designed to spark curiosity and elicit responses that help people feel like individuals rather than just a group. Parker emphasizes that magical questions should be relevant to the context of the group and allow everyone to participate, regardless of their backgrounds or opinions. She provides examples such as asking about someone's first concert or a gift they deeply loved, noting that these questions can lead to deeper conversations and connections.</p>

          <p>World financial markets welcomed a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports, causing U.S. futures to jump and oil prices to rise. The court found that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not authorize the use of tariffs. While the White House appealed the ruling, investors appeared encouraged by the potential end to months of trade war turmoil. The ruling also pushed the dollar higher against the Japanese yen and boosted stock markets in Asia and Europe.</p>

          <p>A significant group of long-serving England rugby players, including Ben Youngs, Dan Cole, Alex Goode, Danny Care, and Mike Brown, are retiring from the sport. These players, who were integral to England's success over the past decade, are stepping down, marking the end of an era. Their departure coincides with the rise of younger players from academies, signaling a shift in the squad dynamic.

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, a key component of his economic policies, ruling that an emergency law invoked by the White House did not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court said the US Constitution gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations and this was not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The White House has criticized the ruling and said it would appeal within minutes of the ruling. Global markets have responded positively to the ruling.</p>

          <p>The government has outlined plans for reforming the UK pension industry, including the creation of ¬£25bn "megafunds" instructed to invest locally to fuel economic growth. The chancellor said the overhaul, designed to follow the example of Australia and Canada's huge pension investment funds, would also boost people's pension pots. Seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms already approved the gist of these reforms in a voluntary agreement earlier this month. The government is also including a legislative back-stop, which will allow it to push through the new rules, if insufficient progress is made by the end of the decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by strong demand ahead of the potential negative effects of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The automaker's global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. Despite the positive sales figures, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen.

The White House has 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs, although most are currently suspended anyway.
