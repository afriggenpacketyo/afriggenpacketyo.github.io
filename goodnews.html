          <p>The UK and the European Union have reportedly reached an agreement to reset relations following Britain's exit from the EU in 2020. The deal, reached ahead of a summit in London, includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. This agreement aims to address trade friction and foster cooperation on various policy areas, including youth mobility and carbon border taxes. The evolving global landscape, particularly U.S. isolationism, has underscored the need for closer collaboration between the UK and the EU.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill for a typical household using gas and electricity will fall by ¬£129 a year, a decrease of nearly 7%. This would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to ¬£1,720, down from the current level of ¬£1,849. However, the price cap is based on the cost per unit of energy, so the total bill still depends on usage.</p>
