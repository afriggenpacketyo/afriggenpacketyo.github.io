          <p>Max Verstappen secured victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy within the McLaren team. Lando Norris finished second after the team ordered his teammate, Oscar Piastri, to let him pass. The decision came after a slow pit stop for Norris, caused by a wheel gun fault, dropped him behind Piastri, sparking debate about fairness in racing and its impact on the drivers' championship standings. Piastri's lead over Norris in the championship has now been reduced to 31 points.</p>

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker has completed a 12-hour, 26.4-mile journey from Catalina Island to the California mainland in a kayak he grew entirely from mushrooms. The vessel was made from mycelium, the root-like network of fungi, which forms a lightweight and buoyant material. Shoemaker's voyage is part of a growing movement exploring fungal materials, known as AquaFung, as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in aquatic recreation. He hopes his achievement will inspire further innovation and research into sustainable materials.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests U.S. Economy Can Absorb Impact of New Tariffs Despite Small Business Concerns</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent elimination of the "de minimis" tariff exemption for imports under $800 has raised concerns about its impact on small businesses. However, this analysis argues that the panic is misdirected, as the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. While the tariffs will likely lead to price increases, the author contends that the overall economy can absorb these costs as long as consumer income and wealth remain strong. The article suggests businesses are adapting by diversifying suppliers and offering financing options to customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's star full-back and current world player of the year, Ellie Kildunne, will be sidelined for the Rugby World Cup quarter-final match against Scotland. She sustained a head injury during England's victory over Australia, resulting in concussion symptoms and a mandatory 12-day stand-down period. Kildunne's availability for a potential semi-final on September 20 is also uncertain, as her return depends on a complete and hitch-free recovery.

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most critical things parents can do for their child's long-term health and success. Good sleep is essential for a baby's physical, mental, and cognitive development, and it helps older children learn to concentrate and regulate emotions. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling the baby, and maintaining a flexible routine to help infants learn to sleep well, which sets a foundation for their entire lives.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that solar energy should be embraced by right-wing preppers and survivalists, not for environmental reasons, but for its practicality and reliability during societal disruptions. Unlike fossil fuels, which depend on complex supply chains, solar panels offer true energy independence by harnessing a consistent power source, the sun, for decades with minimal maintenance. The author suggests that solar panels paired with batteries and electric vehicles provide a simple, robust, and self-sufficient power system, making a home a defensible and sustainable castle in any emergency scenario.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's ongoing investment in coal-fired power plants is not a reversal of its climate policy, but rather a strategic move to support its massive expansion of renewable energy. With solar and wind power generation growing at a record pace, the grid faces challenges from intermittency and "curtailment," where clean energy is generated but cannot be used. Coal plants are being used as a reliable backup or "shock absorber" to ensure grid stability during peak demand and when renewables are unavailable, allowing for a more confident and rapid transition to clean energy.</p>

The idea rapidly gained popularity, expanded internationally, and overcame early business challenges to become Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup, now valued at over a billion dollars with millions of users in the UK alone.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of sauropod fossils from Brazil reveals that these giant, long-necked dinosaurs suffered from osteomyelitis, a destructive bone infection caused by pathogens like bacteria or fungi. Researchers analyzed the 80-million-year-old skeletons of six dinosaurs from the same site and found lesions indicative of the disease, which likely progressed rapidly and may have contributed to their deaths. The findings suggest that the swampy, riverine environment these dinosaurs inhabited was a breeding ground for pathogens that posed a significant threat even to some of the largest creatures on Earth.</p>
