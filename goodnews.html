          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, the city of Minneapolis is collaborating with StoryCorps to record and preserve the stories of those impacted by his death and the subsequent events. The initiative aims to give voice to community members who felt unheard, providing a platform for them to share their experiences and truths. These taped interviews will be shared with city leaders and archived in the Library of Congress, ensuring that future generations can access these narratives. Photographer John Noltner, who documented the initial memorial, emphasizes the importance of connection and authentic community grieving in the wake of such events, noting the project's potential to bridge divisions and foster understanding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Broward County Circuit Court Judge Gary Farmer has been suspended following a determination by the Florida Judicial Qualifications Commission that he was unfit to serve due to telling inappropriate jokes, showing bias, and having poor attendance. The investigation was initiated after concerns were raised about Farmer's courtroom remarks, including mocking a defendant expecting children with different women and referencing a comedy sketch making fun of gay people. While Farmer's attorney admits he made the jokes, they argue they were meant to lighten tension and show humanity, though Farmer has since apologized for the remarks. The commission also cited Farmer's excessive judicial leave and alleged bias in his rulings as reasons for the suspension.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, reported better-than-expected revenue in its first earnings release since going public, with revenue soaring 420% year-over-year. The company also raised its revenue guidance for 2025. CoreWeave's growth is driven by increasing demand for AI infrastructure, including a significant deal with OpenAI. Despite the positive results, the stock initially declined in extended trading, possibly due to investor confusion regarding the company's metrics. The company's CEO, Mike Intrator, highlighted that increased capital spending reflects new client uptake and demand for infrastructure.</p>
