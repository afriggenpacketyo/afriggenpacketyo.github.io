          <p>President Trump declared that the U.S. military would cease bombing the Houthis in Yemen, asserting that the group had 'capitulated' and promised to halt attacks on American commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. However, details of the arrangement remain vague, with the Houthis not issuing any public statement on the agreement. Oman's foreign ministry reported a ceasefire brokered by Oman, ensuring freedom of navigation, but the Houthis' political bureau stated that Israeli and American aggression would not go unanswered. The group has been targeting ships in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea since 2023 in response to Israeli military action in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Sovereignty, the winner of the 151st Kentucky Derby, will not compete in the Preakness Stakes, according to trainer Bill Mott, who cited the horse's long-term interests as the reason for skipping the second jewel of the Triple Crown. Mott stated that the plan is to enter Sovereignty in the Belmont Stakes, the third jewel of the Triple Crown, which will be held at Saratoga Race Course. The decision sparks debate around the spacing of the Triple Crown races, with some advocating for changes to the schedule to better accommodate the horses.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump, aiming to firmly assert that Canada would not become the 51st U.S. state while avoiding a public dispute.

Trump responded with 'Never say never,' but adopted a conciliatory tone, praising Carney's electoral victory. The leaders discussed trade and security issues, with Carney acknowledging the need for time and broader discussions beyond trade.</p>

          <p>Retail investors poured over $24 million into Berkshire Hathaway's Class B stock following Warren Buffett's announcement that Greg Abel would succeed him as CEO. Despite a 5% stock decline on the news, this influx marked the highest sum of net inflows since 2016, indicating confidence in Abel. Investors appear to be assuaged by Buffett's plans to remain as chairman and his endorsement of Abel's management. While Abel's stock-picking abilities are questioned, Buffett's continued involvement and the board's support seem to have eased concerns among everyday investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>MrDeepFakes, a notorious AI-generated pornography site, has shut down after losing a critical service provider, resulting in data loss that made continued operation impossible. The site was known for allowing users to upload nonconsensual, digitally altered, explicit sexual content, often featuring celebrities. Research indicated that a large percentage of the targets were celebrity women, with some videos containing violent scenes depicting sexual assault. The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed the TAKE IT DOWN Act, which establishes penalties for publishing intimate visual depictions without consent.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching a new film, Ocean, which he considers one of the most important of his career, highlighting the crucial role of the oceans in combating climate change and preserving biodiversity. The film documents the catastrophic decline in ocean life and emphasizes the ocean's capacity to recover rapidly. Attenborough's message is that the world must act decisively to protect the oceans, particularly by adhering to commitments to safeguard a third of the world's oceans. The film contains graphic footage of the damage caused by bottom trawling, a practice that drains the life from the oceans and releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide.</p>

          <p>NBC Sports will use AI voice synthesis technology to bring back the voice of the late Jim Fagan, the announcer known for his iconic voiceovers during NBA broadcasts in the 1990s and early 2000s. Fagan's voice will be heard on select title sequences, show opens, and promos when the NBA returns to NBC this fall after more than two decades. The network aims to evoke nostalgia for old-school NBA fans by pairing Fagan's AI-generated voice with John Tesh's 'Roundball Rock' as its NBA anthem.
