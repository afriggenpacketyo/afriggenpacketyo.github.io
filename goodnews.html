          <p>India secured a commanding 336-run victory over England in the second Test at Edgbaston, dramatically leveling the series at 1-1. Seamer Akash Deep delivered an exceptional performance, claiming a five-wicket haul and a total of 10 wickets in the match, dismantling England's batting lineup with relentless accuracy. Despite Jamie Smith's admirable resistance, scoring 88 and ending a crucial partnership, England was ultimately bowled out for 271 on day five, unable to achieve a draw. This significant triumph marks India's first Test win at Edgbaston in nine attempts, providing a reality check for England and setting a compelling stage for the remainder of the series.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall early Sunday near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, with its maximum sustained winds significantly decreasing to 35 mph. All tropical storm warnings have been discontinued, marking a positive shift as the storm is now expected to dissipate later today and by Monday. However, scattered showers and thunderstorms from Chantal's outer bands continue to impact portions of inland South and North Carolina, with some areas, including Myrtle Beach and Fayetteville, remaining under flood watches until Sunday night or Monday due to potential heavy rain and gusty winds.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, defended President Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" and trade policies during an interview, predicting several finalized trade deals this week that will open global markets to U.S. products while imposing reciprocal tariffs. He strongly refuted criticisms that the bill would significantly increase the deficit and cause Medicaid losses, asserting that administration models predict 3% economic growth, which would generate substantial revenue and job creation. Hassett criticized the Congressional Budget Office's past inaccuracies and flawed macroeconomic modeling, arguing their projections for the bill's impact are fundamentally wrong and fail to acknowledge its positive economic stimulus.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured his emotional first home victory in a chaotic and dramatic British Grand Prix at Silverstone, benefiting from a 10-second penalty issued to teammate Oscar Piastri for erratic driving during a safety-car restart. Piastri, who had calmly led through heavy rain, served his penalty during his final pit stop, allowing Norris to take the lead. Nico Hulkenberg achieved a historic first podium finish in his 239th attempt for Sauber, while Red Bull's Max Verstappen recovered to fifth after an unexpected spin. The race captivated a record F1 crowd of 168,000.</p>

          <p>ESPN analyst Carolyn Peck is facing intensified backlash after the Indiana Fever's narrow loss to the Los Angeles Sparks, following her controversial assertion that the team was "more dangerous" without star player Caitlin Clark. Clark missed her fifth consecutive game due to a groin injury, prompting fans and critics to argue against Peck's take, citing the Fever's 2-3 record in her absence. The team's recent 89-87 defeat, where they missed crucial shots in the final minute, further fueled the debate over Clark's impact and the validity of Peck's commentary.</p>
