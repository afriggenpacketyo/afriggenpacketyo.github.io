          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake occurred in northern New Jersey, causing minor shaking across parts of the New York City metropolitan area. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights. While no damage was reported, the event prompted many residents to report the tremors. This follows a larger, more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity, though rare, does occur on the East Coast.</p>

He shared the news on Instagram, stating he considered ending his recent tour but decided to continue, finding that the joy of performing outweighed the physical stress. Lyme disease can cause flu-like symptoms, joint pain, and neurological issues but is typically treatable with antibiotics. Timberlake expressed gratitude to his family for their support while noting uncertainty about his future on stage.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children, has been released after being detained by ICE for two months. She was taken into custody in May during a green card application interview due to an outstanding deportation order she was unaware of, issued after her mother missed a hearing years ago. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, advocated for her release, which came after her case drew public attention and support from Senator John Kennedy's office, highlighting the Trump administration's stricter immigration enforcement policies.</p>

Ledecky's victory was particularly notable, as she maintained her undefeated streak in the event at major competitions, a run that began at the 2012 Olympics.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Upholds Restrictions on Immigration Raids in Los Angeles Area</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 19:30:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how federal agents conduct immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirms that agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals and cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The case stems from controversial "roving patrols" by ICE and CBP that advocates argued were unconstitutional racial profiling. The ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is launching a new left-wing party with MP Zarah Sultana, but it currently lacks a name. While the venture has reportedly attracted over 600,000 supporters, the founders are asking them to help choose a title before they can register with the Electoral Commission and field candidates. The article discusses the importance and difficulty of branding a new political party in the modern digital age. Experts note that a name needs to convey the party's essence while avoiding ridicule or similarity to existing parties.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Hill explained that he felt unsuited for medicine and seeing his stepfather pass away before retirement made him re-evaluate his own life path. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, recalled feeling out of his depth in the profession and was terrified but excited to make the switch to entertainment in the early 1990s.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for around £30 million, just two years after signing him. This development comes as the club maintains interest in RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While Hojlund has publicly stated his desire to stay at United, the club may need to sell players to comply with financial regulations, and his position would be marginalized by Sesko's arrival. Selling Hojlund at this price would represent a book loss for the club on their initial investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia in 1943 has finally been solved. The animal, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during World War II, but perished days before reaching the UK. While wartime rumors blamed shock from a Nazi U-boat encounter, newly analyzed archival records, including the ship's logbook, suggest a different cause. Researchers now believe the platypus died from heatstroke, as water and air temperatures recorded during the journey across the equator far exceeded safe levels for the species.</p>
