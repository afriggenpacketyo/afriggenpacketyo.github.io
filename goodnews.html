          <p>A recent study based on data from the European Social Survey indicates that parents generally find their lives more meaningful compared to childfree individuals, but experience lower levels of life satisfaction. This discrepancy is particularly pronounced for mothers and varies depending on the country's family policies. Scandinavian countries, with robust childcare support and greater gender equality, show less difference in life satisfaction between parents and childfree individuals compared to central and eastern Europe.

          <p>This article is a guest essay by a palliative care physician, Dr. Sunita Puri, reflecting on the meaning of life and death through the stories of her patients. She contrasts the unrealistic portrayals of bucket lists in popular culture with the more profound and ordinary wishes of those facing mortality. Dr. Puri emphasizes that contemplating death often leads individuals to reconcile the differences between their current lives and the lives they longed for, seeking deeper connections and authentic experiences. The article encourages readers to consider what it truly means to live fully and authentically before death becomes imminent.</p>

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has expressed support for the new Olympic age limit, setting the minimum age for competition at 14 and older, starting with the 2028 Los Angeles Games. The decision by World Skate, the sport's governing body, came despite its potential impact on Japan's medal prospects. Daisuke Hayakawa, Japan's street skateboarding head coach, cited concerns about increasingly severe injuries among younger children as a reason for endorsing the age restriction. While some past medalists would have been ineligible under the new rule, Japanese organizers will not impose an age limit for domestic tournaments.</p>
