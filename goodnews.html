          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 23:07:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government will implement a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all nonimmigrant visa applicants, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and a separate, increased Form I-94 fee. The provision allows for the fee to be reimbursed if visitors comply with their visa terms, such as not overstaying. However, with implementation details still unclear, the Congressional Budget Office anticipates few reimbursements, estimating the measure will reduce the federal deficit by nearly $29 billion over a decade.

          <h2>Number of Missing Persons in Texas's Kerr County Drops Sharply After Floods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 22:22:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following devastating floods earlier in the month, officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly reduced the number of unaccounted-for individuals from nearly 100 to just three. This dramatic decrease is attributed to extensive verification work by state and local agencies, which confirmed that many people initially reported missing were safe. The update brings a measure of relief to the community, although the overall death toll from the statewide flooding event remains high at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team defeated the US Eagles in a decisive match in Washington D.C., which was significantly delayed by lightning. Despite the challenging, humid conditions and interruptions, England scored six tries to secure a comprehensive win. The young English squad capitalized on American errors, with tries from players including Curtis Langdon and Caden Murley. While the US managed a late consolation try, the game highlighted the performance gap as World Rugby aims to boost the sport's competitiveness in America ahead of future World Cups.</p>

The players' union opted out of the previous CBA and is seeking improved revenue sharing, higher salaries, and better benefits. With negotiations stalling and players reporting a significant gap between their demands and the league's offers, some have raised the possibility of a walkout if a new agreement isn't reached by October.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly attack in Southport, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law targeting individuals who plan mass killings but lack a specific ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap, giving police powers to apprehend and charge suspects for preparatory acts, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. This would allow authorities to intervene much earlier in cases involving lone, violence-obsessed individuals who currently cannot be charged with a serious offense until an attack is imminent or has occurred.</p>

Roberts expressed hope that having Betts observe a game without the pressure to perform could be beneficial for his mindset and help him break out of his uncharacteristic struggle at the plate.</p>

          <p>A growing number of drivers in the UK are avoiding steep "kiss-and-fly" charges at airports like Edinburgh by parking in nearby lay-bys and waiting for passengers to arrive. With fees at some major airports reaching £6 or more for a brief 10-minute stop, drivers coordinate via phone and then quickly pick up their friends or family from unofficial points to beat the charges. This behavior highlights public frustration with rising airport fees, which have increased at more than half of the UK's busiest airports over the past year.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway in the UK regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and food costs for working parents, and potentially lower holiday prices by spreading them out. However, many teachers oppose the idea, citing the need for the long break to recharge and plan. The issue is divisive, with some regions already adopting shorter summer breaks in favor of a longer October half-term.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a shift in public mindset from risk-averse saving to investing, suggesting that savers with funds in low-interest accounts should be notified of investment opportunities. The government aims to encourage more people, particularly women who invest less than men, to move money into stocks and shares ISAs to boost the economy. While a controversial plan to cut the cash ISA allowance has been paused, the push continues with new ad campaigns, though experts caution that this could backfire if new investors face short-term losses.
