          <p>Hugo Ortega, an American engineer, left his unfulfilling job and relationship to travel, eventually discovering a highly lucrative career in the yachting industry. Starting as a deckhand, he now works as a superyacht captain, earning up to $10,000 monthly, with tips potentially doubling that, and captains of larger yachts making up to $30,000. Ortega emphasizes that prior boating experience is not essential, but a willingness to learn, a customer service personality, and humility are crucial for success. He also runs "Superyacht Sunday School" to mentor aspiring yachties, though he cautions against entering the industry solely for money due to the demanding lifestyle and time away from family.</p>

Battling back from serious health issues, including Sjogren's syndrome and painful fibroids, Williams expressed gratitude for the opportunity to play feeling healthier, a significant improvement from previous matches. Her performance silenced doubters who questioned her wildcard entry, demonstrating her enduring competitive spirit and powerful game. Despite the loss, Williams's ability to push a top player to the limit after limited match play highlights her legendary determination, though her future tournament schedule remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has announced a substantial policy change, stating that his administration will allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the United States, effectively doubling the current enrollment figures. This declaration emerged shortly after the Chinese embassy in the US advised its students to exercise caution when traveling through Houston, citing instances of "unjustifiably questioned and harassed" individuals and electronic device inspections. Trump conveyed a desire for better relations with China, mentioning an invitation from President Xi Jinping to visit. This move represents a notable shift from previous tensions, aiming to foster greater educational and diplomatic engagement between the two global powers.</p>

Beyond weight loss, their potential applications are expanding to treat conditions like psoriasis, kidney disease, and Alzheimer's, sparking a new era of drug innovation. Goldman Sachs estimates GLP-1s could boost US GDP by 0.4% through increased productivity and healthcare savings. However, the high cost raises concerns about a two-tier society where access is limited to those who can afford it, potentially exacerbating socioeconomic inequalities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists report a significant breakthrough in "invisibility tech" for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, aiming to make their radar signals exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation. AEW&C aircraft, vital for managing battlespace but vulnerable due to powerful radar emissions, could become virtually untraceable. The new method uses frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, assigning each antenna a subtly varied frequency to create a chaotic signal at a distance, obscuring its origin. Engineers describe FDA as a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the survivability and effectiveness of these critical command nodes in future conflicts.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is currently weakening as it traverses the central Atlantic Ocean and is not expected to pose any threat to land, as reported by the National Hurricane Center. The storm, situated approximately 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, maintains maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is moving northeastward. Forecasters anticipate its continued dissipation, likely becoming a post-tropical cyclone before fully breaking apart by Wednesday. Fernand is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which previously reached Category 5 strength without making landfall. The season was predicted by NOAA to be above-normal, with 13 to 18 named storms expected.</p>

Lee praised Trump's rapport with Kim Jong Un and asked him to be a "peacemaker" on the Korean peninsula, even joking about a Trump Tower in North Korea. This diplomatic approach was crucial after Trump's earlier Truth Social post questioned South Korea's internal politics. While common ground was found on North Korea, contentious trade and defense issues, including the cost of US troops and a new trade deal, were largely sidestepped in public, with details being worked out behind the scenes.</p>

          <p>A Utah district court judge has ruled the state's congressional map unlawful, mandating its redrawing for the 2026 midterm elections. Judge Dianna Gibson determined that the Republican-controlled legislature violated voters' rights by circumventing an independent commission established to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The current map, drawn in 2021, divided Salt Lake County—a Democratic stronghold—among four districts, all of which subsequently elected Republicans. While Republican lawmakers have promised appeals, Lieutenant Governor Deidre Henderson urged a November finalization to allow time for the new map before candidate filings. This ruling creates uncertainty for the GOP's slim majority in the US House and could influence national political dynamics.</p>
