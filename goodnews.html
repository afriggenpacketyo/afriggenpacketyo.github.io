          <p>President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have signed a significant agreement to bolster the supply of critical minerals and rare earths. The deal outlines a pipeline of projects valued at up to $8.5 billion, aimed at creating a secure supply chain independent of China. This strategic partnership comes as the U.S. seeks to counter China's dominance in the global rare earths market, which is essential for defense, technology, and electric vehicle manufacturing.

          <p>Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician known for exposing the Flint water crisis, has launched a pioneering program called Rx Kids to combat child poverty. The initiative provides no-strings-attached cash payments to every expectant mother in Flint, offering $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 per month for the baby's first year. Funded primarily by private donors, the program is based on global evidence showing that such aid helps families afford essentials like rent, food, and baby supplies. The model has garnered bipartisan support and is being considered for expansion.</p>

          <p>Texas Tech University officials have announced an end to the unofficial fan tradition of throwing tortillas onto the field during football games. The decision follows recent penalties against the team and a new Big 12 Conference policy that imposes fines and warnings for such actions. Athletic director Kirby Hocutt and coach Joey McGuire stated that the school would no longer encourage or permit the practice, which dates back to the 1990s. Fans caught violating the new rule could face a $100,000 fine and lose their ticket privileges.</p>

It advises against assuming rates will only fall further, ignoring alternative savings options like mortgage points, and strictly adhering to the traditional 1% refinancing rule. The piece emphasizes that careful calculation is necessary to determine if refinancing is beneficial, even with a smaller rate reduction, to take full advantage of the current rate environment.

          <p>This article details why many investors choose the end of the year to perform Roth IRA conversions, which involve moving pre-tax retirement funds into a post-tax Roth IRA. The timing allows for more accurate income estimates, which is crucial for managing the upfront tax bill on the converted amount and avoiding pushes into higher tax brackets. The strategy is particularly popular for younger retirees, though the article also notes exceptions, such as leveraging market downturns earlier in the year for conversions.
