        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewables like onshore wind and utility-scale solar remain the most affordable options, even before accounting for government subsidies. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark shows these sources are cheaper to generate than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power, primarily due to lower operating expenses after initial capital investment. However, the report notes that recent Trump administration policies, including new tariffs and the phasing out of clean energy tax credits, are set to increase costs for renewable projects. Experts suggest a diverse energy portfolio is necessary to meet demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning artist Cardi B is preparing to release her new album, titled "Am I the Drama?" in a nod to her public reputation. In an interview, she explained that she believes drama follows her not because she seeks it, but due to her outspoken nature and big personality, which can make her an easy target for headlines. The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Almánzar, stated that she does not enjoy conflict and finds that some of the controversies cause her significant stress. She recalled being voted "most dramatic" in her high school yearbook, a label she didn't feel she deserved at the time.</p>

As part of the arrangement, technology company Oracle will maintain its role as the platform's cloud and data security partner, a key component to address national security concerns raised by U.S. lawmakers. The deal aims to resolve the long-standing issue of TikTok's ownership structure, which prompted legislation demanding ByteDance divest its U.S. operations.</p>

The reader struggles with ennui while witnessing national and global turmoil. Parker suggests she may be experiencing a form of survivor's guilt and advises her to embrace idleness and gentleness with herself, allowing the shape of her new life to emerge naturally. He frames this state of rest not as self-care but as a revolutionary act in a chaotic culture, arguing that people who can savor existence are needed.</p>

          <h2>Explaining the 6-Month Rule for Reverse Mortgages and Its Impact on Heirs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 12:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with a reverse mortgage, a critical but often overlooked guideline is the "6-month rule," which dictates the timeline for heirs after the borrower's death or permanent departure from the home. Once a qualifying event occurs, lenders issue a "Due and Payable" letter, giving the family six months to repay the loan balance, typically by selling the property or refinancing. This rule, applicable to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), underscores the need for borrowers to engage in careful estate planning to avoid forcing their heirs into a stressful, time-sensitive situation or potential foreclosure.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the lifting of travel restrictions for Hungarian citizens under the Visa Waiver Program, effective September 30. The move reverses limitations imposed by the Biden administration in 2021 and 2023 over security concerns related to Hungary's simplified naturalization process, which had granted citizenship to nearly a million people with inadequate vetting. The restrictions had reduced the validity of travel authorizations (ESTA) to one year and a single entry. The restoration to a two-year, multiple-entry validity signals warming diplomatic ties between the Trump administration and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government.</p>

          <p>Two years after a historic strike, the actors' union SAG-AFTRA has formally established a fund to distribute streaming revenue to a wider pool of performers. The "Success Distribution Fund," a key negotiation point, will collect 25% of bonuses generated when a high-budget streaming show meets specific viewership thresholds. This creates a secondary income stream for actors on popular shows and, for the first time, will also benefit stunt performers and background actors who meet a work-day minimum. The initiative, championed by outgoing president Fran Drescher, aims to make careers more sustainable in the streaming era where traditional syndication residuals are absent.</p>

A deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and silver-plated first-class trays from the vessel, which lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. The Britannic, originally a luxury liner, was serving as a hospital ship in World War I when it struck a mine and sank.

          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump's credible willingness to let TikTok "go dark" in the United States was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent stated that the commercial terms had been largely settled for months but were put on hold by China after Trump's tariff announcements. He explained that the President made it clear that national security would not be compromised for a deal, which ultimately "turned the tide" in negotiations. This pressure led to the current framework that aims to resolve the ownership and data security concerns surrounding the popular social media app.</p>
