          <p>The Defense Department is investing $400 million in MP Materials, which operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S. This move will make the Pentagon the company's largest shareholder and is aimed at expanding domestic processing and magnet production to reduce reliance on China for these critical components. The investment, which includes a price floor guarantee for ten years, caused the company's shares to surge significantly. The deal is part of a broader U.S. strategy to secure domestic supply chains for materials essential to defense and technology sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italian confectioner Ferrero has agreed to purchase cereal maker WK Kellogg in a $3.1 billion deal, causing WK Kellogg's stock to jump 30%. The acquisition reflects ongoing consolidation in the packaged foods industry, as many consumers shift away from sugary cereals towards healthier options or private-label brands. This move significantly expands Ferrero's footprint in the U.S. market, following several other North American acquisitions in recent years. WK Kellogg was spun off from Kellanova (formerly Kellogg) in 2023.</p>

          <p>At its recent seminar, OPEC ministers emphasized a pragmatic approach to the green transition, advocating for continued investment in hydrocarbons to ensure energy security while renewable sources scale up. The organization released its 2050 World Oil Outlook, projecting a significant increase in oil demand driven by developing nations and stressing the need for $18.2 trillion in global oil investments by 2050. Ministers also discussed short-term market stability and the dwindling spare production capacity, highlighting the urgency for new investment to prevent future supply shortages.</p>

          <p>North Carolina has been ranked as the top U.S. state for business, attributed to its strong economy, skilled workforce, and business-friendly policies. The state has attracted significant investments, including from companies like Amazon and JetZero, due to its robust GDP growth and net in-migration of college-educated workers. However, the report also highlights challenges, including a low ranking for quality of life and a lack of worker protections. The state also faces potential headwinds from federal budget cuts and the economic impact of Hurricane Helene.</p>

The article reflects on Dora's creation and cultural impact, noting she was introduced as a pan-Latina character during a time of political debate over bilingual education and a "Latin Boom" in pop culture. Creators and actors involved with the franchise discuss how Dora's problem-solving, bilingualism, and focus on exploring her own heritage empowered a generation of children.

          <p>Delta Air Lines' shares surged after the company reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and provided a stronger-than-expected forecast for summer travel. CEO Ed Bastian stated that while booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, demand has stabilized, particularly for premium seats and corporate travel. The airline's revenue from higher-priced cabins and its American Express partnership showed strong growth, offsetting a decline in main cabin sales. This positive report from the first major U.S. airline to release quarterly results has boosted confidence across the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The discussion now centers on whether Ukraine will be a partner, a testing ground, or a competitor, with possibilities including joint ventures and data-sharing agreements. This move could provide a crucial funding stream for Ukraine's own defense industry while bolstering European security.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva argues that abandoning globalization in response to current world crises would be a grave mistake. He contends that the international order is collapsing due to the trivialization of illegal force, the failure to address atrocities, and economic policies that deepen inequality. However, he asserts that the solution is not to "deplanetise" but to rebuild multilateralism on fairer, more inclusive foundations that reflect today's global realities. He calls for a renewed commitment to diplomacy to address shared challenges like poverty, war, and climate change.</p>

          <p>Economist Dean Spears, co-author of "After the Spike," argues that the world is heading towards an unprecedented population decline that could stifle human progress. While birth rates have been falling for centuries, the global population is projected to peak and then enter a continuous freefall, which Spears contends is not a solution to environmental problems. He makes the case that more people lead to more innovation, knowledge, and shared infrastructure, and that society should have a thoughtful conversation about creating conditions, such as greater gender equality, that make it easier for people to choose to have children.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen easily survived a no-confidence vote in the European Parliament, which was initiated by a far-right Romanian MEP. While the motion was defeated with 360 votes in her favor, the debate was used by center-left groups to voice grievances and secure policy commitments from her. The motion cited concerns over transparency in COVID-19 vaccine procurement, but von der Leyen's political partners used the opportunity to critique her perceived cooperation with the right and perceived backsliding on climate goals. The event highlights the fractured political landscape she must navigate in her second term.</p>

While the report focused on the J-15T's new, thicker landing gear, the presence of the more advanced stealth jets suggests progress in their development.

The study evaluated 150 cities based on 20 metrics including housing costs, job growth, and local amenities.
