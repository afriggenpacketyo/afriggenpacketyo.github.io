"AI & Me: The Confessional and AI Ego" allows viewers to be analyzed by AI, revealing their personality traits and goals. Other exhibits include immersive representations of culture and studies of media coverage of mass shootings, showing the emotional and technological depth of the festival.

          <p>Dave Ryding, Britain's most successful alpine ski racer, announced he will retire at the end of the 2025-26 season. Ryding, known as 'the Rocket,' made history in 2022 as the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold. He also secured the nation's best men's World Championship result since 1934 earlier this year, finishing sixth. The Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics will mark Ryding's fifth and final Games, and he aims to achieve as much as possible in his last year while his body remains in good condition. Ryding wants to retire while he is still competitive at the top of his sport.</p>

          <p>The White House attempted to clarify President Trump's earlier statement about using 'heavy force' against protesters at the military parade celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the president supports peaceful protests and the First Amendment, but not violence or assaulting law enforcement. Trump's initial comments followed his deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement, raising concerns about the potential for military intervention against demonstrators. Security measures have been increased around Washington in preparation for the parade, with approximately 6,700 soldiers participating and various military equipment on display.</p>

          <p>Chime, a provider of online banking services, priced its IPO at $27 per share, exceeding the expected range and valuing the company at $11.6 billion. The company raised roughly $700 million in the IPO, with existing investors selling an additional $165 million worth of shares. The stock is expected to begin trading on Thursday under the ticker symbol CHYM. This offering marks a significant event after a prolonged freeze in the fintech IPO market due to rising interest rates and valuation resets. The success of recent fintech IPOs, such as eToro and Circle, indicates a loosening of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of his social media posts about President Donald Trump, acknowledging that 'they went too far.' This comes after Trump expressed openness to reconciliation, noting that he was 'a little disappointed' about their public fallout but harbors 'no hard feelings.' The two had a public dispute after Musk stepped back from his White House role and criticized Trump's tax bill. Musk had previously claimed, without evidence, that Trump appeared in unreleased government files linked to Jeffrey Epstein, prompting Trump to criticize Musk and threaten to cancel government contracts. Musk has since deleted many of his posts, including one calling for Trump's impeachment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration can no longer detain Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil based on claims that he is a threat to US foreign policy. Judge Michael E Farbiarz stated that the ruling would take effect on Friday to allow for appellate review. Khalil, who has not been charged with a crime, had been detained since March after being deemed a threat by the Secretary of State. The judge noted that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged and his speech was being chilled, constituting irreparable harm. Khalil can still remain in custody based on claims that he inaccurately filled out his green card application.</p>

California has asked a federal court to block the government from using troops in LA outside of federal property, and the LA mayor expressed uncertainty about the Marines' role. Federal charges have been announced against individuals for possessing molotov cocktails during protests.</p>

Newsom's address tapped into our zeitgeist, calling the moment we‚Äôve feared has arrived. President Trump has put Marines and National Guardsmen on the streets of Los Angeles, and granted himself the power to put them anywhere. In calling it out, pointing out the danger of protesters turning violent and yet still calling for peaceful protest, Newsom has put Trump in a precarious position that the president may not have been expecting.

Bessent said the U.S. has 18 "important trading partners" and is "working toward deals" with those countries. Until now, Trump administration officials have not suggested that they are open to moving back the 90-day tariff pause without at least "terms of an agreement" before the pause expires.

The price drop is attributed to the receding effects of a years-long avian flu outbreak and easing demand for eggs during the summer months. While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, they remain elevated compared to 12 months ago. Experts note that containing avian flu is the primary factor, with wholesale egg prices beginning to decrease in March. (not investment advice)</p>
