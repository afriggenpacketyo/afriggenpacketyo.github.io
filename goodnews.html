          <p>On Thursday, thousands of TikTok users experienced an outage that interrupted their scrolling, with over 33,000 reports logged on Downdetector. The issues peaked around 4:30 p.m. EST before gradually easing an hour later. As of 6:15 p.m. EST, TikTok had not released a statement regarding the disruption on its main X accounts. The social media platform, which has surged in popularity due to the rise of influencer culture, is estimated to have over 2 billion users globally. The app's future in the U.S. has been uncertain due to a law signed by former President Biden, though President Trump has delayed its enforcement.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen delivered a forceful denunciation of President Trump during his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in Manchester, England, accusing the administration of trampling on civil rights, abandoning allies, and siding with dictators. Springsteen criticized the administration for inflicting pain on American workers, rolling back civil rights legislation, and defunding universities that don't align with their ideology. Despite his criticism, Springsteen expressed confidence that the America he has sung about for 50 years would survive this moment. This sharp critique stands out as other artists have seemingly muted their criticism of the president.</p>

          <p>Federal health officials are considering limiting COVID vaccine recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems due to new clinical testing requirements. The CDC's scientific advisors are debating a shift to a risk-based strategy, similar to practices in other countries. New requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of updated shots. The FDA has requested additional clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the necessity of the vaccine for children under 12. Experts fear these measures could undermine confidence in all vaccines.</p>

          <p>The Pakistan Air Force's use of Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets to shoot down Indian Rafale fighter jets serves as a milestone for China’s defense industry. This aerial fight may have been between the armed forces of Pakistan and India, but it was also the first round of a duel between Chinese and Western weapon systems. The Chinese defence industry has now become a hi-tech modern force developing sophisticated weapons of its own. China reportedly leads in developing and testing a fractional orbital bombardment system that uses a hypersonic glide vehicle on a low-Earth orbit to reach its target.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariff Easing Provides Limited Relief to Small Businesses</h2>

          <p>President Trump lowered his tariffs on China, and Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief. But for many businesses, especially small ones, 30 percent is still a crippling burden. Even Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States, said on Thursday that it would have to raise prices on some items in response to tariff-fueled cost increases. Smaller companies that rely on imports from China tend to have minimal leverage to negotiate with their Chinese suppliers — and relatively tight margins. Now, with the tariff rate down to 30 percent, Mr. Prior said he planned to restart manufacturing some of his most popular toys again and get them to the United States as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods is set to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to expand its reach and customer base. Dick's, the largest sports retail chain in the U.S., seeks to tap into Foot Locker's urban consumer base and exposure to basketball and sneaker culture. While Dick's investors reacted negatively due to Foot Locker's declining sales, the acquisition is expected to enhance the omnichannel experience for customers. The deal, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, is slated to close in the second half of the year.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed deals to create a 10-mile campus that would transform the United Arab Emirates into an A.I. powerhouse. The United States and the United Arab Emirates have signed an agreement that will help vault the Gulf country to become a rising power in artificial intelligence. The announcement came as President Trump visited a new A.I. campus in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, a site that will be supplied by American-made A.I. chips and constitute the largest such project outside of the United States. The UAE was “committed to safeguarding advanced A.I. technologies by implementing stringent measures to prevent diversion and ensure controlled access to technology.”</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are in negotiations to avert a strike, with a midnight deadline approaching. A strike would impact over 300,000 commuters. The union and NJ Transit are at odds over pay raises, with the union stating they haven't had a raise in five years. Gov. Phil Murphy may declare a state of emergency if the strike occurs. NJ Transit has a contingency plan, accommodating only 20% of daily riders, urging people to work from home.</p>

          <p>Disneyland Resort's new "World of Color Happiness!" show aims to create a party vibe, with festivities officially launching Friday. The new show is framed around throwing a house party. Those after some of that patented Disneyland nostalgia will find it in a short, five-minute projection show over on the facade of It’s a Small World, but even that production — “Tapestry of Happiness,” which ever-so-slightly glances at the artwork of key Small World designer Mary Blair — is a jovial affair. There is also a Muppets pre-show.</p>
