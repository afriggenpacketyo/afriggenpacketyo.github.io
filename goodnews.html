          <p>The 44th Great North Run, one of the world's largest half marathons, is taking place with approximately 60,000 runners participating. The 13.1-mile route from Newcastle to South Shields is lined with over 200,000 supporters cheering on the participants, many of whom are raising money for various charities. Event founder Sir Brendan Foster noted the event's growing popularity and a demographic shift towards younger runners and nearly equal gender participation. Celebrities such as fitness coach Joe Wicks and boxer Tommy Fury are among those running in the iconic North East event.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spain's La Liga has adopted a strategy of financial discipline, resulting in significantly lower transfer spending compared to England's Premier League. While English clubs spent over £3 billion, Spanish sides invested only £592 million, reflecting a conscious shift towards sustainability that began in 2013 with strict economic controls. This framework has successfully reduced club debt and professionalized the league, transforming it from financial chaos to a stable industry. Despite the reduced glamour, Spanish clubs remain highly competitive in European competitions, leveraging strong youth academies to produce top-tier talent and ensure long-term viability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The for-profit company Pray.com is generating both praise and controversy with its AI-generated video series, "The AI Bible," which visualizes biblical stories in a cinematic, action-oriented style. These videos have gained significant traction online, particularly with younger audiences, and the company views them as a modern way to engage people with scripture. However, some theologians are critical, arguing that the approach reduces the Bible to mere entertainment, stripping it of its spiritual depth and transformative power. The debate highlights the ongoing intersection of technology and faith, as evangelicals continue to experiment with new tools for outreach.</p>

          <h2>Total Lunar Eclipse to Create 'Blood Moon' Visible Across Parts of the UK</h2>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to occur, creating a 'Blood Moon' spectacle visible for many in the United Kingdom. The Moon will pass through Earth's shadow, taking on a deep red color due to the same light-scattering effect that causes red sunsets. While the full eclipse lasts from 18:30 to 19:52 BST, UK visibility will depend on local moonrise times, with eastern regions getting the best and longest view. Astronomers encourage the public to watch the event, which showcases the mechanics of the solar system and requires no special eye protection.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukaemia at 15, has been canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his passion for technology, Acutis created websites to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname 'God's influencer'. His canonization was fast-tracked by the Vatican in an effort to connect with and inspire young people. The church where he was baptized in Chelsea, London, has become a pilgrimage site, housing a relic of his hair and celebrating his modern approach to faith.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has successfully concluded negotiations with the United States to secure the release of its citizens detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. According to the president's chief of staff, a chartered flight will be arranged to bring the workers home once administrative procedures are finalized. The raid, which saw over 300 South Korean nationals detained, had caused significant concern in Seoul and was widely described as a 'shock' by local media. The government is also working to improve the visa system to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber who was on the FBI's most wanted list for 21 years, is facing an extradition hearing in London. He is accused of planting bombs in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, with an animal rights extremist group claiming responsibility. After a high-speed chase in 2003, he vanished, leaving behind what agents described as a 'bomb-making lab' in his car. San Diego was discovered last year living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales and now faces being sent back to the U.S. to stand trial.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a former FBI Most Wanted fugitive, is scheduled for an extradition hearing in the UK after being on the run for 21 years. He is the prime suspect in two 2003 bombings in California linked to an animal rights extremist group. San Diego was captured in Wales in 2024 after evading law enforcement since a dramatic escape in San Francisco. Former FBI agents involved in the original surveillance suggest there were missed opportunities to arrest him before he disappeared. If extradited, he will face trial in the United States for the attacks.</p>
