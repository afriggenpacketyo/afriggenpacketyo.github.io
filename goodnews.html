          <p>Leaders in the sports betting industry are forecasting unprecedented levels of wagering for the upcoming NFL season, citing strong momentum and resilient consumer spending. CEOs from DraftKings and BetMGM reported record numbers and significant growth in pre-season activity, suggesting the sector is behaving in a contrarian manner amid broader economic concerns. The American Gaming Association projects that legal betting in the U.S. will increase by 8.5% to $30 billion this season. The industry is also navigating the emergence of new competition from sports prediction markets, which operate similarly to stock trading.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has significantly expanded its Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) tool, which now provides flood forecast visualizations for areas covering 60% of the U.S. population. This interactive online tool offers near real-time, neighborhood-level projections of floodwaters, aiming to improve communication between forecasters, emergency managers, and the public. The expansion now includes regions in the Great Plains, Southeast, and West Coast, as well as Hawaii and parts of Alaska. The system has already proven effective in facilitating timely evacuations, and it is expected to be fully operational nationwide by next year.</p>

          <p>Jessie Lovette, a 78-year-old woman from Miami Gardens, has finally obtained her birth certificate after living her entire life without official proof of her birth. Born at home in Georgia during the segregation era, she never received the document, which created significant challenges, especially with the implementation of the federal Real ID law. With the help of her son, Derrick, and aided by local media coverage that accelerated the process, Lovette was able to legally prove her existence. Now in possession of her Real ID, she and her family are looking forward to new opportunities, including international travel.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated that the UK government is considering the implementation of a digital ID program as a measure to tackle illegal immigration and employment. Starmer suggested that such a system could play an "important part" in reducing incentives for unauthorized entry into the country. He acknowledged that public perception has evolved since the controversial physical ID card scheme was scrapped over a decade ago, noting that people are more accustomed to digital forms of identification today. Officials are reportedly examining how a digital ID could streamline right-to-work checks and reduce the use of fraudulent documents.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage in the United States has fallen to 6.5%, marking its lowest point since October of the previous year. This continued decline in borrowing costs, reported by Freddie Mac, is expected to increase purchasing power for prospective homebuyers. The trend is largely attributed to growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming policy meeting. While the Fed's rate does not directly set mortgage rates, its actions significantly influence the bond market, which lenders use to price home loans. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the idea of transforming anxiety from a debilitating condition into a source of personal growth and adventure, drawing on the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard. While acknowledging that anxiety disorders are a serious mental health issue, the author argues that managed anxiety can be beneficial, raising performance and promoting self-knowledge. Research suggests that moderate levels of anxiety can lead to peak performance states known as "flow." The article proposes a two-step approach: first, accepting anxiety as a normal alert system, and second, reframing the physiological response not as dread, but as evidence of an exciting opportunity.</p>
