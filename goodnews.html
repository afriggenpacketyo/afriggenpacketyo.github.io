          <p>President Trump is considering nearly a dozen candidates to replace Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve chair, each with distinct ideas for the central bank's direction. Many potential nominees, including former officials and market strategists, have publicly advocated for lowering the Fed's benchmark interest rate. The candidates' views range from calls for aggressive rate cuts and fundamental "regime change" to concerns about a lack of transparency and intellectual diversity in the Federal Open Market Committee's decision-making process.

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" is critiqued in this article for concluding a show that often seemed hostile towards its own characters and source material. The review argues that while the original "Sex and the City" explored the indignities of single life, the sequel devolved into a cringe comedy fixated on the physical humiliations of aging. The finale reinforces the show's perceived squeamishness about physicality and its disconnect from the realities of life for anyone outside the characters' bubble of extreme wealth.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake worth approximately $1.6 billion in the embattled health insurer UnitedHealth. The investment is notable given UnitedHealth's stock has fallen significantly in 2025 amid public criticism over healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices. The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in underperforming companies, and the disclosure caused UnitedHealth's stock to rise sharply in after-hours trading.

          <p>The apartment market is undergoing a technological revolution as artificial intelligence takes over tasks traditionally handled by landlords and property managers. AI-powered systems are now managing work orders, lease renewals, virtual tours for prospective tenants, and even investor due diligence for property acquisitions. While the technology is still in its early stages and fragmented among various vendors, it represents a significant shift towards more efficient, centralized operations for large multifamily property owners.</p>

          <p>This personal essay from the L.A. Affairs series details the author's experience entering a whirlwind romance with a French animator shortly after her husband left her for a movie star. The relationship initially felt like a perfect, effortless escape from her past heartbreak, filled with romantic trips and adventures across Los Angeles. However, she gradually realized she was ignoring significant red flags, ultimately concluding that her new partner was a "tourist to her heart" and not seeking the committed partnership she desired.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Temasek and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) have recently modified their investments in Chinese stocks, reducing exposure to the technology sector while increasing stakes in consumer companies. The PIF completely divested its shares in tech giant Alibaba, while Temasek's overall portfolio value of US-traded Chinese stocks decreased by over a third. These adjustments reflect a broader trend among large institutional investors reacting to market volatility and ongoing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein saw its UK sales surge by a third to £2 billion in 2024, leading to a 57% increase in profits. The company's success is built on low prices and aggressive marketing, though it acknowledges that future sales could be affected by inflation and cost-of-living pressures. Shein's business model could also face challenges from a potential UK government review of tax exemptions for low-value imported packages, a policy change that has already led to price increases in the US.

With maximum sustained winds currently at 70 mph, the storm is forecast to potentially strengthen into a major hurricane by the weekend. While it is projected to move near or north of the Leeward Islands, current models suggest Erin does not pose a direct threat to the United States mainland as it is expected to curve north into the open ocean.</p>

          <p>A former senior Chinese economic official has advised the government to stimulate consumption by removing purchase restrictions on items like property and vehicles. Yin Yanlin, formerly of a key party economic body, argued that encouraging affluent groups to spend would drive market demand and create a positive economic cycle. He noted that income levels are not the primary barrier to spending, pointing to the country's rapidly rising household savings rate as evidence that constrained demand, not a lack of funds, is the issue.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airlines are finding that traditional summer travel demand is changing, with peak periods shifting earlier in the season and becoming less predictable. Factors like earlier school start dates and travelers avoiding Europe's summer heat are causing demand to taper off in August, forcing carriers to be more strategic with their flight schedules. In response to these evolving patterns and higher operating costs, airlines are reducing capacity, which is expected to lead to higher airfares for consumers during the late summer months.</p>

          <p>A Reddit post has gone viral after a shopper at a Goodwill store shared photos of secondhand knick-knacks being sold at unusually high prices. The post sparked a discussion about a perceived trend of thrift stores raising prices as secondhand shopping grows in popularity, driven by younger, environmentally-conscious consumers and rising costs for new goods. While thrifting helps reduce fashion industry waste, some commenters expressed frustration that the appeal of affordability, a core tenet of thrift shopping, is being eroded.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has written to the Prime Minister requesting the ability to appoint peers to the House of Lords. Farage argues that his party's significant vote share in the last general election and recent local election successes create a "democratic disparity" in the upper chamber, where they have no representation. While appointments are at the prime minister's discretion, the request highlights Reform's growing influence and its challenge to the traditional political establishment.</p>
