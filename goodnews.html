        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its AI model, Claude, constitutes "fair use" and is "transformative." The judge stated that Anthropic's large language models do not reproduce the creative elements or expressive style of individual authors. This decision is a significant victory for AI companies facing legal battles over the use of copyrighted material in AI development and training. The ruling begins to establish legal boundaries for the AI industry regarding the use of copyrighted works. The judge likened the AI's learning process to that of a reader aspiring to become a writer. </p>

          <p>Beginner gold investors should consider strategic decisions before investing, given gold's role as an income protector rather than producer. As July 2025 approaches, potential investors should decide whether to wait for a price drop, determine how much of their portfolio to allocate to gold, and assess their portfolio's specific needs. Investors should consider speaking with a financial advisor to determine the right amount of gold for their portfolio. Gold can serve as a portfolio diversifier and inflation hedge, but its suitability depends on individual goals and current market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>
