          <p>American tennis player Coco Gauff has advanced to the fourth round of the US Open for the fourth consecutive year after a convincing 6-3, 6-1 victory over Magdalena Frech. After two tense opening matches and a recent coaching change to address serving issues, Gauff displayed a more settled and confident performance, landing nearly 80% of her first serves in the opening set. The 21-year-old, who already has two major titles, showed improved rhythm and attacked decisively from the baseline. Her next match will be against either Daria Kasatkina or two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka, promising a tougher challenge in the second week.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has increased its offer for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi to £35 million, now including a 10% sell-on clause. Crystal Palace has countered, seeking the £35 million plus an additional £5 million in bonuses, with negotiations between the two clubs ongoing ahead of the transfer deadline. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, and Palace is reluctant to let him leave on a free transfer when his current deal expires next summer. Palace is also actively trying to sign two new central defenders, which could facilitate Guehi's potential move to Liverpool.</p>

The item, with a pre-sale estimate of $3 million, was authenticated by Propstore, the event's host, after its owner made an unsolicited call to the company. The prop is made from a real camera flash component with plastic strips added, a detail that helped confirm its authenticity. The auction, which will be held in Los Angeles, also includes Indiana Jones's bullwhip and the cursed medallion from "Pirates of the Caribbean," with some items starting at just $200.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared that the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem is over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the city's detection and response capabilities, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters of the disease.</p>

          <p>Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, recently described his experience with wealth accumulation, stating that after taking a decade to earn his first million dollars, money began to come in much more easily. He claims he can now earn as much as $5 million in a single week, attributing the phenomenon to compound growth once a certain financial threshold is crossed. Portnoy famously sold Barstool Sports to Penn Entertainment in a deal valued around $500 million, only to buy it back for $1 as part of a deal that allowed Penn to launch ESPN Bet. Since reacquiring the company, he has secured new content deals with Fox Sports.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:50:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence that can help detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. The device records an ECG and analyzes heart sounds that are undetectable by the human ear, sending the data to the cloud for AI analysis. A large study involving over 200 GP surgeries in London found that patients examined with the AI stethoscope were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with these conditions. The British Heart Foundation has called the tool a potential "game-changer" for enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment, with plans to roll it out further across the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, is reviewed as a well-crafted and diverting homage to the 1984 Troma cult film. While the original was known for its gleeful tackiness and bad taste, this version is noted for its competent filmmaking and appealing cast, including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood. The story updates the premise, with Dinklage playing a janitor who, after being transformed by toxic waste, becomes a community hero by taking on a villainous pharmaceutical company. The review suggests that while the film is rude and violent, its polished nature makes it a more accessible, if less authentically trashy, tribute.</p>

          <p>Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo presented "Sarabande Africaine," a collaborative performance at the Hollywood Bowl that explored the African roots of Baroque music. The show highlighted how the rhythmic patterns of the sarabande, a key movement in Bach's cello suites, originated in dances of enslaved Africans brought to Spain. The concert featured a blend of classical pieces by Bach and Handel with traditional African music and unique interpretations of works by Gershwin, Ravel, and Philip Glass. The review praises the engaging performance, noting the powerful stage presence of Kidjo and the sensitive, integrated playing of Ma.</p>

          <p>Declining water levels at Iraq's largest reservoir, the Mosul Dam, have revealed approximately 40 ancient tombs believed to be over 2,300 years old. The discovery was made by archaeologists in the Duhok province after a severe, multi-year drought lowered the water to a point where excavation became possible. The tombs are thought to date to the Hellenistic or Seleucid period. While the drought has had devastating impacts on agriculture and electricity, it has created an opportunity for archaeological work. The team is now working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is submerged again.</p>
