          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated approximately 20,000 people as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs discovered in the city center. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in Cologne, involved closing off a large area including the old city, hotels, care homes, and Rhine bridges. Cologne was a frequent target for Allied bombing during the war, making the discovery of such ordnance a common occurrence. The bombs, manufactured in the US, included two 200-pound bombs and one 100-pound bomb.</p>
