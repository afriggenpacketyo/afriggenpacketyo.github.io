          <p>Australians headed to the polls amidst economic anxieties and a changing global order influenced by the Trump administration. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, overshadowing broader issues like relations with the United States and China. Both major parties have offered limited solutions to these economic pressures, leading to voter dissatisfaction and a shift towards independent candidates and minor parties. The article notes the opposition leader's adoption of Trump-like rhetoric initially resonated but later proved detrimental as the Trump presidency unfolded. Optimism Score: 65</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies effective against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes. The article notes that this could be a significant step towards a universal antivenom, addressing the global issue of snakebites that cause up to 140,000 deaths annually. The research, published in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that could target multiple classes of neurotoxins. Optimism Score: 85</p>
