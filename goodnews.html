          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. hit 2.3% in April, which is the lowest since February 2021, according to a Labor Department report. This figure was slightly below economists' expectations. The consumer price index rose 0.2% for the month, while the core CPI, excluding food and energy, also increased by 0.2%. Shelter prices were a main driver in pushing up the inflation gauge, and markets reacted little to the news. However, analysts warn that President Trump's tariffs could upend the picture in coming months, potentially leading to a surge in consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. inflation cooled slightly in April, but economists warn that President Trump's trade war could cause a resurgence in consumer prices. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.3% from a year earlier, the slowest annual pace since early 2021. While recent tariff reductions with China have eased concerns, economists still anticipate that the scope and scale of the tariffs will eventually stoke inflation while simultaneously denting growth. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation and has put interest rate cuts on hold until they gain more clarity about the economic impact of Mr. Trump‚Äôs policies.</p>

          <p>A federal court is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Donald Trump's tariffs, questioning whether he exceeded his power in enacting tariffs on over 180 countries. Five domestic businesses argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the president to issue sweeping duties. They claim that trade deficits do not constitute a national emergency. The Department of Justice maintains that the law clearly authorizes the president to impose tariffs. The outcome of the case could significantly limit Trump's ability to unilaterally impose import taxes.</p>

Republicans plan to focus on Democrats' legislative shortcomings on issues such as taxes, crime, and education through digital ad campaigns, rather than defending the Trump administration's actions. The RSLC also intends to push robust absentee ballot and early voting initiatives.

While the report covers April, businesses are still assessing the impact of the tariffs. Trump has rolled back most of the tariffs he announced in early April, but imports from China face a 30% levy, and most other US imports still face a 10% levy. Consumer sentiment dropped sharply in April, and expectations of inflation rose. Economists expect price increases to worsen this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended Prime Minister Keir Starmer's language in a speech unveiling plans to cut immigration, where he said the UK risked becoming an "island of strangers" without stricter controls. Some Labour MPs accused him of divisive language, a claim Cooper rejected. She said the PM was highlighting the impact of rising migration and supporting integration, including English language tests. Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick echoed the prime minister's comments, adding Sir Keir's warning the UK could become an island of strangers was "already" true in parts of the country.</p>

          <h2>NYT: Trump's China Tariff Rollback</h2>

          <p>President Trump's administration cut its China tariffs from 145 percent to 30 percent for at least a few months, with China reciprocating by lowering its retaliatory levies. This action suggests that America needs other countries' trade as much as they need ours, diminishing Trump‚Äôs negotiating position. The move comes after retailers warned that prices would rise and shelves would go empty due to the tariffs. While the pause is temporary, tariffs remain much higher than before Trump‚Äôs second term, potentially leading to higher prices on various goods.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing what is currently the driest spring on record, according to the Met Office. Despite some areas experiencing heavy showers and thunderstorms, the warm and dry weather has been dominant. The mostly dry weather is expected to continue across the UK for at least another 10 days. The Environment Agency has indicated that while reservoirs are currently fairly healthy, there is a "medium" risk of a summer drought.</p>
