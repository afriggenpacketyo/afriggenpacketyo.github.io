          <p>Finland has been named the world's happiest country for eight consecutive years, a distinction that many Finns find perplexing. The World Happiness Report measures life satisfaction and contentment, not daily expressions of joy, which aligns with Finnish culture. Key factors contributing to this ranking include a robust social safety net, extensive and free public services like state-of-the-art libraries, and a deep cultural connection to nature. Citizens generally accept higher taxes as a fair price for a society that provides security and equal opportunities for personal fulfillment.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó has characterized the current relationship between Hungary and the United States as a "golden age," citing close alignment with the Trump administration on key political issues. In an interview, Szijjártó contrasted this with the "hostile approach" of the previous Democratic administration and highlighted Hungary's decision to follow the U.S. in designating Antifa as a terrorist organization. He also affirmed Hungary's support for President Trump's calls for increased NATO defense spending and positioned Trump as the best hope for achieving peace in the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their third World Cup title with a dominant 33-13 victory over Canada at Twickenham. Playing in front of a record crowd of 81,885, England extended their historic winning streak to 33 games. After conceding an early try, England responded with a sensational solo score from Ellie Kildunne and controlled the match with their powerful forward play and staunch defense. The victory marks their first world championship since 2014 and avenges their loss to New Zealand in the previous final three years ago.</p>

          <p>Beyond their on-field dominance, England's Women's Rugby World Cup victory was built on a foundation of strong team culture and unity. The squad made a conscious effort to foster an inclusive and supportive environment, a contrast to some players' negative experiences during the previous campaign. Team-bonding activities, such as movie nights and themed dinners, were scheduled to alleviate the pressures of the tournament. Players also engaged in personal routines like getting commemorative tattoos and keeping scrapbooks, helping to maintain morale and focus on their mantra to "be where our feet are."</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that an Israeli-supplied Patriot air defense system has been operational in Ukraine for the past month. He also stated that two additional Patriot systems are expected to arrive this fall. This development is notable given Israel's historically cautious position on providing military aid to Ukraine, as it has sought to maintain relations with Russia. The announcement was part of a broader update where Zelenskyy also detailed a significant new arms deal with the United States and criticized recent Hungarian drone activity over Ukrainian territory.</p>

Despite the company's calm response, BYD's shares fell over 6% in Hong Kong following the news. The divestment comes as BYD faces signs of cooling growth, including a recent quarterly profit decline.

          <p>Anson Funds, an activist investment firm, is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO), a major out-of-home advertising company. This move follows a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners in 2023, which prompted CCO to divest its European and Latin American assets to become a U.S. pure-play. Despite these changes, CCO's stock has underperformed its peers, and Anson believes a sale is the best path forward for shareholders. Potential acquirers could include competitors like JCDecaux and Lamar, as well as private equity firms showing increased interest in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts advise that interracial couples can build stronger relationships by proactively engaging in essential conversations about their cultural and racial differences. Key topics include openly discussing these differences to understand how they affect the relationship's power dynamics, and intentionally co-creating a new, blended family culture that respects both partners' backgrounds. Couples should also develop strategies for compromise when cultural practices conflict and establish a united front for supporting each other when facing biases from family or the community. These ongoing discussions are vital for navigating the unique challenges and joys of an interracial partnership.</p>
