This article suggests Takaichi's approach could deepen "friendshoring" strategies in Southeast Asia, but with a greater emphasis on national security over mutual development.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at strengthening the California FAIR Plan, the state's property insurer of last resort, which faced significant losses from recent wildfires. The legislation seeks to ease the FAIR Plan's financial strain and increase legislative oversight, addressing issues highlighted by its $4 billion in losses from the Palisades and Eaton fires. This article notes that the new laws enable the issuance of bonds for catastrophic claims and require greater transparency. The reforms are crucial for stabilizing the insurance market amid escalating climate-fueled firestorms.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 576 into law, prohibiting streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video from playing commercials significantly louder than their programming. This article explains that the legislation closes a loophole, as federal laws regulating TV ad volumes did not apply to streaming. The bill was inspired by new parents frustrated by ads waking their baby, gaining unanimous support in the state Senate despite opposition from the Motion Picture Association. The law, effective July 1, 2026, is expected to influence national standards due to California's market size.</p>

This article highlights that the dolphin-sized creature, which swam 185 million years ago, is the only known example of its kind, filling a significant gap in ichthyosaur evolution. Scientists note unique features, including a prong-like bone near its nostril and evidence of serious injury or disease. Marks on its skull suggest it may have been killed by a larger ichthyosaur, illustrating the dangers of Mesozoic oceans.</p>
