          <p>England defeated the West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, securing a series victory with a game to spare. Jos Buttler and Harry Brook contributed with the bat, but Jacob Bethell's explosive cameo and Tom Banton's late hitting sealed the win for England. West Indies posted a challenging total of 197, but England's aggressive batting approach proved too much for the tourists. The series concludes at Southampton, offering West Indies a chance to salvage some pride.</p>
