          <p>This article discusses the renewed global interest in returning to the moon, nearly six decades after the first human landing. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole, while China and Russia plan to build the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, which could be used for lunar bases and potentially transported back to Earth. Scientific research on the moon aims to make space travel safer, understand lunar environments, and develop technologies that benefit both lunar missions and life on Earth.</p>

          <p>Subsidising men‚Äôs participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, according to a new study, offering a fresh approach to deepening demographic challenges in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong (HKU), argued that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidising mothers. The study, which analysed data from 23 countries, also found that traditional expectations that place the burden on women to perform most childcare duties persist in China and other East Asian countries, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>UCLA's baseball team secured a 5-2 victory against Texas San Antonio in Game 1 of the Super Regional, bringing them one step closer to the College World Series. Despite an early lead by UTSA, UCLA's offense rallied with key hits and a strong defensive performance. Pitcher Michael Barnett delivered six solid innings, and Roman Martin's two-RBI triple in the eighth inning sealed the win for the Bruins. UCLA is now one win away from their first trip to Omaha since 2013.</p>

          <p>Ten years have passed since President Xi Jinping unveiled a plan to make China a ‚Äúworld football superpower‚Äù by 2050. China has not missed all its yardsticks, though. Official data shows that tens of thousands of pitches have been added over the decade, while football courses have been introduced to all kinds of schools across the nation. Thanks to these moves, grass-roots football tournaments in several areas have become a cultural sensation, boosting morale and cementing unity at a difficult time of US-China rivalry.</p>
