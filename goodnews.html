          <h2>Ancient Chinese Wisdom Helps Decode Yeast Cell Life Cycles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 00:00:08 EDT</div>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. The study, led by Professor Li Lei, redefines the understanding of metabolic phases in yeast, reorganizing it into four distinct yet interconnected phases. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine, reflecting a balance between passive and active forces. This research provides new insights into the molecular life mechanisms of this single-celled eukaryote.</p>

          <p>Voting is underway in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, seen as a key indicator for the upcoming House of Councillors race. With no single party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party is aiming to retain its seats despite low approval ratings. Major parties are actively using social media and street speeches to appeal to voters on issues such as inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies. The election is also notable for the participation of a new party launched by Shinji Ishimaru, who gained prominence in the 2024 Tokyo gubernatorial race.</p>

New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original verdict. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, Dorotik secured new DNA testing and a fresh examination of other evidence, which altered the course of the case.
