Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, serving as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina. This breakthrough offers significant promise for treating human blindness, with scientists optimistic about its potential to improve vision.

The research, co-authored by Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than subsidizing mothers alone. This innovative policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce. The study also notes that traditional expectations placing the burden on women persist in China, conflicting with economic changes.</p>
