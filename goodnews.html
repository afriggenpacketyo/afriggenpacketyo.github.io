          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler has taken a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final round of The Open Championship at Royal Portrush. Demonstrating remarkable consistency with a third-round 67, he sits at 14 under par, reinforcing the perception of his inevitable victory. His closest competitor is Li Haotong, while others like Matt Fitzpatrick and Rory McIlroy face a significant deficit. Scheffler's unflappable performance draws comparisons to Tiger Woods' era of dominance, positioning him for a fourth major title.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 15:41:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy towards stronger European cooperation, particularly with France and the United Kingdom, forming a trio known as the "E3." This strategic shift, highlighted by a new bilateral treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over the United States' commitment to NATO under a potential Trump presidency. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has emphasized the need for Europe to become more self-reliant in defense, viewing the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK as a potential supplement to the US security guarantee. This move aims to bolster European sovereignty while navigating complex relations with allies like Poland and the US.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler holds a commanding four-shot lead at The Open after a solid third round, positioning himself at 14-under par. While Scheffler played a steady, bogey-free round, other contenders like Rory McIlroy provided early excitement with a charge that energized the home crowd, ultimately finishing six shots back. England's Matt Fitzpatrick and China's Li Haotong remain in the hunt but face a difficult challenge in catching the dominant world number one. Scheffler's performance suggests he is on track to secure the third leg of the career Grand Slam at Royal Portrush.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to securing a loan move to Barcelona after falling out of favor at his home club. The 27-year-old has not played for United since December and was told to train separately after expressing his desire to leave. For Barcelona, the loan deal with an option to buy presents a low-risk opportunity to strengthen their attack after failing to sign other targets. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, Barcelona is betting on his potential to rediscover his top-level performance and become a key asset in La Liga and the Champions League.</p>

          <p>Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, sold an additional 75,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $12.94 million. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares. The sale follows a previous divestment of about $37 million worth of shares earlier in the week. Nvidia's stock has surged dramatically due to high demand for its AI-powering GPUs, pushing its market capitalization over $4 trillion and making it the world's most valuable company.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated Australia 27-19 in a hard-fought first Test, with flankers Tom Curry and Tadhg Beirne delivering "immense" performances. Curry, responding to recent criticism, was a dominant physical force, scoring a try and setting a powerful tone from the start. The Lions built a commanding 24-5 lead early in the second half before a drop-off in discipline allowed the Wallabies to narrow the gap. Despite the late-game lapse, the Lions' strong start and defensive prowess secured a crucial victory as they head into the second match of the series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of young, college-aged Christian activists from the organization Generation Life spent a weekend on the Jersey Shore promoting a message of chastity. Engaging with beachgoers, they sought to redefine chastity not merely as abstinence but as a way to foster deeper, non-transactional relationships in an age dominated by social media. The activists, often framing their message as a "countercultural" response to modern dating pressures, found a mixed reception. Their outreach highlights a generational effort to adapt a traditional religious message for Gen Z, a cohort grappling with the effects of technology on intimacy and relationships.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than initially anticipated. Though first expected to miss six weeks, Muncy is already running, playing catch, and taking swings, with manager Dave Roberts suggesting a return "a lot sooner than anticipated." The injury, sustained in a slide at third base, fortunately avoided major ligament damage. Muncy's return is crucial for the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled significantly in his absence, averaging less than three runs per game and slumping to a 3-8 record since he was sidelined.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, Great Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m relay team has been awarded their world championship gold medals. The team, consisting of Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton, was upgraded from silver after the US team was disqualified. The disqualification came after American sprinter Antonio Pettigrew confessed in 2008 to doping during that period. The belated medal ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting, where the athletes received a rousing ovation from the home crowd in a moment of long-awaited justice.</p>
