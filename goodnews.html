          <p>Meta AI users can now adjust their privacy settings to prevent their prompts from being shared publicly on Facebook and Instagram. The Meta AI app, launched in April, has faced criticism due to some users' prompts being unintentionally shared, raising privacy concerns. To protect their privacy, users can access the 'data and privacy' section in their profile settings and disable the 'suggesting your prompts on other apps' feature for Facebook and Instagram. Additionally, users can manage their information and make all public prompts visible only to themselves, as well as delete their prompt history. The company has invested heavily in AI to compete with other tech companies and bolster its AI strategy. The app is meant to offer inspiration and AI hacks to users.</p>

          <p>President Trump is hosting a parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, marking the first major military parade in Washington, D.C., in over three decades. While military parades have occurred throughout U.S. history, they are not common, typically celebrating the end of a war or the return of military personnel. Past parades include those marking the end of the Gulf War, presidential inaugural parades, and celebrations of victory in World Wars I and II. The event has drawn criticism, with some calling it wasteful and self-aggrandizing, while the White House defends it as a tribute to the service of those who have worn the uniform.</p>
