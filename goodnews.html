          <p>Researchers in China have developed a groundbreaking genomic tool named "Uni-C," which holds immense promise for transforming the early detection and personalized treatment of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of the disease. This innovative single-cell "multiomics" technology can conduct an entire DNA analysis in less than a day, achieving accuracy comparable to traditional biopsies. The method simultaneously decodes crucial genomic information from rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) found in the bloodstream. This article highlights Uni-C's potential to provide unprecedented insights for early screening, monitoring, and tailored immunotherapy, addressing a critical need in cancer diagnostics.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and primary assembler of Apple's iPhones, reported a robust 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, significantly surpassing analyst forecasts. This impressive growth is largely attributed to the burgeoning demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) server business, which for the first time contributed the largest share of its revenues at 41%. This article highlights Foxconn's successful diversification into AI workloads, establishing it as a key partner to Nvidia. Despite potential impacts from US President Donald Trump's global tariffs, the company projects continued strong growth in its AI server segment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, according to preliminary estimates from the Office for National Statistics. This growth, primarily driven by the services sector and an increase in construction activity, surpassed Reuters economists' modest forecasts of 0.1%. While the Chancellor welcomed the positive figures, economists caution that this momentum is unlikely to sustain into the third quarter due to a weak global economy, the full impact of April's tax rises, and ongoing consumer caution. This article notes that the Bank of England recently cut interest rates to 4% amidst efforts to balance inflation with a softening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has rejected a 30 million won (approximately $21,600) copyright infringement claim against SmartStudy, the company behind the global children's hit "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that the 2015 viral song copied his 2011 rendition. However, this article reports that the court upheld earlier rulings, determining that Wright's version lacked sufficient originality to qualify for protection, as both songs are based on a traditional melody popular at US summer camps. The decision confirms that "Baby Shark," which boasts over 16 billion views on YouTube, is considered to be in the public domain.</p>

While some employees prefer to keep these arrangements private, many companies are increasingly accepting of the practice, provided business objectives are met and personal expenses are clearly separated.
