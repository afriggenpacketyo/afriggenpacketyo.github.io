          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases, including several terms popularized by Gen Z and Gen Alpha on social media. Among the new entries are "skibidi," a nonsense word from a viral YouTube series, "delulu," short for delusional, and "tradwife," describing women embracing traditional gender roles online. Lexicographers noted that these additions reflect the significant impact of internet culture on the evolution of the English language. Other new terms include "lewk" for a distinctive fashion look and "mouse jiggler" for a device used to feign activity while working remotely.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and indices in Hong Kong and mainland China saw gains, while South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline. The mixed results reflect a cautious market sentiment, influenced by geopolitical events and regional economic data, such as Singapore's unexpected contraction in non-oil domestic exports. U.S. equity futures also ticked higher, following a strong week on Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a special U.S. envoy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has conceded to allowing the United States and its European allies to provide Ukraine with security guarantees similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. This development, described as a "game-changer," emerged from recent talks and represents a significant potential shift in Russia's long-standing opposition to such alliances for Ukraine. While European leaders have welcomed the move as a positive step toward a peace deal, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has cautiously noted that the specific details of how these guarantees would function remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Australia's Federal Court has imposed a A$90 million ($58.64 million) fine on Qantas Airways for illegally terminating 1,800 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and replacing them with contractors. The judge stated the significant penalty was intended to serve as a strong deterrent against large corporations viewing such contraventions as a mere cost of doing business. The case was brought by the Transport Workers' Union, which will receive A$50 million of the penalty on behalf of the fired employees. This ruling follows a separate A$120 million settlement Qantas previously agreed to with the union for the affected workers.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed actor Dame Helen Mirren has asserted that the iconic role of James Bond should continue to be played by a man. Despite identifying as a feminist, Mirren believes changing the character's gender would fundamentally alter the franchise into something else entirely. Her sentiment was echoed by former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who also expressed his belief that a male actor should portray the spy. This public discussion comes as Amazon MGM Studios prepares for the 26th film in the series, with plans for a "fresh" take that still honors the character's legacy.</p>

          <p>A growing movement to reconnect with African heritage is gaining momentum across the Caribbean, manifesting in cultural, social, and economic spheres. This renewed pan-Africanism is visible in the rising popularity of African food, music like Afrobeats, and increased travel from the Caribbean to the continent. Governments and institutions from both regions are also fostering stronger economic links, with organizations like Afreximbank projecting a potential surge in trade. Leaders have even proposed creating direct air and sea routes and a shared digital currency to overcome logistical barriers and deepen the historic connection.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming White House Talks Seen as Critical for Ukraine's Future Security</h2>

          <p>An upcoming meeting at the White House involving Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, President Trump, and European leaders is being framed as potentially more decisive for Ukraine's future than the recent U.S.-Russia summit. Analysts suggest the European contingent aims to present a united front to ensure Ukraine's direct involvement in any peace negotiations and secure concrete security guarantees. The talks follow reports that Russia may be open to Article 5-style security protections for Ukraine, a proposal that trades some occupied land for guarantees against future aggression. The central challenge remains whether Ukraine could accept a deal that involves ceding territory.</p>

          <p>At the age of 24, Coline Aguirre from France purchased a 100-year-old traditional farmhouse, or "kominka," in the Japanese countryside, fulfilling a dream she had since a high school exchange trip. She moved to Japan alone to undertake the restoration, teaching herself DIY skills to preserve the home's historic character while modernizing key elements like the plumbing. Aguirre is part of a growing trend of foreigners relocating to Japan, drawn by the affordability of rural properties and the appeal of renovating abandoned homes. She has since started her own real-estate consultancy to help others find similar properties.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler secured victory at the BMW Championship, overcoming a four-shot deficit to defeat Scotland's Robert MacIntyre. MacIntyre, who had led overnight, had a difficult final round with a score of three-over-par 73, starting with consecutive bogeys. Scheffler remained composed, carding a three-under 67, highlighted by a decisive chip-in on the 17th hole to finish two strokes clear. MacIntyre expressed deep frustration with his performance, particularly with his inability to control his shot distances during the crucial final day of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing deals. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent, reflecting a strategic shift from generic drugs to more profitable innovative medicines. This transition is expected to continue, with generics projected to form a much smaller portion of the company's revenue in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the United Kingdom is at a strategic crossroads as it holds a leadership election, debating whether to adopt a more aggressive, "eco-populist" approach or continue its current moderate strategy.

The contest comes after the party achieved a record four seats in Parliament, prompting a discussion on how to best capitalize on its growing support.</p>

The discussions involved high-level officials from both nations, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s Vice-Premier He Lifeng.
