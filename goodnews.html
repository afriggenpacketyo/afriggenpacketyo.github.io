          <p>A new documentary, “It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley,” provides an intimate and honest look at the life of the musician who died in 1997 at age 30. Director Amy Berg moves beyond the narrative of a doomed artist, focusing instead on Buckley's complex personality, creative process, and internal struggles with sudden fame. The film utilizes archival footage and interviews with close confidantes, including his mother and bandmates, to create a loving and spirited portrait. It thoughtfully explores his upbringing, his artistic influences, and his final days, presenting his death as a tragic accident rather than an inevitability.</p>

          <p>Michael Brown, the 45-year-old suspect in a deadly shooting at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has been captured following a weeklong manhunt. Authorities say Brown killed four people at The Owl Bar on August 1 before fleeing into the nearby mountains. His capture was announced by Governor Greg Gianforte, bringing an end to the extensive search. The suspect, who lived next door to the bar, was described by officials as an unstable individual. Relatives and community members noted that Brown, an Army veteran, had a history of struggling with mental illness.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that helped guide his crew safely back to Earth after an oxygen tank explosion crippled their spacecraft in 1970, turning the mission into a "successful failure." He was also part of the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, from which he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis." NASA and his family remembered him as a hero whose character and courage inspired millions.</p>

The article reflects on the legacies of these remaining pioneers, including Buzz Aldrin and David Scott, who walked on the lunar surface. It also profiles Fred Haise, Lovell's Apollo 13 crewmate, and Apollo 16 and 17 astronauts Charles Duke and Harrison Schmitt. The piece contrasts their historic achievements with the current challenges and delays facing NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon.</p>

          <p>Independent UK Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe has admitted he wrongly identified a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." Lowe posted on social media that he had alerted authorities to a dinghy arriving at Great Yarmouth and called for "mass deportations." It was later revealed the boat contained a crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. After learning of his mistake, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly stated that there "will be no invasion" by U.S. forces, responding to reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to plan action against Latin American drug cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on security, any U.S. military presence or strike within Mexico is "absolutely rejected." This comes amid growing tensions, with the Trump administration having labeled several Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations and increasing pressure on Mexico to curb fentanyl trafficking, including through the use of tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it is lowering the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel. This move aligns Canada with recent actions taken by the European Union and the United Kingdom. The coordinated effort is designed to further restrict Russia's oil revenues, which are a crucial source of funding for its ongoing war in Ukraine. Canada's Finance Minister stated that the measure is intended to ratchet up economic pressure on Moscow and limit its ability to finance the illegal conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance at the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. President Trump indicated that this commitment to U.S. manufacturing would exempt Apple from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about a significant risk to the company's profitability.

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com shows that home prices are beginning to fall in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Among the 50 largest metro areas, cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from their 2022 peaks, with median listing prices falling nearly 15% and 19% respectively. This trend is attributed to a growing housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising prices. (not investment advice)</p>
