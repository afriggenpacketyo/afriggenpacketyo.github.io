          <p>The Labour Party has announced its long-awaited plans to reduce immigration into the UK, introducing a 'controlled, selective, and fair' system. Key measures include tightening work visa requirements by raising qualification standards, doubling the residency period for indefinite leave to remain to 10 years, and scrapping the dedicated visa for social care providers. At the same time, the government aims to expand eligibility for high-potential individuals and ease access for top scientific talent.

          <p>President Trump's plan to alter the pricing model for some medications is facing strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry before the executive order is even signed. The plan, which ties the price of Medicare-covered medications administered in a doctor's office to the lowest price paid by other countries, is intended to lower drug costs. However, the pharmaceutical lobby argues this will cut billions from Medicare and jeopardize investments in new drug research, potentially increasing reliance on China for innovative medicines. The industry has previously criticized similar attempts, arguing they would give foreign governments the upper hand in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the growing trend of homeowners and renters seeking help to switch from gas to electric appliances to reduce climate pollution, leading to the emergence of 'climate coaches.' These coaches, offered by companies, nonprofits, and government agencies, assist individuals in navigating the transition and understanding government incentives. Switching from natural gas to electric appliances can significantly reduce a household's carbon footprint, particularly for energy-intensive appliances like furnaces and water heaters. Startups like QuitCarbon and state agencies like Efficiency Maine Trust are helping people make these changes by vetting contractors, tracking incentives, and simplifying the process.</p>

          <h2>Trump Reportedly Poised to Accept Luxury Jet from Qatar for Air Force One</h2>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar, intended for use as Air Force One, a move that is likely to raise legal and ethical questions. The plane, a Boeing 747-8 jet, is set to be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation at the conclusion of his second White House term. The administration will retrofit the plane for Trump's official use, while White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that 'any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws.' Trump had previously expressed frustration with Boeing over delays in modernizing the current Air Force One aircraft.</p>

This agreement, set to take effect by Wednesday, follows ministerial talks in Geneva aimed at easing trade tensions. Washington and Beijing have also agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to discuss issues of mutual concern. The United States will retain an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, while China will retain at least a 10 percent retaliatory tariff on all American goods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's upcoming trip to the Middle East is primarily focused on securing business deals, with a goal of announcing over $1 trillion in agreements. While the trip aligns with Trump's expanding business plans and family interests, its strategic purpose remains unclear. The visit includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, where Trump will seek deals in areas such as planes, nuclear power, artificial intelligence investments, and arms. The focus on economic transactions contrasts with past presidential visits that often aimed to advance broader strategic visions for the region.</p>
