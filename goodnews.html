          <p>Google's Gemini has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store, overtaking its rival ChatGPT and signaling a significant gain in the consumer artificial intelligence race. The app's popularity surged following recent updates, including a new image-editing feature that attracted 13 million new users in just four days. This improved traction has also bolstered investor confidence, contributing to Google's parent company, Alphabet, recently joining the exclusive group of firms with a $3 trillion market capitalization. The milestone suggests Google is successfully closing the gap with OpenAI, which had long dominated the generative AI space.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, has officially announced he will seek a third consecutive term, a rare feat in the state's history. In his announcement, Walz highlighted his administration's progressive achievements, such as codifying abortion rights and legalizing recreational marijuana, while vowing to address gun violence and government fraud. The former vice-presidential candidate faces political headwinds, including polling that suggests half of Minnesotans oppose a third term and ongoing scrutiny over his administration's handling of a major COVID-19 fraud case. If successful, he would be the first governor in Minnesota's 167-year history to win three consecutive four-year terms.</p>

          <p>A growing number of high-income households are shopping at discount stores like Walmart, Aldi, and Dollar General, a trend driven primarily by persistent inflation. According to data from GlobalData Retail, nearly 28% of affluent consumers have shopped at budget retailers this year, up from 20% four years ago. As rising costs for essentials shrink the financial cushions of even wealthier consumers, many are seeking better value for groceries and household goods. In response, discount chains are actively courting these shoppers by renovating stores, improving presentation, and expanding their selection of premium and name-brand products.</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League will allow its players to participate in the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, marking their return to the Games for the first time in 12 years. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated that the decision was driven by the players' strong desire to represent their countries in a best-on-best international tournament. The league had previously stopped Olympic participation after the 2014 Sochi Games due to disagreements over costs, promotion, and control. A new agreement with the International Olympic Committee addresses some of these commercial issues, paving the way for the sport's biggest stars to return to the global stage.</p>

          <p>China Eastern Airlines is set to launch a new flight route from Shanghai to Buenos Aires, which will become one of the world's longest at 20,000 kilometers and 25 hours of travel time. The service, which will have a single transit stop in Auckland, New Zealand, is designed to significantly cut travel time between China and Argentina. This new route reflects China's growing trade and political ties with Latin America, providing a more direct connection that bypasses traditional layovers in the United States or Europe. New Zealand will also waive transit visa requirements for Chinese nationals to facilitate travel on the new service.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a framework deal to prevent a ban on TikTok, prompting President Trump to extend the divestment deadline to December 16.

This arrangement aims to address national security concerns by having Oracle manage American user data on its domestic servers. The agreement marks a significant step towards resolving a prolonged period of uncertainty for the popular social media platform and its 170 million American users. (not investment advice)</p>

While coronavirus levels in wastewater remain elevated, other key indicators are showing improvement. The statewide rate of positive lab tests has begun to fall, and the number of new COVID-19 hospital admissions has seen a slight decrease in major regions like Los Angeles County. Public health officials note that while it is too early to definitively declare the peak has passed, the data suggests that community transmission is slowing.

          <p>Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Alphabet, has received a permit to begin testing its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The rollout will occur in phases, starting with employee testing with human safety drivers on board before expanding to a fully driverless commercial service for the public. This move marks a significant expansion for Waymo, which already operates in parts of the Bay Area but previously lacked airport access. The permit allows Waymo to compete more directly with traditional ride-hailing services and represents another step toward the broader integration of autonomous vehicles into public transportation infrastructure.</p>

          <p>After a decades-long decline in activity, the sun has become increasingly active since 2008, a surprising reversal that could impact space weather and technology on Earth. NASA scientists had previously anticipated a prolonged period of low activity, but new research shows an uptick in solar plasma bursts and stronger magnetic fields. This increased solar activity raises the potential for more solar storms and flares, which can disrupt power grids, GPS systems, and radio communications, as well as pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.
