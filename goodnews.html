          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned property for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook a challenging restoration to make it habitable, which included installing running water and electricity. The historic fortress is now equipped with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, transforming it into a unique private venue. The island, which once protected Milford Haven from naval attacks, is now back on the market with an asking price of £3 million.</p>

          <p>As families face the financial strain of providing extra meals during the school summer holidays, parents are sharing creative tips to reduce food expenses amid rising prices. Strategies include meticulously planning meals, buying reduced "yellow sticker" items to freeze for later, and organizing daily food rations in separate bags to prevent over-snacking. Some parents utilize local food pantries that provide surplus groceries for a small fee, which they describe as a lifeline. These measures highlight the growing pressure on household budgets, as the absence of subsidized school meals adds a significant cost for many families.</p>

          <p>Hollywood Forever Cemetery, known as the final resting place for many classic film stars, has unveiled a new five-story vertical mausoleum to address the growing demand for burial space in Los Angeles. The Gower Mausoleum, which can house approximately 13,000 people, offers a modern solution to land scarcity by building upwards. The structure is designed with marble, natural light, and views of city landmarks, aiming to provide a peaceful and beautiful space for both the deceased and their visiting families. The cemetery continues to redefine its role by hosting community events, blending its function as a memorial park with that of a cultural venue.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK have opened time-capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021, just after returning to school from a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters reveal their anxieties about the pandemic, their personal hopes, and their dreams for the future. Written as a motivational exercise by their teacher, the letters capture a unique moment of uncertainty and resilience. Now 16, the students are reflecting on their personal growth and the challenges they overcame during their disrupted secondary school education as they prepare to receive their GCSE exam results.</p>

          <p>In a commanding performance, 20-year-old British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma defeated veteran Dillian Whyte with a first-round stoppage, taking just 119 seconds to secure the victory. Itauma sent Whyte to the canvas with a powerful right hook, and although Whyte got back to his feet, the referee deemed him unfit to continue. The win extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0 and solidifies his position as a major rising contender in the heavyweight division. The decisive victory in his first headlining event suggests a potential title shot could be in his near future.</p>

          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, introducing global diners to the vast diversity of China's regional cuisines beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Brands specializing in fiery Hunan dishes, spicy Sichuan grilled fish, and other authentic fare are using hubs like Singapore as a launchpad for worldwide growth. This culinary movement is driven by intense competition in China's domestic market and a growing diaspora demanding authentic food. These restaurants aim to correct outdated perceptions of Chinese cuisine as low-brow, instead showcasing its sophistication and cultural richness through immersive dining experiences.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates Samsung is closing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's slipped to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing consumer interest in innovative form factors, particularly Samsung's new foldable Z series phones, which offer a fresh alternative to the standard smartphone design. While Apple remains the market leader, its recent stock underperformance reflects this renewed competition. Analysts speculate Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026 to counter Samsung's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dutch midfielder Tijjani Reijnders made an immediate impact in his Premier League debut for Manchester City, scoring one goal and assisting another in a 4-0 victory over Wolves. The 27-year-old, signed from AC Milan, delivered a dominant performance that earned praise from manager Pep Guardiola and pundits. Reijnders' box-to-box energy and creative passing provided a significant boost to City's midfield, which struggled with injuries last season. His sensational start suggests he will be a key player for the club as they aim to rebound from a disappointing previous campaign.</p>
