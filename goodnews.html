          <p>Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, has invested $2 billion in the prediction markets platform Polymarket, valuing the company at approximately $8 billion.

          <p>In the second quarter of 2025, real estate investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the U.S., the highest proportion in five years. While the total number of homes bought by investors decreased compared to last year, their market share grew due to an overall slowdown in home sales. The report highlights that small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, still dominate the market, while larger institutional investors have been selling more homes than they buy, shifting capital towards build-to-rent communities.

          <p>Ares Management has raised its fundraising targets by 25%, attributing the increase to a "retail revolution" where individual wealthy investors are driving growth in private markets. The firm, which now has over $50 billion in assets from retail-focused vehicles, is capitalizing on this trend by expanding its product development and client education services. CEO Michael Arougheti pushed back against concerns that retail investors receive weaker deals, stating that Ares allocates high-quality investments across both its institutional and wealth management platforms.

The move reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed focus on securing domestic supply chains for resources essential for defense and energy infrastructure.

          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources became the largest generator of global electricity in the first half of 2025, according to an analysis by the energy think tank Ember. This "historic shift" was primarily driven by rapid growth in solar and wind power, particularly in China and India, which was sufficient to meet rising global electricity demand. While the EU and US saw a temporary increase in fossil fuel use due to specific local conditions, the overall trend marks a critical turning point in the global transition to clean energy.</p>

          <p>With recent and anticipated interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. A hypothetical $75,000 HELOC now has lower monthly payments than it did earlier in the year and significantly less than in 2024, making it an attractive financing option. Because HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers who secure one now could see their costs decrease further if the central bank continues to lower rates in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

This article offers a look inside Rivian's California design lab, detailing the philosophy behind its distinctive look, including its controversial "stadium" headlights.</p>

          <p>A 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer was diagnosed with the disease after she proactively pushed for early screening. Although initially told she was too young for a mammogram, her persistence led her to a high-risk clinic where a breast MRI detected two suspicious masses that proved to be early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma. Her story underscores the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as oncologists say her early diagnosis significantly improved her prognosis and treatment options.</p>
