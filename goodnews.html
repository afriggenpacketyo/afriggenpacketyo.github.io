        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court has limited the scope for mass compensation claims over hidden commissions in car finance deals, ruling against the idea that dealers have a strict fiduciary duty to buyers. This decision blocks a potentially massive wave of claims that could have cost lenders tens of billions. However, the court upheld one claim where the commission was deemed unfair under the Consumer Credit Act, providing a potential template for other cases with egregious fees. The Financial Conduct Authority is also still considering a separate redress scheme for banned discretionary commission agreements, meaning the industry could still face a substantial compensation bill.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process on migrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole. The ruling specifically protects individuals who were granted entry at official ports and are complying with legal proceedings. This decision could significantly curtail controversial ICE operations that involve arresting migrants at courthouses immediately after their hearings to place them in expedited removal. The judge noted the case raised a "question of fair play," as the migrants had followed the rules but were still targeted for summary deportation.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, savers have an opportunity to secure high returns with long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). This article suggests three key moves: determining the maximum amount you can lock away for the longest possible term, shopping around at different banks, especially online ones, for the best rates, and re-evaluating where other savings are held to potentially consolidate into higher-earning CDs. These steps can help maximize earnings in a predictable way while rates remain elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold, after a significant run-up over the past year, is expected to face a period of potential stagnation in August. Key factors contributing to this forecast include the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates on hold, which removes a major catalyst for price movement. Additionally, uncertainty around the next inflation report and evolving demand for portfolio diversification in a strong stock market could lead to muted activity. Analysts suggest that while gold's long-term value as a hedge remains, short-term price volatility may be limited. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has dealt a significant blow to Italy's plan to process asylum seekers offshore in Albania. The court ruled that Italy's method for designating a country as "safe" for returns is inconsistent with EU law, as it must apply to the entire population, not just specific groups. This decision undermines the legal foundation of the Italy-Albania deal, which relied on a fast-track system for deporting rejected applicants from such countries. The ruling was criticized by the Italian government but hailed by human rights groups as a collapse of the model's legal core.</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple has welcomed a baby boy who developed from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, likely setting a new record for the longest storage time before a live birth. The embryo, created via IVF in 1994, was donated to Linda and Tim Pierce through an open embryo adoption process. The case highlights the growing practice of donating unused frozen embryos, a topic with complex ethical dimensions, particularly following recent legal rulings on the status of embryos. The doctor involved confirmed this surpasses the previous record of an embryo frozen for 30 years.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Some Monogamous Bird Pairs 'Divorce' Between Breeding Seasons</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 16:04:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Oxford University has found that a species of common European songbird, which typically forms monogamous pairs, sometimes separates from its partner between breeding seasons. This behavior, which researchers term 'divorce,' offers new insights into the complexities of avian social bonds and mating strategies. The research explores the potential factors that lead to these separations, contributing to a broader understanding of animal behavior. The findings challenge simpler notions of lifelong monogamy in certain species and highlight the dynamic nature of their relationships.</p>

          <p>While interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) remain elevated, they have declined from their peak in August 2024. A comparison shows that a $10,000 deposit in various CD terms would have earned significantly more last year; for example, a 3-year CD opened in 2024 would yield over $500 more in interest than one opened today. Despite the lower returns, the article notes that CDs still offer a compelling option for savers. Their fixed rates provide predictability and are substantially higher than traditional savings accounts, making them a strong choice in the current financial environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NFL is expected to take an ownership stake in ESPN as part of a significant new deal with parent company Disney.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to bring back the Presidential Fitness Test, a standardized physical education assessment that was a staple in American schools for over 50 years before being phased out in 2013. The order revives the test and its associated awards for top-performing students, citing a national crisis in obesity, inactivity, and chronic disease. The President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition will develop the new criteria. While the move is intended to improve youth health, some educators express caution, hoping a revamped version will focus on lifelong health rather than just competitive performance.</p>
