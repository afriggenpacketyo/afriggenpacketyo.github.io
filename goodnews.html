          <p>Trading has resumed on the Damascus Securities Exchange after a six-month closure, signaling a move towards economic recovery in Syria following nearly 14 years of civil war. The stock exchange had been closed during the turbulent period leading up to the ouster of former President Bashar Assad. Syrian Finance Minister Mohammed Yisr Barnieh stated that the reopening indicates the country's economy is beginning to recover, with the stock exchange operating as a private company focused on digital development. This move coincides with the easing of international restrictions on Syria's financial systems and a recent $7 billion power deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and U.S. companies to revitalize the electricity grid. </p>

          <p>Taiwan is set to test a domestically produced kamikaze sea drone this month to bolster its naval defenses amid growing pressure from mainland China. The drone, developed under the 'Kuai Chi Project,' will undergo combat capability evaluations before further tests later this year. The defense ministry has allocated over NT$800 million for the project, with plans to begin mass production in 2026, aiming to acquire over 200 vessels to support coastal assault operations. Equipped with an AI-enabled targeting system, the attack vessel will autonomously lock onto and strike enemy ships after target assignment, enhancing Taiwan's asymmetric defense strategy. </p>
