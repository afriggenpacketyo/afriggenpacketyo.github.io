          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, passed away at the age of 94. Rangel, who served as a congressman for 46 years representing Harlem, played a crucial role in shaping New York's political landscape. He was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for the Senate and was known for his advocacy for affordable housing and economic development in Harlem. Despite facing ethics violations later in his career, Rangel remained a respected and influential figure, remembered for his gregariousness and commitment to his constituents.</p>

          <p>With the increasing frequency of rocket launches, physicists are studying the acoustics of spaceflight to understand and mitigate the impact of rocket noise on communities. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, for instance, generates a unique three-part sonic boom during its return to Earth. Researchers aim to determine acceptable noise levels and develop strategies to lessen disruptions before problems become pervasive. The team is also studying the noise generated by Starship, the largest and potentially loudest rocket ever built, to address potential noise pollution issues before they escalate.</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla visited Canada at the invitation of Prime Minister Mark Carney, a move seen as a subtle rebuke to President Trump's past comments about Canada's sovereignty. The visit, which included Charles opening Canada's Parliament, emphasized Canada's distinct heritage and independence from the United States. The event was filled with symbolism, including the use of Canadian symbols and expressions of support for Canada's sovereign future. The visit comes after Trump has repeatedly called for Canada to become the 51st U.S. state.</p>

          <p>A Kentucky homeowner got a surprise when a black bear crashed through their ceiling and landed on the kitchen stove. The incident occurred in Bell County, where a game warden responded to find the bear calmly sitting on the appliance. The bear had apparently climbed a ladder, entered the attic through an opening, and subsequently fell through the ceiling. The bear was safely guided out of the house without any reported injuries, leaving the homeowners with an unexpected story and a damaged ceiling.</p>
