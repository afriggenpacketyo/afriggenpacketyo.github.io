          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan were suspended for over five hours after a train stopped between stations due to a malfunction. The affected train was a new type that debuted last year, and the incident forced two other trains to halt. Passengers were transferred from one train to another via a gangplank, while others returned to a station where they were provided with bottled water. The disruption occurred during a day when temperatures reached 35.0 C, adding to the inconvenience for travelers.</p>

          <p>The UK has secured a favorable position with President Trump, evidenced by being the first to sign a trade deal with the U.S. and receiving lower tariff rates. Trump attributed this to his personal affinity for the UK, stating that he likes them. This relationship is notable given the differing political backgrounds of Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Cultural links, Trump's Anglophilia, and the UK's avoidance of trade or foreign policy conflicts with Washington have contributed to this preferential relationship.</p>

          <p>Despite claims that the Trump Organization's newly announced smartphone, the T1, will be manufactured in the U.S., experts suggest it will likely be made in China. Analysts point to the lack of local manufacturing capabilities and the likelihood that a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM) would handle the design and production. The phone, which will run Google's Android operating system and retail for $499, has raised questions about the feasibility of domestic production. This follows Trump's previous calls for Apple to manufacture its iPhones in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that appendix cancer rates are rising in younger generations, specifically those born after the 1970s. This trend is part of a broader increase in cancer rates among young adults globally, including colorectal, testicular, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Researchers are exploring potential causes, ruling out genetic factors and focusing on environmental factors such as exposure to chemicals, microplastics, changes in the gut microbiome, and the "Western diet." Health experts advise focusing on prevention and awareness through lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight and balanced diet.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapies that could potentially replace chemotherapy. ADCs deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, and Merck are investing heavily in ADCs, with some showing the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. However, challenges remain, including ensuring the chemotherapy payload is released at the right time and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins to target.</p>
