          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced that a medium-security state prison in Norco, Riverside County, is scheduled to close by fall 2026. The closure is attributed to a significant decline in the state's inmate population and is expected to save California approximately $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs around 1,200 staff, will see its inmates transferred to other prisons without early release. This shutdown continues a statewide trend of deactivating correctional facilities, raising questions about the future use of the historic Norco property, which was once a luxury resort.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals in California with illegally exporting millions of dollars' worth of sensitive AI chips, including Nvidia's advanced H100 models, to China. The individuals allegedly operated a company, ALX Solutions, to ship the technology without the required export licenses, which were implemented in 2022 to restrict China's access to high-end semiconductors. Investigators uncovered communications detailing plans to evade U.S. law by routing shipments through Malaysia and Singapore. The case highlights Washington's growing concern over the illicit smuggling of controlled technology and its efforts to enforce national security-related export controls against such activities.</p>

Supported by Senate leadership and with a significant financial advantage, Famiglietti's win was widely expected in the heavily Democratic district.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling sided with 20 states that sued after the administration terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and attempted to redirect its unspent funding without congressional approval. The judge argued the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to communities relying on the funds for flood mitigation and other resilience projects. This decision temporarily halts a controversial move that FEMA had initially justified by calling the BRIC program wasteful and politically motivated.</p>

          <p>A major China-backed copper mining project in Afghanistan's Logar province is reportedly making significant progress towards beginning extraction this year, 17 years after the contract was first awarded. The state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) stated it is ready to start production at the Mes Aynak Mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits. The project has long been stalled by security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological ruins, and landmines. The Taliban's recent decision to switch to more costly underground mining is seen as a move to protect the historical sites, potentially clearing a major obstacle for the long-delayed venture.</p>

          <p>The K-pop group Monsta X made a triumphant return to the KCON festival in Los Angeles as headliners, a decade after their first appearance as a rookie act. Their performance marked a significant reunion for the group following a two-year hiatus for mandatory military service, demonstrating their staying power in the fast-paced industry. The members reflected on their journey and the shock of seeing American fans supporting them back in 2015. Their return is especially meaningful as it heralds a new era for the group, which is preparing to release a new album and has continued to attract new fans while retaining a devoted, long-term following.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime rates in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from post-pandemic highs. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime, including a significant 14.9% decrease in murder and nonnegligent manslaughter. Property crime also fell by 8.1%, with motor vehicle thefts experiencing a record 18.6% one-year decline. While experts note the positive trend, they also caution that aggravated assaults remain high compared to pre-COVID levels and that official statistics only capture crimes reported to police.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The ordinance, aimed at protecting tenants from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change, will take effect next month but won't be enforced until 2027. Officials are encouraging landlords to use passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains over air conditioning. The law will be complaint-driven, with public health inspectors aiming to educate landlords and achieve compliance before issuing fines, providing a new layer of protection for vulnerable residents.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to individuals entering the country illegally, but the court ruled the government cannot disregard laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face persecution or torture. This directive effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims, though migrants will likely remain detained during processing. The move halts a key administration policy credited with a sharp drop in illegal border crossings, although the Justice Department may appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is returning to the Los Angeles Chargers, agreeing to a one-year deal worth $8.52 million. Allen, the franchise's second all-time leading receiver, was traded to the Chicago Bears last season in a salary-cap move but now rejoins his former team to bolster its receiving corps. The six-time Pro Bowl selection's return comes after the recent retirement of Mike Williams, providing a much-needed experienced target for quarterback Justin Herbert. Allen will join a young group of receivers, including Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston, bringing veteran leadership and proven production back to the Chargers' offense.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is slated to start the team's first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. The decision comes as a surprise, as Sanders was listed as the fourth-string quarterback on the team's initial depth chart. However, injuries to fellow quarterbacks Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel have opened the door for the fifth-round draft pick. Sanders, who had a prolific college career under his father, Deion Sanders, will have a crucial opportunity to prove himself and compete for a roster spot as he splits playing time with newly signed QB Tyler Huntley.</p>

The agreement requires the companies to pay for natural resource damages and to fund over a billion dollars for the cleanup of the affected areas.
