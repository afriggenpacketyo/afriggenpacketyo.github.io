          <p>The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the primary commuter rail system for the San Francisco Bay Area, experienced a complete shutdown of all train services for several hours on Friday morning due to a computer networking problem. The outage affected all 50 stations, causing major delays and forcing commuters to seek alternative transportation methods like carpools, buses, and ferries. The incident occurred as BART struggles to regain ridership following the Covid-19 pandemic, with current passenger traffic remaining less than half of pre-pandemic levels. While service has resumed, significant delays are expected throughout the day.</p>

          <p>Indiana's governor has signed a groundbreaking bill that could strip charity hospitals of their non-profit status if they continue to charge excessive prices. This legislation, the first of its kind in the U.S., follows an investigation into high hospital prices in the state. The law requires the state to establish a price benchmark, giving hospitals until 2029 to lower their prices. Supporters hope this will reduce healthcare costs for individuals and businesses, while the Indiana Hospital Association expresses concerns about the potential impact on financial stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff as a potential target, as negotiators prepare for high-stakes trade talks in Switzerland. This move comes amid concerns about the impact of trade tensions on international markets and the global economy. However, the White House clarified that any tariff reduction would depend on concessions from China. While the announcement boosted stock markets, the effectiveness of an 80% tariff in reviving trade remains uncertain, with some executives stating that tariffs above 50% can effectively halt exports.</p>
