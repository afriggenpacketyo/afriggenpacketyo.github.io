          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to unveil a substantial ¬£15 billion investment in transport infrastructure across England, targeting mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. Tram projects will receive significant funding, with Greater Manchester slated for ¬£2.5 billion to extend its network and the West Midlands allocated ¬£2.4 billion to expand services in Birmingham. Six additional metro mayors will also benefit from these investments, aimed at improving connectivity and driving economic growth in these regions. This initiative marks a shift from the Treasury's traditional Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the South-East, with Reeves emphasizing the need to address regional disparities and open up access to jobs.

The artists incorporate elements of fauna, flora, and important community figures, including traditional medicine practitioners, while also addressing the theme of migration. This is the first time Colectivo Cheran√≠ has exhibited outside of Mexico, made possible by curator Pablo Ram√≠rez, who aims to showcase art from indigenous communities that has been produced for centuries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a surge in Australian electric vehicle sales in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y. This rebound contrasts with declining sales in the U.S. and Europe, with Australian sales jumping to 3,897 vehicles, primarily due to a 122.5% year-over-year increase in Model Y sales. Despite this positive trend, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year, with increased competition and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities impacting global sales. While the Australian rebound is encouraging locally, it doesn't necessarily signal a broader global recovery for Tesla.</p>

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated from Cologne's city center as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in the city, required the closure of several roads and the evacuation of hotels, care homes, and the railway station in Deutz. The Cologne Cathedral was situated just outside the danger zone. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne due to the city being a major target for Allied forces during WWII.</p>

          <p>The UK has secured an exemption from the increased 50% tariffs on US steel and aluminum imports, but the White House warns that this is conditional upon the ratification of May's trade pact between the two countries. While shipments from the UK will remain subject to the previous 25% rate, this reprieve is limited to just over a month, with a US deadline of July 9. The government of Sir Keir Starmer continues to collaborate with US officials to finalize the terms, while the UK steel industry cautiously welcomes the temporary relief.</p>
