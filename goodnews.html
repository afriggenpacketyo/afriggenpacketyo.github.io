          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told lawmakers that the U.S. would avoid tariffs on natural resources not abundant in the country, addressing concerns about rising consumer prices. During a House Appropriations Committee hearing, Lutnick mentioned bananas, spices, and roots as examples of items exempt from duties in ongoing trade negotiations. He emphasized the need for fair trade, particularly regarding market access for American farmers and ranchers, citing issues with how U.S. chicken, pork, and beef are treated globally. The U.S. is currently in negotiations with numerous countries ahead of a July 8 deadline for proposed tariffs.</p>

          <p>According to *Fox News*, Bill Belichick's publicist allegedly assured him that a CBS interview would be a "puff piece" about his new book, "The Art of Winning." However, the interview reportedly deviated from the agreed-upon topic, leading to Belichick expressing surprise and accusing CBS of creating a "false narrative." The article details how Belichick's girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, intervened during the interview, and it includes statements from both Belichick and CBS regarding the situation. The report suggests a disconnect between the expectations set by Belichick's team and the actual content of the CBS interview.</p>

          <p>Under new rules, six water companies in England have been banned from paying bonuses to senior executives, according to the *BBC*. The measures apply to companies that fail to meet environmental and consumer standards, lack financial resilience, or have been convicted of a criminal offence. The ban, backdated to April 2024, allows regulator Ofwat to claw back bonuses or face enforcement action. The government said it would investigate companies attempting to circumvent the ban by raising base salaries.</p>
