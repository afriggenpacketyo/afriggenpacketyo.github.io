          <p>Perplexity AI has launched its artificial intelligence-powered web browser, Comet, for free to users across the globe. Initially available only to paid subscribers, the browser is designed to function as a personal assistant capable of searching the web, organizing tabs, and drafting emails. This strategic move to offer Comet for free is seen as an effort to attract a larger user base and increase competitiveness against rival AI browser offerings from major tech companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. The company also announced it is developing a mobile version and other new features to further enhance its product.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve implementing rate cuts, the average interest rate for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has fallen, making it a more financially attractive option for homeowners. For a $70,000 HELOC, the monthly payment has decreased notably compared to last year, providing tangible savings for borrowers. The article explains that the variable-rate nature of HELOCs is particularly beneficial in the current economic climate of declining rates, with the potential for further cost reductions if more cuts occur. This analysis highlights that a HELOC can be a cost-effective method for accessing home equity in the present market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to growing consumer demand for more natural ingredients, PepsiCo is accelerating its plan to remove artificial dyes from its food and beverage portfolio. This initiative will affect iconic products such as Gatorade, Cheetos, and Doritos, replacing synthetic colors with natural alternatives derived from sources like paprika, turmeric, and carob powder. The company faces the challenge of maintaining the vibrant colors and familiar tastes that consumers expect, a process that can take several years per product. This move reflects a significant industry-wide shift toward cleaner labels and greater transparency in food production.</p>

          <h2>Remembering Jane Goodall's Legacy of Primatology and Activism</h2>

          <p>Famed primatologist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, is remembered for her revolutionary research on chimpanzees and her later transformation into a global conservation activist. Her career began in the 1960s in Tanzania, where her groundbreaking observations of chimpanzee tool use challenged long-held beliefs about the uniqueness of humankind. Initially a reluctant public figure, she skillfully used her fame to advocate for animal welfare and environmental protection, founding the Jane Goodall Institute and the Roots and Shoots youth program. Goodall's work fundamentally changed our understanding of animal intelligence and inspired generations of scientists and activists.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 12:35:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fair Isaac Corporation, the company behind the FICO credit score, has announced a new pricing model that will allow it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders, bypassing credit bureaus. This change, which sent the company's stock soaring over 20%, aims to eliminate markups and give lenders more choice in how they access and distribute FICO scores to borrowers. While Fair Isaac's shares rallied, the stock prices for major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax fell on the news. The move is seen by analysts as a strategic shift that could improve FICO's own economics while disrupting the traditional credit reporting industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Premier League Considers Replacing Profit and Sustainability Rules with New System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 12:06:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League is nearing a decision on whether to replace its current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), according to chief executive Richard Masters. The existing rules, which limit club losses to £105 million over three years, have been criticized for restricting investment. An alternative being considered is a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's regulations, which would cap spending on squad-related costs as a percentage of a club's revenue. A decision on the potential change is expected to be made at a meeting in November, aiming to align the league's financial controls more closely with European standards.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a post-tropical storm after striking Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane, bringing powerful winds and heavy rain to the island. While a tropical storm warning remains in effect, the worst conditions have passed as the system moves farther into the Atlantic Ocean. There have been no immediate reports of significant damage on the archipelago. Forecasters have warned that swells generated by Imelda are still affecting the U.S. East Coast, creating the potential for life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the shoreline.</p>

          <h2>Expedition Team Claims 'Very Strong' Evidence of Amelia Earhart's Lost Plane in Pacific Lagoon</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers from Purdue University are planning an expedition to a remote Pacific island, Nikumaroro, to investigate a "visual anomaly" they believe could be the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, identified in satellite imagery within a lagoon, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. The team cites "very strong" evidence and will use sonar and magnetometers to scan the site before attempting to dredge and identify the object. If confirmed, the discovery would solve one of aviation's greatest mysteries and potentially allow for the plane's return to Purdue University, which funded the original flight.</p>
