          <p>Ayami Sato, a renowned female baseball player from Japan, has made history by becoming the first woman to play in a professional men's league in Canada. Sato plays as a right-hander for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Intercounty Baseball League, where she has already achieved her first win and garnered significant media attention. Sato's success comes at a pivotal time for women's baseball in North America, with a new U.S. women's pro league slated to launch in 2026, for which she serves as a special advisor. She hopes her journey sends a message of empowerment and inspires others to pursue their dreams and break barriers, as she focuses on improving herself and not proving anything.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced. The order comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Donald Trump of a "government vendetta" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued the ban is necessary on national security grounds, accusing Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitism on campus.</p>

The film will explore Williams' 30-year career, including the creation of iconic songs like "Drop it Like it's Hot," and will include new music from Williams. Morgan Neville, the director, said Williams approached him five years ago with the idea, and the film is set to be released in theaters on October 11.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to advocate for a reconsideration of higher import duties imposed by Washington. Akazawa is in the U.S. capital for tariff talks, aiming to pave the way for a leaders' meeting in mid-June, as the Japanese government seeks the elimination of the higher tariffs, but is also considering accepting a cut in the rates. Under Trump's reciprocal tariff regime, Japan faces a 24 percent duty, and is also affected by additional tariffs on automobiles and other sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of retailers and food brands are offering products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods. While consumers seek simpler ingredient lists, nutritionists caution against sacrificing fortified nutrients for shorter labels. The debate raises questions about whether the public has been misled regarding the health implications of ultra-processed foods, as processing is essential for food safety and shelf life. Food brands are advised to simplify formulas and utilize new processing technologies to create less processed products, as the marketing of less processed food products is expected to increase.</p>

A laser module and phase encoding device were tested on a rocket flight, assessing their robustness against environmental stresses during ascent. The test is part of China's efforts to construct a quantum secure direct communication network. QSDC sends messages directly through a quantum channel, potentially offering more efficient and secure communication than quantum key distribution.</p>

          <h2>DMV Warns of Registration Renewal Scam</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is warning against online vehicle registration scams, as residents have reported deceptive social media advertisements offering renewal services at a 50% discount. The fake ads request personal information and payment through unofficial channels like Cash App, which the DMV never uses. The DMV advises that the safest way to renew your vehicle registration is directly through the official DMV website, a DMV kiosk, or an appointment at a DMV office. The DMV emphasizes that state law prohibits discounted vehicle registration renewals.</p>
