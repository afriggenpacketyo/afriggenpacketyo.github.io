          <h2>The Role of Shamelessness in Politics: A Look at Trump's Tactics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 03:00:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the prevalence of shamelessness in politics, using Donald Trump as a prime example of a politician who readily contradicts himself and changes positions. Ross Douthat in the New York Times suggests that Trump's willingness to swerve and backpedal is part of his appeal to swing voters, reassuring them that anything extreme is provisional. The article highlights instances where Trump has shifted his stance on issues like TikTok and the Ukraine war, and it contrasts how his actions would be perceived if done by a Democrat like Joe Biden. The author argues that Trump's political skills and the lack of a strong Democratic national spokesperson contribute to his ability to get away with such behavior.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. Lee, the Democratic Party candidate, holds a significant lead over his rival, Kim Moon Soo of the People's Power Party. The election was triggered by the impeachment and removal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee is expected to address economic challenges and trade negotiations with the U.S. if elected, potentially pursuing a more left-leaning agenda and a slower approach to tariff talks with Washington.</p>
