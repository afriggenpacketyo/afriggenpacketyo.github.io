          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the author's experience as a visiting scholar at Harvard University, contrasting it with President Trump's apparent perception. The author, who grew up in West Germany with an idealized view of America and Harvard, found the university to be a place of academic inquiry and bridging differences. The author expresses concern over the Trump administration's potential elimination of visa programs that enable international scholars to contribute to Harvard's academic community. A US district judge blocked the White House‚Äôs attempt to revoke Harvard‚Äôs certification to enroll foreign students, while the State Department has cancelled all future interviews for applicants who want to obtain a visa to study in the US.</p>
