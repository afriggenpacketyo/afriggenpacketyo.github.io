          <p>In a guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, challenges the notion of the perfect mother and argues that flaws are essential for raising well-adjusted children. She posits that children learn to accept their own imperfections by witnessing their caregivers' flaws. Ross also points out the historical tendency of psychiatrists to unfairly blame mothers for their children's problems, urging a shift towards recognizing the immense credit mothers deserve. The article encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and embrace their imperfections, highlighting that being good enough is sufficient.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has chosen Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership initially sought to replace Kim due to concerns about his electability, but PPP members voted against the motion, reinstating Kim as the candidate. This decision follows a period of turmoil within the PPP since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol.
