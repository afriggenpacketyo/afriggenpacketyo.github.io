          <p>Malaysia's semiconductor industry, a key player in the global supply chain, is facing uncertainty due to President Trump's evolving trade policies. While Malaysia was initially seen as a beneficiary of U.S. efforts to limit China's access to advanced chips, new tariffs on Malaysian exports threaten the country's ambitions to develop high-tech chip manufacturing capabilities. The proposed tariffs could undermine Malaysia's plans and potentially increase costs for American consumers. Some companies are exploring ways to mitigate the impact of tariffs by diversifying their supply chains, while others are awaiting clarity on the final tariff comparisons.</p>

          <p>Corey O'Connor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city under its current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. This defeat is the latest in a series of losses in deep-blue cities that have raised questions about progressive officeholders. O'Connor, the Allegheny County controller, will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, but Pittsburgh has not had a Republican mayor since 1932, making the Democratic primary win tantamount to winning the election.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumors from weeks to just hours. This method has been described as a "game changer" by surgeons and has already been used in 50 operations at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust with a 100% success rate. The new technique, using software dubbed ROBIN, can deliver results in as little as 90 minutes, allowing surgeons to perform more radical surgery, if needed, at the time.</p>
