        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's revenue from the departure tax, collected from travelers, has hit a record high in fiscal year 2024 due to a surge in visitors. The Finance Ministry reported that the total has already reached 48.1 billion yen, surpassing the previous record of 44.3 billion yen in fiscal 2019, though the final receipts are still being gathered. The government imposes a 1,000 yen International Tourist Tax on each traveler leaving the country, regardless of nationality. The country has been attracting more visitors due to a weaker yen and an increase in the number of flights, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba indicating a willingness to increase the departure tax to further promote tourism and address overcrowding.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring the potential of microbes found in unusual environments, including household sludge, to help solve environmental problems. The Two Frontiers Project, co-founded by microbiologists James Henriksen and Braden Tierney, seeks to identify microorganisms that can capture carbon dioxide, grow crops in hostile environments, and clean up hazardous waste. The team has already isolated microbes with unique abilities, such as Chonkus, which efficiently consumes carbon dioxide, and bacteria associated with corals that produce antibiotics. They are now surveying homes for interesting goos, partnering with CitSci, believing that extreme environments in showerheads and dishwashers may harbor microbes with carbon-capturing abilities.</p>

          <p>Tulsa's mayor, Monroe Nichols, has proposed a $100 million private trust as part of a reparations plan to provide descendants of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre with scholarships and housing assistance. The plan aims to make amends for the racial attack that killed as many as 300 Black people. Nichols characterizes the plan as a "road to repair" rather than using the term reparations, which he considers politically charged. The private charitable trust would be created with the goal of securing $105 million in assets, with the majority of the funding going towards improving buildings and revitalizing the city's north side.</p>

          <p>The article explores Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM), a little-known PTSD treatment claiming to be painless. RTM involves patients reimagining their trauma through mental exercises to fade its emotional charge, differing from prolonged-exposure therapy which directly confronts the trauma. Patients are asked to tweak the film in any way that makes it easier to watch, then rescripting the memory to invent an alternate version where the trauma never happens. Early data from a large-scale clinical trial of RTM shows promising results, outperforming prolonged exposure in completion rates and PTSD diagnosis rates.</p>

Charismatic Christians, who believe in the Holy Spirit's power to heal and prophesy, are the fastest-growing group of Christians. The rising popularity of Spirit-filled worship and emphasis on personal contact with God has paralleled secular society‚Äôs exaltation of private experience over tradition or reasoned argument. Even as partisan politics have come to display the dynamics of fundamentalist sects, there are signs that the 60-year slide of organized religion in the West has slowed.</p>

Cloning has become reliable and lucrative enough to be the basis for companies around the world, which are churning out clones of super-sniffing police dogs, prizewinning show camels, and high-genomic-scoring livestock. While the public remains wary of this genetic tinkering, thousands of clones have already been produced, raising questions about genetic diversity and animal welfare. The cloning process, called somatic cell nuclear transfer, still follows the same basic steps first developed in 1952 to copy a frog embryo.</p>

Ministers are set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) which will re-design the routes planes must take over UK airspace. The initial shake-up will focus on modernising the complex airspace in and around London, with changes potentially including planes climbing quicker during take off and descending more smoothly. The changes would be the largest to UK airspace since it was first designed in the 1950s, at which time there were only around 200,000 flights a year.</p>
