          <p>The upcoming boxing match between Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. and Jake Paul is being framed by both fighters as a legitimate and critical contest, not a staged spectacle. For Ch√°vez Jr., son of a boxing legend, the fight represents a chance to revive his career after personal struggles and prove his superior boxing skills. For Paul, a victory would further his quest for legitimacy in the sport beyond his social media fame and silence critics who claim he faces weak opponents. Both men have dismissed any notion of the fight being fixed, insisting that much is on the line for their respective futures in boxing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A chief economist at a major Chinese investment bank argues that China holds a significant "comparative advantage" in the global race to develop stablecoins. This advantage stems from its mature third-party payment platforms, WeChat Pay and Alipay, which already function similarly to stablecoins by being pegged 1:1 with the national currency. The economist, Peng Wensheng, noted that these platforms are backed by central bank money and operate under a well-established regulatory framework. This perspective emerges as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain proactive in the evolving landscape of global digital currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A century-old building that once housed the Russian Consulate in Hakodate, Hokkaido, is being repurposed as a luxury hotel after being vacant for nearly three decades. The iconic redbrick structure, built in 1908, will now be known as Hotel Biaclyn Hakodate. The new establishment is designed as a six-suite wellness retreat, blending the building's original Western architecture with Japanese design elements. The hotel's reopening in July marks a new chapter for the historic landmark overlooking Hakodate Port.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has partnered with the University of Toronto to create a backup plan for its international graduate students who may be barred from the United States. The plan allows affected students at Harvard's Kennedy School to continue their studies as visiting students at Toronto's Munk School if potential U.S. visa restrictions prevent their return. This move comes after the Department of Homeland Security attempted to terminate Harvard's ability to enroll international students, a decision currently blocked by a federal judge. The contingency program aims to provide stability and educational continuity for students amid legal and political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has announced the completion of the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, was performed on a 67-year-old paralyzed patient. Surgeons inserted a stent electrode into the patient's brain vasculature via a neck vein, reportedly helping him regain some limb movement. The approach is presented as a lower-risk alternative that could significantly reduce recovery times for BCI implantation procedures.</p>

Sources close to the player have also refuted suggestions that he is frustrated at the club, noting he signed a new five-year contract last year. Any potential loan move would only occur if all parties agree it is the best step for his long-term development at Chelsea.</p>
