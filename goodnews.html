          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 17:50:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs, despite beating Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The company plans to offset $1 billion of these costs through remediation actions, expecting a net impact of $1.5 billion. Ford cited near-term risks such as potential supply chain disruptions and future tariffs as reasons for pulling the guidance. The tariff impact is notably less than the $4 billion to $5 billion that General Motors said it expected to incur as a result of Trump's tariffs, as Ford imports fewer vehicles than its crosstown rival.</p>

          <p>Digital physical therapy startup Hinge Health updated its prospectus to reveal a 50% revenue increase in the first quarter, reaching $123.8 million, and its first profitable quarter with a net income of $17.1 million. Despite this growth, the company has not yet shared a price range for its IPO, which was initially filed in March. Hinge's attempt to go public occurs during a period of economic uncertainty and market volatility, prompting other companies like Klarna and StubHub to delay their IPOs. Hinge's updated prospectus indicates its intent to proceed with the IPO despite these challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at incentivizing prescription drug manufacturing in the U.S. by streamlining the approval process for pharmaceutical companies to build new production sites. The order directs the FDA to reduce approval times, raise inspection fees for foreign plants, and improve enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting. The White House estimates current timelines of five to ten years for building new manufacturing capacity are unacceptable for national security. Trump stated the goal is to bring medical supply chains back home, especially in light of potential tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, though some companies like Pfizer are pushing back against these tariff plans.</p>

          <p>Hims & Hers Health reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, but shares fell in extended trading due to a weaker-than-expected outlook.

However, the company's second-quarter revenue forecast of $530 million to $550 million fell short of the $564.6 million expected by analysts.

          <p>A coalition of 17 state attorneys general and Washington, D.C., are suing the Trump administration over an executive order that halts approvals, permits, and loans for wind energy projects. The states argue that Trump lacks the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process and is jeopardizing the development of a power source critical to their economic and climate goals. The lawsuit challenges the order, which paused approvals for both onshore and offshore wind energy projects, and asks a federal judge to declare it unlawful. The administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.</p>

          <p>The classic American breakfast, long a symbol of affordability and abundance, is becoming increasingly expensive due to a combination of factors.

While some elements like toast and bacon may remain relatively stable, the rising costs are challenging the affordability that defined the American breakfast. The defining characteristic of the American breakfast is not bacon and eggs, or toast or coffee, but its affordability.</p>
