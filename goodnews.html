          <p>China's top intelligence agency has cautioned former state employees with access to sensitive information about the risks of leaking state secrets, emphasizing that managing these workers post-employment is critical for national security. The Ministry of State Security highlighted the importance of vigilance to ensure information security, citing a case where an individual named Feng was imprisoned for leaking secrets after being lured by a foreign espionage agency with a consulting fee. Feng maintained ties with former colleagues and accessed classified information in a critical industry sector. The ministry urged former employees not to view declassification periods as freedom or career shackles, but to remain aware of their responsibilities to national security. The article emphasizes China's focus on preventing espionage and protecting state secrets. </p>

          <p>King Charles III's visit to Canada is intended to highlight Canada's sovereignty in response to suggestions from U.S. President Donald Trump about annexing the country. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda for the new Parliament, which is a rare occurrence. The King's visit is meant to demonstrate the differences between Canada and the U.S., emphasizing Canada's history as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system. While Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, Carney hopes the visit will send a clear message about Canada's distinct identity and independence from the United States, particularly in light of Trump's remarks and actions. The article explains the historical context of Canada's relationship with Britain and the significance of the King's role in the Canadian government. </p>

          <p>China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has criticized the Australian government's plan to end a Chinese firm's control of the Darwin Port, calling it "questionable." Landbridge Group, a Chinese company, was granted a 99-year lease of the port in 2015, a deal that is now under scrutiny due to national interest concerns. Xiao argued that Landbridge Group has made significant investments in maintaining and building the port, contributing to the local economy. He expressed hope that Australia would view the project objectively and foster mutual trust, urging the Australian government to create a fair business environment for Chinese companies.

Relations soured after Canada accused India of orchestrating the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Khalistan supporter, and both countries expelled top diplomats.

The ban, effective Wednesday, targets large knives with blades exceeding 20 centimeters, excluding kitchen knives. Possession of a machete will be banned from September 1, punishable by up to two years in prison and a fine of over $30,700. This decision makes Victoria the only Australian state or territory planning such a ban, aiming to reduce knife crimes amid Australia's already strict gun laws.

          <p>Businesses are finding a way to minimize the impact of tariffs by using a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule." This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions. For example, a U.S. retailer can pay the import duty on the initial price of a good from a factory to a vendor, rather than the vendor's inflated price. The first sale rule has gained renewed attention under President Trump's tariff regime. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tencent and Baidu, two of China's largest technology companies, are revealing strategies to continue competing in the global artificial intelligence race despite U.S. restrictions on key semiconductors. These strategies include stockpiling chips, enhancing the efficiency of AI models, and utilizing domestically produced semiconductors. Tencent reports having a "pretty strong stockpile" of GPUs and is optimizing software to improve efficiency in inferencing. Baidu is touting its "full-stack" capabilities, combining cloud computing infrastructure, AI models, and applications, and also emphasized progress made by domestic Chinese technology firms in AI semiconductors.

          <p>After 80 years, four crew members of the WWII bomber Heaven Can Wait, which crashed off New Guinea in 1944, are finally coming home. Their remains were recovered following a family-led investigation and a Navy recovery mission. The co-pilot managed a final salute to flyers in an adjacent plane before crashing into the water, killing all 11 men aboard. The ceremonies are happening 12 years after one of Kelly's relatives, Scott Althaus, set out to solve the mystery of where exactly the plane went down. The return of Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, 1st Lt. Herbert Tennyson, and 2nd Lt. Donald Sheppick provides closure and honors their sacrifice. </p>
