          <p>Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo, has secured a permit to begin testing its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The rollout will occur in phases, starting with employee testing where a human safety driver will be present, before transitioning to a fully driverless commercial service for the public. This expansion follows similar successful deployments at airports in Phoenix and San Jose, marking a significant step for the company as it integrates its autonomous vehicle technology into major transportation hubs in the Bay Area.</p>

Each player scored a goal and provided an assist for the other, highlighting the strategic depth of the squad. Manager Mikel Arteta praised the impact of his "finishers," a term borrowed from rugby, emphasizing that players starting on the bench will be crucial for changing games and securing wins throughout the season. The performance was a significant confidence boost for Martinelli, who had recently faced criticism for a dip in form.</p>

The three-day trip includes significant pageantry, such as a formal welcome by the Royal Family, a military flypast, and a state banquet. On the political front, Trump is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers to discuss key issues. The visit occurs as the UK grapples with its own political divisions, making the high-profile diplomatic event a delicate affair for the British government.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued another extension for the enforcement of a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S., pushing the deadline to December 16. This fourth delay comes as U.S. and Chinese officials have reportedly reached a framework agreement to resolve the dispute over the app's ownership by the Chinese company ByteDance. The proposed deal would see an investor consortium, including Oracle and Silver Lake, take control of TikTok's U.S. operations, addressing national security concerns about data privacy. Final details are expected to be confirmed in an upcoming discussion between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to 6.13%, its lowest point since late 2022, as investors anticipate an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. This decline precedes a key Fed meeting where a cut is widely expected to be announced. However, some financial experts caution that long-term rates may not be significantly impacted by a short-term cut in a non-recessionary environment, suggesting rates could potentially rise again after the official announcement.

          <h2>NASA Reports Unexpected Increase in Solar Activity After Decades of Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 16:20:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NASA scientists have announced that solar activity has been unexpectedly increasing since 2008, reversing a decades-long trend of decline. This shift could lead to more frequent space weather events like solar storms and flares, which have the potential to disrupt spacecraft, satellite communications, and even power grids on Earth. The sun's behavior, which typically follows an 11-year cycle, had been at its weakest point on record, leading scientists to predict a prolonged quiet period. The reversal has prompted NASA to launch new missions to better monitor and predict space weather patterns.</p>

          <p>Panama has unveiled its "Vision 2025–2035" strategy, a major initiative to revamp the Panama Canal to maintain its competitiveness amid changes in global trade.

These projects are designed to accommodate the rising demand for energy products, particularly from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Asia. Canal administrator Ricardo Vazquez Morales emphasized that these upgrades are essential to prevent losing business to alternative shipping routes as global energy demands are expected to double.</p>

          <p>A controversial legislative provision that would have given the Secretary of State the authority to revoke the passports of U.S. citizens accused of supporting terrorist organizations has been withdrawn by its sponsor. The measure, part of a broader State Department reform bill, faced intense criticism from civil liberties advocates who feared it could be used to target pro-Palestinian activists and other political dissidents. The chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee filed an amendment to remove the language, stating that the committee did not want the issue to overshadow other bipartisan efforts within the bill.</p>
