          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued without any visible injuries after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, part of the Clearwater Project, with the collapse happening several miles from the tunnel's only access point. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed its Urban Search and Rescue teams in a massive response effort. The workers managed to climb over a large pile of dirt to reach safety, averting a potential tragedy in the seven-mile-long construction project.</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has authorized Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as a cost-cutting measure. This reform to the Universal Service Obligation (USO) is a response to the declining volume of letter mail, which has driven up costs. Under the new rules, first-class letters will still be delivered six days a week, but second-class mail will be limited to every other weekday. Ofcom has also adjusted delivery targets to balance service and financial viability for the postal service.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the potential to become a safe-haven currency, citing the country's institutional credibility and stable macroeconomic fundamentals. In a recent article, Sheng Songcheng noted that the yuan has shown resilience and reduced sensitivity to global risk indicators, such as the war in Ukraine and U.S. tariffs. The argument suggests that with greater capital-control flexibility and foreign participation, the yuan could offer an alternative to traditional safe-haven currencies. This debate gains relevance as confidence in the dollar is tested by U.S. debt and protectionist policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is witnessing the rapid emergence of a massive market for weight-loss drugs, estimated to be worth around $150 billion, as dozens of domestic producers compete for a share. This growth mirrors trends in the West, driven by rising obesity rates, the approval of new, more effective medications, and celebrity endorsements. Innovent Biologics, a Jiangsu-based firm, became the first domestic company to receive approval to market such a drug in the country. The article explores the dynamics of this nascent but quickly expanding pharmaceutical sector in China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is often cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its extensive and stable social housing system, which comprises about 43% of the city's housing stock. This system, originating from the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s, provides affordable, high-quality housing to a broad range of income levels, not just the poor. The large social sector helps to keep rent levels down across the entire market, including in the private sector. While the model faces challenges regarding accessibility for newcomers, it demonstrates how long-term political commitment to non-market housing can effectively address affordability crises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology have successfully created a cyborg bee by developing the world's lightest insect brain controller. Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is strapped to the bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain. These pulses create illusions that command the bee's flight, allowing researchers to direct it to turn, advance, or retreat. In tests, the bee obeyed the commands with a 90% success rate, marking a significant advancement in micro-robotics and bio-integrated technology.</p>

          <p>A section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in September 2023, has been installed as a permanent public memorial in Northumberland. The trunk is now the centerpiece of an exhibition at The Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre, located near where the tree once stood by Hadrian's Wall. The installation, designed by artist Charlie Whinney, allows visitors to touch and interact with the trunk, which is surrounded by benches inscribed with public messages of hope and remembrance. This new chapter for the beloved tree follows the conviction of two men for its destruction.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is implementing new measures to address persistent labor market pressures by offering a one-off subsidy to companies that hire unemployed youth. Employers who hire individuals aged 16 to 24 and meet certain conditions will receive up to 1,500 yuan per new hire. This policy, effective until the end of the year, is part of a broader effort to stabilize employment amid slow economic growth. Additionally, China's economic planner has allocated 10 billion yuan to expand a "work-for-relief" program aimed at creating jobs through public works projects.</p>

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the North American cereal maker, soared over 50% in after-hours trading amid reports that Italian confectioner Ferrero is close to a takeover deal. The acquisition of the company, which produces cereals like Fruit Loops and Rice Krispies, is reportedly valued at around $3 billion. Ferrero, the owner of brands like Nutella and Kinder, has been actively expanding its portfolio in recent years. This potential deal would give the Italian firm a dominant position in the U.S. breakfast cereal market as food companies face shifting consumer preferences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its policy interest rate at 2.5%, choosing to pause while it assesses the impact of recent government measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% annually in June, prompting authorities to address the rapid expansion of household debt. While the broader economy has shown signs of slowing, the central bank is prioritizing financial stability over stimulating growth. Analysts expect a rate cut later in the year, but the bank remains cautious due to high household debt levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of thirteen brown pelicans, who were poisoned during Southern California's most severe toxic algal bloom in nearly a decade, have been successfully treated and released back into the wild. The bloom, which began in January, sickened hundreds of seabirds and other marine animals with domoic acid. The recovered pelicans were cared for at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach. Their release, witnessed by community members, serves as a hopeful symbol of resilience amid the growing environmental threat posed by increasingly frequent and intense algal blooms.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA, following the withdrawal of his previous nominee, Jared Isaacman. The president pulled Isaacman's nomination citing a review of "prior associations" and later explained his concerns about Isaacman's past political donations and his professional relationship with Elon Musk. Duffy, a member of Trump's cabinet, will now lead the space agency at a critical time as it pursues its goals of returning astronauts to the Moon. This marks another instance of a Trump official serving in a dual-hatted role.</p>
