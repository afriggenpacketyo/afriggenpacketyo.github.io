          <p>The Nobel Peace Prize, an international award honoring significant contributions to world peace, is set to be announced this week. Established by Alfred Nobel, the prize is awarded by a Norwegian committee to individuals or organizations for efforts in areas like international fraternity, arms reduction, and human rights. Former President Donald Trump, who has been nominated for his diplomatic efforts during his second term, has expressed that he believes he is deserving of the award, though experts consider his chances unlikely despite precedent for early-term presidential wins.</p>

          <p>Approximately 900 hikers, guides, and support staff who were stranded by a weekend blizzard on the Chinese side of Mount Everest have all been brought to safety. The storm trapped the group in tents at an altitude of over 16,000 feet, cutting off access to the area. A rescue operation was launched, with some individuals suffering from hypothermia, but authorities confirmed that all stranded people had been safely evacuated by Tuesday, concluding a dangerous situation that arose during a popular weeklong holiday.</p>

          <p>Freida Parton has clarified that she did not intend to cause widespread alarm after a social media post asking for prayers for her sister, country music icon Dolly Parton, sparked concern among fans. She explained that the 79-year-old singer has been feeling "a little under the weather" and that her request was simply a sister's appeal for positive thoughts, not an indication of a severe health crisis. This follows Dolly Parton's recent postponement of a Las Vegas residency due to a kidney stone and other unspecified health challenges.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has begun a two-day visit to India, leading a large trade delegation to promote the free trade agreement signed between the two nations in July. The deal aims to significantly boost bilateral trade by reducing tariffs on a range of goods, including British whiskey and cars, and eliminating tariffs on 99% of Indian exports to the UK, notably textiles. Starmer emphasized the "huge opportunities" the pact provides and urged businesses to seize them, with both governments aiming for swift implementation.</p>

          <p>Shares of major European steel producers, including SSAB, Thyssenkrupp, and ArcelorMittal, surged following the European Commission's proposal to slash tariff-free steel import quotas and hike tariffs. The move is designed to protect the European steel industry from cheap imports and global overcapacity. Conversely, the automotive sector experienced a downturn, with stocks for companies like BMW and Mercedes-Benz falling amid concerns that the tariffs will significantly increase production costs for vehicle manufacturers.

          <p>China's Ministry of Transport anticipates that the eight-day 'Golden Week' national holiday will see a record-breaking number of journeys, with total trips projected to exceed 2.4 billion. This figure represents a 6.2% increase from the same holiday period last year, signaling a robust rebound in domestic travel and economic activity. To manage the surge, the national railway operator has added nearly 1,900 additional trains, with tickets on popular routes like Shenzhen-Guangzhou and Shanghai-Beijing selling out quickly as citizens travel across the country.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has announced a new economic "golden rule" as a cornerstone of her party's platform. The proposed rule would mandate that half of all savings achieved by a future Conservative government be allocated to reducing the national deficit, with the remaining half used to fund pro-growth policies, including tax cuts. In her speech, Badenoch will frame this as a plan for fiscal responsibility, aiming to contrast her party's approach with what she describes as the Labour government's unsustainable "borrowing and tax doom loop."</p>

          <p>Australian cricket captain Pat Cummins is facing uncertainty over his availability for the upcoming Ashes series against England due to a recurring back stress issue. While reports suggest the key fast bowler may miss the first Test and potentially the entire series, the Australian team has stated that no final decision has been made as he continues his rehabilitation. The potential absence of Cummins, a talismanic leader and one of the world's premier bowlers, would be a significant blow to Australia's chances of retaining the Ashes.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of consumers affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal, with estimated average payouts of around £700 per claim. The redress scheme targets 14 million motor finance agreements made between 2007 and 2024 that involved unfair discretionary commission arrangements, which led to customers being overcharged for their loans. The total compensation bill for lenders could reach £8.2 billion as the regulator seeks to provide fair redress for affected car buyers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully demonstrated a new method that may significantly increase the availability of kidneys for transplantation by converting their blood type to the universal O-type. The technique uses enzymes to remove blood type antigens from the lining of the organ's blood vessels, which can prevent rejection by a recipient's immune system. This breakthrough could dramatically reduce waiting lists and improve equitable organ allocation by overcoming the barrier of blood-type incompatibility, making more efficient use of the limited pool of donor organs.</p>
