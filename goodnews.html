          <p>CBS News reports that one of the two eaglets, Sunny, of the famed bald eagle parents Jackie and Shadow, has taken its first flight from their nest in Big Bear, California. The eaglet was seen jumping off a branch, flapping her wings, and flying away, marking a significant milestone in her development. While it's unclear where Sunny flew, young eagles often return to the nest shortly after their initial flight, and the other eaglet, Gizmo, is expected to fledge soon. Both eaglets will remain in the habitat for one to three months before venturing out on their own.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS News explores the reasons why opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) this June could be a wise financial move. With potential rate cuts looming, securing a fixed interest rate now can protect against future market volatility. A long-term CD guarantees a steady interest rate, regardless of market changes, and offers the potential to earn significant interest over time. Savers can earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest, depending on the CD term and rate. (not investment advice)</p>
