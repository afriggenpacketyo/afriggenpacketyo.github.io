          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 13:11:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Independent rural hospitals across the United States are forming clinically integrated networks to pool resources and negotiate better prices for services like mobile MRI units. This collaborative model allows smaller hospitals to remain autonomous while gaining the collective bargaining power of larger systems. These networks, such as the Rough Rider Network in North Dakota, focus on sharing specialists, investing in community health projects, and securing value-based care contracts. By combining their patient numbers, these hospitals can save money on essential services and improve health outcomes, offering a viable alternative to closing down or being acquired by major health corporations.</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been released from the hospital and is reportedly recovering well after a car crash in New Hampshire. The incident occurred when the vehicle he was a passenger in was struck from behind on Interstate 93. Prior to the crash, Giuliani and his associate had stopped to assist a woman who reported being a victim of domestic violence. New Hampshire State Police are investigating the collision, noting that the other driver was not connected to the domestic violence incident and that distraction may have been a factor. Giuliani was treated for a fractured thoracic vertebrae and other injuries.</p>

          <p>Producer and writer Issa Rae is executive producing "Seen and Heard: The History of Black Television," a two-part HBO documentary exploring the evolution of Black representation in television. The series features interviews with media icons like Oprah Winfrey and Shonda Rhimes, examining how Black creators have shaped the industry while facing significant obstacles. Rae notes that while the 1990s were a strong period for Black shows, representation has fluctuated, often diminishing when networks aim for a "broad" audience. The documentary also emphasizes the importance of having Black professionals behind the camera to ensure authentic storytelling and cultural details.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated that he believes the company's humanoid robot, Optimus, will eventually account for approximately 80% of Tesla's total value. This projection reinforces his earlier prediction that Optimus could transform Tesla into a $25 trillion company, shifting focus toward artificial intelligence and robotics amid a current slump in electric vehicle sales. While Tesla is testing robotaxis, it faces significant competition in both autonomous driving and humanoid robotics from established players like Waymo and Boston Dynamics. The company aims to begin pilot production of Optimus in its Fremont factory in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Qualifying for a reverse mortgage, a loan that allows homeowners to convert home equity into cash, involves several key requirements set by the federal government for its most common version, the HECM. A prospective borrower must be at least 62 years old, use the property as their primary residence, and have substantial home equity. Lenders also conduct a financial assessment to ensure the borrower can afford ongoing costs like property taxes and insurance, and mandatory counseling is required to ensure comprehension of the loan's terms. While credit scores are not a primary factor, a stable financial history is crucial for approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, making it one of the consumer goods company's top five active investors. In a letter to Pepsi's board, Elliott outlined an agenda aimed at revitalizing the business, which it claims has underperformed, creating a "historic opportunity" for value creation. The firm believes its proposed changes, including refranchising bottling operations and divesting non-core assets, could lead to a 50% increase in shareholder value. PepsiCo has acknowledged Elliott's investment and stated it will review the firm's perspectives as part of its ongoing strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.21 trillion, more consumers are seeking relief options like forbearance, which allows for a temporary pause or reduction in payments. To qualify, individuals typically need to demonstrate a legitimate financial hardship, such as job loss, a significant income reduction, or a major unexpected expense. A consistent payment history prior to the hardship is also a key factor for lenders. For those who do not qualify, alternatives include debt consolidation loans, debt management plans negotiated by credit counseling agencies, or other hardship programs offered by card issuers.

          <p>Bitcoin's price increased slightly on Tuesday, showing a modest divergence from a broader stock market sell-off, while gold surged to a new record high. The cryptocurrency reclaimed the $111,000 level as traditional markets reacted to concerns over the legality of U.S. global tariffs and a jump in bond yields. Analysts note that while gold is benefiting from its traditional safe-haven status, Bitcoin's performance has been partly tempered by a market rotation into other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The differing movements highlight a market seeking both safety in traditional assets and yield in the digital asset space. (not investment advice)</p>
