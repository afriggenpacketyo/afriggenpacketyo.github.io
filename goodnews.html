        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are navigating President Trump's increased tariffs, employing creative strategies to avoid significant price hikes for consumers. While some costs have been absorbed or passed on, the overall impact has been less severe than initially feared, and consumer spending remains largely steady, albeit with lower-income households showing more price sensitivity. Companies are diversifying sourcing, negotiating with vendors, and being strategic about price adjustments to mitigate tariff effects, which are expected to continue through the fiscal year.

Despite concerns about job displacement, experts predict AI will create millions of new roles and democratize access to jobs by providing advanced tools. However, a recent MIT report indicates that 95% of generative AI implementations have yet to boost revenue, suggesting success often requires redesigning workflows or is found in early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs.

          <p>Gold has reached record highs this year, driven by inflation and tariff concerns, solidifying its role as a safe-haven asset. Gold-focused Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are experiencing significant inflows globally, particularly from American and Asian investors, making it easier for portfolios to hedge against risk. Experts note that while gold ETFs are a growing segment, physical gold ownership and over-the-counter trading also continue to expand. The article suggests there's still considerable room for increased allocation to gold ETFs as a percentage of overall equity portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Novelist Lauren Groff undertook a journey to Kyoto, Japan, seeking insights into Lady Murasaki, the enigmatic author of "The Tale of Genji," often considered the world's first novel. Amidst modern "overtourism," Groff found profound connections to medieval Japan not just in historical sites, but through sensory experiences and spiritual epiphanies, such as a hot bath or a tea ceremony. Her exploration reveals a personal, experiential approach to understanding history and her own fiction, which often reinterprets religious themes through a lens of care for nature.

          <h2>Canada Removes Many Retaliatory Tariffs on US Goods, Maintains Levies on Key Sectors</h2>

          <p>Canada announced it would drop billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, effective September 1st, following a productive call between Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump. However, tariffs on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum will remain in place. This move aims to re-establish free trade for the majority of goods between the two nations, aligning with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The decision is a significant step towards resolving ongoing trade disputes, which had seen Canada impose 25% levies on about C$30 billion worth of U.S. products in response to U.S. tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's definitively dovish speech at Jackson Hole signaled likely interest rate cuts, causing the market to rally significantly, particularly cyclical stocks. Powell indicated that while tariff-driven inflation might be a one-time hit, rising downside risks to employment are a greater concern. This led to increased confidence in multiple rate cuts this year, with the odds of a September cut jumping to 91%. Consumer discretionary, real estate, industrials, and materials sectors are leading gains, reflecting investor focus on companies benefiting from increased economic activity spurred by cheaper borrowing costs.

          <p>Over 2,000-year-old artifacts, including ancient statues and Roman coins, have been retrieved from a sunken city in Abu Qir Bay, off Egypt's coast. Authorities believe the site is an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, submerged by earthquakes and rising sea levels. Notable finds include limestone structures, royal figures, and a partially preserved sphinx with the cartouche of Ramses II. This discovery offers invaluable insights into the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, though the modern city of Alexandria faces similar threats from climate change and rising sea levels, risking its own submersion by 2050.</p>

          <p>The 2025 summer box office surpassed last year's figures, reaching an estimated $3.75 billion, driven by franchise titles like "Lilo & Stitch" and "Superman." Despite hopes of reaching the pre-pandemic $4 billion mark, no single film achieved the blockbuster status of previous years, leading to a mix of hits and underperformers. While theater operators reported solid numbers, a significant cooldown is expected through October, with box office analysts not anticipating a major breakout hit until late November. However, the final months of the year, with releases like "Wicked: For Good" and "Avatar: Fire and Ash," are projected to be stellar.</p>

          <p>As extreme heat waves intensify, green spaces are recognized as crucial for combating their disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, particularly people of color and low-income residents. Decades of discriminatory housing policies like redlining have left these neighborhoods with fewer trees and hotter temperatures. Environmental justice advocates and nonprofits are actively working to increase tree canopy and create community gardens, which not only lower temperatures but also foster community well-being. Data-driven initiatives are helping cities redesign infrastructure, like bus stops, to provide much-needed heat relief.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent hints at potential interest rate cuts signal good news for homeowners considering mortgage refinancing. Mortgage rates typically track 10-year Treasury yields, which are sensitive to monetary policy changes. Experts suggest that if the Fed cuts rates, borrowing costs for home loans could decrease, benefiting both homebuyers and those looking to refinance. Homeowners are advised to monitor rate movements, assess their credit reports and home equity, and prepare necessary documents to act quickly when favorable refinancing opportunities arise.
