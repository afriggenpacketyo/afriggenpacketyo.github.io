          <p>The Israeli military has been directed to advance its readiness to implement the first phase of a Gaza peace proposal outlined by President Donald Trump, which focuses on the release of hostages. This development follows a statement from Hamas indicating its agreement to release all Israeli hostages as part of the deal. The Israel Defense Forces emphasized that the safety of its troops is a top priority during this sensitive period, instructing them to maintain high alertness. An official noted that Israeli forces have adopted a defensive-only posture within Gaza, ceasing active strikes for the time being.</p>

          <p>Despite the federal government shutdown entering its third day, the U.S. stock market demonstrated notable strength, with the S&P 500 achieving a new record high. The healthcare sector led the gains, buoyed by a deal exempting Pfizer from pharmaceutical tariffs, which sparked a relief rally in drugmaker stocks like Eli Lilly and Danaher. The technology sector also performed well, with Nvidia reaching record highs, as the artificial intelligence trade continues to attract investors. This market performance suggests that investors currently view the shutdown as a minor political event with limited economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts are advising U.S. investors to consider increasing their exposure to overseas markets, even as domestic stock indexes reach record highs. They argue that a strong "home bias" has led many to overlook better value and long-term growth opportunities available in international and emerging markets. Countries like China and India are highlighted as having significant potential, driven by large populations, favorable demographics, and rapid economic growth. For instance, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF recently hit a 52-week high, indicating growing momentum in these regions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key components of the Gaza ceasefire deal proposed by President Trump, including the release of all hostages. However, the group indicated that other aspects of the plan require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian national framework. In response, both President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed optimism, with Israel preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. An official reported that Israel has shifted to a defensive-only military posture in Gaza, signaling a potential de-escalation of the conflict.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district court judge has raised concerns that the Justice Department's human smuggling case against Kilmar Ábrego García may constitute illegal retaliation. This follows Ábrego García's successful lawsuit against the Trump administration for his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. Judge Waverly Crenshaw granted a hearing to review evidence of vindictive prosecution, citing "remarkable statements" by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to link the charges to Ábrego García's legal victory. The case highlights the ongoing partisan conflict over the administration's aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off its protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities, ending days of violent demonstrations that resulted in at least 10 deaths. The government agreed to the protesters' demands, which included subsidies for wheat and electricity, as well as commitments to improve public services. The protests, led by the Awami Action Committee, were driven by public anger over the high cost of living and lucrative benefits for the political elite. The deal was brokered after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sent a high-level delegation to negotiate with protest leaders.</p>

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher shared the story of how he was persuaded to leave a successful career at Microsoft in 1996 to join a small online startup called Amazon. Risher recalled that Bill Gates called it the "stupidest decision" he had ever heard, but he was won over by Jeff Bezos's customer-centric obsession and his bold vision for the company's growth. Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000, a goal it surpassed a year ahead of schedule. Risher, who became Amazon's 37th employee, found the opportunity to be part of that rapid expansion incredibly compelling.</p>

This creates a digital time capsule filled with memories, stories, and advice that the children can access when they are older. The expert notes that she writes on birthdays, during special or silly moments, and even during difficult times to show that love is constant.

In a film accompanying the album's release, Swift described the song as a "love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the amount of attention, even if negative, to be flattering.
