          <p>China has completed key technology checks for its experimental satellite, Chutian-001, designed for very low Earth orbit (VLEO), marking progress toward a 300-satellite constellation for remote sensing and communications. The bullet-shaped satellite is designed to reduce atmospheric drag, a major challenge for spacecraft operating below 300km. VLEO satellites offer advantages like lower signal latency and stronger transmission, but require frequent thruster firings to counteract drag. This project is part of China's effort to expand its commercial space sector, with the Chutian constellation slated for deployment in three phases.</p>

          <p>President Trump clarified that the Boeing 747 offered by Qatar will be given to the Department of Defense, not to him personally, in response to questions about the legality of accepting a gift from a foreign power.

Some Democrats have called for an ethics investigation, arguing the gift violates the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution.
