          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, marking a potential shift in their strained relationship following deadly border clashes in 2020. Facing economic challenges, including U.S. tariffs, both nations are exploring reluctant cooperation despite deep-seated mistrust and significant trade imbalances favoring China. While experts remain skeptical of a long-term friendship, the summit could signal a mutual willingness to find common ground on economic issues, highlighted by India's heavy reliance on Chinese supply chains for key industries like pharmaceuticals and electric vehicles. The meeting's outcome will indicate the future trajectory of the complex Sino-Indian dynamic.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed the media to justify the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating it gives the team a "chance to be a better team." Jones emphasized that acquiring Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark helps address the team's long-standing weakness in stopping the run. In addition to Clark, the Cowboys received two future first-round draft picks, which Jones believes provides valuable assets for strengthening the roster. The move came after stalled contract negotiations, though Jones maintained there were no hard feelings with Parsons.</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists are studying the DNA of ancient oak trees, some over 800 years old, to understand their remarkable resilience to threats like climate change and disease. The project, led by UK charities The Woodland Trust and the Arboricultural Association, aims to identify the specific genes responsible for their longevity and hardiness. By sequencing the genomes of about 50 of Britain's most well-known ancient oaks, researchers hope to select the best specimens for future planting. This knowledge could prove vital for restoring the nation's woodlands and supporting the vast ecosystems that depend on these iconic trees.</p>

Launched in 1947, WDIA became a vital community institution, providing not only music but also news, information, and a platform for Black voices during the Civil Rights era and beyond. The station played a key role in community organizing, including fundraising to preserve the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Johnson continues this legacy, connecting listeners with essential resources and information, solidifying the station's role as a community lifeline.</p>

          <p>Starting in January 2026, the National Health Service (NHS) will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales, a measure that brings the UK in line with many other countries. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously available only through private payment, the move is expected to protect children from rare but severe complications of the virus. Officials also hope it will reduce the economic impact of the illness, which costs an estimated £24 million annually in lost productivity from parents taking time off work.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka has advanced to the third round of the US Open with a decisive 6-3, 6-1 victory, continuing her strong performance on the court. Her recent success follows a controversial final in Montreal, where she was criticized for her runner-up speech, an event she says left her feeling shame and guilt. Despite the off-court difficulties, Osaka has now won eight of her last nine matches and appears to be regaining the form that saw her win two previous US Open titles. She also commented on the recent Jelena Ostapenko controversy, describing Ostapenko's remarks towards Taylor Townsend as ill-timed and particularly hurtful in the context of the sport.</p>

          <p>George Clooney's new film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, with some critics hailing it as a "midlife crisis masterpiece." In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney plays an aging, hugely successful movie star grappling with the personal sacrifices made for his career, a role that draws parallels to his own life. The film follows the character as he abruptly abandons a film shoot to reconnect with his family, forcing his entourage, including a manager played by Adam Sandler, to follow. Early reviews are polarized, but Clooney's subtle performance is generating early awards season buzz.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire the director of Voice of America (VOA), Michael Abramowitz, without the approval of a congressionally mandated advisory panel. The judge stated that Lake was breaking the law in her attempt to remove Abramowitz, as the law is designed to insulate the international broadcaster from political pressure. Because President Trump dismissed most of the panel's members and has not named replacements, the legal requirement for its backing cannot be met. This ruling is a significant development in the ongoing legal battles over Lake's efforts to dismantle VOA and its parent agency.</p>
