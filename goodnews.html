        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial rule of thumb, known as the "$1,000 a month rule," offers a tangible way for individuals to plan for retirement. Based on the established 4% withdrawal rate, the guideline suggests that a person needs to save between $240,000 and $300,000 to generate $1,000 in monthly income during retirement without depleting their principal. This approach helps transform abstract savings goals into concrete targets, emphasizing the importance of early saving and the power of compound interest. The article also discusses supplementary retirement income strategies, such as annuities and reverse mortgages, to bridge potential financial gaps. (not investment advice)</p>

One notable absence was Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who stated he was invited but could not attend. The event highlights the administration's ongoing efforts to cultivate relationships with Silicon Valley executives. This gathering follows recent public comments from President Trump predicting that Musk, despite a prior falling out, would eventually align with the Republican Party due to his "common sense."</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old from New Hampshire caught a massive 177-pound Atlantic halibut during a deep-sea fishing trip, a fish that outweighs him by nearly 60 pounds. Jackson Denio was on an overnight charter trip about 100 miles off the coast in the Gulf of Maine when he made the potentially record-breaking catch. After a 30-minute struggle, he successfully reeled in the giant fish with guidance from the boat's crew and cheers from fellow passengers. The captain of the vessel praised the teenager's composure and determination throughout the impressive ordeal.</p>

          <p>In his new book, neurosurgeon and CNN correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the complex nature of pain and strategies for managing it. He explains how the brain can sometimes make mistakes in processing pain signals, such as in cases of phantom limb or referred pain, and discusses how the mind can be trained to minimize certain types of pain through meditation. The article highlights a new FDA-approved non-opioid medication called Suzetrigine, which was developed after decades of research into a unique genetic trait found in a family of Pakistani circus performers who were insensitive to pain.</p>

          <p>Quantinuum, the quantum computing company majority-owned by Honeywell, has raised an additional $600 million in funding, doubling its valuation to approximately $10 billion. This successful capital raise, which included participation from Nvidia's venture arm, positions the firm for a highly anticipated initial public offering planned for 2027. Honeywell's CFO expressed excitement about the development, stating that an IPO is the ultimate goal for the business. A successful public offering would validate Honeywell's long-term investment in the nascent but promising field of quantum computing, potentially unlocking significant value for shareholders.

The initiative aims to provide the twice-yearly injection, which offers nearly complete protection against HIV, to as many as 2 million people by 2028, focusing on countries with major epidemics. This move signals a renewed U.S. commitment to global HIV prevention after recent foreign aid cuts under the Trump administration severely impacted related programs. The partnership involves the Global Fund and the drug's manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, to ensure availability in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is anticipating Friday's August jobs report, which is expected to show the U.S. economy added a modest 75,000 jobs. Investors are hoping for a number that is cool enough to support a Federal Reserve interest rate cut but not so weak as to heighten fears of a recession. The report will also face intense scrutiny as it is the first to be released after President Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over last month's data. A weaker-than-expected ADP private employment report on Thursday has set a cautious tone for the official government figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new bill introduced by Democrats, titled the "You Earn It, You Keep It Act," aims to permanently eliminate all federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. To offset the cost and bolster the program's finances, the proposal would also apply the Social Security payroll tax to all annual earnings above $250,000. This approach differs from the recent Republican tax law, which provides a temporary, income-limited deduction for seniors. Proponents claim this new bill would extend the solvency of the Social Security trust funds by 24 years, ensuring full benefits could be paid until 2058. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that President Trump unlawfully imposed sweeping tariffs could mean American businesses are entitled to tens of billions of dollars in refunds. The court found the president lacked the authority to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for such broad levies. However, the administration has asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, creating uncertainty for businesses. If the ruling is upheld, the government would have to establish a process for refunding the more than $70 billion collected from these specific country-based tariffs, though it is unclear if this would be automatic.
