          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at the age of 94. Rangel's career spanned decades, beginning in 1970 when he was elected to Congress, eventually becoming the dean of New York's congressional delegation. Despite facing an ethics violation that led to his censure, he remained a powerful voice for Harlem and played a key role in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for Senate. The article highlights his influence as a politician who championed economic development and social justice, even though he sometimes faced criticism for being too pragmatic.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of spaceflight to understand and mitigate the impact of rocket launches, particularly those by SpaceX. As launches become more frequent, the noise generated by rockets and returning boosters is causing concern among nearby communities. Researchers are analyzing sonic booms and other sounds to determine acceptable noise levels and develop strategies to reduce disruptions, especially as SpaceX tests its Starship rocket, which is expected to be the loudest yet.</p>
