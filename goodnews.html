          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, one of the world's most active, has erupted for the 31st time since December. The eruption, contained within the summit crater, poses no threat to homes but offers a spectacular view for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists are monitoring the volcano's activity, noting that while the lava fountains have been shorter recently, the eruption's future behavior remains uncertain. The event holds cultural significance for Native Hawaiians, who see the lava as a natural resource connected to the volcano goddess Pele.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal grant funding from 34 cities and counties designated as "sanctuary" jurisdictions. The ruling halts the administration's attempt to penalize these localities for their policies of non-cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The decision affects hundreds of millions of dollars in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants. This legal setback for the administration comes as the Department of Justice continues to challenge sanctuary policies in various states and cities across the country.</p>

          <p>A new FDA-approved technology called the Vivistim System is offering hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their recovery. The system involves a small implant that stimulates the vagus nerve during rehabilitation exercises, which enhances the brain's ability to rewire itself and improve motor function. This article highlights the story of a 72-year-old restaurateur who, months after a stroke, regained significant movement in his previously paralyzed arm after receiving the implant. Neurosurgeons believe this technology could redefine recovery possibilities for a large population of stroke patients.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With trillions of dollars in real estate expected to be passed down by older generations, wealth advisors are highlighting strategies to minimize family conflict and tax burdens. Experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust at death to allow heirs to benefit from a "step-up in basis," reducing capital gains taxes if they sell. Using structures like Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) can protect the property from lawsuits and creditors. It is also crucial to create a detailed operating agreement for shared properties and set aside liquid assets to cover maintenance costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's Attire at White House Was a Diplomatic Signal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's choice of attire for his recent meeting with President Trump is being interpreted as a form of "wardrobe diplomacy." After being criticized for his "bunker-chic" look during a previous combative visit, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black canvas blazer over a collared shirt. This subtle shift is seen as a deliberate message to engage in serious conversation, moving from a wartime footing to high-stakes diplomacy. The change was noted positively by both President Trump and the media, suggesting that in politics, even clothing can send a powerful message.</p>

          <p>The latest season of the animated series "South Park" is delivering an unrestrained critique of the Trump administration, with direct parodies of the president and his cabinet members. This comes as the show's parent company, Paramount, faces pressure from the administration, having recently settled a lawsuit and agreed to an oversight deal. Despite the politically charged environment, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker are leveraging their show's high ratings and a massive new streaming deal to continue their satirical attacks. Media analysts suggest the show's financial success may be insulating it from the political pressures affecting other media entities.</p>

          <p>In the face of increasingly powerful hurricanes, Florida is seeing a shift toward more resilient community planning and construction. This article highlights Babcock Ranch, a town designed to be "storm-proof," which sustained almost no damage from Hurricane Ian due to its strategic design, including advanced water management and reinforced homes. This contrasts with the devastation in surrounding coastal areas, prompting some residents to move inland to such communities. The article also covers efforts by nonprofits to help lower-income residents in places like Miami rebuild their homes with hurricane-resistant features.</p>

          <p>Coventry City Football Club has announced the purchase of its home ground, the Coventry Building Society (CBS) Arena, from Frasers Group. The club's owner described the acquisition as a "pivotal moment" that safeguards the club's future and allows for investment in facilities and the fan experience. This move ends years of uncertainty for the club and its supporters, who have endured multiple stadium owners and ground-shares since leaving their previous home in 2005. The purchase provides the Championship club with long-term stability and control over its own venue.</p>

          <p>A wave of younger, social media-savvy Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against some of the party's most senior incumbents. Frustrated by what they see as a complacent and out-of-touch party establishment, these challengers argue that longtime lawmakers have failed to respond with sufficient urgency to the threats posed by the Trump administration. They are calling for new energy, a clearer vision, and a more aggressive strategy to connect with voters, especially younger generations. This push for generational change is creating intraparty friction and signals a broader identity crisis within the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>A 75-year-old man has received his high school diploma decades after his education was cut short by the severe abuse he suffered at the Dozier School for Boys. Eddie Horne, who was sent to the notoriously brutal state-run reform school as a teenager in the 1960s, dropped out to support his family after the traumatic experience. He was able to complete his education through a compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. Horne's graduation fulfills a lifelong promise to himself and serves as an inspiration for overcoming adversity.</p>
