          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter series while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's anti-transgender stance. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that the books' core message of rejecting discrimination is valuable, despite their flaws and the author's views. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article suggests engaging with the works critically and in community with other fans. This approach allows for continued appreciation while actively interrogating the problematic aspects of the canon, similar to how religious communities reinterpret sacred texts.</p>
