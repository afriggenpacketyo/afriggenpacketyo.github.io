          <p>Netflix has announced that its ad-supported tier has reached 94 million monthly active users, marking an increase of over 20 million since November. This growth reflects the company's strategy to incorporate advertising to enhance the profitability of its streaming service, which was first introduced in November 2022. The ad-supported plan costs $7.99 per month, offering a significant discount compared to the least expensive ad-free plan at $17.99 per month. Netflix claims that its ad tier attracts more 18- to 34-year-olds than any U.S. broadcast or cable network.</p>

          <p>Shares of eToro, a stock brokerage platform, experienced a significant surge in their Nasdaq debut after the company successfully raised almost $310 million in its initial public offering. The stock opened at $69.69, a 34% increase above its IPO price, pushing its market capitalization to $5.6 billion. The Israel-based company sold nearly six million shares at $52 each, exceeding the expected range of $46 to $50, with existing investors selling an additional six million shares. EToro's IPO is being watched closely by Wall Street as a potential sign of renewed interest in IPOs after a period of market correction, with the company's CEO citing stabilization in market volatility as a key factor in the decision to go public.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher detained by immigration authorities, citing violations of his First and Fifth Amendment rights. Suri, an Indian national, was detained based on alleged connections to a Hamas official and accusations of spreading Hamas propaganda. The judge refuted the government's claims of Suri's ties to Hamas and stated that his detention was caused by his protected First Amendment speech regarding the conflict in Gaza. The ACLU has condemned the detention as an attack on academic freedom, and Georgetown University has expressed support for its community members' rights to free inquiry.</p>

          <p>Joseph Nye, the international affairs scholar who coined the term "soft power," has died at the age of 88. Nye's concept of soft power, which emphasized influence through aid, culture, and human rights promotion, gained prominence in the 1990s and influenced foreign policy circles worldwide. He served in the State Department and Pentagon under Presidents Carter and Clinton and was a critic of Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy. Nye's work challenged the notion that military and economic strength were the only forms of power, advocating for a "smart power" approach that combined hard and soft tactics.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 14:41:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In light of declining credit card debt balances but persistent concerns about interest rates and inflation, borrowers should consider strategic debt consolidation moves. One option is taking out a new loan at a lower interest rate to pay off existing credit card debt, simplifying payments and reducing interest costs. Borrowers should take the initiative to explore options, shop for lenders to find the most cost-effective solution, and determine the right approach, whether through a debt relief company or independently. Alternatives such as a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan should also be considered to potentially lower interest payments.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have moved closer to potential freedom after a judge reduced their sentences for the 1989 killings of their parents from life without parole to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. The brothers, who claimed they killed their parents in self-defense due to long-term sexual abuse, have garnered increased public support in recent years. While the district attorney opposed their resentencing, family members testified in support of their release, citing their rehabilitation and contributions to prison programs. The parole board is expected to make a decision on their release soon.</p>

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have secured a $96 billion agreement to sell Qatar Airways up to 210 aircraft, marking Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order.

The White House estimates that the agreement will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and more than one million total domestic jobs over the course of production and delivery. This deal could be a significant boost for Boeing, which has faced major safety concerns, manufacturing defects, and financial losses in recent years.</p>
