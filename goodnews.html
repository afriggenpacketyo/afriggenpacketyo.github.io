          <p>World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm associated with Donald Trump, revealed plans to introduce new products, including a debit card and tokenized commodities. Speaking at a conference in Singapore, CEO Zach Witkoff and co-founder Donald Trump Jr. outlined the vision to bridge crypto with everyday spending and trade assets like oil and gas on the blockchain. The company's stablecoin, USD1, has already become the fifth-largest globally, reflecting a broader trend of the Trump administration embracing the crypto industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, driven by strong demand for electric vehicles and large SUVs. Sales of all-electric models surged by 30.2% to a new record, while SUV sales grew by nearly 10%. The growth in EV sales was partly attributed to consumers purchasing vehicles before the expiration of federal incentives. However, CEO Jim Farley anticipates a potential drop in EV market share once the incentive program concludes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Idaho determined that a public charter school infringed upon a church's First Amendment rights by canceling its lease for Sunday services. The school, Sage International, terminated the agreement while applying for state-backed bonds, fearing the lease would violate a state amendment preventing public funds from benefiting religious groups. However, Chief U.S. District Judge David Nye ruled that the church would have only benefited incidentally and that the school's action unconstitutionally stifled religious speech. The decision was praised by Idaho's Attorney General as a protection against religious discrimination.</p>

          <p>English striker Harry Kane is enjoying a remarkable start to his season with Bayern Munich, having scored 17 goals in just nine games. This performance makes him the fastest player this century to score 100 goals for a club in one of Europe's top five leagues, achieving the milestone in only 104 games. His current goal-scoring rate surpasses the early-season bests of renowned players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Kane's immediate impact in the Bundesliga has been historic, reaching 70 league goals faster than any other player.</p>

          <p>The British High Court has ordered PPE Medpro, a company connected to entrepreneur Michelle Mone and her husband, to repay the government over £121 million ($163 million) for a breached contract. The court found that the 25 million surgical gowns supplied by the firm during the COVID-19 pandemic were not sterile and therefore could not be used by the National Health Service. The case has become emblematic of wasteful spending on hastily awarded contracts during the pandemic. The new Labour government welcomed the ruling as a step toward clawing back misspent funds.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value rose while most other risk assets fell in response to the U.S. government shutdown, highlighting its growing perception as a store of value during geopolitical turmoil. The leading cryptocurrency traded about 2% higher as investors sought alternatives to traditional markets unsettled by the political impasse in Washington. This trend positions Bitcoin similarly to gold, which also reached a record high, as a safe-haven asset for investors looking to hedge against the economic uncertainty caused by the shutdown.

          <p>A major retrospective at London's Tate Britain museum is celebrating the multifaceted career of American photographer Lee Miller, from her beginnings as a model to her work as a surrealist artist and a groundbreaking war correspondent. The exhibition showcases her artistic evolution, including her collaboration with Man Ray in Paris and her iconic photographs from the front lines of World War II. One of her most famous images captures her in Hitler's bathtub on the day of his death, a testament to her unique, art-informed approach to photojournalism. Miller's work left a significant mark on 20th-century photography.</p>

          <p>The UK government has mandated that every general practitioner practice in England must provide online appointment booking services throughout the workday to address the "8am scramble" for phone appointments. Patients can now use online systems to request non-urgent appointments, ask questions, and describe symptoms between 8:00 AM and 6:30 PM on weekdays. While the government aims to modernize the NHS and free up phone lines, the British Medical Association has raised concerns about a potential "online triage tsunami" and the risk of missing serious health issues.</p>

          <p>Ski areas in Vermont, such as Jay Peak, are using herds of sheep and goats as an eco-friendly solution for clearing overgrown vegetation on their slopes during the off-season. This "livestock landscaping" aims to reduce reliance on gas-powered mowers, lower the carbon footprint of groundskeeping, and prevent soil erosion. The animals are contained by virtual fences using special collars that also transmit data to the herd's owner. This sustainable practice, sometimes called "goatscaping," is gaining traction as an effective and charming alternative to conventional methods.</p>

While national average yields for one- to five-year CDs range from 1.67% to 1.99% APY, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some short-term CDs exceeding 4.25% APY. The piece advises savers to look at online banks and consider short-term CDs, which currently benefit from an inverted yield curve, to secure the best returns. (not investment advice)</p>

Typically, demand for gold increases during economic instability, as it is seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. The price is also inversely related to the strength of the U.S. dollar and can be influenced by central bank policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry appears to be losing its impact following a new drug-pricing agreement with Pfizer. The deal includes a three-year exemption from pharma-specific tariffs for Pfizer in exchange for voluntary price reductions and a $70 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing. This agreement sets a precedent for other major drugmakers to strike similar deals, providing them with a path to avoid the levies. The administration has indicated it will prioritize these negotiations before imposing any tariffs, bringing a sense of relief and clarity to the industry.</p>

          <p>According to investing expert Michael Sonnenfeldt, ultra-rich Americans are adjusting their portfolios, slightly reducing their exposure to stocks and real estate due to short-term market choppiness. Instead, they are turning to alternative assets to "shockproof" their wealth, with a notable interest in Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a secure store of value rather than just a speculative asset. While equities remain the dominant long-term holding, this shift reflects a cautious approach to navigating current economic uncertainty.
