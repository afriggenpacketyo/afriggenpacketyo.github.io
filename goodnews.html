          <p>Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is preparing for a leadership election in September while facing a mass-recall campaign initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The recall campaign threatens the KMT's legislative majority and could disrupt the leadership transition. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has expressed his intention to step down after completing his term, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor. The KMT plans to announce the party chair race in July and install a new leader by October, hoping to regain power after years on the political sidelines. The party's ability to navigate the recall challenge will significantly impact its future.</p>

          <p>The ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes comes into effect across the UK on Sunday, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. Shops and supermarkets will no longer be able to stock disposable vapes, although rechargeable and refillable devices can still be sold. Disposable vapes have been identified as a key factor in the rise of youth vaping, with millions of vapes being thrown away annually. While vaping is less harmful than smoking, health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping.</p>
