          <h2>China's Exports Rise Despite Trade Tensions with the U.S.</h2>

          <p>China's exports experienced an unexpected surge in April, increasing by 8.1% year-on-year, primarily driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries which offset a significant decline in exports to the U.S. due to recently enacted tariffs. Imports, however, saw a minimal decrease of 0.2%, contrary to expectations of a larger drop. While exports to ASEAN countries grew substantially, exports to the U.S. fell by over 20%, reflecting the impact of ongoing trade disputes and tariffs. The surge in exports could be attributed to transshipments through third countries and contracts predating the tariffs, with expectations of gradual weakening in trade data in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The US and UK announced a new trade deal, with both Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump describing the agreement as "historic." The deal aims to save British car industry jobs and addresses some tariffs imposed by the White House. However, a flat 10% levy on most goods remains in place. The Daily Telegraph reports that the deal includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain, a claim the government dismisses as untrue.</p>

          <p>The European wind industry is reassessing its approach to renewable energy after the Trump administration paused offshore wind projects, causing disruption and uncertainty. European companies are counting on Europe to compensate for a pullback in the U.S. market. Despite the risks, offshore wind has been a major success in Northern Europe, with costs falling significantly. However, even in Europe, the economic and regulatory environment remains difficult, as evidenced by Orsted's decision not to proceed with a large wind facility in Britain.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the framework of a trade deal with Britain, aiming to lower the burden of his tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Starmer. The deal includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, particularly for agricultural products, and reduces non-tariff barriers. However, the 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains in place, with some exceptions for vehicles. The agreement is seen as a vindication of Starmer's approach to Trump, avoiding direct confrontation.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% year-on-year in April, defying expectations despite tariffs imposed by the U.S. The increase may be due to transshipment through other countries and trade contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.

          <p>India is considering eliminating tariffs on specific imports from the U.S., signaling a major shift in its trade approach. Reports suggest India may propose zero tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals up to a certain quantity.
