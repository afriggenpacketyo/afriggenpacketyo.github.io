          <h2>Indian Markets Remain Resilient Amidst Geopolitical Tensions with Pakistan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 06:10:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent military strikes between India and Pakistan, Indian markets have demonstrated resilience, driven by strong domestic demand, structural reforms, and robust macroeconomic fundamentals. Investors remain optimistic about India's growth prospects, outweighing geopolitical fears. Progress in trade talks with major partners, including a free trade agreement with the U.K., further supports market confidence. Experts anticipate some short-term volatility but expect a gradual recovery unless the conflict escalates significantly, noting historical precedents where markets remained stable despite heightened tensions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a 5% increase following the announcement that sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve in the latter half of 2025. This projection comes as the availability of compounded alternatives is set to decrease. Despite reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales due to competition from these compounded drugs, the company anticipates a rebound once the FDA's drug shortage ruling is lifted, allowing for greater market share. The launch of a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and strategic partnerships with telehealth providers are also expected to bolster Wegovy's accessibility and sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending a newly-agreed trade deal with India that includes an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders. Opposition parties argue that this exemption could disadvantage British workers, as it may be cheaper to employ Indian workers. However, the government maintains that the deal will not impact British workers and points to existing agreements preventing double taxation. The trade deal aims to boost trade between the two countries by making it easier for UK firms to export goods and cutting taxes on Indian exports to the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interpersonal trust is declining due to economic inequality, technology, increasing diversity, and political polarization, impacting relationships and society. Trust involves vulnerability and the expectation of beneficial actions from others, with judgments based on competence, benevolence, and integrity. While distrust is shaped by negative experiences, trust has a genetic component. Fostering trust involves approaching differences with curiosity, embracing a team mindset, and practicing transparency, ultimately strengthening relationships and communities by encouraging openness and vulnerability.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age to become a train driver from 20 to 18 to address driver shortages that frequently disrupt rail services. The move aims to attract younger recruits and tackle the problem of an aging workforce, with a significant portion of drivers nearing retirement. While union Aslef supports the decision, the Rail Safety and Standards Board affirms that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers. The government hopes this change will improve train services and unlock thousands of jobs, with potential apprenticeships becoming available by December.</p>

Proposed changes include adapting training concepts and game formats to better engage young players.
