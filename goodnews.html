          <p>Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell are set to compete for Labour's deputy leadership after Bell Riberio-Addy failed to secure enough MP nominations. Phillipson, the Education Secretary, is considered an early frontrunner, while Powell, recently sacked from her cabinet role, may appeal to MPs dissatisfied with the current leadership. The winner will serve as a link between the Labour membership and the party leadership, playing a key role in election campaigns. This contest offers an opportunity for MPs and party members to express discontent with the leadership, potentially overshadowing ministerial speeches. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates are experiencing their largest weekly drop in a year, with the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage falling to 6.35%. This decrease has led to a surge in borrower demand, with both purchase and refinance applications increasing. Refinances account for nearly half of the applications, as homeowners seek to lower their monthly payments. The drop in rates is attributed to weakening labor market data and lower Treasury yields. This article explores the impact of falling mortgage rates on the housing market. </p>

          <p>China has condemned Mexico's plan to impose tariff increases of up to 50 per cent on selected imports, claiming the move is aimed at China. A Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson stated that Beijing "firmly rejects moves that are taken under coercion to constrain China or undermine China's legitimate rights and interests." The Mexican government says the plan is necessary to protect local jobs in strategic sectors. The proposal comes amid increasing US pressure on other countries to align their trade policies with Washington's stance towards Beijing. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has upheld restrictions on the use of "less-lethal" weapons by federal agents at protests in Los Angeles, arguing that the First Amendment "deserves better." The judge barred federal agents from targeting reporters with crowd control weapons, stating that federal officers have used such weapons indiscriminately. The ruling adds a provision restricting the use of less-lethal weapons against protesters who do not pose an imminent threat. Press rights organizations hailed the decision as a victory, asserting it curbs continuing abuse of media members covering demonstrations. </p>

          <h2>Social Security COLA Could Rise Slightly in 2026</h2>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, slightly above the 2.5% increase in 2025, according to a new estimate. This adjustment would raise the average monthly benefit for retired workers by $54. The Social Security Administration (SSA) makes a COLA each year based on inflation data from July, August, and September. Economists warn that a 2.7% adjustment may not fully offset inflationary pressures. Routine monthly paycheck reductions for some recipients could also negate the COLA's benefits. </p>

          <p>A plane carrying hundreds of workers detained in a U.S. immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery plant in Georgia has departed for South Korea. The workers were detained for allegedly working or living in the country without legal status. South Korea mounted a "whole-of-government response" and worked with the companies to ensure the workers' safe return. The raid will delay the battery plant's construction by at least two to three months. The Hyundai CEO noted that specialized labor is often needed during the construction phase of such plants. </p>

Questions have arisen regarding his partner's financial capacity to purchase the home without a mortgage.

The BBC has been unable to find evidence of substantial family wealth to support her purchase. He has taken specialist legal advice on the purchase, despite claiming he wasn't involved. </p>
