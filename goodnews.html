          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, emphasizing the need for friendship and cooperation between the two most populous countries. Xi highlighted their shared status as civilizational nations and members of the Global South, advocating for a strong relationship between the "dragon" and the "elephant." Modi, on his first trip to China in seven years, noted positive developments in bilateral relations since the previous year. Both leaders expressed commitment to advancing relations based on mutual trust, respect, and sensitivity, particularly following disengagement on the border. The discussions, lasting nearly an hour, signal a potential effort to improve strained ties. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Biologists near the California-Oregon border are employing drones equipped with loudspeakers to deter wolves from preying on cattle, using a mix of sounds including AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and clips from the movie "Marriage Story." The technique aims to reduce conflicts between ranchers and the recovering wolf population, which has led to livestock losses. While ranchers are compensated for confirmed wolf kills, they also face uncompensated costs like stressed cattle and lower birth rates. Environmental advocates are optimistic about the use of drones, but some ranchers are concerned that wolves may eventually become accustomed to the deterrents. The use of technology offers a non-lethal approach to wildlife management. </p>

          <p>Brandon Burgess, a 29-year-old British Formula 1 enthusiast, is undertaking the challenge of attending all 24 Grand Prix races this season on a £20,000 budget. Working full-time, he is using his annual leave and savings to fund the journey across five continents and 21 countries, aiming to prove that attending F1 races doesn't have to be exclusively for the wealthy. Burgess is varying his attendance at each event to save money, utilizing capsule hostels, splitting accommodation costs, and strategically managing his work schedule. His journey has garnered attention, including an invitation from Aston Martin for a garage tour, and he is documenting his experiences on social media. Despite challenges, he remains determined to complete his mission. </p>
