          <p>London's Mayor Sadiq Khan is actively trying to entice investors, visitors, and students from the U.S., especially given the perceived instability associated with another Trump administration. Khan emphasizes London's stability, openness, and diversity as attractive qualities for those seeking an alternative to the U.S. He highlights that London offers a conducive environment for innovation, creativity, and business. While acknowledging political differences with Trump, Khan asserts the importance of prioritizing national interests and maintaining open communication on areas of both agreement and disagreement. The mayor believes London possesses everything individuals and businesses could desire, including strong values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a U.S. port fee aimed at ships linked to China, major shipping companies like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) are continuing to order vessels from Chinese shipyards. MSC senior vice-president Marie-Caroline Laurent stated that the port fee would not deter the company from ordering more vessels from China, citing their unmatched competitiveness. The global shipping industry is striving to achieve net-zero emissions in the next 25 years, leading to increased investments in decarbonization technologies and new ship orders. Laurent noted that reviving America's shipbuilding sector would require state subsidies and strategic asset retention, but would likely not change MSC's shipbuilding strategy.</p>

          <p>An essay reflects on the victory of the horse Journalism at the Preakness Stakes, highlighting the importance of patience and timing over sheer speed. Journalism, initially boxed in and fading, waited for the right moment to surge through a narrow opening and win the race. The essay draws a parallel to the current era of urgency, suggesting that Journalism's approach is a reminder that some victories are earned through patience and calculated moves. Journalism is now headed to the Belmont Stakes, where the race is shorter this year due to the Saratoga track hosting the event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has implemented a larger-than-expected interest rate cut, reducing the benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, exceeding median estimates. The decision follows better-than-anticipated GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, with the economy expanding 7.4% year-on-year. Despite this, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, reflecting a slowdown from the previous year, citing concerns about tariffs from the United States.
