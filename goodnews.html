          <p>This Fox News article reports that the FDA has approved the first at-home screening test for cervical cancer, offering an alternative to traditional Pap smears. The Teal Wand allows women to collect a sample and mail it in for laboratory analysis to detect human papillomavirus (HPV). A clinical trial showed a 96% accuracy rate in detecting cervical precancers, and most participants preferred self-collection at home. The test will be available for women aged 25-65 who are at average risk of cervical cancer, with plans to expand access across the country.

The earthquake originated near Greenback, Tennessee, and prompted thousands of reports to the USGS. While no injuries or major damage were immediately reported, residents described feeling their homes shake. The article notes that the southeastern US carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid seismic zone and the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone. Seismic waves from earthquakes spread more efficiently in the eastern US compared with the west because of the region‚Äôs geology.</p>

          <p>This BBC article celebrates Chelsea's 'special' unbeaten season in the Women's Super League (WSL), emphasizing the team's consistency and mentality. Despite a transitional season with a new manager, the squad won by one-goal margins on 10 occasions and trailed four times during the season. The results were immaculate but not the performances. Of their 56 goals, 17 came in the last 15 minutes of matches (30.4% of their total), and eight were scored in stoppage time. Chelsea finished 12 points clear with 19 wins and three draws. They remain, as they have done for the past five years, the best team in England.</p>

          <p>This CBS News article features an excerpt from Barry Diller's new memoir, "Who Knew," where the media executive discusses the importance of instinct in creative and business decision-making. Diller argues that data and research can be harmful to instinct, and that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea. He recounts stories from his career at ABC, including the making of the TV movie "Brian's Song," and emphasizes the value of trusting one's gut feeling over relying solely on data. Overtraining our brains on data alone doesn't confer an advantage, and it can be a deterrent if it's the only decision-making component.</p>

The attorney general said the settlement, which covers allegations in two separate lawsuits against the search engine and app giant, dwarfed all past settlements by other states with Google for similar data privacy violations.
