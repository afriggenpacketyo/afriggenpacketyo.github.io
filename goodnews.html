          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that the company's leadership needs to improve its relationship with employees and rebuild trust.

He pushed back against concerns that recent U.S. trade rhetoric had pushed India towards China, asserting that the two nations have little in common.

          <p>David Ellison's newly formed Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that would create a media and entertainment behemoth. While no formal offer has been made, news of the potential deal caused Warner Bros. Discovery's stock to surge by nearly 30%. An acquisition would combine Paramount's franchises like "Star Trek" and "Mission: Impossible" with Warner's extensive library, including DC superheroes, "Harry Potter," and "Game of Thrones." This consolidation would also significantly expand Paramount's sports media rights, adding assets like NHL and March Madness to its portfolio.</p>

          <p>Average mortgage rates for 30-year terms have fallen to 6.35%, their lowest level in almost a year, creating a potential opportunity for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing. This decline is attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The article advises potential borrowers to assess whether to act now or wait for potentially lower rates, acknowledging the risk that rates could rise again. For homeowners, it suggests a refinance could be beneficial if current rates are at least a percentage point below their existing mortgage.</p>

This arrangement will continue until Japan's initial investment is fully returned, after which the profit split will shift to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. The fund is part of a broader trade deal in which Japan agreed to the investment in exchange for a reduction in U.S. tariffs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in Germany over whether classic literary works by authors like Goethe should remain central to the high school curriculum. Some students and reformers argue that the required reading lists are dominated by "old white men" and fail to reflect the country's diverse population or engage young people's interests. They advocate for more contemporary and culturally varied texts relevant to students' lives. Conversely, educators and philologists argue that classics are essential for understanding history and developing critical thinking, suggesting a balanced approach that includes both traditional and modern works chosen in consultation with students.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has experienced strong consumer demand for its new product, the "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras. The palm-sized cameras, marketed as functional fashion accessories with vintage filters, sold out quickly on Kodak's website and are now available only for pre-order at most retailers. This early success comes at a critical time for the struggling photography pioneer, which recently warned of financial difficulties in its quarterly earnings report. The popularity of the Charmera suggests Kodak has successfully tapped into Gen Z's growing appetite for retro technology and Y2K aesthetics.</p>
