          <p>Reddit's stock price saw a significant jump after the company announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations for both sales and future guidance. The social media platform's revenue grew by 78% year-over-year, and it reported a net income of $89 million, a strong reversal from a net loss in the same period last year. The company also projected third-quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA figures that are well ahead of Wall Street forecasts, fueled by a 21% increase in global daily active users.</p>

          <p>Apple announced third-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, posting its most significant quarterly revenue growth since December 2021 with a 10% year-over-year increase. The strong performance was largely driven by a 13% rise in iPhone sales, particularly the popularity of the new iPhone 16 model, and a nearly 15% growth in the Mac division. While iPad and wearables revenue saw declines, the company's services business continued its steady growth, and sales in China rebounded, contributing to the overall positive results.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analyst estimates, with sales growing 13% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in its online stores and advertising units. However, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading due to a third-quarter operating income forecast that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. This cautious guidance has raised investor concerns about the profitability of its substantial investments in artificial intelligence, despite CEO Andy Jassy's confidence in AI's long-term benefits for the company.</p>

          <p>A recent meeting in France between basketball stars LeBron James and Nikola Jokić was reportedly about a proposed $5 billion international basketball league intended to rival the NBA. The new league, championed by James's business partner Maverick Carter, aims to feature touring men's and women's teams and offer players equity stakes, a practice currently forbidden for active NBA players. The venture, inspired by models like LIV Golf and Formula One, is reportedly seeking significant funding and would require full-time commitments, creating a potential conflict with the NBA's own European expansion plans.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to bring back the presidential fitness test, a physical assessment program for schoolchildren that was discontinued 12 years ago. The initiative, part of the administration's "Make America Healthy Again" movement, will reestablish the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overseeing the program. The test, which includes activities like a one-mile run and push-ups, was a public school staple for decades, and its revival is being framed as a return to a popular American tradition focused on physical wellness.</p>

          <p>Labubu dolls, plush monster-like creatures from the Chinese company Pop Mart, have become a major trend in the United States, transitioning from collectibles to popular fashion accessories. This surge in popularity, fueled by social media and celebrity sightings, has led to a massive increase in sales for Pop Mart in North America, with revenue growing over 550% between 2023 and 2024. Analysts describe the dolls as a "gateway drug" to the brand's other products, turning the once China-focused company into a global toy powerhouse with a market capitalization exceeding that of some established US toymakers.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), reported an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion and slightly surpassing analyst expectations. Despite this growth and its market leadership, AWS is experiencing intensified competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, both of which posted higher quarterly growth rates. While AWS remains a significant profit center for Amazon, its operating income for the quarter fell just short of analyst estimates, highlighting the competitive pressures in the booming cloud and artificial intelligence sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has resolved a long-standing botanical mystery, revealing that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers analyzed hundreds of potato genomes and discovered that a hybridization event between an ancient tomato and a non-tuber-producing wild potato species from Chile created the modern, starchy vegetable. The ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that initiates tuber formation, while the wild potato species contributed a gene that helps control the growth of the underground stems, demonstrating how interbreeding can spark the evolution of new traits.</p>

While analysts view the spending as a positive sign for chipmakers and the companies' long-term momentum, some express slight unease at the aggressive scale of Meta's financial commitment to its new superintelligence initiatives.</p>

          <p>The opening day of the fifth Test between England and India was characterized by erratic but occasionally brilliant bowling from the English side, particularly from pacer Josh Tongue. Despite favorable cloudy and green conditions, England's depleted bowling attack struggled with consistency, yet managed to restrict India to 204-6 by drawing a high number of false shots. The article suggests that while India's batters were unsettled by the unpredictable bowling, England may have missed an opportunity to fully capitalize on the conditions and bowl the visitors out completely.</p>
