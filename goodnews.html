          <p>Nvidia has refuted claims that it is sending graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China for modification to comply with U.S. export controls. The statement follows a report that the company is establishing a research and development center in Shanghai. Nvidia clarified that while it is exploring ways to cater to the local market, production and design will continue to be based outside of China. CEO Jensen Huang reportedly discussed the potential center with Shanghai's mayor last month.</p>

Trump also announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move praised by Gulf leaders. The trip resulted in deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars for U.S. companies, including a large order from Qatar for Boeing passenger jets, though some details remained vague.</p>

          <p>Shares of Cartier owner Richemont jumped 7% after the company posted better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong growth in its Jewellery Maisons division. Revenues rose 7% year-on-year, indicating that wealthy consumers continue to spend on luxury items despite global macroeconomic uncertainties. However, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Richemont's Chairman Johann Rupert noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require agility and discipline, while analysts pointed to gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations as key headwinds.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that certain college majors, including nutrition, art history, and philosophy, are outperforming STEM fields in terms of employment prospects. The study, based on 2023 Census data, found that computer science and computer engineering graduates had higher unemployment rates compared to those with degrees in humanities and healthcare-related fields.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A $50,000 annuity can provide a predictable income stream during retirement, but the monthly payments vary based on factors like age, gender, and contract structure. An analysis of Cannex data suggests that a 65-year-old man might receive around $322 per month, while a woman of the same age could receive about $309. While these payments may not cover all expenses, they can supplement Social Security and other retirement funds, offering peace of mind and protection against longevity risk. However, it's important to consider the limited access to funds and potential tax implications before investing. (not investment advice)</p>
