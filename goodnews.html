According to a study by Match.com, one in four singles now use AI tools to help craft messages, filter potential matches, and boost their confidence. Apps like Rizz and Keepler offer AI-driven advice, functioning as a virtual 'wingman' to help users initiate conversations or navigate difficult interactions like ghosting. While some users find these tools helpful for breaking the ice, experts caution against over-reliance, emphasizing that AI should supplement, not substitute, genuine human connection and authenticity.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has reached a new record, briefly surpassing $118,000, driven by a significant surge in institutional investment. On Thursday, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion. This rally was also supported by a broader upswing in tech stocks and expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy. The price increase triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further fueling the upward momentum in the cryptocurrency market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pace bowler Jofra Archer made a stunning return to Test cricket for England after an absence of over four years, marked by injuries and setbacks. In his first spell against India at Lord's, Archer bowled with blistering pace, touching 93.3mph and dismissing key batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal with just his third delivery. His five-over opening burst was a powerful demonstration of the X-factor England has been missing, showcasing extreme speed and hostility. While questions remain about his ability to sustain this intensity, his comeback provides a significant boost to England's bowling attack and a moment of triumph for the player.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions on journalists covering protests. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by press rights organizations, which argued that LAPD officers have deliberately targeted and injured reporters during demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies. U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera's order explicitly prohibits the use of such crowd-control tools against journalists who are not posing an imminent threat. The judge cited specific incidents where reporters were hit with projectiles while clearly identifiable as press.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium cabins, following a template similar to the one it used to create varied economy class fares like basic economy. With revenue from premium seats growing while main cabin sales have dropped, the airline is focused on expanding its high-end offerings. Delta President Glen Hauenstein suggested that different premium customers have different needs, hinting at potential new tiers within business and first class. While details are scarce, possibilities could range from a less-expensive business class ticket without lounge access to a more spacious 'business-plus' suite with extra amenities.</p>

          <p>A massive Antonov An-124 cargo jet, a symbol of Ukrainian aviation, was spotted flying over Kyiv, marking a rare non-combat flight since the 2022 invasion began. The aircraft, registered to Antonov Airlines, had likely been stranded at the Svyatoshino airport in Kyiv for over four years and was being evacuated. It successfully flew over Poland and landed in Leipzig, Germany, where Antonov Airlines relocated much of its operations. The flight through heavily restricted airspace sparked joy among Ukrainians and derision from Russian commentators, who questioned how their intelligence and military failed to detect and intercept the high-profile aircraft.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Treasury Reports Unexpected Budget Surplus in June Driven by Surging Tariff Receipts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant shift from the typical deficits seen this fiscal year. This unexpected surplus was largely driven by a sharp increase in government receipts, bolstered by a 301% year-over-year surge in customs duties from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit still stands at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest rates continue to challenge federal finances, with net interest on the national debt remaining one of the largest government expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Ways for Seniors to Supplement Social Security Income</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:24:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's long-term solvency and potential benefit reductions, seniors are increasingly looking for ways to supplement their retirement income. This article outlines three potential options for homeowners aged 62 and older to generate additional funds. These include reverse mortgages, which provide monthly payments from home equity; annuities, which offer guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum payment; and personal loans, which can serve as an emergency fund. Each option presents different financial trade-offs that seniors should carefully consider based on their individual circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Homeowners Seeking Fast HELOCs Can Explore Nontraditional Lending Options</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:22:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing quick access to their home equity, several strategies can accelerate the typically lengthy Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) approval process. Options include applying with fully online lenders that use digital platforms for faster processing, or seeking no-documentation HELOCs that minimize paperwork. Homeowners can also apply with their existing mortgage lender, which may streamline the process since financial information is already on file. Additionally, choosing lenders that use automated or desktop appraisals instead of in-person visits can significantly reduce waiting times. (not investment advice)</p>
