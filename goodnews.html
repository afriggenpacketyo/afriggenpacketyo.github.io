          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is amending the Building Energy Act, aiming to dismantle key aspects of Robert Habeck's climate protection law.

Royal Mail said it is actively modernizing but acknowledges that there is more work to be done. Critics argue that the company is hiking stamp prices while failing to deliver post on time, and that the universal service obligation needs reform.</p>

A study found that nearly half of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, driven by a desire for more "me time."
