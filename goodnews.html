          <p>The Buss family has agreed to sell a majority stake of the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter in a deal valuing the team at $10 billion, setting a new NBA valuation record. Jeanie Buss will retain a minority stake and her governor seat, while Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners and owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, will become the majority owner. Magic Johnson praised the transaction, noting Walter's suitability to carry on the Lakers' winning legacy. NBA valuations have significantly increased since the latest media rights agreement, and the Lakers, who recently acquired Luka Doncic, finished the season as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference. </p>

          <p>Tariffs are driving up the cost of materials used in home renovation projects, leading homeowners to reconsider their plans. According to the National Association of Home Builders, these tariffs can add around $10,000 to a typical renovation project. Builder David Perotti advises pre-ordering materials, opting for paint jobs instead of new appliances, and budgeting an additional 30% for tariff-related costs. He also suggests prioritizing exterior repairs to prevent further degradation of the home. (not investment advice)</p>

These ten Tests will determine whether the team is remembered as merely entertaining or as both ideological innovators and winners. While Stokes' place in history is secure, success in these series could solidify his claim as England's greatest cricketer, and McCullum has the opportunity to take some of the biggest prizes back to New Zealand. Despite the pressure, Stokes remains focused on giving his all, regardless of external expectations. </p>

          <p>The U.S. brokered a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda to end the conflict over mineral wealth in eastern DRC. The agreement, set to be signed in Washington, aims to end fighting and attract American investment in the region's coltan, cobalt, lithium, copper, and gold reserves. However, critics are skeptical because the M23 rebel group, believed to be backed by Rwanda, is not a signatory. The U.S. is also seeking separate deals with the DRC for mineral access and with Rwanda for a potential deportee program. </p>

Public pools have historically served as social hubs, but desegregation led to their decline as suburbanites retreated to private club pools. The author advocates for revitalizing public pools as a way to promote health, happiness, and community, especially during increasingly hot summers.

          <p>Wales will ban plastic wet wipes starting in December 2026 to reduce environmental harm, becoming the first UK nation to implement such a ban. The ban, passed by the Senedd, will make it an offense to supply wet wipes containing plastic to customers, with exemptions for medical-grade wipes and business-to-business transactions. Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies said the move aims to encourage a shift toward reusable and non-plastic products. Research from Cardiff University found that wet wipes pose a significant risk to the environment in Wales. </p>

While some doubt the historical accuracy of these claims, Edmunds and her daughter emphasize the importance of preserving this oral history.
