        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Start-ups like London-based Better Dairy are using precision fermentation to create cheese without cows, aiming for a market launch within a few years. The process involves genetically modifying yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats. Despite the technological advance, the industry faces challenges, including high costs, consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods, and a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales. Companies hope to overcome these hurdles by initially targeting products like frozen pizza and eventually achieving price parity with conventional cheese.</p>

          <p>Actress Candace Cameron Bure has revealed that her marriage to Valeri Bure went through a difficult period during the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly ending. She shared on her podcast that the turning point came when their son, Lev, then a young adult, sat them down and delivered a 45-minute sermon on marriage based on the Bible. Bure recalled how her son's calm wisdom and pointed questions about grace and kindness prompted her and her husband to reconcile. She expressed immense gratitude for her children's support during that challenging time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of declining viewership, the reality TV show 'Love Island' is experiencing a revival, with audience figures returning to 2022 levels. A significant driver of this renewed interest appears to be social media, particularly TikTok, where the show's official accounts have gained over a million followers this year. Content creators and fans are engaging with short-form clips, recaps, and analysis, which makes it easier to keep up with the daily show. While this boosts overall engagement, some observers worry that consuming the show through out-of-context clips alters the viewing experience and a full understanding of the contestants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting immigration officials from making 'indiscriminate' arrests. The order stems from a lawsuit filed after officials allegedly detained individuals at a bus stop based solely on their appearance or language. Judge Maame Frimpong stated there was a 'mountain of evidence' of unconstitutional 'roving patrols' and explicitly barred arrests based only on race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling represents a significant legal challenge to the administration's intensified immigration enforcement tactics, particularly in California.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers snap a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants.

While still on a limited workload, his effective outing provided a much-needed spark for the struggling Dodgers. The performance underscores his elite potential as a starting pitcher and his critical role in the team's success moving forward.</p>

          <p>A last-gasp try from Jack van Poortvliet gave England a dramatic 22-17 victory over Argentina, securing a 2-0 series win. The match was tightly contested, with the score tied at 17-17 for much of the second half in San Juan. The decisive moment came when replacement Guy Pepper broke through the defense and offloaded to Van Poortvliet, who scored in the corner as time expired. The impressive series win is a significant achievement for coach Steve Borthwick's side, which was missing numerous key players on British and Irish Lions duty.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for exacerbating China's declining birth rate by replacing human roles in companionship and elder care, one demography expert argues this may not be entirely negative. As AI technology advances, it could fulfill traditional family functions, reducing the societal pressure to marry and have children for support in old age. For many young Chinese adults, like 32-year-old Tracy Li, the high cost of raising a family makes a single life more appealing. They are banking on future advancements in AI and robotics to provide care and companionship, potentially redefining societal structures.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor retained her undisputed super lightweight titles by defeating Amanda Serrano for a third time in their trilogy fight at Madison Square Garden. The bout, which was the main event on a Netflix-broadcast card, ended in a majority decision with judges scoring it 97-93 twice for Taylor and 95-95. Unlike their two previous closely contested fights, this third encounter saw a more pronounced dominance from the 39-year-old Taylor. The victory solidifies her standing over her 36-year-old Puerto Rican rival, leaving little doubt after a highly anticipated series of fights.</p>

          <p>Allergy-awareness campaigners and a UK Member of Parliament are calling for cosmetic ingredient lists to be in English rather than Latin to prevent dangerous allergic reactions. Currently, companies use the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), a system based on Latin and scientific names, which can be difficult for consumers to understand. A mother whose daughter had a severe reaction to a body wash argues that makeup should have clear allergen warnings similar to food products. While the industry defends the Latin-based system for providing global consistency, critics say it puts consumers with allergies at unnecessary risk.</p>

          <p>A 20-year listener of financial advisor Dave Ramsey's show created the program's 'shortest call in history' with a straightforward question about his mortgage. The caller, Chad from Georgia, explained he had $211,000 in cash and a remaining mortgage balance of $95,000, and was seeking final confirmation on whether to pay it off. Ramsey's immediate and emphatic response was, 'Good Lord. Pay it off today,' ending the call in under a minute. The moment, which has since gone viral, perfectly encapsulated Ramsey's long-held financial philosophy of eliminating debt to achieve financial freedom, even if it means forgoing potential investment gains.</p>
