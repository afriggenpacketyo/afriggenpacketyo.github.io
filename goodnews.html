          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte affirmed the U.S.'s commitment to NATO, emphasizing President Trump's support while highlighting the expectation for European and Canadian allies to increase defense spending. Rutte urged allies to focus on defense investment plans, industrial base development, and support for Ukraine, rather than worrying about the U.S.'s commitment. NATO members have pledged to spend 2% of their GDP on defense since 2014, with some exceeding this target while others struggle to meet it, leading to tensions over burden-sharing. The summit in The Hague will address these spending disparities and reaffirm the alliance's commitment to collective security amidst ongoing global conflicts. The importance of Trump's presence, despite his skepticism towards NATO, underscores the alliance's strength and ambition. </p>

          <p>House Democrats are convening to elect a new ranking member of the House Oversight Committee following the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly. Four Democrats, Reps. Stephen Lynch, Kweisi Mfume, Robert Garcia, and Jasmine Crockett, are vying for the position, which would potentially lead to the committee's chairmanship if Democrats regain control of the House in 2026. The selection process highlights ongoing tensions within the party regarding a potential generational shift in leadership roles. Connolly's death occurred shortly after he announced his decision not to seek reelection in 2026 due to his cancer returning, and his successor will play a key role in shaping the committee's agenda and priorities. The new ranking member will be instrumental in challenging the Republican trifecta in Washington.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, secured a trainee accountant position after submitting 646 job applications over 18 months. Morgan's persistence paid off despite facing numerous rejections and feeling demotivated during her extensive job search. She believes that artificial intelligence (AI) used in applicant tracking systems (ATS) initially hindered her progress until she adjusted her CV to be more ATS-friendly. Recent data indicates that competition for graduate roles is at a record high, with an average of 140 applications per job in 2024, and even higher for finance roles. Morgan's experience underscores the challenges faced by recent graduates in a competitive job market.</p>

          <p>With rising natural gas prices expected to increase air conditioning costs by about 4% this summer, Americans are looking for ways to save on energy bills. Experts recommend sealing windows and doors to prevent air leaks, using fans to reduce thermostat temperatures, and managing sunlight by closing blinds during the day. Additionally, using heat-producing appliances wisely, prioritizing regular AC maintenance, and considering system upgrades can help reduce energy consumption. Homeowners may also consider a professional home energy audit for a comprehensive assessment of energy efficiency.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that people often underestimate how willing others are to help, stemming from inaccurate assumptions about how the helper will feel. Studies have found that people who need help tend to predict others will be less likely to say yes than they actually are, and they overestimate the inconvenience to the helper. American culture's emphasis on self-reliance can make asking for help especially difficult, but seeking assistance can strengthen relationships and provide opportunities for loved ones to feel good. Important events, such as weddings, often remove some of the obstacles to giving and receiving help.</p>
