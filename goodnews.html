          <p>A China-led study suggests that a global interconnected solar-wind energy network could satisfy the world's energy demands by 2050 at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The study, published in Nature Communications, explores creating a network that leverages regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents to areas with high demand. Researchers acknowledge that establishing such a system involves navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises, such as the Ukraine war. The study concludes that successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease decarbonization's economic burden, and bolster resilience against conflict and climate extremes. Optimizing solar and wind renewable energy deployment could create an international renewable energy market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo after a strong initial showing, although no candidate reached the 50% threshold to win outright. Cuomo conceded the primary and hinted at a possible independent run in November, following accusations of sexual harassment that led to his resignation in 2021. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, focused on a progressive platform including a rent freeze and fare-free buses, while Cuomo campaigned on his experience and past confrontations with Donald Trump. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, with final results expected in mid-July due to the time required to retrieve voting machine data.</p>

The purchase, set to be announced at the NATO summit in The Hague, is seen as a response to growing threats from Russia and China. Meanwhile, the papers also cover President Trump's use of strong language in efforts to maintain peace in the Middle East and the unveiling of the UK's new National Security Strategy, which emphasizes preparing for potential direct threats to the homeland.

          <p>California leaders have reached a tentative $321.1 billion budget agreement, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal demanded by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The budget addresses a $12 billion deficit through borrowing, tapping reserves, and shifting funds, reflecting resistance to Newsom's proposed cuts. A key element is a "poison pill" requiring legislators to pass a bill lessening environmental review requirements for building projects under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The deal also includes changes to Medi-Cal funding, such as reinstating asset limits and delaying full dental coverage for undocumented immigrants, while preserving funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants.</p>

          <p>A controversial proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands across Western states, including California, was removed from the Republican tax and spending bill due to Senate rules violations. The proposal, advanced by Senator Mike Lee, aimed to sell up to 3.3 million acres of public land managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to address housing needs. Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision, while Lee indicated that he would continue to pursue the measure with revisions.

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the UK and consumed a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The park stated that the bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. The bears were monitored and successfully returned to their enclosure by keepers without intervention. The park is investigating the "operational error" that allowed the bears to escape.</p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee (CCC) reports that electric car and heat pump adoption is increasing, but further growth is needed to meet climate goals. The CCC emphasized the importance of reducing electricity costs to incentivize households to switch to cleaner technologies. While electric car sales have nearly doubled in the past two years, heat pump installations remain below target. The committee also praised the government's relaxation of planning rules for heat pumps but stressed the need to address high electricity prices.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. Judge Tana Lin granted a partial injunction to the states, ruling that their lawsuit against the Department of Transportation would likely succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program. The Government Accountability Office had previously found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding.</p>
