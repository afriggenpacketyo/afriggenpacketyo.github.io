          <p>The Conservative Party has given Rupert Lowe, a former Reform UK MP, a seat on the prestigious Public Accounts Committee, which is responsible for overseeing government spending. Lowe, who was expelled from Reform UK after a dispute with party leadership, stated he is delighted with the appointment and intends to rigorously scrutinize public sector spending. This move is part of a broader Conservative strategy to work cross-party with individuals who align with their values, similar to appointments made for MPs from Labour and the DUP on other committees.</p>

          <p>HBO has announced that actors Danielle Deadwyler, Natasha Lyonne, and Eli Roth are among the new cast members joining the third season of its acclaimed series "Euphoria." The Emmy-winning show is scheduled to return in the spring of 2026 after a nearly four-year hiatus, with production already underway for its eight-episode run. The upcoming season will reportedly feature a time jump, moving the main characters beyond their high school years, and will see the return of key cast members like Zendaya and Sydney Sweeney.</p>

          <p>Apple has acquired the exclusive U.S. broadcasting rights for Formula 1 in a five-year deal valued at approximately $750 million, starting in 2026. The agreement will make all F1 sessions available to Apple TV subscribers at no additional cost, marking a significant entry for the tech giant into major sports broadcasting. The deal's success was partly attributed to the popularity of the Apple-produced F1 movie starring Brad Pitt, and it represents a substantial increase in value over the sport's previous U.S. rights deal with ESPN.</p>

          <p>The conventional 60/40 investment portfolio of stocks and bonds is increasingly being challenged, with recent record highs in gold and bitcoin prompting a shift toward alternative assets. Some strategists now advocate for a 60/20/20 model, reallocating a portion of fixed income to assets like precious metals and cryptocurrencies to hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk. This trend is reflected in massive inflows into gold ETFs, as central bank demand and de-dollarization efforts have pushed the metal to over $4,300, solidifying its role as a core holding.

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent Democrat known for his pro-housing legislation, reportedly plans to run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously established an exploratory committee, his decision to run was apparently accelerated by the entry of another progressive candidate into the race. Pelosi, who is 85 and has held the seat since 1987, has not yet announced if she will seek another term, creating an opening for a new generation of leadership in the San Francisco district.</p>

          <h2>Bodybuilders Shift from "Dirty Bulking" to "Lean Bulking" for Health and Aesthetics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 12:24:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural shift is underway in the bodybuilding community, as many athletes move away from "dirty bulking"—consuming massive amounts of processed, high-calorie foods—toward "lean bulking." This newer approach involves a more moderate caloric surplus from healthy food sources, aligning with modern wellness trends and scientific findings that excessive calories primarily create fat. While this method produces muscle gains more slowly, it avoids the negative health consequences of a poor diet and allows enthusiasts to maintain a chiseled physique year-round.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank has identified DuPont as a short-term "catalyst buy," anticipating that the upcoming spinoff of its Qnity Electronics division on November 1 will unlock significant shareholder value. Analysts believe the company currently trades at a substantial discount to the sum of its parts and that both the new Qnity shares and the remaining DuPont stock will be attractive holdings. The CNBC Investing Club noted it plans to hold both stocks post-spinoff, with a particular long-term interest in Qnity due to its stronger growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has removed the travel restrictions on Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, enabling him to speak at events nationwide while he continues to fight a deportation case initiated by the Trump administration. Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, was arrested in March as part of a crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activists and had been confined to specific states since his release from detention. His lawyer argued that the ability to travel is crucial for exercising his First Amendment rights to speak on issues of public concern.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "Just Visiting This Planet," astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson uses an alien character to explore a range of scientific questions with personality and humor, which he argues is lacking in AI-generated answers. He expresses skepticism about alien visitations to Earth, noting the lack of high-resolution photographic evidence despite the ubiquity of cameras today. Tyson also playfully debunks the science of a famous "Superman" scene, explaining that reversing Earth's rotation would not turn back time but would cause catastrophic global tsunamis.</p>
