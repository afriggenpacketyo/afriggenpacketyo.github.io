          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets traded higher as investors processed the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, which has introduced a period of political uncertainty for the country. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a notable rise despite the news, while the yen weakened against the US dollar. Market watchers are also keenly awaiting August trade data from China to gauge the economic health of the region's largest economy. Meanwhile, oil prices saw a slight increase after OPEC+ announced it would continue to lift production, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months. (not investment advice)</p>

In Green Bay, Micah Parsons made an immediate impact with a sack as the Packers secured a convincing 27-13 victory over the Detroit Lions. Aaron Rodgers also had a stellar first game with the Pittsburgh Steelers, throwing four touchdown passes in a thrilling 34-32 win against his former team, the New York Jets. Other notable results included the Indianapolis Colts dominating the Miami Dolphins and the San Francisco 49ers rallying late to defeat the Seattle Seahawks in a narrow contest.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old woman in Lowestoft, Suffolk, experienced what she called "the biggest shock of my life" when she gave birth to a baby boy in a football club's toilet, having been completely unaware she was pregnant. Charlotte Robinson was attending a match when she felt a sudden urge to push and delivered her son, Henry. The phenomenon, known as a cryptic pregnancy, affects about one in 2,500 births. An off-duty paramedic and other attendees assisted at the scene before an ambulance arrived, and both mother and baby are reportedly doing well after the surprising arrival.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over a back injury that sidelined him for much of the preseason, quarterback Matthew Stafford led the Los Angeles Rams to a 14-9 season-opening win against the Houston Texans. Stafford passed for 245 yards and a touchdown, reaching a career milestone of 60,000 passing yards in the process. The Rams' defense was crucial in the victory, limiting the Texans to three field goals and securing the win with a forced fumble in the final two minutes. The performance demonstrated Stafford's resilience and provided a much-needed positive start for the team under coach Sean McVay.</p>

          <p>A couple is highlighting how unconventional living arrangements can still lead to a fulfilling marriage, as they have lived in different countries for the past 15 years. Margaret resides in London, where she pursued a new career after her children left home, while her husband Peter remains in their family home in Australia. They see each other approximately once a year but maintain their connection through regular, detailed communication about their separate lives. This arrangement, sometimes known as "living apart together" (LAT), is uncommon but reflects a modern approach to relationships where partners pursue different individual goals while remaining committed.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has acquired the historic Griffith Park carousel for one million dollars, ensuring its preservation ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2026. The merry-go-round, which famously inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland as he watched his daughters ride it, has been closed since 2022 following the death of its operator. Built in 1926, the carousel is one of the few remaining four-across wooden carousels of its type and features hand-carved horses. Although it requires significant repairs before it can reopen, the purchase is seen as a key step in preserving a beloved piece of local history.</p>

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in years, increasingly allocating capital to Asian markets, according to Bank of America research. This shift is driven by the region's burgeoning artificial intelligence sector, more attractive valuations compared to U.S. stocks, and expectations of a weaker dollar and looser U.S. monetary policy. While U.S. markets attracted over a trillion dollars from 2020 to 2024, investment flows have slowed this year. The global AI market is projected to grow significantly, with a substantial portion of that growth expected to be deployed in the Asia-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Skygazers across a wide swath of the globe were treated to the sight of a "Blood Moon" during a total lunar eclipse. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that gives the lunar surface a distinct reddish-orange glow. This reddish hue is caused by sunlight scattering through the Earth's atmosphere. The full eclipse was best viewed in Asia, with parts of Europe, Africa, and Australia also witnessing the celestial event, which has captivated human imagination for centuries.</p>

          <p>Achieving the maximum possible Social Security benefit, which stands at $5,108 per month, requires a specific and prolonged earnings history. To qualify, an individual must have earned an income at or above the maximum taxable earnings limit for at least 35 years of their working life. This limit, which adjusts annually, means a worker has paid the maximum amount of Social Security payroll taxes for those years. Since most Americans will not meet this high threshold, the article advises focusing on controllable factors like working for a full 35 years and strategically choosing when to begin claiming benefits.

          <p>Germany's national football team earned a crucial 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifying match in Cologne. After an early goal from Serge Gnabry, Northern Ireland fought back to equalize through an Isaac Price volley, frustrating the home side. However, two German goals in a three-minute span from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz ultimately secured the win for the hosts. Northern Ireland's manager, Michael O'Neill, expressed pride in his team's performance but also disappointment, citing a lack of depth and some soft defending as key factors in the defeat.</p>

          <p>According to Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, globalisation is not dead but is instead "alive and well in Asia." In a recent interview, Goldin asserted that the Asian region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. He noted that while globalisation is becoming more fragmented and regional, its center of gravity is shifting towards Asia as the U.S. pulls back. Goldin also cautioned that the interconnectedness of globalisation brings not only benefits but also growing risks, such as pandemics, that must be managed.</p>

This shift to cooler, foggier weather will be a relief for Southern California after recent heat waves but may disappoint Bay Area residents who have already endured an unusually cold summer. The forecast includes a thick marine layer and the possibility of light drizzle or showers in some coastal regions due to a low-pressure system.

This milestone performance comes ahead of a crucial Ashes tour in Australia, where his aggressive batting style is seen as well-suited to the conditions.
