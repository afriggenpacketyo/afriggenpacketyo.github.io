          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders has revealed he was diagnosed with bladder cancer, which required surgery to remove his bladder. During a press conference with his medical team, it was announced that the procedure was successful and he is now considered "cancer-free." Sanders shared that he kept the diagnosis private, even from his team, and will continue his coaching duties. He used the announcement to encourage others, particularly African-American men, to prioritize regular health check-ups.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by an investment fund, Azoria Capital, that sought to force the Federal Reserve to open its upcoming interest rate-setting meeting to the public. The court ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the "Sunshine Act," which mandates open meetings for government agencies. The judge questioned whether the lawsuit was a publicity stunt for the new fund, which is led by an ally of President Donald Trump and has been critical of the Fed's policies.</p>

The ruling noted the family is at "constant risk of injury or death" and that the government's current policy of only assisting in specific cases of family separation should be re-examined given the exceptional circumstances.</p>

          <p>This article explains the "4% rule," a long-standing guideline for retirement planning that suggests how much a person can safely withdraw from their savings annually. It details how this rule can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the income stream offered by an annuity. By comparing an annuity's payout rate to a 4% withdrawal, retirees can assess whether the guaranteed income and longevity protection of an annuity is a worthwhile trade-off for the liquidity of a traditional portfolio. The article suggests a hybrid approach, using both strategies to balance security with flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

This initiative, developed with France and Germany, follows the breakdown of U.S.-led talks and aims to provide immediate relief and a path toward a two-state solution. The discussion also touched on the dire humanitarian situation, with Trump acknowledging the "real starvation" in Gaza, a position at odds with recent claims by the Israeli government.
