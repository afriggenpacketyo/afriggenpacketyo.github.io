        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a thrilling first Test match at Headingley, England's captain Ben Stokes played a crucial role in checking India's progress after Harry Brook's impressive 99 runs. Brook, who had been dropped twice and played aggressively, missed out on a century on his home ground after being caught. England managed to get close to India's first innings total thanks to a quick partnership between Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse. Stokes' timely wicket of Sai Sudharsan left India at 90-2, holding a narrow lead of 96 runs as drizzle and fading light brought the day's play to a close, leaving the match beautifully poised.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets largely closed higher on Sunday, demonstrating resilience following U.S. strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. Tel Aviv stocks reached record highs, driven by expectations that Washington's intervention would expedite the conflict's resolution. Gulf markets initially rose but Saudi Arabia's Tadawul eventually closed slightly down, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Despite regional tensions, analysts suggest the Gulf's diplomatic stance and calls for peaceful resolutions have shielded it from significant market turmoil, with some believing the removal of the Iranian threat could positively influence international investors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire during a service at Crosspointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, wounding one person before being killed by a security guard. The pastor, Bobby Kelly Jr., reported that the wounded individual was the security guard, who was shot in the leg. Another church member reportedly ran the shooter over with his truck, which provided the security guard an opportunity to fatally shoot the suspect. Approximately 150 people were present at the service when the incident occurred, and local authorities were immediately notified.</p>

          <h2>Five Phrases to Avoid and What to Say Instead to Encourage Children to Listen</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 13:03:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda suggests avoiding phrases that trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, such as "Because I said so" or "Stop crying." Instead, she recommends using language that respects a child's autonomy and sets clear boundaries, for example, explaining the reasoning behind a decision or acknowledging a child's feelings. By shifting to language that fosters cooperation, parents can create an environment where children feel respected and emotionally safe, which encourages them to listen and regulate themselves more effectively. The goal is to respond with empathy and leadership rather than control and criticism, ultimately strengthening the parent-child bond.</p>

          <p>Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi service is set to debut in Austin, Texas, giving a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis. The pilot program will likely involve a small number of cars operating in a geofenced area, with Tesla investors and enthusiasts among the first to use the new Robotaxi App. Safety concerns and regulatory scrutiny surround autonomous vehicles, with lawmakers requesting a delay until safety regulations take effect, and if successful, the rollout of the robotaxi service could help boost the company's fortunes and potentially reach a $2 trillion market cap by 2026.</p>

          <p>NATO member countries have reportedly agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP, fulfilling a benchmark long advocated by US President Donald Trump. Spain initially opposed the measure but later agreed to an exemption, and the formal vote is expected during an upcoming NATO meeting. The new spending target requires all member nations except Spain to reach the 5% goal by 2035, allocating at least 3.5% to core military needs and an additional 1.5% to related expenditures, and this agreement marks a significant shift in defense spending commitments among NATO members.</p>
