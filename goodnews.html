          <p>Chinese tech firm Baidu saw its Hong Kong shares soar after announcing a significant AI partnership with state-owned China Merchants Group. The collaboration will focus on applying large language models and "digital employees" to real-world business scenarios. To further its AI ambitions and reduce reliance on foreign chips, Baidu also launched a $56.2 million offshore bond offering, signaling what analysts call an "all-in AI pivot" for the company. The move aims to secure a competitive edge in China's burgeoning AI sector.</p>

          <p>The massive Yiwu wholesale market, known as the "world's supermarket," is experiencing a noticeable shift in its customer base, mirroring a broader Chinese economic pivot away from the United States. U.S.-China trade tensions and tariffs have led to a decline in American buyers, with merchants now catering more to customers from the Middle East, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. This trend is reflected in national data, which shows China's exports to the U.S. have dropped while shipments to emerging markets have surged, though often for lower profit margins.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have arrested five individuals allegedly involved in a sophisticated drug trafficking operation that used luxury private shipping companies to transport vast quantities of cocaine and cash between Los Angeles and New York. The organization is accused of shipping at least 22 tons of cocaine, valued at around $315 million, from L.A. to New York's Diamond District over several years, using a downtown jewelry store as a front. The investigation has so far led to the seizure of over $2.8 million in cash and 1,600 pounds of cocaine.</p>

          <p>Democrat Xp Lee has won a special election for the Minnesota House seat previously held by the late Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was assassinated in June. Lee's victory over Republican Ruth Bittner restores the 67-67 tie in the chamber, preserving a power-sharing agreement between the two parties for the remainder of the legislative session. The election took place amid heightened concerns over political violence following Hortman's murder and the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Lee stated he aims to calm the "charged atmosphere" in politics.</p>

          <p>On his show, personal finance personality Dave Ramsey counseled a caller who, despite earning $150,000 annually with no debt and seven children, felt financially "super tight." Ramsey diagnosed the issue not as a money problem but as a "chaos and disorganization problem." He advised the caller to implement a detailed monthly budget to assign a role to every dollar before the month begins, rather than putting money into savings and trying to live on the remainder. This approach, he argued, would reveal that their income is sufficient when managed properly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is leading an initiative to reduce internal bureaucracy, which he described as "anathema" to innovation and entrepreneurialism. As part of a broader cultural reset, the company has sought to flatten its organizational structure and has created a "no bureaucracy email alias" for employees to flag inefficient processes. Jassy reported that this feedback has already led to the change of over 450 internal procedures. The effort is part of his strategy to make the global giant operate with the scrappy, fast-moving mentality of a startup.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted for the fourth consecutive month in August, but the 0.1% year-on-year decline was significantly smaller than economists had forecast. The better-than-expected performance was supported by a rebound in shipments to Asia and a sharp jump in exports to Western Europe. However, exports to the United States continued to fall sharply, particularly in the automotive sector, despite a recent trade deal that lowered tariff rates. The data provides a mixed view of the world's fourth-largest economy as it navigates global trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

In a statement following a call with the U.S. President, she emphasized that Russia's war economy is sustained by fossil fuel revenues. The move is part of a forthcoming 19th package of sanctions targeting Russia's energy, banking, and crypto sectors. The EU's current timeline aims to halt Russian gas imports by 2028 and oil by 2027, but the new proposal seeks to shorten that timeframe.</p>

The author argues that while Shanghai has robust AI infrastructure, Hong Kong's unique "one country, two systems" framework and independent judiciary could reassure international partners and mitigate Western skepticism. By leveraging its international credibility, Hong Kong could serve as a valuable bridge, helping to navigate U.S.-China tech tensions and position the city at the center of global AI diplomacy and standards-setting.</p>

Dan Cooper, now 39, said serving on a jury in an unrelated case in 2018 inspired him to re-report the crime to the police. His attacker was convicted of two counts of sexual assault and one count of assault by penetration and sentenced to eight years in prison.

Authorities report that the woman was confronted by a man who brandished a knife and demanded she hand over her cup of tea. She responded by tossing the drink at him, which gave her an opportunity to escape and call for help. San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies arrived shortly after and arrested a 29-year-old suspect at the shopping center on a charge of robbery. No injuries were reported in the incident.</p>
