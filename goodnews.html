          <p>Amidst protests in Los Angeles, the National Guard and Marines have been deployed with specific rules of force, prioritizing the protection of federal buildings and personnel without engaging directly with protesters or patrolling streets. According to U.S. officials, troops are carrying weapons but without ammunition loaded, using it only for self-defense, and they are prohibited from using rubber bullets or pepper spray. These rules would change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done, and the personnel are led by Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman with de-escalation as the top priority. The deployed force, known as "Task Force 51," consists of 2,100 National Guard soldiers and 700 active-duty Marines trained in de-escalation and crowd control. The troops' deployment is intended to ensure continuous coverage of the area due to protests against immigration sweeps.</p>

The program would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028.

          <p>President Trump is promoting the new 'Trump Savings Account' as part of the GOP megabill, which aims to provide a strong start in life for American children at no cost to the taxpayer. If the bill becomes law, the government would deposit $1,000 into a tax-deferred, low-cost index fund account for each newborn, with additional contributions allowed up to $5,000 annually. The accounts would be used to cover expenses like college or a down payment on a home when the children reach adulthood. House Speaker Mike Johnson touted the policy as a transformative measure that would give every eligible American child a financial head start from day one.</p>

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Justice Department over its demand that school districts ban transgender athletes from competing in sports, arguing the federal agency has overstepped its authority in violation of state and federal law. The lawsuit is a response to a letter from the Justice Department warning school districts of potential legal liability if they do not ban transgender athletes, arguing that allowing them to compete would deprive girls of athletic opportunities based solely on their biological sex. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta argues that the state's antidiscrimination laws protect transgender athletes and that excluding them constitutes illegal discrimination. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the constitutionality of California's laws and prevent the Trump administration from taking retaliatory actions against school districts that refuse to comply with the federal directive.</p>

Frank has been described as the opposite of Postecoglou for his adaptability, and would be Tottenham's fourth permanent manager since 30 June 2021. There is much more pressure at Tottenham than there is at Brentford, because of the expectation - and the manager has to handle that expectation.</p>

Baldoni's lawsuit centered on claims that Lively stole the film from him and his company by threatening not to promote it, and that she promoted a false narrative that Baldoni sexually assaulted her and launched a smear campaign against her. The judge determined that Baldoni and his company had not adequately alleged that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion and had not proved defamation. Lively's lawyers called the opinion a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit.</p>
