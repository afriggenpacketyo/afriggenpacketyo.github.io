          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has outlined a plan to reintroduce a form of military conscription to address the changed security landscape in Europe. The proposed bill would allow the government, with parliamentary approval, to draft conscripts if a defense situation requires a rapid increase in armed forces personnel. This model is seen as a compromise, stopping short of the full compulsory service suspended in 2011 but creating a framework for emergencies. The plan also aims to make voluntary service more attractive with significantly higher pay to boost the number of active soldiers and reservists.</p>

          <h2>Experts Dismiss 'Cloud Seeding' Conspiracy Theories as Cause of Texas Floods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the deadly Texas floods, conspiracy theories blaming "cloud seeding" for the disaster have spread on social media, amplified by some political figures. However, meteorological experts have unequivocally debunked these claims, stating it is physically impossible for the weather modification technique to create a storm of such magnitude. Scientists explain that cloud seeding can only slightly enhance rainfall in existing clouds, not generate massive weather systems or the trillions of gallons of water seen in the floods. The catastrophic event was caused by a combination of natural atmospheric conditions.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Black Americans are moving abroad and reporting happier, more fulfilling lives with fewer experiences of racism. Many expats state that in other countries, they are perceived as American first, rather than being primarily defined by their race, which reduces the daily burden of discrimination they often face in the U.S. Beyond social benefits, they also cite a better work-life balance, improved economic opportunities, and a greater sense of safety and inclusion. For many, leaving the U.S. has allowed them to achieve a version of the American dream that felt unattainable at home.</p>

          <p>American Taylor Fritz has advanced to his first Wimbledon semi-final after defeating Karen Khachanov in a tense four-set match. Fritz appeared to be cruising after winning the first two sets, but a sudden loss of form allowed Khachanov to dominate the third. Despite a momentary dip and a bizarre line-calling system malfunction at the start of the fourth set, Fritz regained his composure and powerful serve. He ultimately clinched the victory in a tie-break, 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6(4), setting up a match against either Carlos Alcaraz or Cameron Norrie.</p>

Sunak, who previously worked at the investment bank in the early 2000s before entering politics, will advise the firm's global clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. His appointment was delayed by a government watchdog for one year after he left his ministerial role due to potential conflicts of interest. Sunak, who remains a Member of Parliament, will donate his pay from the new role to his numeracy-focused charity.</p>

The deliveries included 42 of its best-selling 737 MAX jets and, significantly, eight aircraft to Chinese customers. These are the first deliveries to China since Beijing lifted a ban that was imposed during a trade dispute between the two nations. The increase in deliveries is a crucial development for Boeing as it works to stabilize its finances after years of production setbacks and high-profile crises.</p>

          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears of a sharp inflation spike due to tariffs have subsided. In June, respondents' expectation for inflation one year from now fell to 3%, the same level as in January before the Trump administration's major tariff announcements. This marks a retreat from a peak of 3.6% reached in March and April, suggesting that a more conciliatory U.S. approach to trade negotiations has eased public concern. While the overall inflation outlook softened, expectations for price increases in specific areas like medical care and rent remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the New York City mayoral primary victory of Zohran Mamdani, an advocate for Palestinian rights, as a lesson in coalition-building for the political left. His success was partly due to a cross-endorsement with Brad Lander, a self-described "progressive Zionist," an alliance that defied ideological purity tests. Instead of hiding their differences on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they focused on shared local goals, persuading their respective bases to support each other. This strategy suggests a path forward for Democrats to build broader coalitions by prioritizing common ground.</p>

Downing Street expects new tactics, allowing French police to intervene on boats in shallow waters, to become operational soon. While the government is pushing for a "one in, one out" returns deal, where the UK would return a migrant for every asylum seeker it accepts with family ties, it remains a complex negotiation. The talks come as 2025 has already set a record for Channel crossings in the first six months of a year.</p>
