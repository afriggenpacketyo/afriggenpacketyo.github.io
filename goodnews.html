          <p>Despite concerns over looming tariff deadlines, several positive factors are currently bolstering the stock market. A strong second-quarter earnings season, led by the banking sector, has set a positive tone for investors. Additionally, proposed tax relief measures in President Trump's "big beautiful bill," such as extending 2017 tax cuts and increasing child tax credits, are expected to inject billions into the economy and support consumer spending. Other tailwinds include tax relief for business R&D, increased domestic manufacturing, and massive investments needed for data centers and the energy grid, suggesting a resilient economic outlook.

          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ anticipates that the technology will cross a critical threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. Founded in 2018, SpinQ develops both small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful industrial-grade systems. The company's CEO, Xiang Jingen, compares the current state of quantum technology to the 1950s semiconductor industry, a period of transition before integrated circuits revolutionized computing. SpinQ has already sold its products, including chips and software, to customers in over 50 countries, signaling growing global interest in the emerging field.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners at the Orgreave coking plant, a pivotal event during the year-long miners' strike. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will address unanswered questions that have persisted for over 40 years regarding the confrontation and its aftermath. The probe will examine the events of the day, the failed prosecutions of 95 miners, and allegations of falsified police evidence. The decision marks a significant moment for campaigners and former mining communities who have long sought truth and accountability for one of British industrial history's most contentious episodes.</p>

          <p>Mezcal, once overshadowed by tequila, is now a booming half-billion-dollar industry, with artisanal, family-owned distilleries in Oaxaca, Mexico, at its heart. The spirit's rise is exemplified by brands like Mal de Amor and Ilegal, which have preserved traditional, handcrafted production methods while achieving international success. Many mezcaleros, like the Hernandez brothers, returned to their family businesses after working in the U.S., capitalizing on the growing global demand for authentic spirits. This growth has transformed local economies, creating jobs and opportunity in communities where mezcal production was once a subsistence craft.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler's performance is drawing comparisons to the dominance of Tiger Woods, as he becomes a defining force in modern golf. Since his 2021 Ryder Cup breakthrough, Scheffler has won four major championships and solidified his world number one ranking with machine-like consistency. While Scheffler himself dismisses the parallels, his peers and analysts point to his calm demeanor, ruthless ability to close out tournaments, and a recently improved putting game as key factors in his success. His unorthodox swing and quiet personality differ from Woods, but his results have established him as the undisputed benchmark for his competitors.</p>

          <p>During a recent concert, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin gave a humorous warning to the audience before performing the "Jumbotron Song," advising them to prepare in case they appeared on the large video screens. The warning follows a viral incident at a previous show where a man and woman, later identified as executives from the same company, were caught on camera in an intimate moment and quickly separated. That incident led to the CEO's resignation and a formal investigation by the company. Martin's new pre-song banter appears to be a lighthearted acknowledgment of the potential for awkward, high-profile moments during the fan-focused segment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the most crucial skill for a successful life is self-connection—the ability to understand one's own emotions and needs. This skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence, acting as a buffer against anxiety and self-doubt. The article suggests that parents can nurture this by validating their child's feelings, welcoming their full range of emotions, and modeling their own self-awareness. Simple shifts in language, like asking "What were you feeling?" instead of "Why did you do that?", can help children develop a strong and trusting inner voice.</p>
