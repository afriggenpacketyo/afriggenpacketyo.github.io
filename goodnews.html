          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator plans to visit the United States for further talks, aiming to reach common ground before a mid-June summit between the two countries' leaders. Capital spending by Japanese companies rose 6.4% in January-March, reflecting robust investment in production capacity and digitalization. Former yokozuna Hakuho is expected to announce his retirement from the Japan Sumo Association on June 9, amid uncertainty about the future of his scandal-hit Miyagino stable. Other news includes defense tech subsidies for Japanese universities and the return of a whaling ship with 25 fin whales.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are spearheading a decade-long collaboration to create a comprehensive genomic atlas of Southeast Asia, addressing the historical underrepresentation of the region in the Human Genome Project. The SEA3K data set, published in Nature, includes genome sequencing for 3,023 individuals from six countries, covering five language families and 30 ethnic languages. The study revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry linked to Russia's far east. This initiative aims to rectify the omission of mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) populations, which contributed a mere 1.57 per cent to global genomic databases prior to this research.</p>

          <p>Despite global economic uncertainties, the aviation industry is projected to experience improved profitability in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Revenue, operating profits, and net profits are expected to increase, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. The industry's net profit margin is forecast to rise to 3.7%, with total revenues projected to reach a record high of $979 billion. Passenger load factors are expected to hit an all-time high, averaging 84% for the year, despite challenges in fleet expansion and modernization due to supply chain issues (not investment advice).</p>

A new company listed in Sydney will acquire all outstanding shares of both firms, creating an entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, but critics argued it suppressed shareholder value. The move is seen positively by investors, simplifying the structure and adding scale to create a more investable company (not investment advice).</p>
