          <p>Despite widespread concern over potential economic impacts from threatened tariffs, U.S. stock markets like the S&P 500 have recently reached record highs. This resilience is attributed to a stronger-than-expected economy, a solid labor market, and decent corporate earnings, which have relieved investors. Some market analysts also believe President Trump's tariff actions may ultimately be less severe than his initial threats, though fears of a future downturn persist due to the high valuation of stocks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by J. Randy Taraborrelli claims that while Jackie Kennedy was aware of her husband's infidelities, she viewed his connection to Marilyn Monroe as uniquely threatening. The book alleges Jackie warned President John F. Kennedy that Monroe "could be trouble," prompting her to skip his 1962 birthday celebration where the actress famously sang. However, the author also presents testimony from Monroe's publicist, Pat Newcomb, who disputes the long-rumored affair, suggesting it may have been a figment of Monroe's imagination.</p>
