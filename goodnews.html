          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have unveiled a new 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The proposal includes an immediate ceasefire, the release of all Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and a staged withdrawal of Israeli forces. The plan also outlines a future for Gaza governed by a temporary technocratic committee overseen by an international body, with the potential for an eventual Palestinian state. International leaders have offered varied reactions, with many expressing cautious optimism while urging all parties to engage with the proposal seriously.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL's announcement that global megastar Bad Bunny will headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show has prompted backlash from some conservative commentators. Critics have taken issue with the choice of the Puerto Rican artist, citing his predominantly Spanish-language music, his political endorsements, and his criticism of U.S. immigration policies. This reaction follows a pattern of right-wing condemnation of past halftime performers, such as Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé, for their perceived political statements. Despite the controversy, Bad Bunny is one of the world's most-streamed artists, making him a commercially logical choice for music's most-watched performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed on Tuesday, with investor attention focused on the upcoming interest rate decision from the Reserve Bank of Australia. Analysts widely expect the RBA to maintain its cash rate at 3.6% as persistent high inflation limits the central bank's ability to ease monetary policy. Elsewhere in the region, Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight decline, while South Korea's Kospi posted modest gains. The market movements followed a positive session on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both closed higher, regaining some momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to intensify into a hurricane but is projected to move away from the southeastern United States. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm was bringing heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas on Monday. The forecast track shows Imelda turning sharply to the east-northeast, taking it away from the Florida coast and toward Bermuda by Wednesday. While a direct hit on the U.S. mainland is not expected, swells generated by the storm are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the East Coast this week.</p>

          <p>A Florida-based joint task force has seized a record-breaking one million pounds of cocaine during the 2025 fiscal year. The unit, Joint Inter-Agency Task Force – South, works with international partners to disrupt drug trafficking from South America through the Caribbean. Officials stated that the massive haul represents 378 million lethal doses of the drug and has denied cartels and narco-terrorist organizations an estimated $11.34 billion in revenue. The seizure reflects the Trump administration's strategy to intensify military-led counter-narcotics operations in the region to stem the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.</p>

          <p>A study led by Dr. Gladys Maestre has uncovered alarmingly high rates of memory loss and dementia in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. Her research found that nearly 20% of residents over 65 suffer from memory loss, compared to a national average of around 12%, and she suspects the true figure could be even higher. Researchers are now investigating a combination of potential causes, including genetic factors, high rates of related health issues like diabetes, and environmental factors such as pollution. The findings have prompted state lawmakers to approve significant funding for dementia research to address the growing public health issue.</p>

The remaining $2.5 million will be distributed among the other plaintiffs in the case. The settlement notice explicitly states that it does not constitute an admission of liability by YouTube and was entered into to avoid further litigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that the current investor excitement for artificial intelligence is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s. He argued that the major tech companies leading the AI boom, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, are highly profitable and well-capitalized, unlike many of the speculative dot-com era firms that collapsed. Cramer noted that these established companies can absorb losses from bad investments without facing bankruptcy. While expressing confidence in the AI thesis, he also welcomed market skepticism, suggesting it helps prevent the kind of unchecked frenzy that leads to a crash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has announced a new action plan to rein in cutthroat competition within its strategic non-ferrous metals sector. The plan projects a reduced output growth of 1.5% for this year, down significantly from 4.3% last year, for metals like copper, aluminum, and lithium. Instead of focusing on volume, the government aims to optimize the industrial structure and increase the sector's value-added output. This move comes as processing fees have remained low, squeezing the profit margins of the country's metal smelters and processors. (not investment advice)</p>

Kay admitted she was simply proud and didn't think he would find out. McConaughey said the hiatus ended once he felt more secure in his fame, and he has since let his mother speak freely.</p>

          <p>At the Los Angeles Lakers' media day, LeBron James fueled speculation about his future by responding with "maybe" when asked if he would return for another season. Entering his 23rd year in the NBA, the 40-year-old superstar acknowledged that the end of his career is "a lot sooner than later" but did not provide a definitive timeline for retirement. This ambiguity creates a complex situation for the Lakers organization, which must navigate the season without knowing if it is building for a final championship run with James or preparing for a future without him.

Additionally, parents can opt to receive notifications if the system detects that their child is exhibiting signs of potential self-harm during interactions with the chatbot. This move follows public pressure and a wrongful death lawsuit that alleged the AI program contributed to a teenager's suicide, prompting the company to implement more robust safeguards.</p>
