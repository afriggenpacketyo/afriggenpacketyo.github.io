          <p>Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi made a surprise return to the Glastonbury festival, performing on the Pyramid Stage two years after taking a break to focus on his mental health and Tourette's syndrome. He told the supportive crowd he wanted to finish the set he was unable to complete in 2023, where his voice failed and fans helped him sing. The performance coincided with the release of his new single, "Survive," which addresses his personal struggles. His return was met with widespread enthusiasm from fans and fellow artists.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) authority to manage the Universal Service Fund, a program subsidizing internet and phone services for rural and underserved communities.

Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the majority, affirmed that the delegation was constitutional, ensuring continued funding for the $8 billion program.

          <p>Americans are increasingly prioritizing saving over spending, a trend dubbed "revenge saving," as concerns about inflation, tariffs, and job security grow. The U.S. personal saving rate has risen significantly in 2025, reflecting a shift away from the post-pandemic "revenge spending" splurge. This cautious financial behavior is also seen in record-high 401(k) contribution rates, as workers focus on long-term security. Financial experts suggest this defensive strategy helps consumers build a cash cushion to shield themselves from future economic volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has defended his government's welfare reform plans after making significant concessions to avert a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The initial proposals would have tightened eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip), but the stricter criteria will now only apply to new claimants. The government also reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit for existing recipients. While the compromise has satisfied many MPs, some on the left of the party still plan to vote against the bill, arguing the changes do not go far enough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's ruling limiting nationwide injunctions, while an immediate benefit to the Trump administration, is not a complete ban on the practice. The decision in the birthright citizenship case suggests that while such broad orders should be rare, they may still be permissible when necessary to provide "complete relief" to a plaintiff, such as a state. The opinion leaves the door open for a nationwide injunction in this specific case and suggests class-action lawsuits as another path to similar relief. This nuanced decision could also benefit future Democratic administrations by reining in the power of single district judges.</p>
