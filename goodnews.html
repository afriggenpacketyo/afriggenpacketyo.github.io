          <p>Chime priced its IPO at $27 per share, valuing the fintech company at $11.6 billion ahead of its Nasdaq debut. The company raised approximately $700 million in the IPO, with existing investors selling an additional $165 million worth of shares.

This offering follows a period of limited fintech IPO activity, with rising interest rates and valuation adjustments keeping many companies on the sidelines. Other fintech companies like eToro and Circle have recently seen positive market debuts. (not investment advice)</p>

Among the reinstated branches is the National Center for Environmental Health, which oversees a lead prevention program for children. The cuts to this branch had left several schools in Milwaukee without federal assistance. The chaotic dismissal of experts across the agency had prompted outcry from the science community and questions from Republicans, especially as their states were impacted by cut programs. </p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The preliminary injunction, issued by Judge Michael Farbiarz, prevents the government from deporting Khalil due to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's activities would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge found that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged and his speech chilled, causing irreparable harm. However, the government can still pursue deportation based on alleged inaccuracies in Khalil's green card application. </p>

This suggests a potential shift in the administration's approach, as officials had previously indicated that an agreement would be necessary before extending the pause.

          <p>Egg prices for consumers fell to a 5-month low in May, dropping to $4.55 per dozen, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price decrease is attributed to the receding effects of a years-long avian flu outbreak and a seasonal easing in demand. While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, they remain elevated compared to the previous year. Experts suggest that containing the avian flu has been a primary factor in the recent price drop. (not investment advice)</p>
