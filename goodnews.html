          <p>Irish center Garry Ringrose has withdrawn from the British and Irish Lions' second Test match against Australia after experiencing concussion symptoms during training. This marks the second time a head injury has sidelined him on the tour, disrupting the team's lineup, which now features a new midfield pairing. Coach Andy Farrell expressed disappointment for Ringrose but praised his honesty in prioritizing his health and the team's needs. The Lions, aiming for a historic back-to-back tour victory in the same country, face a determined Australian side in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank announced a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations and reaffirming its full-year targets. The positive results came despite the strengthening euro impacting revenues and mixed performance within its investment banking division. While fixed income and currency trading saw an 11% revenue increase, the origination and advisory unit experienced a 29% decline amid market uncertainty. The bank's CEO expressed confidence in meeting 2025 goals, as the lender navigates a lower interest rate environment and potential trade-related economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's government is set to launch a pilot program providing monthly subsidy coupons to its senior citizens to alleviate the financial strain of its aging population and stimulate the elderly-care service industry. The electronic vouchers, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, will be available to seniors assessed as moderately to severely disabled. This targeted fiscal support is a rare move for Beijing, which has typically avoided direct handouts. Economists see it as a positive step toward strengthening the social safety net, which could help unlock domestic consumption.</p>

          <p>After a ten-year legal battle, former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate quashed by the UK's Supreme Court. The ruling overturns one of the most high-profile prosecutions following the 2008 financial crisis and raises questions about potential compensation and appeals from other convicted traders. The decision has prompted calls for a public inquiry into the conduct of the Serious Fraud Office and the role senior bank managers and central banks played in interest rate manipulation during that period.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, stating that the order's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause is incorrect. The clause grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. The 2-1 ruling found that a nationwide injunction was appropriate to provide complete relief to the states that challenged the order, marking a significant legal setback for the administration.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by local opposition, or "NIMBYism," a growing number of states are passing laws to compel cities to allow for more affordable and denser housing. In states like Utah, where home prices are out of reach for most, the government is mandating that municipalities create more housing options to combat a national shortage. This top-down approach aims to help younger generations build wealth through homeownership. However, these mandates face significant pushback from local governments and residents concerned about overcrowding, strained infrastructure, and the loss of local control.</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking just 7,000 steps a day is linked to a significantly reduced risk of major health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. This more achievable target could encourage more people to track their activity, as the widely-known 10,000-step goal is not based on scientific evidence. The research, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, found that even modest increases in daily steps provide substantial health benefits.
