          <p>After a 20-year restoration project, the tomb of Amenhotep III, one of ancient Egypt's most prominent pharaohs, has reopened to the public. Located in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, the large tomb was first discovered in 1799 but had been closed for extensive renovation work led by a Japanese team. The restoration included preserving paintings of the pharaoh and his wife on the tomb's walls. This reopening is part of Egypt's broader effort to revive its tourism sector, a vital source of foreign currency for the country's economy.</p>

He recalls that even Bill Gates called it "the stupidest decision," but he was won over by Jeff Bezos's compelling vision. Risher was impressed by Bezos's intense focus on the customer experience and his bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000. Risher became a key executive during Amazon's explosive early growth, helping expand it from books into multiple new product categories.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of A Showgirl," has ignited fan speculation, particularly around the track "Actually Romantic," which is widely believed to be a diss track aimed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The song's lyrics refer to another singer who writes songs about hating Swift. In an accompanying film, Swift described the track as a "love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the amount of attention, even if negative, to be flattering. This has fueled theories that it is a direct response to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife."</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired an approximate 2% stake in the software company Workiva. Irenic is urging the company to enhance its operational efficiency, improve corporate governance by collapsing its dual-class share structure, and explore strategic alternatives, including a possible sale. Despite strong revenue growth and high customer retention, Workiva has struggled with profitability, trading at a discount to its peers. Irenic is seeking two new board seats to oversee these changes, aiming to unlock shareholder value at the founder-controlled company. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urenco's uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico, the only one of its kind in the U.S., is ramping up production to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This demand is driven by the electricity needs of AI data centers and a push for domestic manufacturing, coupled with a forthcoming ban on Russian uranium imports. The plant, which currently supplies about a third of U.S. demand, is expanding its capacity by 15% to help fill the supply gap. The article highlights that the entire nuclear supply chain will need to expand to meet ambitious national goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a conservative and China hawk, as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, defeated the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi in a runoff vote. Her leadership is expected to bring a hard-line stance on foreign policy, particularly concerning China, and a focus on strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance. Domestically, she faces the challenges of addressing rising prices and restoring public trust in the LDP after recent election losses.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with an early, asymptomatic stage of the disease after she insisted on early screening. Despite being told she was too young for a mammogram by previous doctors, a high-risk clinic approved her for screening at age 36, leading to the discovery of two suspicious masses via an MRI. Her oncologist credits her self-advocacy with catching the cancer at a stage with a 99% five-year survival rate. Del Barrio's story underscores the importance of understanding personal risk factors and advocating for one's own health.</p>

          <p>This opinion article pays tribute to the life and work of primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91. It revisits her revolutionary discovery in 1960 that chimpanzees make and use tools, a finding that forced science to reconsider the definition of humanity. Her patient, empathetic approach, exemplified by her first gentle contact with the chimp she named David Greybeard, transformed our understanding of animal intelligence. Goodall's legacy extends beyond her research to global conservation efforts, forever changing how humans perceive their place in the natural world.</p>

          <p>Ted Koerner may be one of the first residents to move back into a completely rebuilt home in Altadena, California, following the devastating Eaton fire. His primary motivation for the rapid reconstruction is his 13-year-old golden retriever, Daisy, whom he wants to allow to live out her final years in their familiar home. By liquidating retirement funds to start immediately and tenaciously navigating the bureaucracy, Koerner has pushed his project to near-completion while most others are still in the permitting phase.

          <p>The long-held belief in the enduring prestige of elite universities is being challenged as families increasingly prioritize practical factors like tuition costs, career services, and hands-on learning opportunities. With college sticker prices soaring and the job market uncertain, many parents are questioning whether a brand-name degree is worth the high cost. This shift is causing fluctuations in college rankings, with schools like Northeastern and NYU rising in prominence by catering to these new priorities. The article suggests that a school's value is now measured more by what it delivers than by its historical reputation.</p>

          <p>Israel has reportedly halted its offensive military operations in Gaza to allow Hamas to organize for a potential hostage release, following the militant group's positive response to a peace deal outlined by President Trump. While not an official ceasefire, the pause is a significant step, with indirect talks set to begin in Egypt. Hamas stated it agreed to parts of the proposal, including the release of all hostages, though other aspects remain under negotiation. The Palestinian Authority has welcomed the developments, emphasizing the need for a complete ceasefire and humanitarian aid delivery.</p>
