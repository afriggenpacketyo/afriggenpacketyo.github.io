          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before congressional committees to discuss budget cuts, department restructuring, and his stance on vaccines, facing criticism from Democratic representatives like Rosa DeLauro, who accused him of gutting life-saving programs. Kennedy defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate wasteful spending, despite concerns about layoffs affecting critical regulatory roles. He reaffirmed his support for vaccines but acknowledged ongoing CDC studies on potential links to autism, a stance that has drawn scrutiny given measles outbreaks across the U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy expressed that Kennedy assured him he would not alter vaccine policy without scientific evidence, highlighting the ongoing tension between Kennedy's statements and public health concerns.</p>
