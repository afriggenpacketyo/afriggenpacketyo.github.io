        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million complaint against Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds. Baldoni claimed Lively falsely accused him of sexual harassment in an attempt to repair her reputation following the fallout around the "It Ends With Us" press tour. The judge stated that Baldoni's legal team did not sufficiently allege that Lively, Reynolds, or their publicist acted with serious doubt about the truth of their statements, which is required for defamation claims. The court found that the claims against Lively were privileged and that the other allegations lacked the necessary elements for a defamation case, leading to the dismissal of the amended complaint in its entirety.</p>
