          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership during the 1970 "successful failure," where an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft, but the crew managed a safe return to Earth. He also flew on the Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon. NASA and his family remembered him as a hero whose steadfast courage and unshakeable optimism inspired millions and contributed significantly to the future of space exploration.</p>

Common disqualifiers include failing the income-based means test for Chapter 7, having a recent bankruptcy discharge, or not completing mandatory credit counseling. Additionally, actions considered fraudulent, such as hiding assets, lying on forms, or making large luxury purchases just before filing, can lead to rejection and potential criminal charges. The article also suggests alternatives like debt consolidation or settlement for those who do not qualify. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty and rising prices, gold is gaining attention as a stable investment, with major retailers now making it more accessible. For beginners, there are several ways to invest, including opening a gold IRA to diversify retirement savings or purchasing physical gold like bars and coins, which requires secure storage. Other options involve the stock market, such as buying shares in gold mining companies or investing in gold-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While gold is seen as a hedge against volatility, the article notes it typically offers less growth than the stock market over the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is driving significant growth in the digital advertising market, with giants like Meta and Alphabet reporting strong earnings fueled by AI-powered ad system efficiencies. Meta's revenue surged 22% year-over-year, partly due to increased spending from Asian-based retailers and North American advertisers. However, the success is not universal across the tech industry. While Reddit posted a 78% sales increase, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, with Snap missing user revenue targets and Pinterest noting a pullback in ad spending, highlighting the competitive pressure to innovate and execute flawlessly.</p>

          <p>Gold futures fell from a record high after the White House announced it would issue an executive order to clarify "misinformation" regarding tariffs on gold bullion. The statement came after the Swiss Precious Metals Association raised concerns that a 39% U.S. tariff on Swiss exports was being applied to 1-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars, potentially disrupting the international flow of physical gold. Following the White House's announcement, gold futures, which had reached an all-time closing high of $3,491.30, dropped to trade at $3,463.30, easing market fears of a major trade disruption.

          <p>Tesla has been granted a permit to operate a ride-hailing business across Texas, positioning it to compete with services like Uber and Lyft. The permit, issued by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, allows Tesla Robotaxi LLC to run a "transportation network company" until August 2026. Since June, the company has been conducting a limited, invitation-only robotaxi service in Austin using Model Y vehicles with a human safety supervisor present. This new permit enables statewide operation, including with fully autonomous vehicles, marking a significant step in Elon Musk's long-stated ambition for a robotaxi fleet.</p>

          <h2>EV Sales Surge as Buyers Rush to Claim Federal Tax Credit Before Expiration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 14:37:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicle sales are experiencing a significant surge as consumers hurry to purchase before a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 is eliminated on September 30. Legislation signed by President Trump ended the Biden-era incentive, creating a rush that analysts predict could lead to a record-breaking third quarter for EV sales. In July, new EV purchases hit their second-highest monthly total on record, accounting for 9.1% of all passenger vehicle sales. Dealers are capitalizing on the deadline by offering additional incentives, but analysts warn that EV sales are likely to "collapse" once the tax credit expires. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to sell stock in government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, potentially creating one of the largest stock offerings in history. According to The Wall Street Journal, administration officials are discussing valuations for the companies that could exceed $500 billion. Leaders of major Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have met with President Trump to discuss the plans. This complex deal would end the government's conservatorship of the two firms, which began during the 2008 financial crisis, and return them to private shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The relationship between the European Union and India is facing new complexities after the EU sanctioned an Indian refinery, partly owned by Russia's Rosneft, for processing Russian crude. This move, part of the EU's sanctions against Russia, aims to curb funding for the war in Ukraine. However, experts believe this will have a limited impact on the broader EU-India trade negotiations. A more significant pressure point for India is the threat of high U.S. tariffs, which may paradoxically push New Delhi to finalize a free trade agreement with the EU to secure a more predictable economic partnership.</p>
