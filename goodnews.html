          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations, leading to a jump in its stock price. The company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast, attributing the strong performance to improvements in its retail pharmacy operations and its Aetna insurance unit. CEO David Joyner highlighted a "multiyear recovery effort" at Aetna, which has been managing higher medical costs, and noted investments in pharmacy technology and labor have boosted efficiency. While the insurance and retail segments showed strength, this was partially offset by a decline in the health services division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not run for governor of California, ending months of speculation about her next political move. In a statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she decided her public service would not be in elected office for now, though she remains committed to fighting for Democratic values. Sources close to Harris indicated she seriously considered the role but felt she could have a greater impact on the national stage. This decision keeps the door open for a potential presidential run in 2028 as she plans to campaign for other Democrats.</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of four charges related to spot-fixing by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately getting booked in four separate Premier League matches to influence the betting market and faced a potential lifetime ban if found guilty. While the commission found the spot-fixing charges "not proven," it did find Paqueta guilty on two lesser counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation. A sanction for these breaches will be decided at a later date.</p>

The company's net bookings also grew by 51% to $1.44 billion, well ahead of analyst forecasts. In response to the positive results, Roblox raised its bookings guidance for the upcoming third quarter, signaling confidence in its continued growth and strategic investments in its platform.

          <p>An Ohio couple has welcomed a baby boy born from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, reportedly setting a new world record for the longest-frozen embryo to result in a live birth. The embryo was created through IVF in 1994 and was adopted by Lindsey and Tim Pierce after they struggled with infertility. The donor, who had already used one of four created embryos to have her own daughter 30 years ago, found the couple through a Christian embryo adoption agency. The previous record was held by twins born in 2022 from embryos frozen for nearly 30 years.</p>
