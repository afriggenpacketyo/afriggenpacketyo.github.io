          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $1.7 billion after no winner in the latest drawing, making it the fifth-largest in the lottery's history. CBS News data analysis highlights the odds of winning, frequently drawn numbers, and the significant impact of state taxes on prize payouts. Winners in states like California, Florida, and Texas, which do not tax lottery prizes, could take home considerably more after federal taxes than those in states with high income taxes such as New York. The analysis offers a detailed breakdown for potential winners considering annuity versus lump-sum options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Julia Koch and her family are set to purchase a 10% minority stake in the New York Giants for over $1 billion, valuing the NFL franchise at a record $10 billion. This landmark deal, awaiting league approval, marks the highest valuation ever for a sports team and will slightly reduce the Mara and Tisch families' holdings. The transaction further expands the Koch family's investment in New York sports, following their acquisition of a 15% stake in BSE Global last year. The Giants, four-time Super Bowl champions, are now ranked among the NFL's most valuable teams. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a military parade in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin were reportedly overheard discussing the possibility of achieving immortality and extended lifespans through repeated organ transplants and biotechnology. While their exchange seemed lighthearted, the BBC article delves into the scientific reality, noting that organ transplants significantly save lives and advancements are extending their functional duration. However, experts emphasize the substantial risks of multiple surgeries, lifelong immunosuppressants, and the body's diminishing resilience with age, suggesting that current research aims to treat illness rather than achieve indefinite life extension. The discussion highlights ongoing efforts in xenotransplantation and growing organs from stem cells, but scientists caution against the notion of living to 150 years through such means. </p>

          <p>WNBA star Angel Reese issued an apology to her Chicago Sky teammates after publicly expressing frustrations with the team's performance and suggesting she might seek a move if the outlook doesn't improve. Reese, who leads the league in rebounds, stated a non-negotiable need for "good players" and "great players" to compete for championships, also singling out injured point guard Courtney Vandersloot. She later clarified that her language was taken out of context and stemmed from personal frustration, acknowledging the need to be more careful with her words. The controversy highlights the challenges of a losing season for the franchise. </p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, Catherine and William, made their first official public appearance since the summer, visiting the Natural History Museum gardens. As patron of the museum, Catherine joined William in exploring the gardens, which serve as both a recreational space and a living laboratory for research and teaching about urban wildlife. This engagement follows a challenging period for the royal couple, including the Princess's cancer diagnosis, and comes as their three children begin a new school term. The visit underscores their continued commitment to public duties and nature conservation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The peace sign, or V-sign, has become the dominant photo pose for Gen Z and Gen Alpha, surpassing older gestures like bunny ears. Originating as a World War II victory symbol and later adopted by Vietnam War protestors, its current widespread use is attributed to the influence of Japanese pop culture, particularly anime, where it signifies cuteness or celebration. For many children, the gesture has lost its specific historical meaning and is simply a default pose that provides something to do with their hands in an era of constant photography. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift where social media and kawaii aesthetics shape youth behavior. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration unlawfully froze over $2 billion in research funds for Harvard University, which the administration claimed was a response to antisemitism on campus.

Separately, a Senate committee is set to hold a confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee to the Federal Reserve's governing board, Stephen Miran, as Trump seeks to fill two seats and increase presidential control over the Fed's decision-making processes.

          <p>British luxury fashion house Burberry is slated to re-enter the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index later this month, marking its return after a year's absence. This upgrade reflects the early success of a sweeping overhaul strategy implemented by CEO Joshua Schulman, which has focused on embracing Burberry's iconic pieces and implementing cost-cutting measures. The company reported a better-than-expected 1% year-on-year decline in first-quarter sales, driven by an uptick in U.S. and European markets. Burberry's share price had previously fallen sharply, but its strategic changes are now showing positive results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. flight attendants are intensifying their push for paid boarding time, a long-standing demand, following a tentative deal between Air Canada and its cabin crews that includes ground pay. The Air Canada agreement, which resulted from a three-day strike, mandates at least 60 minutes of ground pay at 50% of the hourly rate, setting a new standard for the industry. While Delta, Alaska, and American Airlines have made similar concessions, many U.S. flight attendants still work unpaid during boarding and deplaning. Unions emphasize that flight attendants deserve compensation for all working hours, highlighting the financial struggles faced by many. </p>

It highlights the potential for age discrimination claims under federal law if the termination is linked to age or retirement. The piece also offers practical financial advice, including budgeting for healthcare expenses, exploring COBRA or private insurance options, and building an emergency fund of 12-18 months of expenses. Investing in stable assets like gold IRAs is suggested to shield retirement funds against economic uncertainties, emphasizing diversification rather than putting all savings into one type of asset.

          <p>Streameast, identified as the world's largest platform for illegal live sports streaming, has been shut down following a collaborative operation between the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) and Egyptian police. The site, which garnered over 1.6 billion visits in the past year, offered pirated access to major sports events like Premier League football and Formula One. Two individuals were arrested in Egypt on suspicion of copyright infringement, and authorities seized assets and uncovered links to a shell company allegedly used to launder millions in advertising revenue. While a significant victory against piracy, experts note that high legal streaming costs continue to fuel the demand for illegal alternatives. </p>
