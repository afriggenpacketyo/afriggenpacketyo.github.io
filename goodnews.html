          <p>An analysis of the Premier League's top teams suggests a competitive season ahead, as clubs like Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea have invested heavily in new talent to challenge reigning champions Liverpool. Liverpool themselves have spent a record £269 million to strengthen their squad under new manager Arne Slot. Arsenal has focused on adding firepower with striker Viktor Gyokeres, while Manchester City has refreshed its midfield and Chelsea has added depth to its young, expensive roster. The article assesses each team's transfer strategy and prospects for the upcoming title race.</p>

          <p>Shares of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group surged by 13%, marking their best single-day performance in five years and reaching a new record high. The spike followed the company's announcement of a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, far exceeding analyst expectations. This is the second consecutive profitable quarter for the group, driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, the largest since 2021. The positive results were attributed to strong performance from both private investments and listed portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy. (not investment advice)</p>

However, Cruz Azul fought back, benefiting from an own goal before Ignacio Rivero scored a late equalizer to force the shootout. The victory gave Cruz Azul an additional point, concluding their disappointing tournament run, which included a historic 7-0 loss to the Seattle Sounders.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton captured the biggest title of his career, winning the Canadian Open by defeating Russia's Karen Khachanov in a tight three-set final. The 22-year-old rallied after losing the first set in a tiebreak to win 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-6(3). This victory makes Shelton the youngest American man to win a Masters 1000 tournament since Andy Roddick in 2004.

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued another nationwide injunction blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and temporary residents. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. The judge certified the lawsuit as a class action, a legal pathway left open by the high court. The ruling states that the plaintiffs are highly likely to succeed in their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to nearly all individuals born in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm in her lawsuit over being fired from the Star Wars series 'The Mandalorian' in 2021. Carano was dismissed after making social media posts that compared being a Republican in the U.S. to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. Her lawsuit, which was funded by Elon Musk, alleged wrongful termination and discrimination. While the terms of the settlement were not disclosed, Carano expressed hope for healing, and a Lucasfilm statement noted she was always respected by colleagues and that they look forward to future work opportunities.</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom for the first time, according to the charity Butterfly Conservation. A volunteer photographed the female butterfly at a nature reserve in Suffolk, confirming its identity with experts. The species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe in recent decades, a movement believed to be at least partly driven by a warming climate. While a significant ecological event, it is not yet known if the butterfly will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning the Amadea, a $300 million superyacht seized from a sanctioned Russian oligarch. The 348-foot vessel, currently docked in San Diego, features a helideck, a mosaic pool, a glass elevator, and a marble fireplace. The U.S. Justice Department maintains the yacht was owned by Suleiman Kerimov, who was sanctioned for money laundering and his ties to Vladimir Putin. The sealed-bid auction requires a $10 million deposit and is part of a broader U.S. strategy to pressure Russian elites in response to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and embracing in-person singles events to find partners. Companies like Date Cincy in Cincinnati are capitalizing on this trend, hosting events for those fatigued by online swiping and seeking genuine face-to-face connections. This shift is reflected in market trends, with Bumble's stock value plummeting and attendance at singles events rising significantly. Participants and organizers say these events offer a more authentic way to gauge chemistry and avoid the misrepresentation common on digital platforms.</p>
