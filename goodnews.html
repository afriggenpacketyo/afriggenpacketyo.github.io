          <p>President Trump has reportedly canceled plans to deploy federal agents for a large-scale immigration operation in San Francisco following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie. The mayor argued that a militarized presence would hinder the city's economic recovery and public safety efforts. The decision came after local and state officials, including California's governor, vowed strong legal challenges against any such deployment, de-escalating a potentially volatile confrontation between federal and local authorities.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Commerce Department official has refuted reports that the Trump administration is negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing companies in exchange for federal funding. The denial follows speculation involving firms like IonQ and Rigetti, and contrasts with the administration's recent moves to take stakes in other sectors deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors. The government maintains a close watch on quantum technology due to its significant military and encryption-related implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate has unanimously passed legislation aimed at making IRS notices for simple tax return mistakes easier for taxpayers to understand and address. The IRS MATH Act, which now heads to the president, requires the agency to provide clearer explanations for proposed tax adjustments and the consequences of not responding. The move comes as advocates express concern over the clarity of current notices, which can be confusing for filers facing a 60-day response deadline.</p>

          <p>Traditionally known as a discount carrier, Southwest Airlines is making significant changes to appeal to premium travelers and enhance its competitiveness. The airline is ending its long-standing open seating policy in favor of assigned seats, introducing a new cabin design with extra legroom options, and upgrading its Wi-Fi and overhead bin space. These moves, along with the recent introduction of fees for checked bags, signal a strategic shift away from its purely budget-focused business model.</p>

          <p>Shares in the French luxury group Kering saw a significant increase after the company reported a narrower sales decline in its third quarter than in the previous period. The improvement was largely attributed to a "sharp sequential improvement" at its flagship brand, Gucci, where sales fell 14% compared to a 25% plunge in the second quarter. The results suggest that the current CEO's turnaround strategy for the fashion giant may be starting to gain traction with consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
