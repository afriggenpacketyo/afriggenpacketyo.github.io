          <h2>New Apple TV Show Depicts the Misery of the Ultra-Rich</h2>

          <p>Ross Douthat's New York Times article examines the Apple TV show "Your Friends & Neighbors," which portrays the lives of wealthy Connecticut residents as unhappy and financially insecure. The article contrasts this portrayal with more aspirational depictions of wealth in shows like "Selling Sunset," suggesting that the new show offers a reassuring perspective for those experiencing meritocratic status anxiety. The author questions whether the show's bleak depiction of the rich is accurate, noting that cultural trends have stripped away some of the glamour and aesthetic distinction that once characterized upper-class lifestyles.</p>

          <p>The BBC reports that US and Chinese officials are set to start talks this week to try and deescalate a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks in Switzerland, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer will attend the talks, their offices announced. Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods of up to 145%, and Beijing has hit back with levies on some goods from the US of 125%.</p>
