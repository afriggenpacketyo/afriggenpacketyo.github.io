          <p>The UK government and OpenAI have signed an agreement to explore using artificial intelligence in public services like education and defense to boost national productivity. The deal, a non-binding statement of intent, includes plans for an information sharing program, developing public safeguards, and expanding OpenAI's London office. This move is part of the government's broader strategy to leverage AI for economic growth, though it has drawn criticism from groups concerned about the unlicensed use of data and the focus on major US tech firms.</p>

          <p>The National Museum of Ireland is exhibiting ancient manuscripts from Switzerland's Abbey Library of St. Gall, featuring remarkable doodles and notes from 9th-century Irish monks. These scribbles in the margins, written in Old Irish, offer a rare and humorous glimpse into monastic life, with complaints about hangovers, cold weather, and poor-quality ink. The doodles, found in a grammar book, reveal the personal frustrations and resilience of the monks, providing a uniquely humanizing perspective on early medieval history and culture.</p>

The child was bitten by the cougar on a popular trail and was subsequently airlifted to a trauma center, where they were reported to be in satisfactory condition and have since been released. Park rangers located and killed the animal, which was fitted with a tracking collar, and stated there is no current threat to the public following the terrifying incident.</p>

          <p>In a thoughtful commentary, Slovenian author Ana Schnabl reflects on the narrow expectations Western publishers often have for writers from the Balkans. She argues that authors from the region are frequently pushed to produce stories centered on war, political tragedy, and cultural trauma to appeal to English-speaking audiences. This demand, she contends, overlooks a diverse range of contemporary stories and reinforces a one-dimensional, exoticized view of the Balkans, limiting the scope of literature that gets translated and published globally.</p>

Cabinet Office Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds stated the goal is to restore trust among the thousands of people given contaminated blood products by the NHS in the 1970s-90s. Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a victim's estate if they die before a deadline, with the adjustments expected to cost an additional £1 billion.</p>
