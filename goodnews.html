          <p>Economists in China are currently debating the merits of establishing official, measurable consumption targets in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents, like Chang Xiuze from the Academy of Macroeconomic Research, argue for including metrics such as the household consumption rate as a key national indicator to boost domestic demand. They point to China's relatively low rate of 39.6% in 2023 as a cause for concern. However, other influential thinkers argue that such specific benchmarks are not operationally feasible to implement as concrete policy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster mitigation funds, siding with 20 states that sued over the matter. The states argued that the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program was unlawfully terminated and its funds redirected without congressional authority. U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns ruled the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas and that he was not convinced Congress intended for the money to be repurposed. The injunction prevents the funds from being moved while the court considers the case.</p>

          <p>Ten years after their debut appearance, K-pop group Monsta X returned to the KCON festival in Los Angeles as headliners, reflecting on their endurance in the industry. The group's performance marked their first U.S. appearance after a two-year hiatus for mandatory military service, a milestone that often breaks up other groups. Now in their early 30s, the members discussed their focus on health and their excitement to reconnect with American fans, who have followed them since their rookie days. Their return signifies a new era for the group, which is preparing to release a new album next month.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime, including a significant 14.9% decrease in murder and nonnegligent manslaughter. Property crimes also fell by 8.1%, with motor vehicle thefts experiencing a record 18.6% one-year drop. While sexual assault and aggravated assault rates also declined, experts note that aggravated assaults remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, despite the overall positive trend.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to maintain indoor temperatures at or below 82 degrees in their rental units. The ordinance, which aims to protect tenants from the dangers of extreme heat, will take effect next month but will not be enforced until January 2027 to allow time for compliance. Officials are encouraging landlords to use passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains, in addition to air conditioning.

          <p>In a major media deal, the NFL has acquired a 10% ownership stake in Disney's ESPN, which in return will take over the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and RedZone channel. The arrangement solidifies the relationship between the sports media giant and the country's most popular league ahead of ESPN's launch of a direct-to-consumer streaming service. This new service will now feature the NFL Network, expanding its reach as cable subscriptions decline. The deal gives ESPN more live games and strengthens its position as the premier destination for football content.</p>

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is returning to the Los Angeles Chargers, agreeing to a one-year deal worth $8.52 million. Allen, the franchise's second all-time leading receiver, was traded to the Chicago Bears last season in a salary-cap move but was not re-signed. The six-time Pro Bowl selection rejoins the team following the recent retirement of receiver Mike Williams, bolstering a young pass-catching corps. At 33, Allen will provide experience and a reliable target for quarterback Justin Herbert, with whom he had significant success in previous seasons.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is scheduled to start the team's first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. The decision comes as other quarterbacks on the roster, Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, are dealing with hamstring injuries, and veteran Joe Flacco is not expected to play much. Sanders, a fifth-round draft pick from Colorado, was surprisingly listed as QB4 on the initial depth chart. This start provides a significant opportunity for him to compete for a roster spot after a prolific college career playing for his father, Deion Sanders.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a landmark $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliates, Chemours and Corteva, over pollution from "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other contaminants. State officials called it the largest environmental settlement ever achieved by a single state. The agreement resolves claims tied to decades of pollution from four industrial sites and requires the companies to pay for natural resource damages and fund extensive cleanup efforts. A separate $475 million reserve fund will be established to protect taxpayers if the companies fail to meet their obligations.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has launched a new program called "Families on the Fly" to ease the stress of airport security for parents traveling with children. The program features dedicated family-friendly security lanes, which are now available at select airports, including John Wayne Airport in Orange County. These lanes, which do not require TSA PreCheck, often have shorter lines and allow families to proceed without feeling rushed. The initiative aims to enhance the airport experience for families, particularly in popular tourist destinations like Southern California.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has released two new open-weight language models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, marking its first such release since 2019. These models are designed to be lower-cost alternatives that developers and researchers can run and customize more easily, competing with similar offerings from Meta, Mistral, and DeepSeek. Unlike fully open-source models, open-weight means the model's parameters are public, offering transparency and control. OpenAI stated it conducted extensive safety testing and collaborated with chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD to ensure broad hardware compatibility for the new models.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park indicates that social relationships between female mountain gorillas are more crucial than previously thought. A 20-year study of their behavior found that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she actively seeks out and joins other females she already knows, even if they have been separated for years. This behavior highlights the importance of these same-sex bonds, as having an ally helps a new arrival navigate the social hierarchy and potential aggression from resident females. The findings provide new insights into the evolutionary roots of social movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complexities of modern weather forecasting and why public perception of its accuracy sometimes lags behind scientific reality. While a one-day forecast is now correct over 90% of the time, challenges remain due to Chaos Theory, where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. Communicating vast amounts of data in a simple format also creates difficulties. The future of forecasting lies in AI, which can process historical data to make predictions faster and more granularly, though experts note it may struggle with predicting unprecedented climate events.</p>
