          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as a violent civil war, a perspective he believes is often overlooked due to a sanitized, romanticized view of history. He argues that the nation's founding ideals emerged from immense turmoil and division, making them even more inspiring. Burns emphasizes that understanding the founders' flaws and the era's conflicts provides a more authentic and powerful connection to the past. He suggests this complex history offers lessons for navigating contemporary political polarization by reminding Americans of their shared capacity to overcome deep divisions.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Bogota have arrested Elder José Arteaga Hernández, the alleged mastermind behind the June 7th shooting of Colombian senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay. The attack, which occurred in broad daylight at a park, left Uribe in intensive care and injured two others. Arteaga, who has a criminal history spanning over 20 years, faces charges including attempted aggravated homicide. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation, but the incident has been widely condemned as a threat to Colombia's democracy, evoking the country's dark history of political violence.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured pole position for the British Grand Prix in a tight qualifying session, narrowly beating out McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. Verstappen's final lap was just enough to edge Piastri by 0.103 seconds, with Norris a mere 0.015 seconds further back in third. The session at Silverstone was marked by tricky wind conditions, with Mercedes' George Russell and Lewis Hamilton finishing fourth and fifth, respectively. The results set the stage for a highly competitive race, with the top teams closely matched in performance.</p>

          <p>In a recent podcast interview, actress Charlize Theron shared her deliberate choice to be a single mother, a decision relationship experts support as a sign of strength and self-awareness. Theron explained that her own upbringing in a family affected by alcoholism and her tendency to lose herself in past relationships led her to realize she was not equipped to have children with a partner. Experts praise her decision as an act of alignment with her true self, noting that modern women with sufficient resources can choose single parenthood out of preference rather than necessity, breaking from historical norms.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal, the third named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season, is projected to make landfall in South Carolina on Sunday morning. The system is expected to bring widespread rainfall of 1-4 inches from Florida to the Delmarva Peninsula, with localized totals up to 8 inches near the landfall point. Coastal hazards, including rough surf, rip currents, and minor storm surge, are anticipated along the coasts of North and South Carolina. Wind gusts of 40-50 mph are possible, potentially causing tree damage and localized power outages in coastal areas.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are increasingly facing confusion and pressure to tip in situations where it was not previously expected, a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation." The proliferation of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options at coffee shops, fast-food counters, and even self-service kiosks has led to an explosion in tip requests. Marketing professors note that these systems are often designed to make tipping the default, putting social pressure on customers. This shift is changing long-standing norms and leaving many people unsure about the appropriate etiquette for showing gratuity in a rapidly evolving service economy.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally issued a "positive response" to the most recent ceasefire proposal mediated by the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, stating it is prepared to enter negotiations on implementation. The proposal reportedly includes a two-month truce, though Hamas is still seeking guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and a permanent end to the war. President Trump expressed optimism about the development, suggesting a deal could be reached within the next week. The news provides a potential breakthrough in the nearly 21-month conflict that has devastated Gaza and caused immense suffering.</p>

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming the alcohol-free drink can lower the body's primary stress hormone. The beverage typically combines ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical professionals are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients, either individually or combined, can significantly lower cortisol levels. While the drink is generally harmless and can aid hydration, doctors caution that it is not a substitute for proven stress-management techniques like quality sleep, exercise, and maintaining social connections.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai, a revolutionary Chinese typewriter invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been rediscovered and acquired by Stanford University. The machine is a crucial artifact in the history of computing, as it solved the immense challenge of typing a language with tens of thousands of characters instead of an alphabet. Its ingenious design, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean input methods. The discovery highlights a pivotal moment in preserving East Asian languages in the digital age.</p>

The swimming ban, in place since 1923 due to pollution, was officially lifted at designated, lifeguarded zones near the city center. On Saturday, residents eagerly took the plunge into water that now meets European quality standards on most days.

          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change negative public perceptions of the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team temporarily captures sharks to analyze their stomach contents, which provides vital data on the animals' health and the quality of their marine environment. The research aims to demonstrate that healthy shark populations are indicative of a healthy ocean. Despite public fascination, researchers note that securing financial support for shark conservation and study remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>An Arizona couple was fined $4,000 by their property management company after posting negative online reviews about their rental experience, which included black mold and unfinished repairs. A clause in their lease prohibited negative reviews, but such "gag clauses" are illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA). The law protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback without fear of retaliation or financial penalties. This case highlights a broader issue of companies attempting to unlawfully silence criticism, and it serves as a reminder for consumers to know their rights and report violations to agencies like the FTC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for living a more fulfilled life. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to anger or stress, involving hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued distress is a result of consciously or unconsciously rerunning the negative thought. By allowing oneself this brief window to feel upset and then choosing to refocus, individuals can prevent themselves from getting stuck in a cycle of rumination and more quickly recover from life's upsets.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the hobby-centric culture in Denmark, a business school professor undertook an experiment of trying 17 different hobbies in one year, from pottery to pickleball. She found that the experience fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely, and redefine self-care. The article argues that hobbies are a powerful tool for achieving work-life balance, as they force individuals to set boundaries and build identities outside of their professional and family obligations.
