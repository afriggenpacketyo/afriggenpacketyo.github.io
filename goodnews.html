          <p>Singapore's economy grew 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, accelerating from the previous quarter and significantly beating economists' expectations. This growth was primarily led by a strong expansion in the manufacturing sector. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution for the second half of the year, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies, ahead of a key monetary policy decision.

          <p>A notable trend is emerging in Chinese higher education, as students are increasingly selecting technology-focused majors such as information and communications technology and vehicle engineering. This shift is driven by the belief that these fields are central to future industrial development and is in line with China's state-driven push to advance its technological capabilities. This contrasts with previous decades when subjects like international trade and urban planning were the most sought-after fields of study.</p>

          <p>Prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground have reached their highest level in six years, with Transport for London (TfL) taking legal action against 3,691 people in 2024-25. This enforcement surge is part of a broader crackdown on fare dodging, which TfL states deprives the city's transport network of crucial investment. The figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, indicate a determined effort to reduce revenue loss across London's public transit system.</p>

This strategy is designed to accelerate the delivery of military aid by utilizing equipment already deployed in Europe, with allied nations subsequently backfilling their stocks by purchasing new replacements from the U.S. The meeting occurs as the administration faces bipartisan calls to enact stronger economic sanctions against Russia.</p>
