          <p>Former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn analyzed the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, noting that while it lowers the overnight bank lending rate, it doesn't directly reduce borrowing costs for consumers. Cohn explained that consumer loan rates are tied to open market conditions, which have not followed the Fed's move. He also highlighted the Fed's concern over a cooling labor market, stating that companies are reducing labor costs to maintain profit margins amid rising input costs. (not investment advice)</p>

He pointed to the controversial decision for U.S. players to receive a $500,000 payment for participating, a first for the event, while European players continue to compete for free. Donald theorized that if the highly-paid U.S. team underperforms, the New York audience, having paid high ticket prices, might express their displeasure. He affirmed that his team remains motivated by purpose rather than monetary reward.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch, and likely his father Rupert Murdoch, will be part of the group involved in a deal to save TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants in the investment group. He described the potential investors as "American patriots" who would do a good job with the social media platform. The specific details of the deal are reportedly still being finalized between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially announced their recognition of a Palestinian state. The leaders of the three nations framed the decision as an effort to revive hope for a two-state solution and build momentum for peace. The announcement, largely symbolic but historically significant, drew strong condemnation from Israel, which vowed to fight what it called an "absurd reward for terrorism."

          <p>For the first time in almost 100 years, hundreds of swimmers participated in an organized event in the Chicago River, a waterway once infamous for its severe pollution. The mile-long swim marks a significant milestone in the river's transformation, made possible by decades of environmental cleanup efforts following the 1972 Clean Water Act. The event highlights a major shift in public perception, as the river has evolved from an industrial sewer to a recreational hub. Organizers hope the swim will become an annual tradition and inspire similar events in other U.S. cities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to wellness expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress speeds up this decline, which can lead to various health issues. However, Epel notes that this damage can be mitigated through daily restoration practices. She recommends creating an anti-inflammatory lifestyle by eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, prioritizing deep rest, and incorporating more Omega-3s into one's diet.</p>

This process, known as Teshuvah or "return," is about returning to one's better self.

          <p>According to a child development researcher, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Other key behaviors involve teaching conflict resolution, validating a child's feelings, and helping them recognize social cues. The article emphasizes that these skills are built through connection and emotional safety at home, rather than by memorizing polite phrases.</p>

          <p>According to Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy, consumers often make key mistakes when choosing and using rewards credit cards, such as opting for no-annual-fee cards that offer poor rewards. He argues that even a modest annual fee is typically worthwhile for the superior perks and earning potential. Another common error is hoarding points, which can be devalued by program changes at any time. Kelly also advises cardholders who are unhappy with an annual fee to call their provider's retention department to negotiate for discounts or bonus points before downgrading or canceling.

          <p>Researchers have discovered that two 7,000-year-old mummies from the Takarkori rock shelter in Libya belong to a previously unknown human lineage. DNA analysis of the female herders, who lived when the Sahara was a lush savanna, revealed an ancestry distinct from expected Sub-Saharan populations. Their genes indicate they were part of an isolated North African group that diverged from other African lineages much earlier. The finding suggests that pastoralism may have spread through the region via cultural exchange rather than large-scale migration and genetic mixing.</p>
