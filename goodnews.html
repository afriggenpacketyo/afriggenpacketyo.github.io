          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 07:44:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage application volume experienced a notable increase last week, reaching its highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index, with an additional adjustment made for the Memorial Day holiday. Despite this surge, overall volume remains low from a historical perspective. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages saw a slight increase, while refinance applications rose significantly compared to the previous year, and applications for home purchases also increased, driven by loosening housing inventory in certain markets. While economic uncertainty persists, homebuyers appear to be capitalizing on the increased availability of listings and slightly easing home prices. Optimism is tempered by the potential impact of upcoming inflation data and ongoing trade talks with China on bond markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have prohibited teaching antisemitism in public schools, citing concerns that it would unfairly target educators and expose them to costly lawsuits. Hobbs argued that the bill was not genuinely about combating antisemitism but rather about attacking teachers, placing an unacceptable level of personal liability on them. The bill would have allowed students and parents to file lawsuits over violations creating a hostile environment, with teachers responsible for covering any damages. Opponents of the bill claimed it would silence discussions on the oppression of Palestinians and hinder educators from providing a comprehensive account of the Holocaust. </p>

Expenses can fluctuate significantly year to year, as seen in St. Louis, where child-rearing costs have increased by over 20% in the last year.

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a strong rebound in 2025, with registrations surging by 20% from January to April, driven primarily by corporate sales and EU mandates to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions.

The transition is uneven across Europe, with some countries lagging behind, and public enthusiasm for EVs is not growing as quickly as policymakers would like, with charging infrastructure remaining a critical barrier.

          <p>David Lammy, along with Europe Minister Stephen Doughty, met with Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo and his cabinet to discuss a potential post-Brexit deal for the territory.

The current Labour and previous Conservative governments have affirmed that they will not agree to a deal with the EU without Gibraltar's agreement. </p>
