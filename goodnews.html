        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports to encourage long-term strategic focus. In a post on Truth Social, he argued the change, which would require SEC approval, would save money and allow managers to better run their companies, contrasting it with what he described as China's long-term business perspective. This idea echoes a 2018 proposal by Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who argued against quarterly guidance for similar reasons. Supporters of the current system, however, emphasize the importance of transparency and timely information for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Career coaches are advising job seekers to avoid over-relying on artificial intelligence for crafting resumes and applications, as it can lead to significant errors and a lack of authenticity. Experts note that AI tools can fabricate information, or "hallucinate," to match a resume to a job description, creating inaccuracies that candidates may struggle to defend in interviews. Recruiters also report that AI-generated applications often share a uniform, keyword-stuffed structure, making them less effective than those written in a candidate's own voice. The advice is to use AI for polishing a self-written draft rather than for initial generation to avoid critical mistakes.</p>

          <p>Amid high interest rates and limited housing inventory, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance face a difficult market. As of September 11, 2025, national average rates for a 30-year mortgage stand at 6.53%, while a 30-year refinance rate is slightly higher at 6.72%, according to Bankrate data. Experts suggest that strengthening one's credit profile into the mid-to-high 700s is crucial for securing the best possible rates. While the market remains challenging, a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could offer some relief to borrowers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) offer more affordable borrowing options compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of mid-September 2025, the average interest rate for a 10-year home equity loan is 8.38%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.10%. These rates, which are influenced by factors like location and credit score, are considerably lower than other consumer credit products. Experts note that these financing tools may also provide tax benefits if the funds are used for eligible home improvements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold, a key safe-haven asset, stood at $3,651.88 per ounce as of September 12, 2025. Its value is subject to constant fluctuation based on a variety of global factors, including fundamental supply and demand dynamics. Economic conditions play a significant role; during periods of uncertainty or recession, investors often turn to gold, driving its price up. Other major influences include inflation rates, as gold is seen as a hedge against eroding currency value, geopolitical instability, central bank policies, and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City secured a decisive 3-0 victory over Manchester United by tactically exploiting weaknesses in United's defensive system. City focused its attack down the left flank, using wide positioning from its left-back to draw United's wing-back out and create an overload in the midfield. This strategy, combined with clever player movement and pinning tactics, left United's defenders in disarray and repeatedly gave City's attackers space to operate. The article suggests that while individual mistakes were a factor, the loss highlighted systemic issues in United's disjointed pressing scheme, which manager Ruben Amorim has so far been reluctant to change.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price saw a significant jump after CEO Elon Musk revealed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since 2020. Musk acquired 2.57 million shares for approximately $1 billion, a move widely interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer. This purchase is his largest ever by value and comes as Tesla's stock has faced pressure from slumping sales and increased competition. The acquisition is seen by analysts as Musk doubling down on his vision for Tesla's future in artificial intelligence and robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Africa is becoming a pivotal producer of critical minerals like cobalt, platinum, and manganese, which are essential for green energy and technology. This boom could boost the continent's GDP by 12% over the next 25 years, but significant challenges remain. Issues such as government fragility, environmental degradation from mining, and inequitable revenue sharing hinder progress. A UN report estimates that African nations currently generate only about 40% of the potential revenue from their mineral wealth. To fully capitalize on these resources, countries must move beyond raw material extraction and develop domestic refining capabilities to capture more value.</p>
