          <p>Oracle's stock experienced its best single-day performance since 1992, increasing by nearly 36% after the company reported an unprecedented demand for its cloud services, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. The company announced it has $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a figure that far exceeded analyst expectations and added approximately $244 billion to its market capitalization. This surge overshadowed a mixed quarterly earnings report, signaling strong investor confidence in Oracle's strategic position as a key AI infrastructure provider. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former football star and presenter Gary Lineker won the Best TV Presenter award at the National Television Awards, ending the 23-year winning streak of duo Ant and Dec. The victory, determined by public vote, comes after Lineker's departure from the BBC's "Match of the Day" and the corporation itself following controversies over his social media use. In his acceptance speech, Lineker emphasized the importance of using one's platform to advocate for the voiceless. The awards ceremony also saw popular reality show "The Traitors" lose to "I'm a Celebrity" in its category.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that its Perseverance rover collected a rock sample from Mars's Jezero Crater that contains potential biosignatures, suggesting the possibility of ancient microbial life. The sample, named Sapphire Canyon, exhibits mineral patterns and textures that on Earth are often byproducts of biological processes. While scientists caution that nonbiological explanations cannot yet be ruled out, this finding is considered the closest the agency has come to discovering evidence of past life on the planet. The discovery underscores the importance of the Mars Sample Return mission, which faces funding challenges.</p>

The company, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, raised $1.37 billion, valuing it at approximately $17.3 billion. The successful listing indicates strong investor appetite for tech offerings and will test Wall Street's confidence in Klarna's expansion into banking services, including a new debit card in the U.S. The IPO also generated significant returns for early investors like Sequoia Capital.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a candidate for New York City mayor, has launched a petition opposing FIFA's use of dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, arguing it prioritizes profit over fans. Mamdani contends that the pricing model will make tickets unaffordable for many, harming the atmosphere of the games, which are to be held in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. His petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing, a cap on resale prices, and an allocation of 15% of tickets for local residents. This stance aligns with his broader political platform, which emphasizes affordability and accessibility for working-class citizens.</p>

          <p>A weekend-long bus strike that was expected to disrupt dozens of routes in London has been largely called off after the Unite union accepted a new pay offer. The industrial action involved drivers and other staff from bus companies London United and London Transit in a dispute over pay and conditions. While London United employees have canceled their walkout, negotiations are still ongoing with London Transit. If an agreement is not reached, a smaller-scale strike affecting a handful of routes in the city may still proceed, continuing a week of transport disruptions in the capital.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary, actor Charlie Sheen revealed that a phone call from Clint Eastwood was the final push that convinced him to enter rehab in the early 1990s. Sheen described being surprised by a family-led intervention, organized by his father Martin Sheen, which he initially planned to resist. However, his father handed him the phone to speak with Eastwood, who urged him to get his life "back on the tracks," calling him "worth saving." The powerful moment led Sheen to agree to treatment, marking a pivotal point in his long and public struggle with substance abuse.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the mortgage rate climate cools, prospective homebuyers may be able to secure a rate below 6% through several strategic approaches. One option is to consider an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which currently offers average rates just under this threshold for the initial fixed period. Additionally, diligently shopping around and comparing offers from multiple lenders can often yield a rate significantly lower than the national average. Finally, strategically timing the market around Federal Reserve announcements could present brief windows of opportunity for lower rates, though this requires agility and preparedness.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated in September, savers should consider the differing impacts on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. CDs are better positioned to weather rate cuts for those who act now, as they allow savers to lock in a fixed interest rate for a specific term, protecting their returns from subsequent declines. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that will likely fall following a Fed cut. The best choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus the desire for a guaranteed, predictable return on their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council indicates that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number associated with Brazilian exports to China. The report highlights the profound and growing economic interdependence between the two nations, with bilateral commerce increasing nearly fivefold in two decades. While exports of commodities like soybeans and iron ore generate a significant trade surplus for Brazil, the reliance on a few products and a single major partner exposes the country to economic risks. The findings show that imports have a broader impact on employment across various sectors.</p>

          <p>Despite September 10 marking the historical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, storm activity has been notably subdued this year.

The current "ENSO Neutral" climate pattern, where neither El Niño nor La Niña is dominant, also contributes to the atypical conditions.
