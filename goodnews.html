          <p>This article explores the significant decrease in sexual desire that many couples experience after having a baby, a topic highlighted by reality star Holly Hagan-Blyth's personal account. It delves into the physical and hormonal reasons for this change in women, such as healing from birth and drastic drops in estrogen levels, which can make intimacy painful or undesirable. The piece also addresses how new fathers can be affected, citing potential psychological shifts and the importance of open communication between partners to navigate this challenging period without pressure. Experts recommend professional support if the issue causes major relationship conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the rising trend of single men feeling unhappy and lonely, contrasting with single women who report higher life satisfaction. It suggests that societal norms of masculinity discourage men from building deep platonic friendships, leading them to place their entire emotional support system on a single romantic partner. This emotional dependency makes being single particularly difficult, while a lack of practice with emotional vulnerability can also hinder dating success. The piece discusses how some men turn to misogynistic online communities out of frustration, and concludes that developing broader social connections is key to their well-being.</p>

          <p>US Air Force Chief of Staff General David Allvin has announced that Boeing has begun manufacturing the F-47, the nation's new sixth-generation fighter jet. This advanced aircraft is part of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, designed to replace the F-22 and ensure future air superiority. The announcement confirms President Trump's earlier statement about the program, which involved secret testing of experimental X-planes over the past five years. The Air Force is aiming for an ambitious timeline, with a goal to have the first F-47 flying by 2028, underscoring a sense of urgency in military modernization.</p>

          <p>An archaeological mission searching for the lost tomb of Queen Cleopatra has discovered an ancient submerged port linked to the Taposiris Magna Temple, about 30 miles west of Alexandria, Egypt. Using advanced sonar technology, the team mapped the seabed and found evidence of a harbor and an underwater extension of a tunnel from the temple. The lead archaeologist, Dr. Kathleen Martinez, believes this site, not the traditional location in Alexandria, was Cleopatra's final resting place, chosen to outsmart the Romans. This discovery adds a new chapter to the history of the site and fuels hope for eventually locating the famous queen's tomb.</p>

          <h2>An exploration of the trend of "uniquely spelled" baby names and the intense online backlash they receive</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the cultural phenomenon of "tragedeighs"—common names given alternative spellings like "Oaklynn" or "Sadilynn"—and the vitriolic criticism they attract online. It explores the motivations behind the trend, including a desire for individuality and the feminization of masculine-sounding names. The backlash is analyzed as being rooted in classism, a preference for the familiar, and a "quiet luxury" aesthetic that values tradition over novelty. Despite the online mockery, the article notes that these names are not as widespread as the outrage suggests and are part of a larger trend of parents seeking more diverse name options.</p>

          <h2>Scientists and startups are developing "phytomining," a method of using plants to harvest metals like nickel from the soil</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A novel process called phytomining uses hyperaccumulating plants, such as certain mustard species, to extract valuable metals directly from the ground. These plants naturally absorb and store high concentrations of metals like nickel in their tissues, which can then be harvested, burned into a "bio-ore," and processed into market-ready products like nickel sulfate for batteries. Proponents highlight its low environmental impact compared to conventional mining, as it is nearly carbon-neutral and can remediate contaminated land. While it cannot replace large-scale industrial mining, phytomining offers a sustainable alternative for smaller communities on metal-rich, non-arable land.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has intensified into a major Category 4 storm, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season with sustained winds of 140 mph. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the powerful storm will continue moving northeast, further out into the Atlantic, and is not expected to make landfall. However, Gabrielle is generating significant ocean swells that will create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coasts of Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina northward. The season has so far been quieter than initially predicted by forecasters.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's decision to raise the H-1B visa application fee to $100,000, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman offered positive reactions. Huang stated that immigration is the "foundation of the American Dream" and that he was glad to see the president making moves, while Altman commented that streamlining the process and outlining financial incentives "seems good." Their comments stand in contrast to widespread concern from the broader tech industry, particularly startups, who fear the high cost will prevent them from hiring essential foreign talent. The H-1B program is a critical source of skilled workers for the U.S. tech sector.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has upgraded its global growth forecast for the current year to 3.2%, up from a previous estimate of 2.9%. This revision is attributed to stronger-than-expected economic performance, particularly in emerging markets, boosted by strong AI-related investment in the U.S. and fiscal support in China. However, the organization warns that significant risks remain, including high tariffs, policy uncertainty, and the potential for inflation to return. The U.S. growth forecast was also lifted to 1.8% for 2025, though this is a slowdown from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

Programs like the Lviv Habilitation Center offer veterans a place to recover, learn new life skills, and connect with peers after their hospital rehabilitation ends. Another approach focuses on training community leaders and social workers to better understand the challenges veterans face, aiming to bridge the gap between military and civilian experiences. These initiatives recognize that reintegration is a societal challenge, requiring a community-wide effort to support those who have served in the war.</p>

          <p>This article provides a scientific perspective on the claim linking Tylenol (acetaminophen/paracetamol) to autism, concluding that the assertion is not supported by robust evidence. Experts state that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with strong polygenetic roots, meaning hundreds of gene variants contribute to risk, not a single medication. While some studies have shown a weak association, large-scale research, including a 2024 study of 2.4 million births, found no causal relationship. The rising diagnosis rates are largely attributed to increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria, not a single environmental factor.</p>

The deal is set to eliminate most tariffs on EU exports like car parts and pharmaceuticals, while also opening up investment opportunities in key sectors such as electric vehicles. For Indonesia, about 80% of its exports to the EU will become tariff-free. The process was reportedly accelerated by the "global tariff war" initiated by U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, pushing both sides to conclude the negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>
