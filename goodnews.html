          <p>Voting is currently underway in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, which is seen as a bellwether for the upcoming House of Councillors race, as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba navigates a minority government. With no single party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the Liberal Democratic Party aims to retain its seats amidst dipping approval ratings. Major parties are actively using social media and street speeches to appeal to voters on key issues such as inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies. Voter turnout as of 3 p.m. was estimated at 18.60 percent, slightly up from the previous election. The optimism score for this article is 55.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband, Bob, was overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original investigation. Despite maintaining her innocence and arguing that authorities focused solely on her, Dorotik's initial appeals were denied. The San Diego County District Attorney's Office eventually recommended overturning the conviction due to the new evidence, and in May 2022, prosecutors dropped the charges, citing insufficient evidence.

          <p>Chinese scientists are investigating the potential of the spleen as a hub for treating diabetes through cell transplantation. Research indicates that "shielding" islet cells can improve their survival after transplantation into the spleen, offering a more promising long-term survival site than the liver. The scientists also found that the spleen could be engineered into a transplant hub using nanoparticles. These advancements could transform the spleen into an ideal organ for islet transplantation, potentially benefiting the over 140 million adults with diabetes in China.

          <p>Chinese researchers have created a two-kilowatt fibre laser capable of operating without heating or cooling systems in extreme climates, from the Arctic to the Sahara Desert. The device is designed for quick and ultra-portable deployment for defence and industrial purposes. The innovation stabilizes laser performance across 100-degree temperature swings through design choices such as 940-nanometre pump lasers and heat-sensitive component isolation. The laser's core features a dual-clad optical resonator amplifying photons into a lethal 1,080nm beam. The optimism score for this article is 55.</p>

They attribute these issues to a lack of regulations and insufficient testing.
