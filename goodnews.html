          <p>Detroit Police Department's Missing Persons Unit, led by Sgt. Shannon Jones, has successfully identified 33 individuals in cold cases by exhuming unidentified remains and using DNA analysis. Jones's inspiration came from photographs of missing loved ones, leading her to believe that clues were buried underground. The operation, named UNITED (Unknown Names Identified Through Exhumation and DNA), involves collaboration with the FBI and the use of online DNA databases. The project has brought closure to families, such as Kristina Morris, whose father's remains were identified, leading to an active homicide investigation. The overall positive sentiment of the article as it relates to solving cold cases warrants a high optimism score.</p>

          <p>In Xian, China, the growing tourism industry, spurred by government promotions, has led to an increase in the popularity of traditional Chinese clothing (hanfu). This has created new job opportunities for stylists, make-up artists, and photographers catering to tourists who want to experience hanfu culture. The city saw approximately 306 million trips last year, generating a tourism income of 376 billion yuan, reflecting the sector's growth. The rise in tourism and related services could provide stable work for young people in China.

          <p>Singer Nezza's performance of the Spanish version of "The Star-Spangled Banner," known as "El Pend√≥n Estrellado," at Dodger Stadium has sparked conversations about the origins of the song and the legacy of Clotilde Arias. Arias, a Peruvian immigrant, was commissioned by the U.S. State Department in 1945 to create a Spanish version of the national anthem to strengthen ties with Latin American countries. Her translation was accepted as the only official version, but her contribution remained largely unknown until recently. Nezza's performance has highlighted Arias's role in American history and Latino culture. The overall positive sentiment of the article warrants a high optimism score.</p>

Despite a strong start, the Oilers are facing concerns that history could repeat itself. The repeated losses have united Canadians against a common enemy ‚Äì the US.
