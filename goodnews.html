          <p>Stocks of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks surged after announcing a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The merged entity, listed in Sydney, will acquire all outstanding shares of both companies, holding assets across real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company, unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers. Brickworks shareholders will receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium. The article details the strategic rationale and financial implications of the merger.</p>
