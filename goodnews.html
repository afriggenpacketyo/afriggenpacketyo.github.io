          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos described the current state of artificial intelligence as an "industrial bubble," acknowledging that investor excitement has led to both good and bad ideas receiving funding. Speaking at Italian Tech Week, he compared the situation to past bubbles, like the dot-com era, noting that while stock prices can become disconnected from fundamentals, the underlying technology is real and transformative. Bezos argued that such bubbles can ultimately be beneficial, as the innovations from winning companies will provide "gigantic" benefits to society, similar to how the 1990s biotech bubble produced life-saving drugs despite many company failures.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly mass shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, a fundraiser was established for the family of the accused shooter. The organizer, a fellow church member, cited religious teachings on caring for widows and the fatherless, noting the shooter's family are also victims of the tragedy and have a son with serious medical needs. The attack, which killed four and injured eight, was reportedly motivated by hatred for the Mormon faith, yet the fundraiser has garnered significant support from the community. As of Friday, it had raised over $334,000, demonstrating a remarkable display of forgiveness.</p>

          <p>San Francisco 49ers quarterback Mac Jones revealed the straightforward motivation behind his choice to wear suits to games, stating, "I wear suits because I’m going to work." After leading his team to a 26-23 overtime victory against the Los Angeles Rams, Jones addressed his gameday attire with a simple and professional outlook. Currently undefeated as the 49ers' starter while filling in for the injured Brock Purdy, Jones is thriving in his new role. His performance and professional attitude are providing stability for the team, which has been impacted by several key injuries early in the season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect their money's buying power, with top accounts currently providing returns that outpace inflation. This article explains the current landscape of CD rates, noting that online banks typically offer more competitive rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead costs. It also highlights the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs (around six months to one year) presently offer higher interest rates than long-term ones. Financial experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs to take advantage of these high short-term rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an overview of the current interest rates for mortgages and mortgage refinances, which remain elevated compared to previous years. As of early October 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.34%, while a 30-year refinance rate is slightly higher at 6.64%. To secure the best possible rate, prospective borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, as top rates are typically offered to those with scores in the mid-to-high 700s. The article also stresses the importance of shopping around and comparing offers from multiple lenders to find the most favorable terms and lowest overall cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chicago Fed President Goolsbee Expresses Caution on Cutting Interest Rates Prematurely</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 09:20:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee voiced concern about cutting interest rates too quickly, citing risks to both inflation and employment. In a CNBC interview, Goolsbee, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, noted that the central bank is in a "sticky spot" with recent inflation upticks and deteriorating job numbers. While the FOMC voted for a rate cut in September and signaled more could come, Goolsbee is wary of "front-loading" cuts and assuming inflation will simply disappear. Despite his caution, he believes the underlying economy can support a gradual reduction in rates over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) represent an affordable borrowing option compared to high-rate personal loans or credit cards. This article details the current national average interest rates, with a 10-year home equity loan at 8.34% and the average HELOC rate at 7.88% as of early October 2025. It explains the difference between the two products: home equity loans provide a lump sum at a fixed rate, while HELOCs offer a revolving line of credit with a variable rate. Both options use the home as collateral, requiring careful consideration before borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 09:09:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electronic shelf labels are increasingly replacing paper price tags in major grocery stores like Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods, allowing for rapid, centralized price updates. This technology enables retailers to change prices in minutes, which can improve efficiency and help move perishable items, potentially reducing food waste. However, some lawmakers and consumer advocates express concern that these digital tags could pave the way for "dynamic pricing," where costs for essential goods could surge based on demand, time of day, or other factors. While grocery chains deny any plans for surge pricing, the debate over the technology's potential impact on consumers is growing.</p>

          <p>England began their Women's World Cup campaign with a commanding 10-wicket victory after bowling South Africa out for a mere 69 runs in Guwahati. The English spinners dominated the match, with Linsey Smith taking three key wickets for just seven runs, dismantling South Africa's top order. In a dismal batting display, only one South African player reached double figures as the team was dismissed in just over 20 overs. England's openers, Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont, then comfortably chased the target, securing a crucial win that provides a significant net run-rate boost for the remainder of the tournament.</p>

          <p>This article explores the vibrant subculture of cumbia music in Monterrey, Mexico, a city that has become a second home for the Colombian genre. It focuses on the "sonideros," DJs who have been central to the scene since the 1960s, and the accidental creation of "cumbia rebajada," a slower-tempo style born from overheating equipment. The music fostered a unique "cholombiano" identity, blending cholo aesthetics with a deep reverence for Colombian artists. Despite a period of intense cartel violence that drove the parties indoors, cumbia has returned to the streets, remaining a vital part of the city's cultural identity.</p>

          <p>A significant breakthrough has been announced in the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders, where four teenage girls were killed. Law enforcement officials revealed that new DNA and ballistics technology has identified Robert Eugene Brashers, a deceased serial killer, as the likely sole perpetrator. The case, which had remained cold for nearly 34 years, was cracked after investigators re-examined a shell casing and a fragmented DNA profile, linking them to other unsolved crimes committed by Brashers. This development brings long-awaited answers to the victims' families and is expected to fully exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted for the crime years ago.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is under intense pressure from both industry groups and public health advocates as he considers signing a bill to ban the sale of cookware containing PFAS, known as "forever chemicals." The legislation is opposed by the cookware industry and some celebrity chefs, who argue that nonstick pans are essential and that the industry is being unfairly targeted. Proponents, including environmental groups and actor Mark Ruffalo, argue the ban is a necessary step to reduce exposure to the toxic compounds, which are linked to serious health problems. The decision is being closely watched as it could influence similar legislation in other states.</p>

While property tech as a whole is seeing a rebound with new unicorns and successful IPOs, investment in decarbonization and sustainability tech for real estate has been hampered by a negative political shift away from ESG initiatives. Wallace notes that while national policy may be unfavorable, local governments are still pushing for decarbonization, often through carbon taxes.
