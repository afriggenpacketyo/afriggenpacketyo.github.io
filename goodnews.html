          <p>Shares of clean energy companies, including NextEra Energy and AES, experienced a significant jump after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of a major Republican policy bill. The tax, which targeted projects using components from foreign entities like China, would have added a substantial financial burden to the industry. While the removal was a relief for investors, industry groups like the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) remain critical. They caution that the overall bill is still harmful to the renewable energy sector because it phases out crucial investment tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper secured his spot in the next round of Wimbledon with a commanding performance against Sebastian Baez. Draper, the fourth seed, was leading 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 when the Argentine player was forced to retire due to an injury sustained from a slip on the court. The match, played on Court One, lasted just one hour and 14 minutes. As the British number one, Draper carries the nation's hopes in the tournament, especially in the first championship since Andy Murray's retirement, and will next face former runner-up Marin Cilic.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare announced it will begin blocking AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a move that could significantly impact how AI models are trained. The new policy requires website owners to explicitly opt-in to allow AI bots to access their content, aiming to restore control and potential revenue to creators. Cloudflare is also introducing a "pay per crawl" model, allowing publishers to charge AI companies for data access. This addresses growing concerns that AI firms are profiting from online content without compensating the original sources.</p>

The record-breaking serve, which surpassed the previous best by 5mph, was ironically returned by Fritz, who won the point.

          <p>The Republican "big beautiful" bill passed by the Senate includes a new temporary tax deduction, or "senior bonus," aimed at providing relief for taxpayers aged 65 and over. The Senate's version proposes a deduction of up to $6,000, while the House version calls for $4,000, available from 2025 through 2028. This benefit would be fully available to single filers with incomes up to $75,000 and joint filers up to $150,000. While touted as a way to reduce taxes on Social Security, it does not eliminate the taxation of benefits, a different proposal prohibited under the legislative process used.

          <p>The spending package passed by the Senate includes a provision to permanently increase the child tax credit, a key difference from the temporary expansion proposed by the House.

In contrast, the House version offers a higher credit of $2,500 but only through 2028. Policy experts note that despite the increase, the credit's structure means that the lowest-income families may still not be able to access the full benefit due to refundability limits.

          <p>With average U.S. homeowners holding significant tappable equity, a new report suggests several smart ways to utilize these funds, focusing on a hypothetical $100,000. One primary recommendation is to consolidate and pay off high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, by leveraging lower-rate home equity loans. Other strategic uses include funding home renovations that boost resale value, investing in a diversified portfolio, or financing a small business venture. The article cautions that these are secured loans backed by one's property and should be used responsibly. (not investment advice)</p>

Judge Melissa DuBose found "no rational basis" for the administration's plan, stating HHS failed to prove that critical services would continue uninterrupted. The injunction halts the termination of some 10,000 employees and prevents the overhaul of agencies like the CDC.</p>
