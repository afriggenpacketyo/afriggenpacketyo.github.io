          <p>Prince Harry visited Angola to support the Halo Trust, a charity dedicated to clearing landmines, continuing the advocacy work of his mother, Princess Diana. He emphasized the ongoing threat that explosive remnants of war pose to civilians, particularly children. His visit follows his mother's iconic 1997 walk through an Angolan minefield, which brought global attention to the issue. The Halo Trust has cleared 120,000 landmines in the country, but an estimated thousand minefields remain from the nation's long civil war, continuing to cause death and injury.</p>

          <p>During Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to China, Beijing has focused on securing numerous trade and investment agreements while setting aside major political disagreements. The deals reportedly include expanded market access for Australian agricultural products and coal, financial sector cooperation, and potential tariff reductions. Notably, discussions have avoided the contentious issue of the Darwin Port, which Australia wants to reclaim from a Chinese company on security grounds. Analysts suggest this approach is an effort by China to find common ground with key partners amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <h2>Tsunami Advisory Canceled for Southern Alaska Following 7.3 Magnitude Earthquake</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 21:39:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula was canceled after a preliminary 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially triggered a stronger tsunami warning, prompting some coastal evacuations. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory, which cautions people to stay away from beaches and waterways but does not anticipate significant inundation. Officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration stated that because the earthquake occurred in shallow water, large and widespread waves were not expected. No major damage or injuries were reported.</p>

          <p>The Texas National Guard's response to devastating floods has been bolstered by the arrival of a specialized search and rescue team from the Czech Republic. The team, consisting of sixteen civilians and four cadaver dogs, is assisting in the search for approximately 100 people still missing in the Kerrville area. This international cooperation is part of the National Guard's State Partnership Program, which pairs states with foreign countries for joint training. The assistance follows a similar effort last year when a Texas Air National Guard drone helped with flood recovery in the Czech Republic.</p>

          <p>A new official photograph of Queen Camilla has been released to celebrate her 78th birthday. The picture, taken by photographer Chris Jackson, shows the Queen smiling in a field at her private home in Wiltshire. Unlike last year, when she attended the State Opening of Parliament on her birthday, she is expected to celebrate the occasion privately this year. The release follows a busy period of public engagements for the Queen and King Charles, including a state visit from the French President and a trip to Canada, as the King continues his treatment for cancer.</p>

          <h2>Tech Companies Explore Using Recycled Electric Vehicle Batteries to Power AI Data Centers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:47:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new initiative is exploring the use of recycled electric vehicle batteries to provide reliable power for the energy-intensive artificial intelligence industry. In Nevada, AI cloud platform Crusoe is using rows of used EV batteries, supplied by Redwood Materials, to power two of its data centers. As the AI boom strains electricity grids, this approach offers a renewable alternative to building new gas-fired power plants. The used batteries, which may have lost some capacity for vehicles but are still functional, are repurposed for large-scale energy storage, creating a sustainable solution for a growing power demand.</p>

          <h2>Congress Passes Bipartisan Bill to Help Veterans Avoid Home Foreclosure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has passed bipartisan legislation aimed at preventing thousands of veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The bill addresses a gap created when the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a previous homeowner assistance program, leaving many veterans with unaffordable options. The new law will allow veterans who have fallen behind on mortgage payments to move the missed payments to the end of their loan term, making their loan current. This solution was praised by veterans' groups and the mortgage industry as a crucial fix for a problem that had left veterans with fewer protections than other homeowners.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son who were lost in a remote California forest were successfully located by rescuers who followed a trail of handwritten notes she left behind. The pair became stranded after their car's GPS led them deep into the Stanislaus National Forest, where they lost their signal. The notes, which pleaded for help and provided contact information, guided the search-and-rescue team to their location. The mother also took other crucial steps, such as having her son blow a whistle in a distress pattern, which contributed to their safe recovery.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. While the company did not explicitly confirm the change, a spokesperson stated that details on new product innovations would be shared soon. The move follows advocacy from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has raised concerns about the health impacts of corn syrup. The change could negatively affect American corn farmers, while aligning U.S. Coca-Cola products with those sold in other countries like Mexico and the UK, which already use cane sugar.</p>
