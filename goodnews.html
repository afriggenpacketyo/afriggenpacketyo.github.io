          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices had fallen below $2 per gallon, attributing it to his policies and urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. However, the average U.S. gas price is around $3.165 per gallon, significantly higher than Trump's claim. While RBOB gasoline futures did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, this contract represents wholesale, unfinished gasoline and does not reflect the retail prices consumers pay. Experts emphasize that the RBOB price excludes taxes, transportation costs, and other fees, making it irrelevant to consumers.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a reduction in the number of general officers across all branches of the U.S. military, calling it a historic move to fulfill President Donald Trump's commitment to achieving peace through strength. The reduction will shift resources from headquarters elements to warfighters, aiming to create a leaner, more lethal force. The plan involves a minimum 20% reduction of four-star generals and flag officers in the active-duty component and the National Guard in the first phase, followed by an additional 10% reduction across the military.

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering imposing tariffs on films produced outside the United States, following a meeting with actor Jon Voight, who proposed the idea. Trump announced he was authorizing the Commerce Department to begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, causing confusion and concern in Hollywood. Voight and his manager submitted a comprehensive plan to increase domestic film production, including tax incentives, co-production treaties, and infrastructure subsidies, but Trump has since walked back the certainty of these tariffs, saying he will meet with Hollywood studios to gauge their reaction.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will continue defending U.S. rules easing access to the abortion drug mifepristone, maintaining the position previously held by the Biden administration. The Department of Justice filed a brief urging a Texas federal court to dismiss a lawsuit by Republican-led states challenging the FDA's actions. This decision suggests that the Trump administration is not planning to restrict access to mifepristone, despite the President's previous statements on abortion. The lawsuit challenges FDA actions from 2016 and 2021 that loosened restrictions on the drug, including allowing telemedicine prescriptions and mail delivery.</p>

          <p>Medicare does not cover dental care, vision care, hearing aids, overseas medical care, and long-term custodial care, leaving seniors exposed to significant out-of-pocket expenses. As healthcare costs continue to rise, seniors are increasingly turning to Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, to shore up their healthcare protection. Purchasing Medigap coverage can help mitigate the financial impact of rising healthcare expenses and secure coverage before health issues arise, as eligibility can depend on current health status. It is important to consider the potential coverage gaps and proactively plan for uncovered expenses to ensure greater financial security in retirement.</p>
