          <p>Eight female college athletes have appealed a $2.8 billion NCAA settlement, arguing it violates Title IX by disproportionately favoring men's sports, particularly football and men's basketball.  The appeal pauses all back payments, potentially delaying compensation for over a year.  This highlights ongoing debates about fair compensation and gender equity in college sports, particularly in light of the recent NIL ruling.</p>
