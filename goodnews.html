        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key provision within President Trump's latest domestic policy bill aims to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry by increasing tax credits for domestic manufacturing from 25% to 35%. This measure is designed to incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to expand their advanced production facilities within the United States, building upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The goal is to onshore more of the critical chip supply chain from Asia and strengthen national economic security. This reflects a continued strategic push from Washington to support domestic tech players and limit China's influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that imposes a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese goods imported into the United States. In exchange, the U.S. will gain tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets. The agreement also includes a higher 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at preventing nations like China from circumventing trade barriers. The deal could raise costs for U.S. apparel companies and other businesses that rely on Vietnamese manufacturing, altering the dynamics of international trade with the key Southeast Asian nation.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal. However, Israel has not officially confirmed its agreement, and a Palestinian official indicated the proposal offers no substantive changes from a previously rejected offer. Hamas officials stated they are ready to agree to a deal if it guarantees a complete end to the war and a withdrawal of Israeli forces. The situation remains highly fluid, with significant unresolved issues and skepticism on the Hamas side about the proposal's terms.</p>

By doing so, savers can secure a predictable and substantial return on their money, protecting their earnings from future rate declines.

Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared 88 years ago during their attempt to circumnavigate the globe.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, has proposed a novel plan to combat high food prices by creating a network of municipally-owned grocery stores. The plan envisions one non-profit store in each of the five boroughs, selling food at wholesale cost to fight what he calls price gouging by corporate chains. While the idea has popular support, it faces significant logistical and financial hurdles, as similar experiments in small rural towns have had mixed success. The proposal represents a major policy experiment for a city of New York's size.</p>

The DNA analysis revealed the man had brown eyes and hair and lived a physically demanding life, with skeletal markings consistent with using a pottery wheel. Significantly, the study showed that about 20% of his ancestry traced back to the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, providing the first genetic evidence of population mixing between North Africa and the Levant during this critical period of Egyptian history.</p>
