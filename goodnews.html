          <p>Shares of Canada Goose experienced a significant surge after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. The luxury retailer, known for its high-end parkas, decided to withdraw its fiscal 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainties and dynamic consumer spending patterns. Despite the uncertainty, Canada Goose executives expressed confidence in the brand's strength and ability to adapt to changing conditions. The company has been expanding into non-winter categories and leveraging AI-powered virtual try-on tools for its eyewear collection to strengthen year-round relevance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk individuals, but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means that many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new top vaccines official, Dr. Vinay Prasad, cited the division in America over repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses as a factor in the change.

          <p>Callable CDs offer potentially higher interest rates compared to traditional CDs, but come with the risk that the bank can redeem the CD before its full term.
