          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina recounts his decision to invest in the AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022 after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski. At the time, voice AI was an overlooked market, but Reina was convinced by Staniszewski's technical expertise and vision for solving the problem of robotic-sounding AI voices. Reina, who specializes in pre-seed funding for technical founders in non-obvious industries, saw potential before the company even had a product. ElevenLabs has since achieved a valuation of $6.6 billion, validating the early, thesis-driven investment strategy.</p>

          <p>As he began a five-day tour of Asia, former President Donald Trump stated he would be open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This comment came as he traveled to a series of summits in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where a high-stakes trade meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is also anticipated. Trump acknowledged North Korea as "sort of a nuclear power," a shift in rhetoric that could signal a different approach to stalled diplomatic talks. While US officials have downplayed the likelihood of a meeting, the suggestion has added another layer of intrigue to the diplomatic tour.</p>

Shortly after, Josh Charlton dominated the individual pursuit, securing the nation's first world title in that discipline since Bradley Wiggins in 2008.

          <p>England's Herbie Farnworth, who plays for the Dolphins in Australia's NRL, is being highlighted as a pivotal player in the upcoming Rugby League Ashes series against Australia. Regarded as one of the best centres in the world, Farnworth's journey from Lancashire to NRL stardom has equipped him with unique skills that his teammates believe could be a "cheat code" for England. Having been named Dally M centre of the year twice, his performance is seen as crucial for England's hopes of winning their first Ashes series since 1970. The series opener is expected to draw a record crowd at Wembley.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured a commanding 11-4 win against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the World Series, fueled by a massive nine-run rally in the sixth inning. The game-changing inning featured the first-ever pinch-hit grand slam in World Series history, hit by Addison Barger. The offensive explosion gave Toronto an insurmountable lead in the first Fall Classic game held in Canada since 1993. Despite a two-run homer from Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, the defending champions were unable to recover, giving the Blue Jays a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.</p>

          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, hosted in Kuala Lumpur, is set to tackle pressing regional security issues. A key focus will be the signing of a formal peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia to resolve a long-standing border dispute that recently led to armed clashes; US President Donald Trump is expected to oversee the signing. The summit will also address the ongoing civil war in Myanmar, where ASEAN's diplomatic efforts have so far been ineffective. While the bloc will welcome Timor-Leste as its 11th member, its ability to foster lasting peace in its most volatile conflicts remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani for mayor of New York City, providing a significant boost to the frontrunner's campaign just before early voting begins. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the city's affordability crisis and his commitment to representing all New Yorkers as reasons for his support. The endorsement consolidates Democratic establishment support behind Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, in his race against former Governor Andrew Cuomo. The move came shortly after Mamdani's rival, Cuomo, received the endorsement of the outgoing mayor, Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center report reveals that the Latino population in the United States has grown to 68 million, almost doubling since the year 2000. This demographic now constitutes one in five Americans and accounted for over half of the nation's total population growth in that period. Key findings show that U.S. births have been the primary driver of this increase for most of the last two decades. The population is also notably young, with a median age of 31, and is increasingly composed of U.S. citizens, with 79% holding citizenship as of 2024.</p>
