          <p>Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon are launching a platform for institutional investors to purchase money market funds as digital tokens recorded on a blockchain. This initiative seeks to bring greater efficiency to the $7.1 trillion money market industry by reducing transactional friction. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds provide a yield, making them an appealing cash management tool for large financial entities like hedge funds and corporations. Major asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity are already participating, with the long-term vision being a real-time, 24/7 digital ecosystem for these assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Ubiquitous Word 'OK' Traces Its Origins to a 19th-Century American Joke</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 08:08:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "OK" is one of the most universally understood terms globally, originating as a linguistic joke in 1839 Boston. It began as an abbreviation for "oll korrect," a playful misspelling of "all correct," which was part of a slang fad at the time. Its popularity surged during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, where his supporters formed "O.K. Clubs," referencing his nickname "Old Kinderhook." The word's simplicity and versatility made it ideal for the telegraph age and its global spread was later accelerated by American soldiers in the World Wars.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old shortstop Ethan Holliday has agreed to a record-breaking $9 million signing bonus with the Colorado Rockies, the largest ever for a player drafted directly from high school under the current system. Holliday, the son of former MLB All-Star Matt Holliday and brother of Baltimore's Jackson Holliday, was the No. 4 overall pick in the draft. This deal surpasses the previous high school record set earlier this month and ranks among the highest bonuses for any drafted player, including college athletes. His impressive family pedigree and outstanding high school performance made him a top prospect.</p>

          <p>Police in India have arrested a man accused of running a fake embassy from a residential building near New Delhi and using cars with counterfeit diplomatic license plates.

Authorities recovered doctored photos of Jain with world leaders, fraudulent seals from numerous countries, and a significant amount of cash in various currencies. He is now facing charges of forgery, impersonation, and illegal money laundering through international shell companies, representing a highly unusual and elaborate deception.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy for the Middle East, is set to travel to Europe to continue pushing for a ceasefire and a broader peace deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and the U.S. working to broker a 60-day truce that would include the release of hostages and an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. A key sticking point remains the positioning of Israeli forces during any ceasefire. The Trump administration is reportedly cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough in the protracted diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Two former traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their criminal convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate quashed by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. They were among 19 traders convicted in the UK and US following the 2008 financial crisis, and they argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what was then common commercial practice. The court ruled that errors in jury direction during their trials made the convictions unsafe, a landmark decision that vindicates their long-held claims of being scapegoats. The Serious Fraud Office has stated it will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off her attacker's tongue during a sexual assault. At the time, the 19-year-old was given a suspended prison sentence, while her aggressor received a lighter, suspended sentence for trespassing. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, sought to clear her name, and after a lengthy campaign, the nation's top court ordered a retrial. Prosecutors have now asked the court to acquit her, marking a significant moment for victims' rights in the country.</p>

          <p>The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed designating Apple and Google as having "strategic market status," a move that would empower the regulator to enforce changes to their business practices. The CMA's investigation focused on the companies' mobile operating systems, app stores, and browsers, citing concerns about unfair terms for developers and practices that may favor their own services. Proposed remedies include forcing greater transparency in app review processes and making it easier for developers to direct users to payment options outside the app stores, potentially avoiding hefty commission fees.</p>

          <p>Early data indicates that the reintroduction of McDonald's Snack Wraps has been a significant success, driving double-digit traffic increases in the initial days of its launch. After a nearly ten-year absence, the popular item's return appears to be boosting the company's sales, which had been sluggish in recent quarters. The demand was so high that some locations experienced temporary lettuce shortages. A survey of early buyers showed that 90% would purchase the item again, suggesting the sales lift could be sustained beyond the initial social media hype, providing a needed boost for the fast-food giant.</p>

          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted German comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as "El Hotzo," of charges that he condoned a criminal act through satirical online posts made after last year's assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Prosecutors had argued his posts, including one finding it "fantastic when fascists die," constituted hate crimes. However, the judge ruled the statements were clearly recognizable as satire, and while in bad taste, were not intended to disturb public order or incite violence. The case had drawn attention from journalists' associations who called the legal action against the satirist excessive.</p>

He states that Reform UK's appeal to young people stems from addressing their concerns about housing affordability and job prospects, offering a sense of hope for a better future that he believes other parties fail to provide.</p>
