          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated he will determine the most suitable governing framework for his coalition following the critical House of Councillors election in July. He described securing a majority in the upper house as a crucial but challenging goal, especially with conservative voters exploring alternatives to his Liberal Democratic Party. The election is viewed as a public verdict on his government's handling of inflation, stagnant wages, and economic uncertainty. Ishiba also mentioned plans to develop a new policy to support rice producers amid recent price surges and to explore further economic cooperation with the United States.</p>

          <p>Jerry Mathers, who played 'Beaver' Cleaver, reflected on the positive environment on the set of the 1950s sitcom "Leave It to Beaver." He attributed the wholesome atmosphere to his TV father, Hugh Beaumont, who was also a Methodist minister and helped keep the cast and crew "on the straight and narrow." Mathers noted that the set was a fun and caring place, largely because most of the crew were parents themselves and knew how to work with children. The show's enduring popularity continues to bring comfort to fans, and Mathers remains grateful for its positive impact.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the narrative of a "sex recession," this article argues that Gen Z is spearheading a significant sexual revolution by redefining sex, gender, and relationships. While statistics show they are having less partnered sex than previous generations, they are described as the most sexually progressive generation, actively challenging traditional norms and political conservatism. The overturning of Roe v. Wade and other conservative policies have politicized their approach to sexuality, leading to activism and a reimagining of concepts like virginity. The piece, extracted from a forthcoming book, posits that Gen Z's focus is on dismantling outdated expectations and embracing a more inclusive, intentional understanding of sexuality.</p>

Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, concluding a 24-year program as it transitions to the more cost-effective H3 model. In a notable diplomatic development, Israel's ambassador confirmed he will attend the upcoming peace ceremony in Nagasaki, marking the anniversary of the 1945 atomic bombing, after not being invited the previous year. Meanwhile, a Kyodo News poll revealed that half of Japanese voters hope the ruling coalition loses its upper house majority in the upcoming election. Top negotiators from Japan and the U.S. also held further talks regarding a potential tariff deal.</p>

          <p>This featured poem, titled "For Now" by Christopher Kondrich, explores themes of time, safety, and the ephemeral nature of the present moment through the metaphor of a day at the beach. The speaker reassures a child about the safety of swimming between two flags, which also come to represent a demarcated, fleeting period of time. The poem juxtaposes the immediate, sensory experience of the waves with a broader, more anxious awareness of future threats, such as climate change. It captures a poignant moment of parental care within a world of looming uncertainty.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the Labour government is now better positioned to pass its welfare reforms after making significant concessions. The government was forced into a major U-turn on its plans to cut the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) following the threat of a large-scale rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. Key changes include limiting Pip cuts to new claimants and allowing the health-related component of Universal Credit to rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs have indicated they are now likely to support the bill, averting a major defeat for the Prime Minister.</p>

The company has grown from a niche sportscar maker into a global automotive giant, though its recent performance has been sluggish due to an aging lineup and increased competition. CEO Elon Musk now pivots the company's future value on solving autonomous driving and developing humanoid robots. However, the stock has struggled in 2025, impacted by slowing sales and controversies surrounding Musk's political activities. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece notes Pelinka's role in building a championship team and Redick's decent performance in his first regular season. The recommendation is to allow them at least one more season to demonstrate their capabilities with improved organizational support.</p>
