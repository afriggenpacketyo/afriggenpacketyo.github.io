          <p>Mykale Baker, an 18-year-old Burger King employee in Georgia, helped his overwhelmed coworkers on his graduation night, leading to an outpouring of support. A customer, Maria Mendoza, captured the act on video and started a crowdfunding campaign that has raised over $200,000. Baker plans to use the money to attend trade school and become a master auto mechanic.

Limited-edition Labubu items are resold online for high prices, reflecting strong demand.

          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing negotiations to reach a tariff agreement, but have yet to find common ground on key issues. Despite the disagreements, both countries aim to strike a deal by mid-June, according to Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa. Akazawa emphasized that Japan will not accept a deal unless it benefits both countries, reiterating Japan's position that the Trump administration's additional tariffs must be removed. The discussions include cooperation in trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Russian truck drivers who transported platforms for Ukraine's drone attack on Russian warplanes did so unknowingly. The drones were hidden in "mobile houses" with retractable roofs, loaded on trucks, and remotely opened to conduct the operation. Zelenskyy emphasized that the drivers were unaware that the containers were equipped with drones used to assault Russian airfields. Ukraine has claimed to have damaged over 40 Russian bombers in the attacks.</p>

          <p>Liam Dawson has been selected for the England cricket team after a two-year absence, showing the hosts what they had been missing. Dawson's absence had been a contentious topic among county fans, who were puzzled by his consistent overlook despite leading the County Championship in spin bowling. Rob Key, England's managing director, had previously stated that Dawson was "not someone who wants to go around India as the 15th or 16th man." Dawson's return signifies a shift towards valuing dependability and strength in the team.</p>
