          <p>Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management is investing $900 million in real estate company Howard Hughes, purchasing 9 million newly issued shares at a 48% premium to the previous closing price. This move increases Pershing Square's stake to 46.9% and signals Ackman's intention to transform Howard Hughes into a diversified holding company, acquiring controlling interests in both public and private operating companies, while continuing its core real estate development business. The investment strategy mirrors that of Warren Buffett, indicating a long-term value-oriented approach. Shares of Howard Hughes experienced an 8% increase in premarket trading following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain chairman. This decision, revealed at the annual shareholder meeting, assures shareholders that Buffett, at 94, will continue to guide the company and assist Abel with significant acquisition opportunities amidst potential market volatility. Buffett emphasized that Abel, 62, will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment after the transition. Despite the CEO change and somewhat disappointing earnings, Berkshire shares only decreased by 2% in premarket trading, with the company's market value exceeding $1.1 trillion at Friday's close. Abel has been Buffett's designated successor since 2021.</p>

          <p>Temu, the China-based low-cost retailer, has stopped shipping goods from China to the U.S. following the expiration of the de minimis tariff exemption. This exemption allowed low-value parcels to enter the U.S. without tariffs, but its end means Temu's China-sourced products now face high tariffs. Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with sales in the U.S. now handled by locally based sellers and orders fulfilled from domestic warehouses. The company is also actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform, aiming to help them reach more customers and grow their businesses. U.S. consumers had complained about tariff surcharges that sometimes doubled the value of the merchandise.</p>

          <p>Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, is navigating a delicate balance between criticizing President Trump and working with Republicans to serve his state's interests. As the only Democratic senator up for re-election in a state Trump won in 2024, Ossoff faces a tough challenge. While he has vocally criticized Trump's actions, including his attempts to wield the federal government against critics, Ossoff also emphasizes his commitment to bipartisanship and delivering for Georgia. He supports initiatives like lowering tariffs on Georgia pecans and backs incentives for electric vehicle construction. Ossoff's approach aims to appeal to a broad range of voters in a state that has recently swung between parties.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett announced that Greg Abel will become the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, with Buffett remaining as chairman. Abel, who currently oversees all of Berkshire's non-insurance companies, has been the designated successor since 2021. Known for his business acumen and hands-on management style, Abel joined Berkshire in 2000 and transformed MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a leading wind energy producer. While Abel is well-regarded, analysts note that he faces the challenge of matching Buffett's legendary performance and may have less leeway due to not controlling a significant portion of Berkshire's stock.</p>

          <h2>Talk Therapy Use Increases as Reliance on Medication Alone Declines, Study Shows</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in the American Journal of Psychiatry reveals that more American adults with mental health needs are engaging in talk therapy, while the use of psychiatric medications without therapy has decreased. Between 2018 and 2021, the percentage of adults receiving psychotherapy rose from 6.5% to 8.5%, marking a shift from previous trends where medication use was increasing. This change may reflect greater awareness and accessibility of talk therapy, partly due to the expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also found that the types of providers offering talk therapy have expanded to include licensed counselors and social workers.</p>

He notes that disability remains a constituency with crossover appeal, making it crucial to foreground disability in the defense of programs like Medicaid. Ne'eman also expresses concern over Secretary Kennedy's statements on autism, emphasizing the need for research focused on improving services and supports for autistic individuals.</p>

          <p>The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the UK has issued a warning about cybercriminals impersonating IT help desk staff to breach British retailers. Recent attacks on Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and Harrods have prompted the NCSC to advise organizations to review their IT help desk password reset processes. The agency highlights the use of social engineering tactics, where criminals trick employees into divulging login credentials. Cyber security experts recommend implementing multiple layers of security, such as code words, to verify the authenticity of staff members requesting credential changes.</p>
