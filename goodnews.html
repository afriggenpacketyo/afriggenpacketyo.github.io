          <p>Chipotle is introducing its Adobo Ranch dipping sauce, the first new dip in five years, available at restaurants starting June 17. The new flavor combines the ranch craze with a "smoky, spicy" twist, blending adobo pepper, sour cream, herbs, and spices. Chipotle Rewards members can try the Adobo Ranch for free on launch day by enrolling before 11 p.m. local time on June 16. This launch follows previous criticism of Chipotle's bowl sizes, which the company addressed after allegations of underserving customers. Chipotle aims to provide customers with a craveworthy way to customize their orders with the new flavor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey indicated that Americans' inflation fears receded in May, coinciding with President Trump's softened stance on tariff proposals. The one-year inflation outlook decreased to 3.2%, a 0.4 percentage point drop from April, while the three-year and five-year forecasts also edged down. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett highlighted that inflation has decreased despite rising tariff revenue, contradicting predictions of tariff-induced inflation. The survey also revealed positive trends in employment and debt management, with fewer people expecting job loss and improved confidence in stock market performance (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While technically possible to use a 401(k) to pay off credit card debt through a loan or withdrawal, it's often not advisable due to long-term financial risks. A 401(k) loan requires repayment with interest, and job loss can trigger immediate repayment, leading to taxes and penalties. Outright withdrawals incur a 10% penalty if under 59¬Ω, plus income taxes, and both options sacrifice potential compound growth. Before tapping retirement savings, exploring alternatives like debt consolidation, credit counseling, or debt settlement is recommended (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated that he "forgave" Zia Yusuf after Yusuf criticized MP Sarah Pochin's call for a burka ban and subsequently resigned as chairman. Yusuf, who initially said working for a Reform UK government was not "a good use of my time," later reversed his decision and will now lead the party's Doge unit, focused on cutting wasteful spending. Farage acknowledged Yusuf's "intemperate comment or two" but said Yusuf regretted his actions and was forgiven.
