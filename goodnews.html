          <p>The Federal Reserve has launched a public defense of its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation, responding to escalating attacks from the Trump administration. The central bank created a "Frequently Asked Questions" webpage to counter claims of mismanagement and extravagance, particularly from OMB Director Russell Vought. The page clarifies that costs increased due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos and design changes, not for "VIP dining rooms" as alleged. This public pushback signifies the Fed's resistance to political pressure as the administration continues its campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Joe Biden has refuted allegations that he was unaware of or incapacitated during the issuance of numerous pardons and commutations in his final days in office. In an interview, he stated, "I made every single one of those," dismissing claims from conservatives as politically motivated lies. The controversy centers on the use of an autopen to sign the documents, a practice critics argue invalidates them. Biden defended the autopen's legality, noting its use by previous presidents, including Donald Trump, for large batches of documents.</p>

          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is renewing efforts to have global nuclear powers sign the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (SEANWFZ). Malaysia, the current ASEAN chair, announced that China has committed to signing the 1995 treaty without reservation, and Russia is also expected to join. The treaty aims to keep the region free of nuclear weapons while permitting civilian nuclear energy programs. The move is seen as a diplomatic win for China, contrasting with the AUKUS security pact and highlighting shifting geopolitical dynamics in the region.</p>

In the women's draw, Iga Swiatek's commanding victory made her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces. The tournament also signaled that time may be catching up with Novak Djokovic, while highlighting the replacement of human line judges with electronic systems.</p>

          <p>The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has stated its intention to carefully manage its "moderately loose" monetary policy to support the nation's goal of approximately 5% GDP growth for the year. A deputy governor for the bank, Zou Lan, noted that the full effects of recent supportive measures, such as cuts to the reserve requirement ratio, are still materializing. The central bank plans to base future actions on economic conditions and market performance, aiming to stimulate domestic demand and stabilize public expectations without over-saturating the market.

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that U.S. President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation for a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17 to 19. He will be hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle, as Buckingham Palace is undergoing renovations. This is an unusual honor, as second-term presidents are not typically offered a full state visit. The event, a tool of soft diplomacy by the British government, will involve senior royals and include a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet, though public-facing events are unlikely due to security concerns.</p>

          <p>Writing in an opinion piece, a former member of New York City's rent guidelines board defends mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposal for a citywide rent freeze. The author, Leah Goodridge, argues that such freezes are not "pie-in-the-sky" but are established lifelines for tenants, citing multiple instances of freezes enacted over the past decade based on economic data. The article frames the debate as part of a larger agenda by landlord interests to deregulate and weaken rent stabilization protections, which have recently survived legal challenges that went nearly to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>This article provides a brief history of queerness, tracing its varied acceptance and persecution from antiquity to the modern era. It notes that while figures like Leonardo da Vinci faced scrutiny, same-sex relationships were common in ancient Greece and Rome, albeit with specific social hierarchies. The spread of Christianity introduced centuries of stigmatization and punishment, contrasting with more relaxed attitudes in places like samurai-era Japan. The article also highlights the long-standing existence of third-gender identities in various cultures and the modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights, emphasizing that these hard-won achievements require continuous protection.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the state-owned Post Office, suggesting it could be transformed into a mutually-owned business. This proposal, which would give employees a greater stake in the organization, aims to reform the Post Office's culture following the Horizon IT scandal that led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The consultation will also review the necessity of maintaining 11,500 branches and what future services, particularly banking, should be offered. The goal is to create a fresh vision for the financially struggling but socially valuable institution.</p>

The article contends that NIMBYism is the truly conservative project, preserving an unfair status quo that worsens the cost-of-living crisis, climate outcomes, and segregation, ultimately hurting progressive values.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's platform, which centers on affordability, has gained significant attention for its proposal of free, universal childcare. The plan, funded by increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy, responds to a growing activist movement and the city's crippling childcare costs, which average $26,000 annually. Proponents argue the policy would improve financial security for families and childcare workers, boost the city's economy, and build on the success of its universal pre-K program.

          <p>Despite modern advancements like comfortable beds and climate control eliminating historical sleep threats, many people still struggle with poor sleep. This article explores the paradox of modern sleep, where new obstacles have replaced old ones. Modern lifestyles, marked by stress, demanding work schedules, and constant screen time, disrupt natural sleep patterns. Furthermore, systemic issues like noise and light pollution, housing insecurity, and the stress of discrimination disproportionately affect sleep quality in marginalized communities, creating significant sleep health disparities that technology alone cannot solve.</p>
