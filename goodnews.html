          <h2>California Court Rules Holding Cellphone for Navigation is Illegal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 15:01:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California appeals court has ruled that holding a cellphone while driving, even for navigation purposes, violates the state's law against distracted driving. The court determined that merely looking at a map on the screen while holding the phone constitutes "operating" the device, thus breaking the law. This decision reverses a previous ruling that required active use or manipulation of the phone for a violation to occur, reinforcing the legislature's intent to reduce distracted driving. The ruling clarifies that only mounted phones operated with a single swipe are exempt, aiming to encourage drivers to keep their eyes on the road. The author's tone is neutral, reflecting the legal interpretation and its implications for drivers.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 14:51:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit significantly narrowed in April, coinciding with President Donald Trump's tariff escalations, as imports plunged. The trade gap fell sharply from $140 billion to $61 billion, reflecting the impact of trade barriers taking effect. While Trump touts tariffs as a means to slash the nation's trade deficit, economists argue it reflects the consumer-driven nature of the U.S. economy. The outlook remains uncertain due to Trump's fluctuating tariff policies and anxious consumer sentiment, although key economic measures like unemployment and job growth have largely defied downturn fears. The article does not offer investment advice and the author's tone reflects the mixed economic signals and policy uncertainties. </p>

          <p>The film "From the World of John Wick: Ballerina" stars Ana de Armas as Eve, an assassin seeking vengeance in the John Wick universe. While the movie delivers stylish action and impressive fight choreography, the plot is somewhat predictable and the dialogue is lackluster. De Armas delivers a convincing performance as a determined killer, engaging in brutal combat scenes. Although the film includes familiar elements from the franchise, like the Continental Hotel and cameos from John Wick characters, the narrative struggles to maintain engagement, relying heavily on action sequences to compensate for its shortcomings. The author's tone is mixed, acknowledging the strengths of the action while criticizing the plot and dialogue.</p>

          <p>The government announced that from September 2026, any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be able to claim free school meals, regardless of their income, potentially benefiting 500,000 more pupils. The government says this change will save parents ¬£500 a year and "lift 100,000 children out of poverty", and has set aside ¬£1bn to fund the change up to 2029. While Sir Keir Starmer hailed the measure as a "down payment" on a broader child poverty strategy, some critics have argued that other measures, such as lifting the two-child limit, would be more effective. Concerns have also been raised about the impact on schools' budgets, as they will not receive pupil premium funding for the additional children who receive the meals. The author's tone is neutral, presenting the benefits and drawbacks of the policy change. </p>
