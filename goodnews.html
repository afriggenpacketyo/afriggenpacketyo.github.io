        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United has announced the signing of German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a club-record fee of up to £69 million. The 23-year-old forward has agreed to a long-term contract, surpassing the previous transfer record set by Alexander Isak. Woltemade's arrival is seen as a significant move for the club's attacking options, especially amid speculation about Isak's potential departure. Head coach Eddie Howe praised the new signing for his technical ability and growth potential, expressing confidence that Woltemade fits the team's strategic profile and will be a key player for the future.</p>

          <p>China is deepening its security cooperation in Africa under its Global Security Initiative (GSI), with a recent focus on training Somali security and military personnel. The program aims to help Somalia develop a self-reliant defense force to combat the extremist group al-Shabab, particularly as the African Union mission prepares to withdraw. This military support follows law enforcement and border security training for Somali officials conducted in China. These efforts, which also include discussions on anti-piracy cooperation, demonstrate Beijing's strategy to build security partnerships and protect its interests, such as fishing, in strategically important regions like the Horn of Africa.</p>

          <p>A team of former federal employees is working to launch a new non-profit climate information portal, climate.us, after the Trump administration effectively shut down the widely used climate.gov website. The original site's production team was fired, and its content, while technically online, has been made difficult to access by political appointees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Led by climate.gov's former managing editor, the new volunteer effort aims to restore public access to vital climate science information and expand its mission to offer climate-related services. The initiative seeks to preserve a taxpayer-funded resource that the current administration has tried to suppress.</p>

          <p>The Ndlovu Youth Choir from South Africa has released a Zulu-language translation of Queen's iconic song "Bohemian Rhapsody," marking the first time the band has officially authorized such a version. The project received the blessing of Queen's surviving members and the Mercury Phoenix Trust, coinciding with the song's 50th anniversary. The choir's artistic director noted the connection to Freddie Mercury's birthplace in Zanzibar, Tanzania, as an inspiration for the African rendition. The translation process was meticulous, aiming to preserve the original's meaning while weaving in African musical traditions, creating a unique cultural tribute to the rock anthem.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has granted clemency to 23 individuals and commuted the sentences of 10 others, including five inmates serving life without parole for murder. The governor's office stated that these actions recognize the individuals' rehabilitation, self-improvement, and, in some cases, childhood trauma that influenced their past choices. The commutations will make the inmates eligible for parole hearings, where their potential release will be considered. While the decisions highlight a focus on transformation within the justice system, they have drawn emotional responses from victims' families who were previously assured the perpetrators would never be released.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Scotland, have set a new world record by rowing unsupported across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Australia in 139 days, five hours, and 52 minutes. Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean completed the 9,000-mile journey, beating the previous record by over 22 days despite facing severe tropical storms that forced detours and even swept one brother overboard. The trio, who undertook the challenge to raise over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar, endured relentless physical and mental challenges. They were reunited with family in Cairns, Australia, after nearly 140 days at sea.</p>

          <p>Provisional data from the CDC indicates a significant and sustained decline in fatal drug overdoses in the United States, reaching a five-year low of 77,648 in the 12-month period ending March 2025. This marks a nearly one-third drop from the peak in 2023, with some states like West Virginia seeing declines of over 40%. Despite this positive trend, President Donald Trump has continued to frame fentanyl as a growing crisis to justify policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. Public health experts attribute the decline to successful supply chain disruptions and improved addiction treatment, while critics worry the administration's punitive approach could hinder further progress.</p>

          <p>A global movement to protect children online, exemplified by the UK's Online Safety Act and similar bills in the US Congress, is driving a surge in AI-powered safety technology. These regulations impose a "duty of care" on tech companies, compelling platforms like Pornhub, Spotify, and X to implement robust age-verification systems. Companies like Yoti are at the forefront, using AI facial analysis to estimate a user's age, though this has raised privacy concerns. Concurrently, new hardware solutions are emerging, such as a child-safe smartphone from HMD Global that uses AI to block inappropriate content, reflecting a growing market for child protection technology.</p>

          <p>Star pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers, where he signed a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. The trade, which sent two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to Dallas, ended a difficult four-month contract stalemate for Parsons. Now in Green Bay, Parsons expressed his ambition to build a legacy comparable to franchise legends like Reggie White. The move provides the Packers with a transformative defensive player they have lacked, though it required a significant investment in both draft capital and salary.</p>

          <p>North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine, with volume more than doubling in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the previous year. The country imported over 157,000 liters, making it the second-largest destination for Chinese bottled wine by volume. This surge in trade highlights North Korea's limited options for sourcing alcoholic beverages due to international sanctions. While the United Nations has banned luxury goods from entering the country since 2006, alcohol is not on the restricted list, allowing China to remain a key supplier and long-time trade partner for the isolated nation.</p>
