          <p>Panasonic Holdings Corp. announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees, approximately 5% of its workforce, both domestically and internationally as part of a restructuring initiative. The company will target 5,000 workers in Japan and 5,000 overseas, offering some employees early retirement packages. This decision follows a significant restructuring charge of 130 billion yen ($895 million), aimed at streamlining the company's operations and improving earnings by over 300 billion yen by fiscal year 2028. President Yuki Kusumi expressed regret for the layoffs and committed to improving employee productivity while returning a portion of his compensation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 08:55:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent University of Florida study analyzing nearly 300 years of human-alligator interactions found that 96% of alligator bites are preceded by human inattention or risk-taking behavior. The study categorized incidents based on the level of human risk, with most bites occurring after moderate-risk behaviors like swimming in alligator-inhabited areas, and fatal bites resulting from high-risk actions like deliberately entering those waters. Researchers emphasize that alligator bites are preventable and urge the public to maintain situational awareness around wildlife, minimizing risky behaviors such as walking small pets near water or swimming in known alligator habitats. By creating a ranking system, the team underscored that the majority of bites stemmed from risky human behavior.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signaled a possible shift in trade policy by suggesting a reduction in tariffs on China to 80%, a significant decrease from the current 145%, ahead of crucial trade discussions in Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators. Trump also mentioned that "Many Trade Deals in the hopper" and reiterated the importance of China opening its market to the USA.

          <p>President Trump is navigating complex trade negotiations, with a recent agreement with Britain seen as a potential breakthrough, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent prepares for crucial talks with Chinese counterparts in Geneva. The White House faces pressure to ease its protectionist stance as companies warn of profit impacts from the trade war, and the S&P 500 has rallied on hopes of reduced trade tensions. Despite the UK deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick cautioned that negotiations with Japan and South Korea will be protracted, and a full China deal could take years. Meanwhile, data indicates a significant drop in Chinese shipments to the U.S. but a rise in exports to Southeast Asia, suggesting a shift in trade patterns.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era Venus mission lander, Cosmos 482, which failed to leave Earth's orbit in 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. This piece of space debris is unique because Venera spacecraft were designed to withstand Venus's harsh atmospheric conditions, potentially allowing Cosmos 482 to survive its re-entry. Weighing 495 kilograms, it is larger than most space debris, but the risk of it hitting someone on Earth is low. The re-entry is uncontrolled, but its smooth shape may allow for reasonably accurate calculations of its descent.</p>

          <p>Ofcom has initiated investigations into two pornographic websites, Itai Tech Ltd and Score Internet Group LLC, for potentially violating the UK's new child safety regulations. The regulator alleges that these sites have not provided sufficient details on how they prevent children from accessing their platforms, as required by the Online Safety Act. Compliance with the Act mandates the implementation of robust age-checking techniques on websites featuring pornographic content, and failure to do so can result in significant fines. While many services have submitted plans for effective age assurance methods, these two companies have reportedly failed to respond or demonstrate any age verification measures.</p>
