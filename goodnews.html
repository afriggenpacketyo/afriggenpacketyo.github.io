          <p>Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases. Tillis's decision jeopardizes Martin's confirmation prospects, as it could lead to a tie vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, preventing the nomination from advancing. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire soon. The article underscores the internal divisions within the Republican party regarding judicial nominations and the legacy of the January 6th riot.</p>

          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a significant drop of over 10% despite the company reporting ongoing revenue growth acceleration. Analysts raised concerns about modest full-year revenue guidance and a decline in international commercial revenue. Despite exceeding revenue expectations and increasing its revenue guidance for the year, the company's high software multiple makes it susceptible to compression as revenue growth slows. CEO Alex Karp remained optimistic, stating that Palantir is "on fire" due to a combination of 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S.</p>

The BBC acknowledged failing to properly challenge these allegations and not including the views of the Home Office or Buckingham Palace. The corporation stated it should have given the view of Buckingham Palace, which had previously stated: ‚ÄúAll of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.‚Äù</p>

Trump's executive order aims to address what he views as the Smithsonian's promotion of narratives harmful to American values, singling out the African American museum. The museum is currently without a permanent leader, as Young left to focus on writing after some Smithsonian officials questioned his suitability for the role. Despite these challenges, supporters rallied to protect Black history and the museum from interference.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A single late payment can significantly impact your credit score, potentially affecting loan rates and financial opportunities. While legitimate late payments remain on credit reports for up to seven years, several strategies can be employed to mitigate their impact. These include requesting a goodwill adjustment from the creditor, disputing inaccuracies with credit bureaus, negotiating with the creditor for removal, or simply waiting for the late payment's impact to lessen over time. Consistently making on-time payments after a late mark can help rebuild credit faster.</p>
