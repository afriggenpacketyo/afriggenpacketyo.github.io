Knack allowed four runs, including three home runs, in just 3 ‚Öì innings, forcing the Dodgers to rely heavily on their bullpen. Michael Conforto delivered a go-ahead RBI single in the eighth inning, completing a three-run comeback and securing the win for the Dodgers. Manager Dave Roberts noted potential roster moves ahead of a six-game road trip, with injured pitchers possibly returning and outfielders joining the taxi squad as insurance.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzed stocks reaching new 52-week highs to understand current market trends, noting the absence of major tech names due to U.S.-China trade tensions. Broadcom, along with data center-related companies like Seagate and Johnson Controls, made the list, indicating the strength of the data center trend. Subscription-based businesses like Netflix and Spotify also saw gains, while uniform-maker Cintas' success signals a positive outlook for the broader economy. Cramer advises considering these stocks for purchase if they dip 5 to 8% from their current levels (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws apply equally to all employees, regardless of majority or minority group status. The ruling revives a lawsuit by a heterosexual woman who claimed discrimination by a lesbian supervisor, rejecting the idea that majority group members need more evidence to sue and win. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson emphasized that the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination against ‚Äúany individual.‚Äù Experts noted the decision's impact would vary by region, potentially increasing "reverse discrimination" lawsuits. The ruling clarifies that there is no double standard for discrimination claims.</p>
