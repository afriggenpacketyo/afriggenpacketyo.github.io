          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, citing his commitment to public safety, affordability, and defiance against Donald Trump's agenda. Despite past disagreements, Hochul expressed confidence in Mamdani's leadership, emphasizing their shared goals for the city. This endorsement from a moderate Democrat is significant for Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has recently softened some past positions, including apologizing for calling the NYPD "racist." The article notes that other prominent New York Democrats, like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, have yet to make an endorsement in the competitive race against incumbent Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index hit a record high of 3,420.23, marking its tenth consecutive session of gains, after the government announced it would scrap plans to raise taxes on stock investments. This positive market movement occurred as Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, with investors monitoring U.S.-China talks in Spain and new economic data from Beijing. While the Kospi surged, China's economy showed a slowdown in August, and Australian markets dipped. U.S. equity futures remained stable as investors anticipate a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut this week, following recent data indicating a weakening labor market and tame inflation. The article notes that U.S. markets had strong gains last week, fueled by hopes for rate cuts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a leading cause of death and infertility for the marsupials. Researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast developed the vaccine over ten years, aiming to reduce the rapid, devastating spread of the disease, which affects up to 70% of some koala populations. Chlamydia can cause blindness, starvation, and bladder damage in koalas, often leading to euthanasia. This vaccine, tested on hundreds of wild and captive koalas, has shown to reduce infection, prevent disease progression, and even reverse existing symptoms. Its widespread use, now approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, offers significant hope for koala conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Brain fog, characterized by difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common experience often linked to stress or busy lifestyles.
