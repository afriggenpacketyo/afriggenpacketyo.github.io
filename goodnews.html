          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 14:11:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, recently informed CNBC that his company is not in the market to acquire another railroad, despite previous market speculation that saw CSX shares rise. Instead, he met with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to explore greater cooperation aimed at enhancing freight rail efficiency. This discussion builds on a newly announced partnership between Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX to provide new coast-to-coast services, allowing them to achieve benefits similar to a merger without the high acquisition cost. The broader railroad sector had been shaken by Union Pacific's recent $85 billion bid for Norfolk Southern, setting off widespread takeover speculation. Buffett's comments clarified Berkshire's strategic approach amidst this dynamic industry landscape, impacting various rail stocks.</p>

          <p>Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin has reportedly secured a three-year, $96 million contract extension, finalizing a deal that had been a point of contention. McLaurin had previously withheld from summer workouts and even requested a trade amidst stalled negotiations for a new contract. Despite team struggles, the two-time Pro Bowl athlete has been a consistent performer, achieving over 1,000 receiving yards in five consecutive seasons since his 2019 NFL Draft selection. Commanders co-owner Magic Johnson lauded McLaurin as an exceptional player and a significant leader within the Washington community, underscoring his pivotal role for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>President Trump recently mused about renaming the Department of Defense back to the "Department of War," referencing its historical name and suggesting an announcement would be made soon. During a White House meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, Trump also weighed in on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. He indicated that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be up to them, stating, "it takes two to tango," and that they should meet to "close the deal" before he would consider his own involvement. Trump added that he would monitor the situation over the coming weeks for further developments in the diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing its colossal Super Heavy-Starship rocket for its 10th test flight, aiming to validate corrective upgrades after several previous failures. The mission's objectives include rigorously testing the Super Heavy first stage and sending the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory for a controlled splashdown, along with deploying Starlink simulator satellites and performing an in-space engine restart. Despite these ambitious tests, significant concerns linger about the vehicle's readiness for NASA's planned 2027 moon landing, primarily due to the complex and unproven requirements for numerous in-orbit cryogenic propellant transfers. While NASA's acting administrator expresses optimism, some experts warn that the technical leap may be too large for the current timeline, highlighting the immense challenges ahead for the program.</p>

Thousands of attendees enjoyed the spectacle of colorful costumes, energetic dancing, and diverse music under warm weather conditions. Performing groups showcased traditions from various Caribbean nations and Brazil, contributing to Europe's largest street party. Carnival chair Ian Comfort underscored the vital importance of ongoing funding to maintain the event's annual operation and ensure necessary safety enhancements. A significant moment of the day included a 72-second silence, observed to honor the 72 victims of the Grenfell Tower fire, along with others who have passed away at the carnival and Kelso Cochrane, whose murder in 1959 was a catalyst for the event's inception.</p>

          <p>Eric Thompson, a tech worker, is leading an initiative to pass federal legislation, the Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act (TJAAA), aimed at banning "ghost jobs." These are job postings without a genuine intent to hire, often used to collect resumes or signal growth, causing significant frustration for job seekers. The proposed law would mandate that public job listings include specific information like intended hire dates, whether it's a new or backfill role, and limits on posting duration. Thompson's advocacy, which includes numerous meetings with Congressional staffers, is part of a growing movement to increase transparency in the hiring process, with similar proposals emerging at state levels and in Canada.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a widely used Wall Street metric for valuing stocks, to help investors determine if a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued. The forward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current stock price by analysts' estimated earnings per share for the next four quarters. Key factors influencing the appropriate P/E multiple include the company's earnings growth rate, comparisons within its industry, historical valuation trends, and prevailing interest rates. Higher interest rates, for instance, can lead investors to demand a higher rate of return on stocks, potentially resulting in a lower P/E multiple. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals an increasing presence of great white sharks in the colder waters off New England and Canada's Atlantic coast, with sightings rising significantly in areas like Maine and Nova Scotia. Scientists attribute this shift to the growing availability of seals, the sharks' primary food source, in these northern regions. While the increased sightings prompt awareness among boaters and beachgoers, experts emphasize that fatal shark bites remain exceedingly rare. Maine, for example, has only confirmed two unprovoked shark attacks since 1837, with the most recent occurring in 2020, suggesting that despite their growing numbers, the risk to humans remains minimal.</p>
