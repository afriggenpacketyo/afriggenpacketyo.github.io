        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain and the European Union have finalized a significant agreement aimed at enhancing security cooperation and reducing trade barriers that arose after Brexit. The deal intends to foster closer collaboration between the two entities, especially as the United States signals a reduction in its commitment to European security. Key aspects of the agreement include streamlined border crossings for British citizens using electronic gates, eased travel regulations for pets, and the resumption of certain British meat product sales within the EU. The agreement also addresses fishing rights, granting European boats access to UK waters until June 2038, a point of contention that drew criticism from pro-Brexit factions in Britain.</p>

          <p>Born in 1925, Malcolm X became an influential figure in the Black civil rights movement, advocating for self-confidence and resistance against oppression "by any means necessary." His early life was marked by racism and violence, leading him to join the Nation of Islam (NOI) and denounce "white devils." Later, a pilgrimage to Mecca transformed his views, leading him to seek an alliance of oppressed people of color. He was assassinated in 1965, but his legacy has been renewed through hip-hop and film, reminding us of the importance of facing reality and fighting against injustice.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy's "non-conforming" driver became a major talking point at the US PGA, overshadowing Scottie Scheffler's victory. Rumors emerged that McIlroy had been forced to switch drivers after his club failed a legality test. The PGA of America confirmed that testing had been carried out by the USGA, but did not identify any players whose clubs failed. McIlroy ignored reporters after his rounds, adding to the speculation. Observers expressed concern that the leak of information led to ill-informed speculation that might have called into question the validity of McIlroy's Masters win.</p>

The club has shown in the past that it is prepared to walk away from transfers if it believes a deal does not represent value for money.</p>

          <p>Alison Bechdel's latest comic novel, "Spent," explores themes of late-stage capitalism and anxiety while also reflecting on her own aging and career. The cartoon Alison, Bechdel's avatar, grapples with writer's block, fame, and societal anxieties, but ultimately finds solace in her chosen family and community. Despite the pervasive sense of doom, the novel concludes with a moment of happiness and calm, suggesting that solidarity and connection can provide a sense of resilience in a troubled world. Bechdel's work continues to resonate by capturing the complexities of queer life and offering a blend of humor, intellect, and emotional depth.</p>
