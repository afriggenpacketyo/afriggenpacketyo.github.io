          <p>Exxon Mobil announced a 23% decrease in second-quarter net income to $7.1 billion, a result softened by the impact of lower oil prices. However, the company's earnings per share and revenue both beat analyst expectations, driven by record production levels in the Permian Basin and Guyana, reaching the highest Q2 output in over 25 years. The oil major has successfully cut $1.4 billion in costs this year and continues its significant shareholder return program through dividends and share buybacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor has voiced his opinion that his teammate, star slugger Juan Soto, was a significant snub for this year's MLB All-Star game. Lindor stated that Soto "deserved it" and "definitely should have been there," highlighting his status as one of the league's best hitters despite a slow start to the season. While four other Mets players were selected for the event, Lindor believes Soto's impressive statistics, including 25 home runs and 62 RBIs, warranted his inclusion in the midsummer classic.</p>

          <p>China has introduced its first anti-money-laundering regulation specifically targeting the precious metals and gems sector. The new rule requires dealers to report any cash transactions exceeding 100,000 yuan (about US$13,870) to the country's financial crime watchdog within five days. This measure is designed to close a significant loophole that was being exploited for illicit financial activities. Dealers must also report any transaction they reasonably suspect is related to money laundering, regardless of its value, marking a significant expansion of financial oversight beyond traditional institutions.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has officially begun selling its first-ever assigned seats for flights, marking a significant departure from its long-standing open-seating policy. The cost for selecting a seat will vary depending on the route, travel date, and seat location, potentially adding hundreds of dollars to a trip. For example, a "preferred" aisle or window seat on a February flight from Denver to Orlando could cost an additional $46 each way. This change, along with new baggage fees, aligns Southwest more closely with its competitors and follows pressure from activist investors to maximize revenue.</p>

          <p>The private investment firms of the ultra-wealthy, known as family offices, are increasingly using structured long-term incentive plans to attract and retain top talent. According to a new report, a majority of these firms now offer compensation tied to performance and investment returns, moving away from informal "handshake agreements." For investment-focused family offices, the median total compensation for CEOs has reached $825,000, with those at larger firms earning over $1.2 million. Popular incentives include co-investment opportunities, carried interest, and phantom equity to boost executive pay. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Gen Z's Political Allegiances Are Shifting and Unsettled</h2>

          <p>Recent polling data indicates a complex and evolving political landscape among Gen Z voters in the United States. While their approval of President Trump has dropped significantly since the beginning of his term, this has not translated into a firm swing back toward the Democratic Party. Research from Pew shows that the 18-to-29 age group is more evenly split between the two parties than in previous years, with a large segment identifying as independent. This suggests that the rightward shift seen in 2024 has some durability, but also that these young voters feel unmoored from traditional party structures, making them an unpredictable and up-for-grabs demographic.</p>

          <p>The long-standing 100ml liquid limit for air travel hand luggage is set to be relaxed across the European Union, following the approval of new CT-based scanning technology. These advanced scanners provide high-resolution 3D images, allowing security to detect liquid explosives without passengers needing to remove items from their bags. While the EU Commission has authorized the change, implementation will be up to individual airports and will occur gradually as the new equipment is installed. German airports in Frankfurt and Munich are among those deploying the technology, though a full rollout will take time.</p>

          <p>Veteran actor Brian Cox is starring in "Make it Happen," a new play about the rise and fall of the Royal Bank of Scotland, as the Edinburgh International Festival gets underway. In the biting satire, Cox portrays the ghost of economist Adam Smith, a role he says allows him to protest the conditions that concern him, drawing on his own working-class roots in Dundee. At 79, Cox remains focused on using his platform for protest, stating that he feels a need to advocate for "a better break" for people. The play is a major highlight of the festival, which features thousands of performances across the city.</p>

          <p>Gwyneth Paltrow has appeared in a promotional video for Astronomer, a tech startup recently embroiled in a viral "kiss-cam" scandal involving two of its married executives. In the ad, Paltrow knowingly winks at the controversy while redirecting questions about it to promote the company's data services. The clever marketing spin, which leverages Paltrow's public persona and connection to Coldplay, has been highly effective, turning a potential PR disaster into a major visibility win for the relatively unknown company. The video successfully owned the outrage and generated massive social media engagement for the brand.</p>

          <p>The European Union has confirmed it will begin replacing manual passport stamping with a new biometric Entry/Exit System (EES) for non-EU travelers, including those from the UK, starting October 12. Under the new system, passengers will need to have their fingerprints and facial images scanned to cross an EU border, with the data being registered and stored for three years. The goal is to tighten border security and, eventually, speed up processing times. However, officials have warned travelers to expect potential delays during the initial rollout period as the system is implemented across member nations.</p>

Dalio, who founded the firm in 1975, will continue to serve as a mentor and remain a significant investor in Bridgewater's funds.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Having an emergency savings fund acts as a crucial "security blanket" that helps protect long-term retirement savings, according to new research from Vanguard. The study found that 401(k) investors with at least $2,000 in emergency savings are significantly less likely to take out loans or make hardship withdrawals from their retirement accounts. This is especially important for hourly workers, whose volatile incomes often lead them to tap retirement funds for unexpected expenses. Experts recommend automating savings into a liquid, high-yield account to build this buffer and prevent "leakage" from retirement plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a new initiative to increase representation, the UK government has announced that its main civil service internship scheme will be restricted to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy, driven by Labour minister Pat McFadden, aims to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupation when they were 14. Successful interns will also be fast-tracked for the main graduate Fast Stream program, a move welcomed by social mobility advocates but criticized by some Conservatives as "leftist social engineering."</p>

          <p>In a novel anti-poaching effort, scientists in South Africa have begun injecting rhinos' horns with a harmless radioactive substance. The initiative, known as the Rhisotope Project from the University of the Witwatersrand, makes the horns detectable by radiation monitors at borders and ports, even inside large shipping containers. This aims to disrupt the smuggling of horns, which are highly valued in some Asian markets. After six years of research, the project has confirmed the process is safe for the animals and effective in making the horns traceable, offering a new technological tool to protect the threatened species.</p>
