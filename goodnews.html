        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota's global sales experienced a 10% increase year-over-year in April, according to Kyodo News. This rise occurred amidst concerns about the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. The sales figures reflect strong demand in key markets, potentially driven by consumers anticipating higher prices due to the tariffs. Toyota's performance suggests resilience in the face of looming trade challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS has secured a court ruling allowing it to continue distributing Sony's "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" during its ongoing legal battle with Sony Pictures Television. Sony owns the shows and produces them, but CBS has been the distributor for decades. A Los Angeles judge previously ruled that Sony was no longer obligated to provide episodes to CBS, prompting CBS to appeal. CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As immigration enforcement intensifies in the United States, the Latino community with permanent residency is increasingly seeking naturalization. This trend is driven by a desire for protection against deportation and to promote civic participation in upcoming congressional elections. The USCIS reported over 7.9 million people naturalized in the last decade, and organizations are reporting a surge in applications in 2025. Academics note that this is an opportunity to advance electoral participation and place a counterweight to President Trump in the 2026 elections.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending legal protections for hundreds of thousands of people who entered the United States through Biden-era programs. The order applies to Ukrainians, Afghans, military members and their relatives, and others. Judge Indira Talwani wrote that the termination of these programs was likely unlawful and could sow discord across the country. The decision is a victory for civil and immigrant rights groups, and the judge also certified all those affected as a class.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% surge in its data center business. The company's stock rose in extended trading, and CEO Jensen Huang stated that global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. However, Nvidia's guidance would have been higher without export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. The company said the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is "effectively closed to U.S. industry."</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit and be used as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. Ryosei Akazawa met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ahead of a fourth round of tariff talks in Washington. Ishiba has pledged to support the United States in its efforts to revive the shipbuilding industry amid China's increasing dominance. Japan is hoping to schedule an in-person summit between Ishiba and President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in June. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government has announced that two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire will be fast-tracked in a bid to shore up England's water supplies. The projects have been declared "nationally significant", allowing them to speed through the planning process. The reservoirs are currently pencilled for completion in 2036 and 2040 respectively, and are intended to provide more resilience to future droughts. However, household consumption of water may also need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population.</p>
