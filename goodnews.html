          <h2>Trump Claims Iran-Israel Ceasefire Amid Republican Praise, Democratic Skepticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, sparking immediate praise from Republican lawmakers who lauded his negotiating skills and foreign policy expertise, some even suggesting him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Democrats, however, have been largely silent, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez raising concerns about the legality and constitutionality of the President's actions, particularly the unilateral engagement in military actions without congressional approval. Vice President J.D. Vance described the '12-day war' as an important reset for the region, while Rep. Thomas Massie stated he would not push for a resolution requiring congressional approval for attacks on Iran given the ceasefire. This divergence in reactions underscores the deep political divisions surrounding the administration's foreign policy decisions, especially in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked another Trump administration attempt to restrict international students from attending Harvard University, granting a second preliminary injunction. The order preserves the ability of foreign students to travel to the U.S. for study at Harvard while the case is decided. This action is part of a broader conflict between the administration and Harvard, involving research grant cuts and threats to the school's tax-exempt status. Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security, alleging the administration's actions were retaliation for the university's rejection of demands to overhaul policies related to campus protests and other issues.</p>

          <p>An RBN Energy executive suggests that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions. The analyst argues that closing the strait would harm Iran's own oil exports, making it an unlikely scenario unless the situation escalates significantly. The market appears to agree, as oil prices dropped following reports of Iran's parliament approving the closure. The analyst also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China could damage the U.S.'s reputation as a reliable energy supplier. (not investment advice)</p>
