          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who was pardoned for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon and seeking to have it formally blocked. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative about the events of January 6th. She is working with Senator James Risch to secure formal acknowledgement from the Department of Justice that she will not accept the pardon. Her decision stands in contrast to other January 6th defendants who have embraced their pardons.</p>
