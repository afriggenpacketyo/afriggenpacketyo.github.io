          <p>An advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed strong faith in the Gaza ceasefire framework proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The plan's second phase, which includes the demilitarization of Hamas and deradicalization efforts, is seen as a viable path to long-term security for Israel. The agreement establishes a temporary technocratic administration in Gaza overseen by an international board chaired by Trump. While Israeli military officials believe their strategic pullback compelled Hamas to agree, some experts remain concerned about the plan's vague language regarding enforcement and the high price of releasing dangerous prisoners.</p>

          <p>Egypt's Foreign Minister, Badr Abdelatty, expressed confidence that the first phase of the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan, including a hostage and prisoner exchange, will be implemented. He confirmed that Egypt is actively training Palestinian forces to manage security in Gaza and supports the deployment of an international peacekeeping force under a UN Security Council mandate. Abdelatty emphasized that the ultimate goal must be the realization of a Palestinian state to ensure regional stability. He also highlighted plans for an international conference, co-hosted with the U.S., to address the massive costs of reconstructing Gaza's devastated infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Matt Cross, a newcomer from Lincolnshire, has been crowned the World Conker Champion after defeating the women's victor, Mags Blake, in the final round of the 60th annual competition in Northamptonshire. The event saw increased participation this year, partly due to a cheating scandal involving the previous year's winner, who was ultimately cleared. Organizers overcame a shortage of quality conkers caused by a hot summer, receiving donations from across Europe, including from the royal estate at Windsor Castle. Cross attributed his surprising victory to a combination of force, accuracy, and chance.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the New York Jets 13-11 in a defensively dominated game held in London, extending their winning streak to three. The Jets' offense struggled profoundly, managing only 82 total net yards and a franchise-worst minus-10 passing yards. Despite their offensive woes, the Jets briefly took the lead in the third quarter after a safety. However, a late 27-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Wil Lutz and a final, decisive sack on Jets quarterback Justin Fields secured the victory for Denver, leaving the Jets winless at 0-6.</p>

          <p>Australian captain Alyssa Healy scored a magnificent 142 runs to lead her team to a record-breaking victory over India in the Women's Cricket World Cup. Chasing a formidable target of 331, the highest total ever conceded by Australia in a one-day international, Healy's commanding innings set the stage for the successful pursuit. Despite a late-innings rally from India's bowlers, Australia reached the target with six balls to spare, surpassing the previous record for a women's ODI chase. Healy's performance was a masterclass in composure and skill, guiding the defending champions through a high-pressure situation.</p>

          <h2>Mentally Strong Children Are Raised by Parents Who Avoid These Seven Behaviors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 13:32:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 families, raising mentally strong children involves avoiding common pitfalls like rescuing them from every struggle and modeling perfection. Instead, parents should allow children to face age-appropriate challenges to build resilience, and they should openly apologize for their own mistakes to teach accountability. The article advises validating a child's big emotions rather than dismissing them, praising effort over achievement, and giving children a sense of autonomy through small choices. True strength is fostered by teaching kids to manage feelings, take responsibility, and value rest.</p>

          <p>A trio of Europe's top strikers—Erling Haaland, Harry Kane, and Kylian Mbappé—are currently demonstrating remarkable goal-scoring form for both their clubs and countries. Haaland leads with 21 goals in 12 games, closely followed by Kane with 19, and Mbappé with 17, setting up a competitive race for the European Golden Shoe. While Haaland is the most efficient finisher, statistics show that Kane and Mbappé are more involved in overall team play, with significantly more touches and chances created.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to attend an international peace summit and signing ceremony for the Gaza ceasefire agreement. The summit, led by U.S. President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, marks a significant diplomatic step after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect. Downing Street stated that Starmer will pay tribute to President Trump's role and offer the UK's support for the next phases of the peace process. However, some Israeli officials have criticized the UK's recent actions, suggesting they emboldened Hamas rather than aided the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Amy Poehler hosted the 50th-anniversary episode of "Saturday Night Live," delivering a performance that balanced her signature compassionate humor with sharp satire. Her monologue touched on modern anxieties like AI and economic recession, while a standout sketch kindly satirized the emotional venting of a menopausal mother. Poehler also reprised her political commentary skills in the cold open, portraying Attorney General Pam Bondi, and reunited with Tina Fey and Seth Meyers for a nostalgic "Weekend Update" segment. Her hosting was seen as a stabilizing force for the show, which is currently in a transitional period with new cast members.</p>

          <p>The first phase of the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan is set to proceed with an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners on Monday. Following a ceasefire that began Friday, Hamas is expected to release the remaining 48 hostages, while Israel will free approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The agreement also details a partial Israeli military withdrawal and the deployment of a multinational force to monitor the truce. Subsequent phases, which aim for the complete demilitarization of Gaza and a transition of governance to a reformed Palestinian Authority, face significant hurdles, including Hamas's refusal to disarm.</p>

          <p>Germany has signaled its readiness to provide immediate humanitarian aid and to co-host a conference with Egypt on the reconstruction of Gaza, according to Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. German officials emphasized that any such conference must include Israel and be politically broad, aiming for a long-term two-state solution under a United Nations mandate. The initiative has support within Germany's ruling coalition, which views aiding Gaza's recovery as essential for regional stability and humanitarian reasons. However, the plan faces diplomatic challenges, as illustrated by Israel's sharp criticism of a recent related meeting in Paris.</p>
