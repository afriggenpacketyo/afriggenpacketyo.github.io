          <p>Amazon's Zoox unit issued a software recall for 270 robotaxis following an April crash in Las Vegas. The recall addresses a defect in the automated driving system that could misjudge other cars' movements, increasing crash risks. Zoox paused operations after the incident but has since resumed after implementing a software update across its fleet, including purpose-built robotaxis and test vehicles. The company stated the root cause was identified through analysis and rigorous testing, emphasizing the updated software's widespread implementation.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have finalized a free trade agreement that will significantly lower tariffs on British cars and whiskey exported to India, while also reducing costs for British companies importing Indian clothing and food. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi both hailed the deal as a historic milestone that will boost economic growth and job creation in both countries. India will slash tariffs on 90% of British products, while 99% of Indian exports to the UK will face zero tariffs, fostering greater trade opportunities for both nations.</p>

          <p>Kristi Noem, head of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), clarified that travelers without REAL ID will still be able to fly after the May 7 deadline, but they may face additional scrutiny at TSA checkpoints. While 81% of travelers already have compliant IDs, those without may be diverted to a different line or undergo an extra step. The DHS emphasized that passports and tribal identification will also be accepted, ensuring a seamless transition. Civil rights groups have opposed REAL ID due to privacy concerns, arguing it creates a national identification system.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Hold Rates Steady Amid Mixed Economic Signals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 13:58:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its May meeting, despite pressure from President Trump for a rate cut. The decision comes amid mixed economic signals, including a negative GDP in the first quarter but strong job growth in April. Economists predict the Fed will likely adopt a wait-and-see approach, closely monitoring the impact of tariffs and other administration policies. Borrowers seeking relief on loan and credit card rates are likely to face a wait, with experts predicting potential rate increases in the coming months.</p>

          <p>President Trump said he would "love" to see California Governor Gavin Newsom run for president in 2028, while also criticizing Newsom's handling of the state's high-speed rail project and wildfire management. Trump claimed that his administration provided Newsom with water resources that the governor had refused, asserting that this would have helped prevent the Los Angeles wildfires. He also blasted the high-speed rail project as the "worst cost overrun" he's ever seen and stated that his administration will not provide further funding for it.</p>

          <h2>Syrian Druze Community Embraces Belief in Reincarnation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Sweida, Syria, the Druze community widely accepts the belief in reincarnation, with many individuals recalling vivid details from what they believe to be past lives. One man, Nawaf Nasr, claims to remember being a university student who died in the 1940s, despite never attending school in his current life. This belief in reincarnation serves as a path to spiritual purification for Druze, offering souls a chance to achieve enlightenment through knowledge and good deeds. This belief is one of the reasons that the Druze have been branded by Islamic militants as infidels.</p>

          <p>The FDA has selected Dr. Vinay Prasad, a known critic of COVID-19 vaccine boosters, to head its center for vaccine approvals, a move that has garnered attention due to Prasad's outspoken views on the agency's past decisions. Prasad has criticized the FDA for granting emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccine boosters, and has also questioned the need for COVID vaccinations in young children. His appointment comes as the FDA is considering annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines and may require new randomized trials before approving future updates.</p>
