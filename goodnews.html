          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to address elevated prices of the staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move aims to alleviate shortages in stores that have caused prices to double compared to the previous year. The government maintains a reserve for emergencies, and Koizumi has expressed interest in increasing rice imports to ensure a stable domestic supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan is behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. The report, reviewed by a task force led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, acknowledges that efforts to close gender gaps by 2030 remain insufficient. Japan ranked 118th out of 146 economies in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Index, highlighting the need for increased efforts to promote gender equality. The government plans to step up efforts to ensure women have more opportunities in decision-making roles across various fields.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly in the first five months of the year due to increasing consumer markets, offshore factory investments, and efforts to offset losses from high US tariffs. Shipments to Vietnam increased by 18.8%, while exports to Thailand and Indonesia grew by 20.9% and 16.8%, respectively. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to factories in Southeast Asia for re-export, potentially circumventing US tariffs by incorporating local content into the finished products.</p>

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline" in global fertility rates, with many people unable to have their desired number of children. The report, based on a survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries, cites the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners as key reasons. The UNFPA urges caution in response to low fertility, warning against panicky policies that could lead to manipulative responses. The report also notes that a lack of time is an even bigger barrier to having children than finances.</p>
