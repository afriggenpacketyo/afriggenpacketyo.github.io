          <p>Following days of violent anti-corruption protests that led to the prime minister's resignation, Nepal has appointed its first female leader, former Chief Justice Sushila Karki. The unrest, which resulted in over 50 deaths, was initially sparked by a government ban on social media platforms but grew into a wider movement against political corruption. Karki will lead an interim government tasked with holding general elections within six months, a move aimed at restoring stability to the nation.</p>

They argue that Bitcoin is effectively "gold 2.0" and that its potential to disrupt the traditional gold market is still in its very early stages. Their comments came as their company, Gemini Space Station, prepared for its initial public offering, which valued the firm at $3.3 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major technology companies are racing to turn the science fiction concept of a universal translator into a consumer reality by integrating real-time language translation into their hardware. Apple recently showcased its "Live Translation" feature for the new AirPods Pro 3, which can translate spoken Spanish into English for the listener almost instantly. This move places Apple in direct competition with Google's Pixel phones and Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, both of which have introduced similar AI-powered translation capabilities.</p>

          <p>On the 48th anniversary of his death, South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority announced it will reopen the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko. Biko died in police custody at age 30, with authorities at the time claiming it was due to a hunger strike, a narrative long disputed by his family who saw evidence of torture. This new investigation aims to formally determine if a criminal offense was committed, as no one has ever been held accountable for his death.</p>

          <p>For seniors on fixed incomes facing rising inflation, tapping into home equity can provide crucial funds without the burden of additional monthly loan payments. Options like reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62 and older to borrow against their equity, with the loan repaid only when the home is sold or the owner passes away. Other solutions include home equity sharing agreements, where a company provides cash in exchange for a share of the home's future appreciation, offering liquidity without new debt obligations.

          <p>Pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are set to intensify their rivalry as they both plan to launch daily oral obesity pills in the U.S. next year. This new format could significantly expand the market for GLP-1 medications, which are currently dominated by weekly injections like Zepbound and Wegovy. While Lilly's injectable Zepbound offers higher weight loss, the company is betting that the convenience and easier manufacturing of its pill, orforglipron, will give it a competitive edge.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is capitalizing on a recent drop in Boeing's stock price to increase its position in the aerospace company. Shares fell after CEO Kelly Ortberg acknowledged delays in the 777X aircraft certification process. The club's analysis suggests this is a short-term issue that does not alter the company's long-term cash flow trajectory, presenting a buying opportunity as the company's overall turnaround continues under new leadership.

This vote comes ahead of a summit where several nations are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state, increasing diplomatic pressure on Israel.</p>
