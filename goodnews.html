This move aims to strengthen Eaton's aerospace business amid growing global defense spending, with Ultra PCS projected to generate $240 million in sales in 2025. Meanwhile, Abbott Laboratories received a hold-equivalent rating from Leerink Partners, citing a full valuation, while also gaining Canadian government approval for a rapid blood test to assess suspected concussions. The Abbott test will be used at MotoAmerica races this year, and the company is also facing scrutiny over baby formula claims. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investing $400,000 in an immediate fixed annuity at age 65 could yield substantial monthly payments, but these payouts depend on factors like gender, life expectancy, and the interest rate environment. A 65-year-old male might receive approximately $2,590 per month, while a female of the same age could receive around $2,482. Joint-life annuities offer lower monthly payments, around $2,246, as they continue payments to the surviving spouse. Annuities provide guaranteed income but come with trade-offs, such as limited liquidity and potential loss of purchasing power over time. (not investment advice)</p>
