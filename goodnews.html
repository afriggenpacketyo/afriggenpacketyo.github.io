          <p>Following a proposed peace plan by U.S. President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly ordered the military to cease all offensive operations in the Gaza Strip. According to sources, Israel will now only engage in defensive measures and is preparing to send a negotiating team to discuss the release of all hostages, a top priority for the nation. This move is being made in full coordination with the Trump administration, with Palestinian militant groups like Islamic Jihad also expressing support for Hamas's positive response to the ceasefire proposal.</p>

          <p>England's World Cup-winning full-back, Ellie Kildunne, has stated she is open to considering a move to the proposed new R360 rugby league, though she remains focused on her current contract with Harlequins. Reports suggest that Kildunne is a primary target for the breakaway league and that many of her England teammates have already signed pre-contract agreements. Kildunne acknowledged the growing investment and changes in women's rugby, viewing them as positive developments for the sport's future, but emphasized that details about the R360 league are still limited.</p>

          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes a surprising origin for the iconic bronze Lion of St. Mark in Venice, suggesting it may have been a tomb guardian from China's Tang dynasty. The research, published in *Antiquity*, combines stylistic analysis and lead isotope testing, which points to copper sources in the Lower Yangtze River basin. The theory posits that the statue was transported to Venice and later modified, with the researchers even suggesting Marco Polo's father and uncle could have been responsible for its journey, though some Chinese scholars remain skeptical of the claim.</p>

          <p>The film "The Smashing Machine," starring Dwayne Johnson, chronicles the dramatic life of former MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr, whose career was derailed by addiction to opioids and alcohol. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores Kerr's fall from being the world's top fighter and his subsequent struggles with substance abuse, job instability, and personal relationships. Now sober for years, Kerr reflects on how the decision to allow his darkest moments to be filmed decades ago has led to this cinematic revival of his story, a project championed by Johnson himself.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a conservative nationalist, as its new leader, setting her on course to become the country's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a former economic security minister and an advocate for the "Abenomics" strategy of aggressive fiscal stimulus, inherits a party facing declining public trust due to rising prices. Her nationalistic stances, including visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, may create friction with neighboring countries like China and South Korea, while her economic policies could impact Bank of Japan decisions.</p>

          <h2>Aviation Industry Faces Challenges and Doubts in Transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuels</h2>

          <p>The aviation industry is navigating a difficult path toward its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, with a heavy reliance on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). While the UK and EU have mandated that 2% of jet fuel be sustainable this year, rising to 10% in Britain by 2030, production capacity and cost remain significant hurdles. Some industry leaders, like Ryanair's CEO, express deep skepticism about meeting these targets, citing supply shortages and high prices. Despite setbacks, including Shell halting a major biofuel plant project, proponents argue that government support and investment in new technologies are crucial for making SAF commercially viable.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed "States of Elevation," an audacious endurance project where he summited the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in 31 days. The challenge involved cycling over 3,000 miles between the peaks and running up each one, a feat equivalent to a daily marathon and a Tour de France stage. Jornet, known for his minimalist approach and artistic pursuit of "the most aesthetic line," used the journey not just to test his physical limits but also to explore and raise awareness about the American wilderness and its conservation.</p>

          <p>This article delves into several surprising and often overlooked facts about the Nobel Prize, highlighting its complex history. It covers the Curie family's multigenerational success, Albert Einstein's unawarded theory of relativity, and the persistent myth about why no prize exists for mathematics. The piece also examines controversies, such as the systemic overlooking of female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin, and instances where prizes were awarded for scientific discoveries that were later debunked or deemed harmful, such as the lobotomy.</p>

          <p>A look back at the 1998 BBC documentary "Premier Passions" reveals the raw, behind-the-scenes drama of Sunderland's turbulent 1996-97 Premier League season, which ended in relegation. Former manager Peter Reid recalls his infamous, expletive-filled halftime team talks, acknowledging that such behavior would likely be unacceptable today but was part of the era's culture. The series captured a pivotal moment for the club as it prepared to leave its historic Roker Park stadium, documenting both the on-field struggles and the boardroom efforts to navigate the rapidly commercializing world of top-flight football.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, also known as the Harvest Moon, is set to appear on the night of October 7th. This lunar event will be the largest and brightest full moon of the year so far, kicking off a series of three consecutive supermoons. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth, known as the perigee, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than other full moons. This year's Harvest Moon is notably late, being the latest since 1987.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to interpret Hamas's conditional response to his 20-point peace plan as a full acceptance marks a significant diplomatic shift, placing unprecedented pressure on Israel to end the war in Gaza. This analysis suggests Trump's move is pragmatic rather than ideological, driven by a desire to secure a deal, further his Abraham Accords, and achieve a foreign policy victory. By publicly calling for Israel to immediately halt its bombing, Trump has cornered Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, signaling that the release of hostages is now the paramount goal, even if Hamas has not yet agreed to all conditions.</p>
