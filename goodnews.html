          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan approaches its first "zero giant panda" moment in over half a century, amidst intensifying Sino-U.S. rivalry. With current panda loans expiring, China's decision on whether to send new pandas is anticipated during high-level bilateral talks, potentially during a visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan. While pandas have historically symbolized friendship and brought economic benefits, their diplomatic weight may be diminishing. Some experts believe that China may use a new panda loan to mend relations with Tokyo amidst escalating tensions with the United States.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Encourage Children to Listen</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert identified five phrases that can hinder cooperation and offers alternative language to foster better communication. The expert suggests replacing phrases like "Because I said so" with explanations that respect a child's feelings and providing choices instead of threats. Encouraging emotional expression, inviting problem-solving, and expressing belief in a child's capabilities are also recommended. By creating a safe and respectful environment, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro jabs, a weight loss medication, will be available at GP surgeries in England starting today, but only for those who meet very strict criteria. The first group of patients eligible will be those with a BMI of 40 or over and several related conditions, and they will also receive support with exercise and diet. Some GP practices are warning patients who do not meet the criteria not to book appointments to discuss the jabs. Pharmacy trade organizations are concerned that demand will outstrip supply, and some GPs need training in how to offer the drug safely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. This transformation was driven by government planning, subsidies, and infrastructure development, allowing China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production. While some Western countries view these practices as unfair, Chinese EV executives insist that all companies have access to the same resources. This has fostered a competitive landscape and a culture of innovation, attracting young consumers with affordable and technologically advanced EVs.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to set up a clinic by the end of the year offering ketamine as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe depression. This move comes after a private clinic in Lanarkshire began offering ketamine assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for the routine treatment for depression, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors and psychiatrists. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has previously urged caution over the use of ketamine therapy but it is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>

          <p>Florida Republican congresswoman Kat Cammack attributed the reluctance of hospital staff to administer the drugs she needed to terminate an ectopic pregnancy that endangered her life to left-wing fearmongering. Cammack, who opposes abortion, went to the emergency room and was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, but medical staff were concerned about violating Florida‚Äôs six-week abortion ban. Cammack, who opposes abortion, told the Wall Street Journal she blames messaging from pro-abortion groups for delaying her treatment.
