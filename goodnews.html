        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The integration of artificial intelligence in education is presenting both opportunities and challenges for teachers. Proponents highlight AI's ability to save time on tasks like lesson planning, with one survey indicating teachers save nearly six hours per week. Tech companies are investing in training programs to help educators harness these tools effectively. However, critics raise concerns about the potential for cheating and a decline in students' critical thinking skills. They argue that the focus should be on improving teachers' working conditions directly rather than relying on technological solutions from Silicon Valley.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced the Trump administration will require an equity stake in Intel in exchange for funds from the CHIPS Act. This move converts what was previously a grant under the Biden administration into a non-voting equity position for the American government, aiming to ensure taxpayers benefit from the investment. The decision follows reports that the administration was considering a 10% stake in the struggling chipmaker to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and national security. Lutnick suggested similar equity-for-funding deals could be pursued with other CHIPS Act recipients as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Southern California family and a woman seeking grandchildren have formed a deep connection through an online group called Surrogate Grandparents USA. The Turner family, wanting a grandparent figure for their twin boys, connected with Janet Firestein Daw, whose own children did not plan to have kids. After meeting two years ago, "Nana J" has become an integral part of the family, participating in trips, holidays, and daily life. The relationship has brought a sense of completeness to the Turners and fulfilled Firestein Daw's lifelong wish to be a grandmother, highlighting a growing trend of unconventional family-building.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to gradually resume operations after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, ending a strike that disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers. The strike began over the weekend, with a key issue being unpaid work while planes are on the ground. The union announced the new agreement guarantees pay for this ground time, hailing it as a victory. The airline has cautioned that it may take a week or more to fully restore its regular flight schedule and has asked for customer patience during the transition period.</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to protect their money's buying power, with many top accounts currently providing returns that outpace inflation. While national average yields for CDs are modest, online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some one-year CDs yielding around 4.40% APY. Financial experts suggest that savers consider online banks and shorter-term CDs, which currently feature higher rates due to an inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs—investing in multiple terms—is also recommended as a strategy to balance high short-term returns with long-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose approximately 4% after the company maintained its full-year sales forecast, signaling confidence despite slightly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The retailer reported that big-ticket transactions over $1,000 increased and that sales trends improved each month during the quarter. However, the company noted that many homeowners continue to operate with a "deferral mindset" regarding large projects due to general economic uncertainty. Home Depot is expanding its focus on professional contractors, including through its recent acquisition of SRS Distribution, to drive growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against Key Investment Group, a Maryland-based ticket broker, for allegedly using illegal methods to purchase and resell hundreds of thousands of event tickets for profit. The complaint accuses the company of using thousands of fictitious accounts and spoofed IP addresses to bypass Ticketmaster's purchase limits for high-demand events, including Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. The FTC alleges the company made millions in profit from this scheme, reselling over 2,200 tickets to Swift's concerts alone. The lawsuit claims these actions violate both the FTC Act and the Better Online Ticket Sales Act.</p>

He praised President Trump's commitment to providing security guarantees for Ukraine and welcomed the movement toward a potential meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. Following the summit, Starmer co-chaired a virtual meeting of allies to discuss the deployment of a "reassurance force" should the conflict end. While diplomatic risks and anxiety about Ukraine's future persist, European leaders appear to have collectively endorsed the U.S.-led peace initiative, focusing on strengthening Ukraine's negotiating position.</p>
