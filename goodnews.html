          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a ¬£2 billion upgrade project that began in 2002. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While Welsh ministers tout the economic benefits, critics cite the project's cost and delays, with Plaid Cymru criticizing the funding model as a waste of public money.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government began releasing its stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, offering consumers cheaper alternatives amid soaring rice prices. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were among the first to sell the rice, pricing a 5 kilogram bag at 2,160 yen ($15) including tax. The initiative aims to alleviate the financial burden on households struggling with rising costs. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes this direct approach will be more effective in curbing rice prices than previous auction-based efforts.</p>
