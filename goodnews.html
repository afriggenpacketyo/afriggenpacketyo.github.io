        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Labubu dolls, created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung and sold by Chinese toy maker Pop Mart, have become a global sensation, attracting celebrity endorsements and long queues of eager buyers. The dolls' popularity has significantly boosted Pop Mart's profits, with international sales contributing nearly 40% of total revenue in 2024. Some observers believe Labubu's success reflects the appeal of Chinese creativity and culture on a global scale, despite recent challenges to China's soft power. The dolls' affordability and the trendsetting influence of celebrities like Rihanna and Lisa from Blackpink have contributed to their widespread appeal. </p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden criticized "ongoing efforts to erase history" during a Juneteenth Celebration Service in Galveston, Texas, appearing to reference President Trump. Biden highlighted his role in making Juneteenth a federal holiday and chided attempts to remove history from textbooks and classrooms. He also pointed to efforts during his administration to rename military bases named after Confederate officers, contrasting it with the Trump administration's push to restore the old names. Biden emphasized the importance of remembering the events of Juneteenth and the moral stain of slavery. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. The judge granted a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, arguing that the Department of Transportation lacked the authority to impose such conditions. The ruling blocks the "Duffy Directive," which required states to adhere to an Immigration Enforcement Condition to receive funding. The judge found no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the purposes of the transportation funding. </p>
