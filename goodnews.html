          <p>Catherine Connolly has been elected as the 10th president of Ireland after winning against Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys, becoming the first independent president backed by left-wing parties. Connolly, a TD (member of the Irish parliament) since 2016, secured 63% of first preference votes, the largest amount in Irish presidential election history, and she pledged to be an inclusive president for all. Connolly emphasized her commitment to peace, neutrality, addressing climate change, and recognizing the work being done across the country, as well as expressing her desire to see a border poll on the island of Ireland during her seven-year presidency.

          <p>Timothy Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking family, has been identified as the anonymous donor who contributed $130 million to help cover U.S. military personnel's salaries during the government shutdown. President Trump described the donor as a "great patriot" and a "friend of mine," but did not reveal his name, and Mellon's contribution, while substantial, only amounts to about $100 per service member. Some legal experts suggest the donation might violate the Antideficiency Act, which restricts federal agencies from spending funds not appropriated by Congress, and Mellon has been a long time donor for Trump, contributing $50 million to Trump's super PAC during the 2024 election cycle. The article discusses the controversy surrounding the donation and its potential legal implications.</p>

Barger, who had just returned from seeing his wife after the birth of their third child, found himself without a permanent residence in Toronto, leading to his unconventional sleeping arrangements. His grand slam was the first in Blue Jays' World Series history, adding to a wild week for the player who had also celebrated his team's ALCS victory and the birth of his child.
