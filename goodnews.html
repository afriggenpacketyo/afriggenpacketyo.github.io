          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker, experienced a significant jump in its shares during its Hong Kong debut, raising almost HK$35.7bn.

Despite its reliance on the Chinese market for revenue, CATL is expanding globally, including building factories in Europe and partnering with Stellantis in Spain. However, US lawmakers have expressed concerns about potential national security risks, leading to some investment restrictions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to a two-year low of 3.85% as inflation concerns continue to diminish. This decision aligns with economists' expectations, prompted by a downtrend in Australia's inflation, which recently hit a four-year low of 2.4%. While the RBA aims to keep inflation within its 2-3% target range, it also acknowledges uncertainties in the economic outlook. Despite a recent economic turnaround, analysts highlight downside risks due to global trade tensions and domestic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>In-N-Out Burger is changing its menu after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the FDA's intent to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes.

Additionally, In-N-Out will switch from high fructose corn syrup to real sugar in its ketchup. The move aligns with the Trump administration's goal to eliminate synthetic dyes from the food supply by the end of next year, addressing concerns about neurological problems in children.</p>

          <p>China attracted a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite the ongoing trade war initiated by US President Donald Trump. This inflow contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and the recent downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift reflects changing global investment dynamics, as investors move away from US dollar assets. The report from China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange highlights the country's resilience amid trade tensions.</p>

This rate cut is part of a broader stimulus package, including deposit rate reductions by state-backed commercial lenders.
