          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a rare, large-scale meeting of senior generals and admirals from across the globe to convene at Quantico, Virginia, on short notice. The Pentagon has offered minimal details about the agenda, leading to speculation about its purpose. Theories range from an announcement of the new National Defense Strategy to discussions about Hegseth's previously stated goal of reducing the number of four-star positions by 20%. The unprecedented nature of the summons has drawn attention, with President Trump expressing his approval of the gathering.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to resume issuing airworthiness certificates for some of its new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, a significant step in rebuilding regulatory trust. This authority was revoked in 2019 and 2022 following fatal crashes and production defects, which placed the company under intense scrutiny. The FAA stated the decision follows a thorough review of Boeing's quality control, and its inspectors will now focus on other areas of the production process. The move signals growing confidence in the manufacturer's safety protocols after years of crises.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the 'Rule of Thirds' as a Modern Retirement Income Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 12:57:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention among retirees seeking to ensure their savings last. The rule suggests converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending, balancing security with liquidity. This approach aims to provide a stable, pension-like income stream to reduce stress from market volatility, though it requires careful consideration of interest rates and individual financial circumstances.

          <p>Moldova's Central Electoral Commission has banned the pro-Russian party Heart of Moldova from participating in this weekend's parliamentary elections. The decision follows a court ruling that limited the party's activities amid an investigation into illegal financing. Officials in the pro-European nation, an EU candidate since 2022, have warned that Russia is spending heavily to interfere in the election and sway the outcome. The party's leader, Irina Vlah, was also recently sanctioned by several EU states on suspicion of assisting Russian interference.</p>

Immigration attorneys report a surge in interest from the global wealthy, particularly from China and India, as the new price point is highly competitive with similar "golden visa" programs in other countries. The program, created via executive order, aims to raise federal revenue but faces potential legal challenges over its use of existing immigration frameworks and its fee structure.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is placing immigration at the forefront of his political agenda, a strategic shift aimed at combating the surging popularity of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. In a recent speech, Starmer argued that centre-left parties have been too "squeamish" about border control and announced plans for a mandatory digital ID to curb illegal working. This political analysis suggests the move is a direct response to polls indicating strong support for Reform, framing the upcoming political contest as a "battle for the soul of this country."</p>

She now faces a yearlong recovery involving daily mobile IV treatments and oral antibiotics.
