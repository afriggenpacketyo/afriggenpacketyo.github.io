The article analyzes his on-court skills, noting his strengths at the rim and defensive prowess, while also highlighting areas for development like his mid-range game.

          <p>England's fast bowler Mark Wood has stated he is "quietly confident" about being fit for the first Ashes Test against Australia following a frustrating season sidelined by injury. Wood, who underwent knee surgery in March, has not played since February and missed the entire summer of cricket. He revealed that his rehabilitation has been progressing well at a training camp, with his bowling pace returning to expected levels. With the Ashes series set to begin on November 21 in Perth, Wood is hopeful his performance in practice games will secure his spot for the opening match.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has refused the Trump administration's request to lift an order preventing the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois. The three-judge panel determined that the administration was unlikely to prove a "rebellion" exists that would justify such a move, stating that political opposition and protests do not meet that threshold. The court found the deployment to be a likely violation of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers to the states. This decision maintains a temporary restraining order against the federal government using the Guard within Illinois, a measure President Trump had sought for crime prevention in Chicago.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Greene King, a major UK pub chain, has identified coffee shops and food delivery apps as emerging rivals for the traditional pub industry. Nick Mackenzie stated that these businesses are competing for consumers' leisure time, particularly as a growing number of people, especially younger generations, do not drink alcohol. To adapt, Greene King is improving its coffee offerings and creating more comfortable, food-led environments to attract a broader clientele. Mackenzie also called on the UK government to provide relief by reforming the business rates system, which he argues disproportionately burdens the hospitality industry.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is actively working to establish direct export channels for its fresh durians to China, aiming to significantly increase profits for its growers. Currently, Indonesian durians often transit through neighboring countries like Malaysia and Thailand, which assist with the necessary refrigeration and phytosanitary approvals required by Chinese customs. By developing its own certification processes and cold-chain storage capabilities, Indonesia hopes to bypass these intermediaries. This move would allow the nation to tap more effectively into the massive Chinese market, which consumes over 90% of the world's durian production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's main stock index, the Kospi, achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. This positive performance bucked a broader trend of losses across other Asia-Pacific markets, which were affected by renewed fears in the U.S. banking sector and trade tensions. While Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index led losses in the region, dragged down by technology and energy stocks, the Kospi's resilience highlighted investor confidence in the South Korean economy's trade prospects. The index touched an intraday high of 3,794.87 before closing slightly up. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AC Milan teenager Francesco Camarda is being hailed as a potential future star of Italian football after breaking several age-related records. At just 15, he became the youngest player to debut in Serie A, and he has since become the youngest Italian to score for the under-21 national team. Currently on loan at Lecce, Camarda has demonstrated remarkable composure, strength, and a natural scoring instinct that has drawn praise from coaches and former players alike. While expectations are high, his club and mentors are carefully managing his development to shield him from excessive pressure as he progresses in his promising career.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has expressed skepticism about Marcus Rashford's recent claim that an "inconsistent environment" at the club was to blame for his poor form. Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona, suggested the club's atmosphere hindered his performance. However, Rooney countered that personal application is key and that blaming the environment can be an easy excuse when a player is not performing well. He argued that a player's effort on the pitch, such as running more during games, is a matter of personal responsibility and has nothing to do with the surrounding environment.</p>

          <p>The UK government has begun rolling out a digital identity card for military veterans, which can be downloaded to a smartphone. While physical cards will still be issued, the new digital version is designed to make it easier for the 1.8 million eligible veterans to prove their status and access dedicated services like healthcare support and retail discounts. Ministers suggest the initiative will also serve as a case study for a planned, more comprehensive digital ID scheme for all UK citizens and residents. The digital veteran card will be the first document stored in the government's new One Login app.</p>
