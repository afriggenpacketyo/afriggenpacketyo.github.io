          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, has introduced a new business model that allows it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders, bypassing credit bureaus. This change, aimed at eliminating unnecessary markups, prompted a more than 20% surge in Fair Isaac's stock price. Conversely, shares for major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax declined as investors anticipated a reduction in their role in the mortgage lending process.

          <p>YouTube TV and NBCUniversal have successfully negotiated a new distribution deal, ensuring that millions of subscribers will not lose access to popular channels like NBC, MSNBC, and Bravo. The agreement was reached after the previous pact expired, averting a potential blackout that would have disrupted programming for YouTube TV's nearly 10 million customers. The resolution saw both parties make concessions, with YouTube TV reportedly backing away from demands to include content from the Peacock streaming service at no extra cost.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has decreased compared to earlier in the year. For a $90,000 loan with a 15-year term, the average monthly payment is now approximately $871, down from around $886 in February. While this makes borrowing against home equity more affordable, the article advises homeowners to carefully consider their ability to make payments, as the home serves as collateral for the loan.

          <p>A research team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate a "visual anomaly" they believe is the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, located in a lagoon on Nikumaroro island, was identified in satellite imagery and has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, a year after the aviator's disappearance. If confirmed, the discovery would solve one of history's most enduring mysteries and potentially allow for the plane's recovery and return to the university.</p>
