          <p>Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni strongly refuted what he called "bulls---" narratives suggesting quarterback Jalen Hurts was carried to his Super Bowl championship. Sirianni emphasized Hurts' selflessness and adaptability, stating he will do whatever is necessary for the team to win, whether it involves passing or handing off the ball frequently. He argued that winning in football is a team effort and that no successful quarterback or coach achieves victory without talented players around them. Sirianni praised Hurts as an elite, two-time Pro Bowl quarterback and the MVP of Super Bowl LIX.</p>

          <p>An assault rifle and five high-capacity magazines that fell from a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department vehicle were safely returned by a member of the public. The department issued a news release admitting to the loss and asking for help, detailing the route the deputies had taken. A resident in the Lennox area found the hard-shelled case, initially thinking it might contain a musical instrument, and promptly turned it in at a local sheriff's station. The department expressed deep gratitude for the resident's honesty and integrity, highlighting the crucial role the community plays in maintaining public safety.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Develop New Superalloy Technique to Advance Aircraft Engine Manufacturing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 21:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of aircraft engines, potentially aiding the development of sixth-generation fighters. The breakthrough involves a method for rapidly cooling forged superalloy turbine discs, which are critical components that must endure extreme heat, pressure, and rotational speeds. The quality and durability of these discs have long been a challenge for China's aviation industry. This advancement could help close the technological gap with Western nations in high-performance aircraft engine development.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to deny the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Maxwell's lawyers argue that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement (NPA) should have prevented her prosecution. However, the DOJ contends the agreement was limited to the Southern District of Florida and did not bind other federal districts. The government's brief also states that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary and that prosecutors were not even fully aware of her role when the NPA was negotiated.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has made history by becoming the oldest person to finish the Badwater 135, widely considered the "world's toughest foot race." The 135-mile course starts below sea level in Death Valley and climbs to over 8,300 feet, with runners facing temperatures exceeding 120°F. Becker completed the race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a score after falling just short of the 48-hour cutoff in 2022. He credited his success to his experienced support crew and coaches, demonstrating that age is not a limiting factor in endurance sports.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Martian meteorite on Earth, with an estimated value of up to $4 million. The 54-pound rock, which represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet, was discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023. Scientists believe an asteroid strike dislodged it from Mars, sending it on a 140-million-mile journey through space before it landed on Earth. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, making this a significant event for collectors and providing a valuable dataset for scientists studying the red planet.</p>

Having lost their home and sold off a third of their land, they now live in a new house built on a man-made hill. The article reflects on the broader impact of "whiplash weather" on the region's agriculture, where extreme rain was followed by severe drought, a pattern linked to climate change. While this summer's crops are faring better, farmers like the Obergs and their nephew remain wary of the unpredictable climate.</p>

At the world's largest cancer research conference, nearly a third of drug candidate presentations involved Chinese companies, a dramatic increase from a decade ago. The report, titled "Shopping in China’s Biotech Supermarket," notes that multinational corporations are increasingly looking to partner with or acquire assets from Chinese firms. These deals typically grant global development and marketing rights while Chinese companies retain rights in their domestic market. (not investment advice)</p>

A report that JPMorgan was considering fees for data aggregators like Plaid had caused a sharp decline in fintech stocks. However, analysts from Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley stated the potential costs would be negligible for large platforms and far from "business model-breaking." They noted that major fintechs rely more on debit, credit, or stored balances, and already have long-term pricing contracts in place for account verification services. (not investment advice)</p>

The Faroese prime minister endorsed the idea, noting how tunnels have driven population and economic growth in his country. The multi-million pound project would likely be funded through borrowing and paid back with tolls, a model that could be adopted by other Scottish island communities.</p>
