        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Basketball's EuroLeague is widely regarded as the second-best professional league in the world, trailing only the NBA. Established in 2000 by a group of top European clubs seeking more control, the league operates with a mix of permanent member clubs and wildcard entries, creating a highly competitive environment. The style of play is often described as more tactical and team-oriented than the NBA, partly due to different rules like a smaller court and no defensive three-second violation. While many European stars have transitioned to the NBA, the EuroLeague continues to attract top talent, including former NBA players, solidifying its elite status.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has strengthened into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend. As of early Friday, the storm was located northeast of the Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. While it is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., its development marks it as the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center is also monitoring a second weather system in the Caribbean that could develop into a tropical depression and bring heavy rain to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.</p>

          <p>Sir Menzies Campbell, a distinguished figure in British politics and sports, has died at the age of 84. Known affectionately as Ming, he led the Liberal Democrats from 2006 to 2007 and served as the Member of Parliament for North East Fife for 28 years. Before his political career, he was an accomplished sprinter who represented Great Britain in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and held the UK 100m record. Colleagues from across the political spectrum remembered him as a principled and respected parliamentarian, particularly for his strong opposition to the Iraq War, and as a true liberal giant.</p>

          <p>Private holding company Ames Watson has purchased approximately 1,000 stores of the recently bankrupt tween retailer, Claire's, in a $140 million deal. The new owners assert that while the business operations were flawed, the brand itself remains strong and popular among its target audience. Their revitalization strategy includes modernizing merchandise, increasing employee pay and training, and launching a new marketing campaign focused on nostalgia and customer connection. This approach is modeled on Ames Watson's previous successful turnaround of the hat retailer Lids, aiming to restore Claire's profitability and cultural relevance.</p>

          <p>A UK court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap, due to a procedural error. Ó hAnnaidh was charged after allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization, during a concert in London. The chief magistrate ruled that the charge was brought unlawfully because the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General was not obtained within the six-month statutory time limit. Following the ruling, Ó hAnnaidh stated that the case was a politically motivated attempt to silence his advocacy regarding Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Bill Introduced to Allow Affordable Housing on Religious Land</h2>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the Faith in Housing Act, has been introduced in the U.S. Congress to help religious institutions build affordable housing on their property by overriding restrictive local zoning laws. This "Yes in God's Backyard" (YIGBY) movement aims to address the national housing crisis by unlocking millions of acres of underutilized land owned by churches, synagogues, and mosques. While similar initiatives have seen success in states like California, they have faced opposition elsewhere from local governments protective of their zoning authority. The federal legislation seeks to create a national framework to facilitate these projects and provide much-needed housing for low-income families.</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, health officials in the UK are warning of a potential seasonal increase in both flu and COVID-19 infections, urging eligible individuals to get vaccinated. Differentiating between the two viruses can be challenging, as they share many symptoms like fever, cough, and fatigue, though flu often has a more sudden onset with body aches. While many COVID-19 cases now present with cold-like symptoms, a hoarse throat has become a notable feature of recent variants. Public health agencies emphasize that vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe illness and hospitalization from both viruses, especially for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power across Africa through a growing network of Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture. These government-run centers, now present in 49 African countries, offer language courses and cultural programs, attracting students with scholarships and the prospect of jobs with Chinese companies. However, critics raise concerns about the institutes' role in spreading Chinese political ideology, potentially undermining academic freedom at host universities. Analysts suggest this cultural expansion is intertwined with China's economic interests, including access to the continent's vast natural resources, and call for African nations to establish clearer rules of engagement.</p>

          <p>A submersible expedition in Germany's Luebeck Bay has discovered that unexploded Nazi-era bombs on the seafloor are teeming with vibrant marine life. Researchers were surprised to find dense populations of organisms, including marine worms, mussels, and algae, covering the munitions, which include V-1 cruise missiles. In a particularly unusual observation, dozens of starfishes were found clustered directly on an exposed chunk of TNT. This discovery highlights how artificial structures, even deadly ones, can become crucial habitats in areas where natural hard surfaces have been removed, demonstrating nature's remarkable ability to adapt and thrive in unexpected environments.</p>

          <p>A coordinated operation by Interpol across 14 African countries has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of involvement in romance scams and sextortion. The sting targeted criminal networks that use digital platforms to defraud victims, who collectively lost an estimated $2.8 million. The operation, which took place over the summer, led to the identification of over 1,400 victims and the seizure of electronic devices and forged documents. Authorities in countries like Ghana and Senegal uncovered sophisticated schemes where scammers impersonated celebrities or used blackmail to extort money, highlighting the growing threat of digital-enabled crime on the continent.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's remarks linking Tylenol to autism, medical experts are clarifying the existing research and providing nuanced guidance for pregnant individuals. Researchers and physicians emphasize that while some studies suggest a potential association, a causal link has not been established, and untreated fevers during pregnancy pose definite risks to a fetus. The consensus among medical professionals, including the FDA and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is that acetaminophen (Tylenol) remains the safest option for treating fever and severe pain during pregnancy. They advise judicious use under a doctor's supervision rather than complete avoidance.</p>

          <p>Robert “Rabbit” Jaramillo, a founding member of the influential 1960s East L.A. rock group Cannibal and the Headhunters, has passed away at the age of 78. The band was a key part of the Chicano rock scene and scored a national hit with their version of "Land of 1,000 Dances." Their success led them to open for The Beatles on their 1965 U.S. tour, bringing their energetic, brown-eyed soul sound to a massive audience. Though the band's time in the national spotlight was brief, Jaramillo and his bandmates left a lasting legacy as trailblazers for Mexican American musicians in rock and roll.</p>
