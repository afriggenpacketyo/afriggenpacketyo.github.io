          <p>China is expanding avenues for foreign institutions to utilize the yuan, aiming to diminish reliance on the U.S. dollar as global confidence in the greenback wanes. These initiatives include establishing a digital yuan internationalization center in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Foreign institutions can now trade additional futures and options contracts in mainland China, encompassing commodities like natural rubber, lead, and tin. Despite Beijing's efforts, some analysts express concerns about China's rule of law and geopolitical risks, which could hinder widespread adoption of the yuan. (not investment advice)</p>

Protesters plan further demonstrations on Venice's canals, bridges, and streets to disrupt the event. The wedding and parties are expected to cost ‚Ç¨40 to ‚Ç¨48 million, while Bezos will donate ‚Ç¨1 million to Corila, an academic consortium studying Venice's lagoon ecosystem. </p>

          <p>Childhood vaccinations have averted an estimated 154 million deaths over the past 50 years, however, efforts to boost vaccination rates have stalled or reversed in many places since 2010. The COVID pandemic was a major hurdle for vaccination efforts, and health care professionals were diverted from vaccination efforts. The researchers estimate that the number of kids in India who got their first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine in 2023 was 93%, which is near levels in some high-income countries. The number of children born each year is expected to shrink by about 1.6% between now and 2030, but that matters for vaccination efforts. </p>

The discovery promises to shed light on the evolutionary history that saw early small dinosaurs become very large and "bizarre" animals. The fossilized remains are the most complete of any in the world for early small dinosaurs. </p>
