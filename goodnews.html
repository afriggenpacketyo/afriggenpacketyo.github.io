          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court emphasized that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, while global markets have responded positively to the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly released an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, intensifying competition with OpenAI. The company did not make an official announcement, but the upgrade was released on AI model repository Hugging Face. DeepSeek gained prominence this year after its free, open-source R1 model outperformed rivals, sparking concerns that U.S. tech giants were overspending on infrastructure.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that purchases of U.S. defense equipment may help reduce the trade deficit, potentially serving as a bargaining chip in tariff talks. However, he emphasized that tariff negotiations and security matters are based on different logic and should not be mixed. Japan seeks the withdrawal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, steel, and aluminum, as well as a "reciprocal" tariff. The Trump administration has resisted completely removing the levies, leading Japan to consider lower duty rates for a trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>
