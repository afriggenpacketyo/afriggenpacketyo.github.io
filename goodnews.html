          <p>IBM reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, driven by strong growth in its software and infrastructure segments. The company's revenue increased by nearly 8% year-over-year, with its hybrid cloud division showing 16% growth. Despite the positive results, IBM's shares experienced a slight decline in after-hours trading. The technology firm maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating over $13.5 billion in free cash flow and revenue growth of at least 5%. (not investment advice)</p>

However, Alphabet announced it is raising its projected capital expenditures for 2025 by $10 billion, to a new total of $85 billion.

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a comprehensive "AI Action Plan" designed to bolster U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence by removing regulatory hurdles and promoting infrastructure development. The plan includes over 90 policy actions, such as expediting data center construction and reviewing federal rules that might hinder AI innovation. It also aims to eliminate what the administration calls "ideological bias" from AI systems and promote the export of American AI technology to allies. Critics argue the plan prioritizes corporate interests over public safety.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat in 2026, ending speculation about a potential run for New York governor. Lawler stated that after deliberation, he concluded that running for reelection was the best decision for his family and his district. His decision solidifies the GOP's effort to defend a key seat that was crucial to their House majority in the past two elections. The announcement leaves the field of potential Republican challengers to incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul more open, with Representative Elise Stefanik still considering a run.</p>

          <p>Elite cyclists competing in the grueling Tour de France are powered by a significant nutritional strategy centered on high carbohydrate intake. According to exercise metabolism researcher Tim Podlogar, these athletes consume thousands of calories daily, with a heavy emphasis on carbohydrates to sustain their extreme levels of physical exertion over the multi-week race. This approach, often referred to as a carbohydrate revolution, is critical for performance, allowing cyclists to maintain energy levels and recover effectively between stages. The science of sports nutrition has become a key element in achieving success in professional cycling.</p>

Playing in his first Test match in eight years, the 35-year-old left-armer made an immediate impact against India, dismissing opener Yashasvi Jaiswal early and providing crucial control for England's bowling attack. Dawson, who has a stellar domestic record, was recalled to the side due to an injury to Shoaib Bashir. Vaughan argued that Dawson's all-around package of control, batting ability, and fielding is exactly what the current England side needs.</p>

Torres, who grew up in public housing, emphasized the need for pragmatic, results-oriented governance over ideological sloganeering.

The deal sets a 15% tariff on most Japanese imports, a reduction from the 25% previously threatened, and is expected to open Japan's market to more U.S. products like cars and agricultural goods. The announcement provided a political lifeline for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who faced pressure to resign after recent election losses.
