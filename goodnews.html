        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the fourth Test at Old Trafford, India demonstrated strong resistance against England, closing the fourth day at 165-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After losing two early wickets, an unbroken partnership between KL Rahul (87) and Captain Shubman Gill (78) blunted the English attack. Earlier, England's captain Ben Stokes scored his first century in over two years, a knock of 141, helping his team to a formidable total of 669. Despite England remaining favorites to win the series, India's determined batting has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

          <p>A Japanese nutritionist visiting a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, was impressed by the extensive selection of traditional and healthy Japanese foods not commonly found in U.S. stores. The article highlights six categories of 'longevity foods' she found remarkable, including a wide variety of seaweeds like mozuku and nori, and numerous soy-based products such as freeze-dried tofu. The store also offered a rich assortment of seasonal Japanese produce, ready-to-eat healthy meals, traditional rice crackers, and a vast selection of green tea products, reflecting staples of the Japanese diet.</p>

          <p>In a closely watched recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature. The KMT and its allies currently form a majority bloc, which has resisted President Lai Ching-te's agenda. The failure of the recall effort means Lai's government will likely continue to face strong legislative opposition, reinforcing political stability but also potential gridlock ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogacar is set to win his fourth Tour de France after maintaining his overall lead through the penultimate stage. Australian sprinter Kaden Groves won the 20th stage with a solo attack, marking his first victory in the prestigious race. Pogacar finished safely within the peloton, meaning he will almost certainly secure the championship during the final, largely processional stage in Paris. Barring any unforeseen accidents, his victory will be confirmed, capping a dominant performance throughout the competition and cementing his place among cycling's elite.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs this week, fueled by positive developments in trade negotiations and a strong start to the second-quarter earnings season. The market was particularly boosted by President Trump's announcement of a "massive" trade agreement with Japan. So far, a third of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, with 80% beating expectations. The focus now shifts to upcoming trade talks with China and the European Union, as well as a heavy slate of earnings reports from major tech companies next week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris has claimed pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, narrowly beating his teammate Oscar Piastri in a dramatic qualifying session. Norris set his fastest time on his first lap in the final session, and while Piastri improved on his second run, a late mistake cost him the top spot. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start third, just ahead of four-time champion Max Verstappen, who was unhappy with his car's balance and a wheelspin moment that cost him time. Rain is expected for Sunday's race, which could lead to chaotic and unpredictable conditions.</p>

          <p>The New York-based chain 7th Street Burger is gaining recognition as a formidable competitor to Five Guys, offering high-quality smash burgers with a simplified, efficient model. The article highlights that 7th Street Burger uses fresh, never-frozen beef and the same popular buns as Shake Shack, but at a significantly lower price point. A cheeseburger at 7th Street costs $6.50 compared to $9.89 at Five Guys. The chain's success is attributed to its streamlined menu of only three items, which increases efficiency and keeps costs down for consumers without sacrificing quality.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old man, Christopher Kennedy, has made a remarkable recovery after receiving a double-lung transplant for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal disease. Initially given less than a year to live, Kennedy was a promising candidate for the procedure despite his age. After a successful surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, his lung capacity is now at 98%, allowing him to return to an active life. He is now training a new Bernese Mountain dog, named Encore, as a hospital therapy animal to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>A potential visit to China by U.S. President Donald Trump is not expected to happen in September, but both Washington and Beijing are reportedly working to arrange a trip for October or November. According to sources familiar with the matter, high-level officials from both countries share a consensus on the visit, though some hurdles remain. A meeting could occur before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. The discussions follow a recent meeting between the two nations' top diplomats, which was described as "better than expected" and a positive step.</p>

          <p>A Russian woman named Irina Krynina has moved to Ukraine to assist Russian prisoners of war after her own partner was captured fighting for Russia. Krynina now runs a project called "Our Way Out," which helps relatives contact captured soldiers, delivers parcels, and records interviews to prove they are alive. She says she was against the war and became disillusioned with the Russian state after learning the reality of the conflict.
