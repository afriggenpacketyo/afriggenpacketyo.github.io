          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a surge after President Trump approved the merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president "total control," though the specific powers remain unspecified. Senator Dave McCormick suggested the golden share would provide the U.S. government with control over several board seats and ensure production levels are maintained. U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, pending customary closing conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Most countries have agreed to set goals to prevent the planet from overheating, as demonstrated by Kenya's commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2035.

Climate targets, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), are crucial for the Paris Agreement, aiming to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. While 22 countries have submitted their latest climate goals, many are still finalizing their plans, considering political realities and national priorities.</p>

Bilateral meetings between Trump and other leaders seeking trade deals are expected, but the likelihood of significant agreements remains uncertain.

          <p>Airbus has surpassed Boeing as the leading planemaker due to Boeing's safety record and technical issues. Boeing reported an operating loss of nearly $11.8 billion in 2024, delivering fewer commercial airplanes than Airbus. The Air India crash is the latest setback for Boeing, while Airbus has managed its aircraft production more effectively. The rivalry between the two companies extends to government subsidies and competition in space and defense manufacturing, with China's Comac emerging as a potential competitor.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Hawaii are using drones to release live mosquitoes in remote forests as a method to combat avian malaria and save endangered honeycreepers. The mosquitoes are male and contain a bacteria called wolbachia that prevents reproduction, reducing the population of biting mosquitoes. This approach aims to protect the remaining honeycreeper species that are threatened by the spread of malaria due to climate change. The method has been successful in other parts of the world in reducing mosquito populations that spread diseases among humans.</p>

          <p>Some conservative figures are encouraging women to pursue both motherhood and careers, challenging traditional views that prioritize domesticity. They argue that women are capable of succeeding in both roles and express frustration with those on the right who encourage full-time housekeeping. These figures embrace progressive-leaning views on family policy, such as federal parental leave and remote work. This shift reflects a practical calculation that limiting women to a kids-or-career choice won't boost fertility rates or discourage abortion.</p>

Many low-cost tools are available to reduce methane emissions, but they are underutilized, particularly in the United States.</p>
