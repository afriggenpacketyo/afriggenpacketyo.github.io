          <p>Members of the 1960s British band The Zombies are looking back on their unconventional path to fame, which saw their iconic album "Odessey and Oracle" initially fail upon release in 1968. The band, known for hits like "She's Not There," actually broke up due to financial struggles and a lack of commercial success before their song "Time of the Season" became a major hit a year later. Decades after their peak, the album is now critically acclaimed as a masterpiece, and the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, cementing their legacy after a long and bumpy journey.</p>

          <p>China is implementing a new industrial "pull" system designed to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency of car manufacturing. This approach aims to address the projected exponential growth in global space activity by ensuring consistent quality, lower costs, and greater flexibility. Unlike the traditional "push" system based on forecasts, the new model has final assembly stages pull components from suppliers on an as-needed basis. This shift is intended to eliminate production delays and inventory issues, positioning China to dominate the future of scalable space production.</p>

          <p>An increase in shopping center vacancies, which rose to 5.8% nationally in the second quarter of 2025, is creating rare real estate opportunities for small and local businesses. As national chains close stores, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms with independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses that were previously priced out of prime locations. While overall rents are still rising, the rate of increase has slowed, allowing entrepreneurs to secure spaces in desirable areas. This trend is helping to revitalize commercial corridors and diversify the retail landscape.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, resolving the $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit filed against him for spreading false claims about the 2020 presidential election. As Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani was a prominent figure in promoting the conspiracy theory that Dominion's machines were rigged. This settlement follows Dominion's previous high-profile resolutions with Fox News for $787.5 million and Newsmax for $67 million over similar defamatory statements. The legal consequences have been severe for Giuliani, who has also been disbarred in New York and Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election, as part of its broader goal to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced that a taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The plan, central to Labour's economic growth strategy, emulates the post-war Attlee government's new town developments. However, the pledge faces challenges, including rising industry costs and concerns from local residents who feel uninformed about the scale of the projects.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Latinos in the U.S. are installing personal air quality sensors to gather local data on pollution in their neighborhoods, which are disproportionately affected by toxic air. This community-led initiative, supported by groups like the Hispanic Access Foundation, aims to fill data gaps left by official government monitoring and advocate for regulatory action. From industrial hubs in Los Angeles to agricultural areas in Idaho, residents are tracking harmful pollutants like PM2.5, which are linked to asthma and other serious health issues. The effort comes as the Trump administration moves to roll back numerous environmental protection regulations.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its cultural and diplomatic influence in Africa by establishing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) centers, with new facilities recently opening in Tunisia and Chad. These centers are part of a long-standing health diplomacy strategy where Beijing sends medical teams and promotes TCM to build goodwill on the continent. The new facility in Tunisia, located at a university hospital, is a result of recent health cooperation agreements between the two nations. This expansion of TCM across Africa is a key component of China's broader strategy to enhance its soft power through cultural and health-related exchanges.</p>
