          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart's shares surged over 12% after reporting a near-400% rise in net profit, fueled by global demand for its Labubu dolls. The company's revenue jumped 204.4% year-on-year to 13.88 billion yuan for the first half of 2025. Despite concerns from analysts about the long-term popularity of its IPs and regulatory scrutiny on "blind boxes," the firm's CEO expressed confidence in reaching ambitious revenue targets. Pop Mart's international expansion, particularly in Asia-Pacific and the Americas, significantly contributed to its robust performance.</p>

Welsh Fire, suffering their fifth consecutive defeat, struggled with an underwhelming batting performance despite Sophia Dunkley's positive start. Brave's bowlers, notably Lauren Bell and Sophie Devine, expertly controlled the innings, setting up their team to potentially secure a spot in the Eliminator.</p>

          <p>A TikTok gardener, JennieGardens, warns homeowners about the destructive potential of invasive Asian Wisteria, which can be mislabeled and kill other plant species, including trees. While native wisteria varieties are less harmful, the Asian type poses a significant threat to biodiversity by crowding out other plants. The article encourages rewilding yards or planting native species like clover or buffalo grass as alternatives. These native options require less water and fertilizer, saving money while also supporting pollinators essential to the food chain.</p>
