          <p>DoorDash reported strong first-quarter revenue, driven by an increase in total orders and grocery delivery demand, despite concerns about the U.S. economy. The company is set to acquire Britain's Deliveroo to expand its presence in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Additionally, DoorDash is purchasing SevenRooms, a hospitality management software company, to enhance its offerings to merchants and improve customer relations. Despite rising revenue, the article notes that DoorDash shares fell after the report, indicating investor hesitation, even as the company expands into new markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases as the reason for his decision. This opposition from a key Republican senator jeopardizes Martin's chances of confirmation, as it could lead to a tie vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, preventing the nomination from moving forward.</p>

          <p>During an Oval Office meeting with President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney asserted that Canada is "not for sale" in response to Trump's repeated suggestions of acquiring Canada and merging it with the U.S. Trump has romanticized the idea of eliminating the border between the two countries, citing potential economic benefits for Canada. Despite Carney's firm rejection, Trump insisted that it would not affect trade negotiations, but added, "never say never." The article also highlights tensions between the two countries due to tariffs and differing views on trade relations.</p>

          <p>J's Grocery, a Black-owned supermarket in Clarksdale, Mississippi, has reopened after renovations to include fresh produce, aiming to combat food insecurity in the primarily Black town. The project is a collaboration between the store owner, local farmers, and organizations like Partnership for a Healthier America and Rootswell. The store also features a seated area surrounded by raised herb beds, creating a community gathering space. The initiative seeks to address the lack of access to fresh, culturally relevant food in the Mississippi Delta, where much of the farmland is dedicated to export-bound commodity crops.</p>

          <p>Financial experts recommend limiting credit card spending, especially with high interest rates and compounding debt, suggesting that consumers only spend what they can comfortably pay back each month. For a credit limit of $1,000, experts advise keeping spending below $300 to maintain a healthy credit utilization ratio. By keeping credit usage low, borrowers can improve their credit scores and access lower interest rates on future loans. The article emphasizes the importance of responsible credit card use to avoid accumulating unmanageable debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK and India have reached a trade agreement after three years of negotiations, aimed at boosting trade between the two nations by an estimated ¬£25.5 billion annually by 2040. The agreement will reduce tariffs on UK exports like whisky and cars to India, while lowering taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. While Prime Minister Starmer hailed the deal, opposition leaders have raised concerns about the terms, particularly regarding exemptions from National Insurance contributions for some workers.</p>

The plan includes adding 100,000 appointments in GP surgeries, permanently banning peak rail fares, and ending the alcohol ban on ScotRail trains. While the government touts these measures as improvements, critics argue they don't adequately address the challenges facing the NHS and the broader issues of child poverty and the cost of living.</p>
