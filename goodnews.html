          <p>A recent summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation underscored a potential shift in the global order but notably lacked a foundational economic agreement akin to the historic Bretton Woods system. The article argues that for the SCO's political and strategic goals to be realized, a new multilateral monetary and economic framework is essential to prevent further global fragmentation into competing blocs. With 27 members and partners, including China, Russia, and India, the SCO has the potential to lead such an initiative, but the task requires immense effort from both Eastern and Western powers to succeed.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has marked his official entry into adulthood, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his ceremony renews focus on Japan's male-only succession law, which currently excludes the Emperor's daughter, Princess Aiko, from the line of succession. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the imperial family faces a potential crisis, prompting a national debate over whether to allow female succession or re-integrate distant male relatives into the royal line.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, but the occasion is shadowed by political attacks from Germany's far-right AfD party. The AfD has criticized the movement for promoting "globalist uniformity," echoing the "degenerate art" rhetoric used by the Nazis who shut the school down in 1933. Despite these challenges, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its centennial program, focusing on the evolution of materials and sustainable design while forming alliances to counter the rising far-right cultural pressure.</p>

          <p>A writer recounts their journey of becoming a Buffalo Bills fan after never having an interest in sports, discovering that team allegiance is deeply connected to community and identity. The essay explores how the Bills embody the spirit of Buffalo, a city with a history of resilience and a reputation for being a perennial underdog. The shared experience of supporting the team, through both near-triumphs and heartbreaking losses, forges a powerful bond among fans that transcends geography and creates a profound sense of belonging and home.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new long-term compensation plan for Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The package, which requires shareholder approval, would grant Musk up to 12% of Tesla's stock over a decade if the company achieves extremely aggressive growth targets, including a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion. The board presented the plan as a necessary incentive to retain Musk and ensure his focus on turning Tesla into an AI and robotics leader, though it has raised concerns about corporate governance.

          <p>Scotland secured a valuable point in their World Cup qualifying campaign with a hard-fought draw against Denmark in Copenhagen. Manager Steve Clarke praised his team's work rate and grit in a performance that puts one of their main group rivals on the back foot early in the competition. The result is seen as a promising, if understated, start, giving the team a solid foundation as they aim to qualify for their first World Cup since 1998, a contrast to many previous campaigns that often began with early defeats.</p>

          <p>The article reflects on the 30th anniversary of Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita's legendary "scorpion kick" save during a friendly match against England at Wembley. This audacious move became his defining moment, but it was just one part of the story of "El Loco," a pioneer who redefined his position by playing far from his goal and scoring 43 career goals. The piece also delves into his complex life, including his time in prison for involvement in a cartel kidnapping, which ultimately kept him out of the 1994 World Cup.</p>

The decision safeguards the ability of approximately 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians to continue living and working legally in the U.S. while their home countries face dangerous conditions.</p>
