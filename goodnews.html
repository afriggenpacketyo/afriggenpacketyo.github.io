          <p>Shares in Japan's SoftBank Group surged by 13%, marking their best performance in five years and reaching a new record high. This follows the company's fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, which significantly exceeded market expectations and marked a second consecutive profitable quarter. The gains were largely driven by a $4.8 billion increase in the value of its Vision Funds, buoyed by strong performances from portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy. Several other portfolio companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, are also expected to go public soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued another nationwide injunction blocking President Trump's executive order that seeks to limit birthright citizenship. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy, which aims to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens or are in the country on temporary visas. The judge certified the case as a class action, a legal pathway left open by a recent Supreme Court ruling that had otherwise limited nationwide injunctions. The ruling affirms that plaintiffs are likely to win their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment.</p>

          <p>New South Wales politician Gareth Ward has resigned from parliament just before a vote was scheduled for his expulsion. Ward was recently convicted of sexually assaulting two men and is currently in custody awaiting sentencing. He had launched an unsuccessful legal challenge to prevent his removal from office, arguing it was an "affront to democracy" before his appeals process was finished. His resignation, which state leaders said should have come sooner, triggers a by-election for the seat he has held since 2011.</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been officially recorded in the UK for the first time. A female of the species was photographed by a volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk. According to the charity Butterfly Conservation, this species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe over the past two decades, moving at a rate of about 100 kilometers per year. While a warming climate is believed to be a factor, it is not yet clear if the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials, are reportedly moving away from dating apps and returning to old-fashioned, in-person singles events. Organizers of such events, like Date Cincy in Cincinnati, are seeing a surge in popularity as individuals seek more genuine face-to-face connections. This trend coincides with a significant drop in the stock value of dating app Bumble and data from Eventbrite showing a 42% rise in attendance at dating events from 2022 to 2023. Participants cite frustration with the superficiality of online profiles and a desire for the authentic chemistry that can only be found in person.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. The celebrity chimp was later discovered by animal rights group PETA in a small cage and relocated to a sanctuary. Haddix's sentencing is seen as a victory for animal welfare advocates who have long campaigned against the private ownership and trade of primates.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, showed significant efficacy in a late-stage clinical trial. Participants with obesity lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with a safety profile similar to existing injectable GLP-1 therapies. Common side effects included nausea and constipation, leading about 10% of participants on the highest dose to discontinue the medication. The company plans to submit the daily pill for regulatory approval later this year, potentially offering a more accessible alternative to current treatments. (not investment advice)</p>
