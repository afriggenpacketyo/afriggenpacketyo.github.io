          <p>A study led by China suggests that a global interconnected solar-wind energy network could meet the world's energy demands by 2050. This system would produce three times the needed power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The researchers highlight the potential for an international renewable energy market by optimizing solar and wind deployment. However, they acknowledge that geopolitical boundaries and crises, like the Ukraine war, present challenges to establishing such a network, though the team said setting up such a system must navigate geopolitical boundaries and crises such as the Ukraine war.</p>

The $321.1 billion budget deal reflects resistance to Governor Newsom's proposed cuts, citing uncertainty about the state's financial problems. The agreement relies on borrowing money, tapping into state reserves, and shifting funding to address a $12 billion deficit. Key elements include a housing caveat requiring CEQA exemptions, changes to Medi-Cal funding, and the preservation of funding for film and television tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Michael Conforto had a strong performance in the Dodgers' win against the Rockies, hitting a double and a three-run home run. This marked his first multi-hit game since May 27 and his first game with multiple RBIs this season. The Dodgers have remained optimistic about Conforto's ability to improve, and this performance could be a turning point. The Dodgers will soon be facing the MLB trade deadline and this recent game from Conforto could help solidify his place in the team.</p>

          <p>China is expanding ways for foreign institutions to use the yuan, as international confidence in the U.S. dollar weakens. These efforts aim to challenge the dollar's dominance, with the People's Bank of China discussing strategies to reduce reliance on a single sovereign currency. Recent moves include setting up a digital yuan internationalization center and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Despite these efforts, the U.S. dollar remains the world's predominant currency, and China faces challenges in presenting itself as a fully dependable alternative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant political upset. Cuomo, the former governor, was attempting a comeback after resigning amid a sexual harassment scandal. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, secured a commanding lead, although short of the 50% needed to win outright. Cuomo's concession was unexpected, and he may run in the general election on an independent line.</p>

          <p>A controversial proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands in Western states was removed from a Republican tax and spending bill due to Senate rules. The plan, advanced by Senator Mike Lee, aimed to sell up to 3.3 million acres of public land for housing needs. The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal violated the Byrd Rule. While the plan was initially scuttled, Lee is attempting to revise the proposal, but environmentalists and public land advocates remain vigilant. </p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidates, Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo, are facing off in a primary election viewed as a test for the Democratic Party. Mamdani, a left-wing candidate, has gained momentum, challenging Cuomo, the former governor. The race highlights the internal divisions within the Democratic Party, with Mamdani advocating for progressive policies and Cuomo emphasizing experience. Mamdani's rise has been attributed to his focus on affordability and support from younger voters, while Cuomo relies on name recognition and support from older and Black voters.</p>

          <p>New York mayoral candidates face off in test of Democratic Party. After Donald Trump's stunning 2024 presidential victory - where he made inroads in reliably liberal New York City - a millennial New York state assemblyman had a question. ‚ÄúWhat would it take for you to vote for a Democrat in the future?‚Äù Zohran Mamdani asked Bronx and Queens residents who either swung for Trump or didn't vote. His platform includes free public buses, universal childcare, freezing rent in subsidized units, and city-run grocery stores. The race is being watched, not just by New Yorkers, but by Democrats across the country.</p>
