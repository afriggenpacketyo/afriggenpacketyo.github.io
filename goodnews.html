          <p>Government data reveals that Japan's child population has fallen for the 44th straight year to a new record low of 13.66 million, indicating the country's ongoing struggle with a declining birth rate. The ratio of children to the overall population also decreased to 11.1 percent, the lowest since 1950. Despite government initiatives to provide financial assistance and expand daycare services, the decline continues, with the 0 to 2 age group significantly smaller than the 12 to 14 age group, highlighting the severity of the demographic challenge. Japan has the second-lowest ratio of children among nations with a population of at least 40 million, only ahead of South Korea.</p>

          <p>As the US and Iran engage in nuclear talks, Iran's opposition remains cautiously optimistic, though divided on the best path to regime change. While some, like Reza Pahlavi supporters, advocate for foreign intervention, others, like historian Arash Azizi, emphasize that change must come from within. A diplomatic resolution leading to sanctions relief and economic openness is seen as positive, potentially fostering more freedom for pro-democratic activities. However, skepticism remains regarding the influence of Iranians in the diaspora, and concerns persist that military action could destabilize the country.</p>

          <p>Chinese government scientists report a successful weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where cloud-seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4 percent across more than 8,000 sq km in a single day. The operation generated 70,000 cubic meters of precipitation using just 1kg of silver iodide. The test, conducted by the China Meteorological Administration, was detailed in a peer-reviewed paper published in the journal Desert and Oasis Meteorology.

          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the original vote in November was annulled due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The annulled vote saw far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round, but he is now banned from standing. George Simion, an ally of Georgescu, is expected to progress to a second-round run-off, while pro-Western candidates Nicusor Dan and Crin Antonescu are also competing. The election is seen as a test of Romania's pro-Western orientation amid rising right-wing populism.</p>

          <p>The debate over the nutritional value and marketing of baby food pouches has ignited discussions about maternal guilt and societal expectations. While concerns exist regarding the high sugar content and potential lack of nutrition in some pouches, critics argue that the issue is being used to shame mothers and reinforce traditional roles. The article emphasizes the importance of considering social, political, and economic factors, including time constraints and access to resources, when evaluating parents' food choices. It calls for a broader societal approach that supports and facilitates good food choices for families, rather than placing blame on individual mothers.</p>
