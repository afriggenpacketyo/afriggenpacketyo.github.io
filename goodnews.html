          <p>Authorities in Dresden, Germany, evacuated approximately 17,000 people after a 250-kg (500-pound) British bomb from World War II was discovered during construction work. The unexploded ordnance was found near the partially collapsed Carola Bridge, requiring a large-scale operation to safely defuse it. The evacuation zone included historic landmarks like the Frauenkirche, and around 330 police officers were deployed to manage the situation. Such discoveries remain a regular occurrence in Germany, serving as a stark reminder of the war's lasting legacy even 80 years after its conclusion.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook is set to join President Donald Trump at the White House to announce a new $100 billion investment commitment toward manufacturing in the United States. This pledge will increase Apple's total domestic investment to $600 billion over the next four years. The initiative reportedly includes a new "American Manufacturing Program" aimed at bringing more of the company's supply chain and advanced manufacturing processes to the U.S. The announcement follows President Trump's persistent calls for Apple to produce more of its products domestically rather than in countries like China and India.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Realtor.com shows that median home listing prices are declining in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops of nearly 15% and 19% respectively over the last three years. This trend is attributed to higher housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising or stubbornly high prices, creating a divided national housing market where buyer and seller experiences vary greatly by region.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is auctioning the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million, which was seized in 2022. Authorities allege the vessel is owned by sanctioned Russian billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, a claim disputed by a holding company that states it belongs to another, non-sanctioned Russian. The seizure was part of "Operation KleptoCapture," a task force created to enforce sanctions against Russian oligarchs following the invasion of Ukraine. The auction has strict bidding requirements, and the ownership dispute could lead to future legal challenges for the eventual buyer.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Weigh Pros and Cons of Reverse Mortgages Versus Selling a Home for Retirees</h2>

          <p>This article explores the financial options available to homeowners in retirement, focusing on the choice between selling their home and obtaining a reverse mortgage. Experts suggest a reverse mortgage can be a valuable tool for those on a fixed income who wish to stay in their home, as it converts equity into cash without requiring monthly payments. However, it reduces the inheritance for heirs and comes with its own fees and risks. Selling the home offers a lump-sum of cash and the ability to downsize, but may have tax consequences and depends heavily on local market conditions. The best choice depends on an individual's financial situation, location, and personal goals.</p>
