          <p>A fire broke out in a chapel within the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, a UNESCO World Heritage site in southern Spain. Firefighters responded swiftly, preventing what the city's mayor described as a potential catastrophe. The blaze, possibly caused by a short circuit, was contained without major structural damage to the iconic monument. The building, originally a mosque from the 8th century, was converted into a cathedral in the 13th century and remains a major tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging it overcharged customers in California. The lawsuit, brought by several county district attorneys, claimed the retail giant sold products for higher prices than advertised and misstated the weight of items like produce and baked goods. As part of the settlement, Walmart will pay civil penalties and implement measures to ensure accurate pricing in its California stores. The case underscores regulatory efforts to enforce consumer protection laws against pricing discrepancies.</p>

          <p>Disney's Lucasfilm and actress Gina Carano have settled her wrongful termination lawsuit, which she filed after being fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts. While details are private, Lucasfilm issued a statement praising Carano's professionalism and expressing hope for future collaboration. This article argues that the settlement was the right decision, suggesting Disney's initial firing was an overreaction to online pressure. The author frames the resolution not as "corporate capitulation" but as a reasonable conclusion to a contentious case.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit, a van that became an icon for tradespeople, rock bands, and even bank robbers, is celebrating its 60th anniversary. First launched in 1965, its versatility and practicality made it the world's best-selling van, with over 13 million built. Though production moved from the UK to Turkey in 2013, its design and engineering heritage remains in Britain. As the brand enters a new era, Ford is focusing on electric propulsion and software-defined vehicles to adapt to a changing market with increasing competition.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission have undocked from the International Space Station and are heading back to Earth. Their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule is scheduled for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California, concluding a 148-day mission. This will be the first NASA-sponsored crew to land in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure any discarded hardware lands safely away from populated areas. The departure followed a six-day handover period with their replacements, the newly arrived Crew-11.</p>

          <p>A feature article explores the surprising friendship between U.S. Vice President JD Vance, a conservative, and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, a left-wing politician.

Vance is currently visiting the UK and staying with Lammy at a government residence, a visit that underscores the importance of personal relationships in international diplomacy. The friendship is seen as a strategic bridge-building effort by the UK government with the Republican administration.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. Investigations show that the island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip capable of landing a plane of that size; visitors arrived by helicopter or boat. The Facebook user who originated the claim used a profile picture with a pin from a commercially available pilot costume. This fact-check highlights the spread of misinformation and the lack of verifiable data to support the accusation.</p>

          <p>To combat rising loneliness, the city of Seoul has launched "warm-hearted convenience stores," safe spaces offering free food and social connection. These centers provide a welcoming, cafe-like atmosphere for isolated individuals, particularly the elderly and unemployed youth, to interact with social workers and peers. The initiative was prompted by an increase in "lonely deaths" and a growing number of single-person households. The program aims to destigmatize seeking help by creating an accessible and non-clinical environment for those feeling disconnected from society.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has begun issuing licenses allowing Nvidia to export its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, a key market for the company. This move reverses a previous ban on the chip, which Nvidia specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls aimed at limiting China's technological advancement. The decision comes after Nvidia warned the restrictions could significantly impact its sales and potentially cede market share to Chinese competitors. It remains unclear which Chinese companies will be permitted to receive the chips under these licenses.</p>
