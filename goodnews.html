          <p>The Broadway play "John Proctor Is the Villain," set in a high school during the MeToo movement, has been evoking strong emotional reactions from audiences, particularly women, who are often seen leaving performances in tears. The play revolves around an honors English class studying "The Crucible" and explores themes of feminism, sexual harassment, and the complexities of the MeToo movement. Its power lies in transporting viewers back to a time when MeToo felt full of possibility, offering a sense of hope that is now in short supply.</p>

          <p>Ram√≥n Rodriguez, the star of ABC's "Will Trent," has become an industry game-changer by shaping his character and the show to reflect his Puerto Rican identity. Rodriguez plays Will Trent, a special agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation who navigates his trauma and dyslexia while solving crimes. The show has organically tailored the titular role to reflect Rodriguez‚Äôs real-life Puerto Rican identity, which is a major win for Latinos in an industry that otherwise lacks Latino-led programming. Rodriguez also directed an episode and was named an executive producer, allowing him to contribute to the creative collaboration of the show.</p>

          <p>A geomagnetic storm that was forecast to produce vibrant displays of the Northern Lights across much of the United States turned out to be weaker than anticipated. Skywatchers who hoped to witness the aurora borealis were largely disappointed, as the expected streaks of colorful light did not materialize to the extent predicted. This serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of space weather and its impact on Earth's atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by her recent comments about potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to a concerned constituent at a town hall by saying, "Well, we're all going to die," after the constituent expressed fears that people would die from the proposed cuts. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and current baseball player, aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policy and provide better leadership for Iowa.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. The divers believed the line was illegal and freed the animals, later reporting it to state wildlife officials. Despite avoiding prison time, the felony convictions restricted their rights, but the pardons now erase those convictions.</p>
