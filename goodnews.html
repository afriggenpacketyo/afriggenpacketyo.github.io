          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat, strategically utilized Fox News to broadcast her message emphasizing policies aimed at restoring children's childhoods. This move signifies an effort to reach a broader audience and potentially garner support from across the political spectrum.

          <p>TV, film, and media executive Barry Diller's new memoir, "Who Knew," explores his career, including the importance of instinct over relying solely on data. Diller emphasizes that too much information can hinder decision-making, particularly in creative and business contexts. He recalls his time at ABC, where he championed the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week," and highlights successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" that were driven by instinct. The book also reveals the sexuality that he kept secret from an early age. Data is often harmful to instinct, and I believe this to be true for making not only creative decisions but many business decisions.</p>

I see Father's Day Month as an off-and-on holiday. On even days Dads would receive a present. Kind of like during Hanukkah. One present every day that has an even number.</p>
