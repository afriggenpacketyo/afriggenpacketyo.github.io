          <p>JPMorgan Chase exceeded analyst predictions for its second-quarter performance, driven by strong results in fixed income trading and investment banking. The bank reported revenue of $45.68 billion, surpassing estimates, although net income fell compared to the previous year due to a one-time gain from Visa shares in that period. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the U.S. economy's resilience but reiterated warnings about risks from trade policy, geopolitical conflicts, and fiscal deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has obtained approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 AI computer chips to Chinese companies, reversing a previous ban. CEO Jensen Huang announced the policy change, stating that the U.S. government will grant the necessary licenses for the shipments to resume. This decision is seen as a significant benefit for Nvidia, allowing it to compete more effectively with rivals like Huawei in the large Chinese market and helping to ease trade frictions in the global semiconductor supply chain.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars. The program, funded with £650 million over three years, applies to vehicles costing up to £37,000, with the goal of making zero-emission cars more affordable. While the initiative is welcomed by some automakers, critics and industry figures highlight the urgent need for more public charging infrastructure, as the UK currently has only 82,000 of the 300,000 charging points targeted for 2030.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that relations with Australia have 'turned around' during a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Beijing. Both leaders emphasized seeking common ground and pursuing mutually beneficial cooperation, marking a significant improvement after years of strained diplomatic ties. Albanese's six-day visit, his second as prime minister, aims to strengthen economic relations between the two nations. The thaw comes as China seeks to bolster ties with key trading partners amid ongoing policy challenges with the United States.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual report has revealed that Gary Lineker was the corporation's top-earning presenter for the eighth straight year, with earnings between £1,350,000 and £1,354,999. Former Radio 2 host Zoe Ball was the second-highest earner. The report was released as the BBC confirmed several staff dismissals following a review into workplace culture, prompted by recent revelations of misconduct. The data also showed a decline in the number of households paying the licence fee, though the BBC remains a dominant force in UK media.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on their journey of leaving the conservative evangelical church to embrace their identity as a gay Christian. The author critiques the Southern Baptist Convention's recent resolution against same-sex marriage, recounting their own experiences at a Southern Baptist university where such relationships were viewed as a spiritual 'cancer.' The essay argues that for many queer people of faith, affirmation is a sincere religious conviction, and the true cross to bear was leaving their community to maintain their integrity and find a deeper connection with God.</p>

          <p>A pastor and divinity school professor argues that despite a recent IRS rule change allowing it, churches should not endorse political candidates. The author contends that while the church has a duty to speak on moral and political issues like justice, endorsing specific candidates undermines the conscience of congregants and reduces the church's role. Direct endorsements risk turning houses of worship into politically polarized spaces and entangling them in partisan battles, ultimately weakening their spiritual mission and community health.</p>

The launch coincided with the opening of Tesla's first showroom in Mumbai. The steep price is largely due to India's high tariffs on imported EVs, positioning the Model Y in the premium segment against brands like BMW rather than mass-market competitors.
