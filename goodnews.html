This move comes as E.l.f. continues its impressive growth streak, having become the top color cosmetics brand in the U.S. by units sold. The company has successfully leveraged social media trends and platforms like TikTok to appeal to younger consumers, challenging legacy brands. Despite concerns over financing the deal with debt and a recent dip in net income, analysts are cautiously optimistic about the acquisition's potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent tariff truce between the United States and China, economic experts remain cautious about the likelihood of significant long-term breakthroughs. While it is in the interest of both nations to avoid re-escalating tariffs, deep-seated issues make a comprehensive deal difficult to achieve. Analysts predict a future of continued negotiations, extensions, and adjustments rather than a definitive resolution to the trade conflict. President Trump has suggested a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping by year's end if a deal can be reached, but the path forward is expected to be challenging.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve having cut rates in late 2024 and more cuts anticipated, savers are evaluating the best place for their cash. Experts compare money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts, noting both offer competitive, variable rates that are much higher than traditional savings. The primary difference is that money market accounts often provide check-writing and debit card access, but may require higher minimum balances to earn the top yields. High-yield savings accounts are often simpler and ideal for building emergency funds or saving for short-term goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retirees who are required to take minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the cash have several strategic options. Financial experts suggest reinvesting the funds in a taxable brokerage account, often favoring tax-efficient assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Another popular option for those aged 70½ or older is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit, satisfying the RMD requirement without increasing taxable income. For those focused on legacy planning, using the RMD to contribute to a 529 college savings plan can also be a tax-advantaged move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's Swedish striker, Alexander Isak, remains determined to join Premier League champions Liverpool before the summer transfer window closes. This comes after Newcastle rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the 25-year-old player earlier in the month. Isak, who scored 27 goals last season, is expected to miss Newcastle's season opener as the situation remains unresolved. Newcastle's manager has indicated that "everything is in play" regarding the striker's future, suggesting a departure is still possible despite the rejected offer.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly stepping up its efforts to sign Crystal Palace and England center-back Marc Guehi before the summer transfer deadline. With Guehi having only one year left on his contract, Palace may be willing to sell the 25-year-old captain to avoid losing him on a free transfer next year. The club is believed to want around £40 million for the defender. This move is part of a significant summer spending spree for Liverpool, which is also pursuing other high-profile players to strengthen its squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Nine-time Grand Slam champion Monica Seles has publicly shared her diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease. The 51-year-old tennis icon was diagnosed three years ago after experiencing symptoms like double vision and muscle weakness that affected her daily life. Myasthenia gravis is a rare condition that causes weakness in voluntary muscles, including those in the eyes, face, and limbs. While there is no cure, treatments are available to manage symptoms.

          <p>In its first quarterly report as a public company, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a 53% surge in revenue to $658.1 million, causing its stock to rise.

The company reported a net loss due to non-cash IPO-related charges but issued strong guidance for future growth. CEO Jeremy Allaire noted a surge in interest from major financial institutions following the passage of new crypto legislation, signaling broader adoption. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European team for the 2025 Ryder Cup is taking shape with a strong sense of continuity from the victorious 2023 squad. Key players like Tommy Fleetwood, Rory McIlroy, and Justin Rose have already secured their spots, with several others from the Rome team likely to return. This stability is seen as a major advantage against a U.S. team facing more uncertainty, including questions around its captaincy. While a few spots remain contested, captain Luke Donald benefits from a core group of experienced players who are already familiar with the winning environment.</p>
