          <p>Renowned investor Warren Buffett has announced a donation of $6 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock to five charitable foundations, continuing his long-standing pledge to give away the majority of his wealth. The largest portion of the nearly 12.4 million shares will go to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. This latest contribution brings his total philanthropic giving since 2006 to approximately $60 billion. Buffett reaffirmed that his will designates about 99.5% of his estate for philanthropic purposes, underscoring his commitment to addressing wealth inequality through private giving.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman experienced a likely shark bite while in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. She suffered minor, non-life-threatening cuts to her leg and foot and was treated at the scene. While the woman did not see the creature, experts who analyzed the bite marks believe they were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, officials temporarily suspended swimming and conducted drone searches before reopening the beach the next morning.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied President Donald Trump's motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the five men wrongfully convicted in the Central Park jogger case. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP statute, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit alleges that Trump defamed the men by falsely stating during a presidential debate that they had pled guilty and killed someone. This ruling allows the case, which centers on events from decades ago, to proceed against the former president.</p>

          <p>On the tenth anniversary of the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage, a Maryland couple, Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, are reflecting on their pivotal role in the fight for equality. They were the lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit that, while unsuccessful in court, helped build momentum for marriage equality in the state, which was achieved in 2012. The couple shared their story of overcoming obstacles to protect their family and expressed concern over current efforts by some groups to roll back LGBTQ+ rights and protections across the country.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University has invented a specialized printer capable of adding braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), the state's largest employer of blind and low-vision individuals. The innovative device is designed with open hardware, allowing BISM employees to operate it by touch. This invention will support an annual fundraiser and prevent workers from having to manually punch braille into thousands of labels.</p>

          <p>Wall Street concluded a strong week with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing at new record highs, demonstrating resilience in the face of significant geopolitical risk.

This optimism was bolstered by a sharp drop in oil prices, which eased concerns about inflation and consumer spending. Investor focus also turned to potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Genetic analysis of skeletons from √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a well-preserved 9,000-year-old city in Turkey, suggests it may have been a matriarchal or matrilineal society. Researchers found that where biological connections existed among individuals buried in the same house, the link was through the female line, indicating women likely remained in their family homes after marriage while men moved in. This evidence, combined with a higher prevalence of grave goods for females, challenges traditional assumptions about patriarchal structures in ancient societies and points to women holding significant social power.</p>
