          <p>R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe discussed the band's decision to release a new remix of their hit song "Radio Free Europe" to support the federally funded news service, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The organization is facing financial difficulties due to the Trump administration withholding millions in funding. Stipe emphasized the importance of journalism and freedom of speech in the fight against authoritarianism. The remix aims to raise morale and support for the organization, which broadcasts to 23 countries in 27 languages, and had to furlough journalists and go to court to get its funding released.</p>

          <p>This article presents an excerpt from Mark Whitaker's book, "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," focusing on the artistic choices made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in the 1992 film "Malcolm X." The excerpt details the meticulous recreation of Malcolm Little's life, from his early days as a hustler in Boston to his rise as a civil rights leader. It highlights the challenges of filming key scenes, including Malcolm's assassination, and Lee's efforts to convey Malcolm's premonition of his own death through dialogue, music, and camera work.

The index's upward momentum could continue if defensive stocks remain in favor, but technical indicators suggest a potential pullback, and geopolitical tensions could disrupt the rally.
