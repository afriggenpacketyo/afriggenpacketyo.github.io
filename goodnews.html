          <p>U.S. officials have outlined the rules of force for the National Guard and Marines deployed to Los Angeles amidst protests, emphasizing their role in protecting federal buildings and personnel. Troops are instructed to de-escalate situations and are not authorized to engage crowds unless necessary, with weapons carried but not loaded, and the use of rubber bullets or pepper spray prohibited. The Los Angeles Police Department expressed concerns about logistical challenges due to the federal military presence and urged continuous communication between agencies. These rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as one of the worst in the developed world, citing fundamental flaws and outdated gender stereotypes. The report recommends increasing paternity pay and leave, highlighting the financial strain on new fathers and the complexity of shared parental leave. The report has been released on the eve of the world's first dad strike. The government said its forthcoming review would look at all current parental leave entitlements and is already in the process of ensuring dads no longer need to be employed for 26 weeks to be entitled to paternity leave.</p>
