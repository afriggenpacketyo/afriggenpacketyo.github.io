          <p>The Points Guy (TPG) has released its annual ranking of the best airlines in the U.S., evaluating carriers based on reliability, passenger experience, cost and reach, and loyalty programs. Delta Air Lines topped the list for the seventh consecutive year due to its strength across all categories, including on-time performance and inflight amenities. United Airlines came in second place, aided by an improved onboard experience, while Southwest Airlines moved up to third due to its low flight cancellation rate. The rankings aim to help travelers make informed decisions about which airlines offer the best overall experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Roberto Minervini's "The Damned" strips away traditional war film elements to focus on the existential drama of soldiers during the Civil War. The film emphasizes the minutiae of military life and the characters' inner thoughts over combat, creating a pensive atmosphere. Minervini's naturalistic style and close relationships with the cast result in a series of episodes that subtly pinpoint the economic inequalities, senseless brutality, and thwarted masculinity that have bedeviled the nation for over a century. The film can be considered an origin story for Minervini's exploration of an America still in conflict, rather than a traditional anti-war film.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists at William & Mary University in Virginia have unearthed a secret cellar beneath the Williamsburg Bray School, the oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children in America. The cellar contained artifacts such as slate pencil fragments and jewelry. The Williamsburg Bray School taught mostly enslaved students in the 1760s, using a religious framework to justify slavery, before later becoming a dormitory for some of the first women to attend college. The discovery provides new insights into the early republic and the history of the city and university.</p>

The sale marks a new record for NBA valuations, driven by the league's recent media rights agreement.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author advocates for increased investment in public pools, citing their importance for mental, physical, and social health. Swimming boosts moods and provides a unique sense of buoyancy and relaxation. Public pools can serve as social hubs, but many have been neglected due to historical racial tensions and the rise of private pools. Revitalizing public pools would promote health, happiness, and community engagement, especially during increasingly hot summers.</p>

          <p>Wales will ban plastic wet wipes from December 2026 to reduce environmental harm, becoming the first UK nation to implement such a ban. The ban, passed in the Senedd, makes it an offence to supply wet wipes containing plastic to customers, with exemptions for medical-grade wipes and business-to-business supply. The move is intended to encourage manufacturers, retailers, and consumers to shift towards reusable and non-plastic products. Research has highlighted the significant risk wet wipes pose to the environment, contributing to sewage blockages and river pollution.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has suspended millions of dollars in funding to the Cook Islands while it examines the scope of agreements with China. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon cited a lack of transparency regarding the Cook Islands' strategic partnership with Beijing, which includes deep-sea mining, regional cooperation, and economic issues. The funding pause is part of larger friction between New Zealand, Australia, and smaller Pacific island nations that China is approaching with partnership agreements. New Zealand seeks more 'trust' and is reviewing the free association relationship with the Cook Islands.</p>

Trump, who previously vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of the law for the third time. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's support in keeping the app online for its 170 million US users.</p>

          <p>Despite recent demonstrations and a now-lifted curfew, downtown Los Angeles remains safe for dining. A recent public safety alert and boarded-up storefronts in Little Tokyo created the impression that it was unsafe, impacting restaurant reservations. However, many downtown restaurants are still struggling to fill their dining rooms. With the curfew being lifted, many restaurants that closed, temporarily opened for lunch or moved to entirely new locations outside of downtown Los Angeles, started to announce that they would return to regular business operations.</p>
