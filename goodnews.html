          <p>Finland has been named the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, a title that even puzzles some Finns. The ranking, based on a life evaluation score rather than daily emotions like joy, is attributed to a strong sense of contentment among citizens. This contentment is fostered by a society with robust social support systems, free access to extensive public services like advanced libraries, and a deep cultural connection to nature and practices like saunas. The Finnish model suggests that societal well-being and contentment are key drivers of long-term happiness.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó has described the relationship between his country and the current U.S. administration as a "golden age," contrasting it with a "hostile approach" under the previous Democratic White House. Speaking to Fox News Digital, Szijjártó highlighted close alignment on major political issues, such as Hungary's plan to follow the U.S. in declaring Antifa a terrorist organization. He also credited President Trump with strengthening NATO by pushing for increased defense spending and positioned him as the "only hope" for peace in the Ukraine conflict.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their third World Cup title with a dominant 33-13 victory over Canada in front of a record crowd at Twickenham. After an early Canadian try, a sensational solo score from fullback Ellie Kildunne shifted the momentum firmly in England's favor. The team's powerful forward pack and relentless defense controlled the game, extending their record-breaking winning streak to 33 matches. This victory avenges their loss to New Zealand in the previous final and marks a historic achievement for English women's sport.</p>

          <p>England's Women's Rugby World Cup victory was built on a foundation of strong team culture, a conscious effort to improve upon the environment of previous campaigns. Head coach John Mitchell and the players fostered a supportive and inclusive atmosphere, with team-bonding activities like movie nights and a focus on staying present. This unity was visible on and off the pitch, with non-selected players like veteran Emily Scarratt actively supporting the team during matches. This collective effort helped the squad manage the pressure of being both hosts and heavy favorites, culminating in their championship win.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, a pioneering journalist who broke racial and gender barriers in television news, has passed away at the age of 92. In the 1960s, she became the first Black woman hired as a TV reporter on the U.S. West Coast, building a celebrated career at stations like KPIX and KQED in San Francisco. Throughout her five-decade career, she covered pivotal moments from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, earning eight regional Emmy Awards.

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has confirmed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold the remainder of its long-held stake in the company earlier this year. A BYD executive described the selling of stock as "completely normal" for an investment firm and expressed gratitude for the 17 years of support from Buffett and Charlie Munger. Berkshire's initial $232 million investment in 2008 grew to be worth billions, and the gradual sell-off began in 2022. Despite the amicable separation, BYD's stock has faced pressure amid signs of cooling growth in the competitive EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

Ryan highlights the low cost of living, sense of safety, and a cultural focus on daily life rather than monetary pressures as key benefits.

          <p>Activist investment firm Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO), arguing the timing is now ideal for a transaction. After a previous activist campaign prompted CCO to sell its international assets, the company is now a more focused and attractive U.S. pure-play. Despite these strategic moves, CCO's stock has underperformed, and Anson believes a sale to a strategic acquirer or private equity offers the best path forward for shareholders. Potential buyers have shown interest in the out-of-home advertising sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The company claims its process can reduce construction costs by up to 20% and cut delivery times in half compared to traditional on-site building. This method has already been utilized for disaster relief, with Fading West producing 82 homes for residents displaced by the Maui wildfires. By leveraging manufacturing efficiencies, the company hopes to make home ownership more attainable for a broader range of Americans, including essential workers in high-cost areas.</p>
