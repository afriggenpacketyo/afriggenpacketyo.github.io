          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei and U.S. President Donald Trump praised each other during a meeting at the White House, reinforcing their strong alliance. Milei commended Trump for his commitment to global peace, particularly citing the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The visit also focused on Argentina's pressing financial issues, with discussions centered on securing tariff exemptions and understanding the implementation of a $20 billion U.S. currency swap line. Trump reaffirmed his endorsement of Milei, calling him a "very great leader" and suggesting a free trade agreement is a possibility to help both nations.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is approaching the end of its program to reduce its bond holdings, a process known as "quantitative tightening." In a speech, Powell noted that rising risks to the labor market are becoming a more significant concern, suggesting that interest rate cuts are being considered to balance employment and inflation goals. He stated that the job market has softened considerably, shifting the balance of risks and increasing the likelihood of policy easing. Financial markets are now anticipating multiple rate cuts before the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Despite flight delays caused by air traffic controller shortages during the U.S. government shutdown, aviation experts assert that air travel remains safe. They explain that delays and ground stops are precautionary measures implemented by the FAA to maintain safety standards, not a sign of compromised safety. While acknowledging traveler inconvenience and the long-term stress on unpaid federal workers, experts emphasize that pilots have the final authority to ground a flight if they perceive any risk. The consensus is that while the risk of delays is higher, safety protocols are not being relaxed.</p>

Walmart frames this as a move toward "agentic commerce," where AI anticipates and learns customer needs to provide a more personalized service. The collaboration positions Walmart to compete more directly with Amazon in the evolving landscape of AI-driven retail.</p>

          <p>As part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, the final 20 living hostages captured by Hamas have been returned to Israel in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Concurrently, President Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset, stating that Hamas will be disarmed, by force if necessary. Following the withdrawal of Israeli forces from some areas, humanitarian organizations report improved access to deliver aid within the Gaza Strip. The U.N. and other groups are scaling up efforts to address urgent needs, including delivering medical supplies and improving infrastructure for residents returning to their homes.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Stark Disconnect in Workplace Values Between Gen Z and Employers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent research highlights a significant values gap between Gen Z employees and the hiring managers looking to employ them, creating friction in the modern workplace. The study found that Gen Z prioritizes self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping others, whereas employers are seeking candidates who value achievement, learning, and hard work. This disconnect has led to hiring challenges and frustration on both sides. An NYU professor advises young workers to be honest about their financial goals to determine whether they should adapt to traditional workplace expectations or seek careers that align more closely with their personal values.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 15:42:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS has adjusted the capital gains tax brackets for 2026 to account for inflation, raising the income limits for investors to qualify for the 0% rate on long-term gains. For 2026, single filers with taxable income up to $49,450 and married couples filing jointly with up to $98,900 will pay no taxes on profits from assets held for more than a year. This change provides a significant tax planning opportunity for investors, allowing them to potentially sell profitable assets to rebalance or diversify their portfolios without incurring a tax liability.

          <p>Amid rising inflation and high interest rates, many consumers are considering debt relief programs to manage their finances, but it's crucial to ask critical questions before enrolling. Experts advise that borrowers should first fully understand how the specific program, such as debt settlement or consolidation, actually works and what its potential impact on their credit score will be. Secondly, individuals must realistically assess if they can commit to the full program timeline, which often lasts for several years. Finally, it is essential to compare all available options, including negotiating with creditors directly or creating a tighter personal budget. (not investment advice)</p>
