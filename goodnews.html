          <p>The House is set to vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill, dubbed "The Big, Beautiful Bill," after unveiling an updated version aimed at appeasing various Republican factions. The revised bill includes changes to Medicaid work requirements, renewable energy tax credits, and state and local tax deductions (SALT). Speaker Mike Johnson faces a tight margin, needing to secure almost all Republican votes as Democrats are expected to oppose the measure. Even if passed in the House, the bill is anticipated to encounter resistance in the Senate, where Republicans are likely to seek further changes. </p>

          <p>Juan Soto, the Mets' $765 million slugger, is under intense scrutiny in his first season with the team, despite solid performance. Early anxieties arose from instances of perceived lack of hustle and unfounded rumors about private travel arrangements. While his current OPS+ of 134 is above average, it falls short of his career standard, leading to heightened expectations and criticism. Experts suggest that Soto's track record and underlying statistics indicate he will soon return to his elite form, emphasizing the need for patience and perspective.</p>

          <p>New research has uncovered the genetic mutation responsible for the orange coat color in cats, a mystery that has puzzled scientists for decades. Two separate studies identified a missing piece of DNA near the ARHGAP36 gene that activates the gene in pigment cells. Researchers collected DNA samples from hundreds of cats with the help of cat owners at cat shows and spay-neuter clinics. The finding intersects with the same pathway responsible for red hair in humans but affects it differently, providing insight into hormonal signaling in various cell types and animals.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued as it reached a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and sustained interest from institutional buyers. This surge occurs despite a recent drop in U.S. stock markets, diverging from Bitcoin's typical correlation with equities. Factors contributing to the rally include broader macro concerns, such as Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which bolsters Bitcoin's narrative as a hedge against fiat instability.
