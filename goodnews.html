          <p>Former Disney star Christy Carlson Romano described a harrowing incident where she was struck by birdshot during a clay pigeon shooting outing with her husband. Romano, who was hit in multiple places including below her eye, emphasized the importance of gun safety while recounting the event. She revealed that a fragment is still lodged behind her eye, dangerously close to causing blindness, and another fragment remains in her forehead. Despite the severity, Romano initially made jokes to keep those around her calm, though she admitted to struggling with the reality of being a "gunshot survivor."</p>

          <p>Thousands of Chinese officials are rushing to adhere to President Xi Jinping's austerity orders, ensuring modest offices and proper meal receipts, as inspectors conduct checks. This campaign, ongoing since 2012, targets overspending among Communist Party and government bodies to improve the party's image and cut wasteful spending. Analysts suggest this also ensures wise spending amid rivalry with the U.S. and identifies politically loyal cadres for promotion. The effectiveness of the campaign is questioned due to strict media control and the difficulty of enforcing detailed rules on a large scale.</p>
