          <p>Veteran actor Brian Cox is starring in a new play, "Make it Happen," which chronicles the rise and fall of the Royal Bank of Scotland, as part of the Edinburgh International Festival. Cox portrays the ghost of economist Adam Smith in the production, which is described as a biting satire on the financial crisis. At 79, Cox expresses a commitment to protest and social justice, drawing from his own difficult upbringing in Dundee. The article highlights how the play re-examines Smith's legacy, suggesting his work was more focused on moral philosophy and human welfare than pure capitalism, a theme that resonates with Cox's personal convictions.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil announced its second-quarter financial results, revealing a significant 23% drop in net income to $7.1 billion compared to the previous year. Despite the decline, the company's performance exceeded Wall Street predictions, with earnings per share at $1.64 against an expected $1.54. The better-than-expected results were attributed to strong production growth, which helped offset the negative impact of lower global oil prices. The company's revenue for the quarter also slightly beat estimates, coming in at $81.5 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

Other insights include leaning into personal strengths while outsourcing weaknesses, carefully considering customer price sensitivity in an inflationary environment, and the value of listening to community needs. The stories emphasize that despite economic turbulence, strategic planning and resilience can lead to successful business launches.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported a significant 44% decline in its second-quarter net income, which fell to $2.49 billion, largely due to lower oil prices and a financial loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the drop, the company's adjusted earnings of $1.77 per share surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The acquisition of Hess, which adds key assets in Guyana and the U.S., is expected to contribute to earnings later in the year. Chevron's worldwide production saw a 3% increase, with a notable 8% jump in U.S. output, driven by strong performance in the Permian Basin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has confirmed its new Entry/Exit System (EES) will begin on October 12, replacing traditional passport stamping with biometric checks for non-EU travelers, including those from the UK. Under the new rules, travelers will need to have their fingerprints and faces scanned upon entry, with the data being valid for three years. While the system aims to tighten security and eventually speed up border crossings, the UK government has warned of potential initial delays. The rollout will be phased over six months, and the EU has assured that once registered, travelers can use e-gates where available, streamlining future trips.</p>

While he will no longer have an ownership role, Dalio will continue to be a significant investor in Bridgewater's strategies and serve as a mentor. The firm raised capital from existing investors and employees to facilitate the final sale of Dalio's shares. Bridgewater's flagship Pure Alpha fund reported strong performance in the first half of 2025, with gains of 17%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Vanguard Research Shows Emergency Savings Help Protect 401(k) Retirement Funds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 06:15:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having an emergency savings fund acts as a crucial "security blanket" that protects long-term retirement savings. The study found that 401(k) investors with at least $2,000 in emergency savings are significantly less likely to take out loans or make hardship withdrawals from their retirement accounts. This is particularly important for hourly workers with volatile incomes, who are more prone to tapping their 401(k)s early. Financial experts recommend building a fund to cover three to six months of expenses and automating contributions to ensure consistent saving. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship program exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This initiative, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase working-class representation in Whitehall to ensure the government better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move has been welcomed by social mobility advocates but criticized by the Conservative opposition as "leftist social engineering" that excludes people based on their background rather than merit.</p>

          <p>In a novel anti-poaching effort, scientists from South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand have launched the Rhisotope Project, which involves injecting a harmless radioactive material into rhino horns. The substance makes the horns easily detectable by customs scanners at ports and airports worldwide, aiming to disrupt smuggling networks. This initiative comes as South Africa, home to the world's largest rhino population, continues to battle high levels of poaching driven by demand in Asian markets. After a six-year pilot study involving 20 rhinos confirmed the method is safe for the animals, the project is now ready for wider deployment.</p>

As heat waves intensify, the project focuses on identifying areas with the greatest need for shade, using high-resolution mapping to determine where new trees and structures can have the most impact. Unlike past campaigns, ShadeLA emphasizes the quality and long-term maintenance of shade rather than just planting a set number of trees. The goal is to create a lasting legacy of improved public health and thermal comfort for the city's residents.</p>

          <p>This article defines and explores parasocial relationships, the one-sided connections people form with public figures like celebrities, influencers, and podcasters. It explains that while these relationships feel real, they are not reciprocal, an illusion facilitated by modern media's intimate style and the constant access to celebrities' lives. The piece traces the history of intense fandom and notes that while often harmless, these dynamics can become toxic when fans overstep boundaries, leading to harassment and a sense of entitlement. It concludes by advising fans to remain mindful of the distinction between a public persona and a real person to engage with media responsibly.</p>

          <p>A new tax bill signed by President Trump includes a significant tax break for charitable giving, aimed at the 90% of filers who do not itemize their deductions. Starting in 2026, non-itemizers will be able to claim a deduction for cash donations, worth up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly. Financial experts advise that taxpayers who typically make year-end donations might consider shifting their 2025 gift to January 2026 to take advantage of this new benefit. Proper record-keeping, including bank records and written acknowledgements from the charity, will be essential to claim the deduction. (not investment advice)</p>
