        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a significant decrease in April, coinciding with President Trump's tariff escalation. Imports declined by 16% as trade barriers took effect, leading to a trade deficit of approximately $61 billion, a substantial drop from the previous month's $140 billion. Despite the narrowing deficit, the outlook for Trump's tariff policy and the wider economy remains uncertain due to the administration's inconsistent approach to tariffs. Consumer attitudes have soured, and economists are closely monitoring consumer spending and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
