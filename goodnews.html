          <h2>Bank of England Signals Readiness for Interest Rate Cuts Amid Slowing Job Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 02:29:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Governor of the Bank of England has indicated a willingness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK's job market continues to weaken. Citing a slowdown in hiring and smaller pay increases, the governor expressed a belief that the path for interest rates is downwards from the current 4.25%. This stance is reinforced by recent data showing a decline in job vacancies and an economic contraction in May. The comments suggest a rate cut could occur as soon as the Bank's next meeting in August. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has achieved a new record price, surging past the $120,000 mark on Monday. The rally is largely attributed to substantial inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with one recent day logging over $1.18 billion in new investments. Market optimism is also fueled by expectations of clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including potential legislation around stablecoins. Analysts suggest that continued institutional buying could propel the cryptocurrency's price even higher in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China's Export Growth Surpasses June Expectations Amid US Tariff Truce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 02:20:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts and showing resilience despite global trade tensions. This growth was supported by strong shipments to non-U.S. markets, particularly Southeast Asia and the European Union, and a temporary tariff reprieve that slowed the decline in exports to America. Imports also saw their first year-over-year increase in 2025, climbing 1.1%, although this was slightly below expectations. While the data provides a short-term boost, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year due to ongoing tariff uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sought to alleviate U.S. fears that the company's advanced AI chips could be used by the Chinese military. In a recent interview, Huang argued that China's military cannot rely on U.S. technology because its access could be restricted at any time. He reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive and that engaging with China's large developer community is essential for maintaining America's global leadership in AI. The comments come as Huang prepares for another trip to China amid ongoing tensions over semiconductor technology.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are making substantial inroads in Norway, emerging as major competitors to Tesla and established Western automakers. In a country where nearly 94% of new cars are electric, Chinese brands have captured approximately 10% of the market share since their introduction in 2020. Norway's policy of not imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the U.S. and EU, has created a highly competitive environment. Consumers have been won over by the competitive pricing and advanced technology of models from companies like BYD, XPeng, and MG.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, successfully avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the first quarter. The growth, which beat economists' forecasts, was driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. This rebound is partly attributed to businesses front-loading exports to get ahead of potential U.S. tariffs and a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Despite the positive data, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing "significant uncertainty and downside risks" in the global economy for the remainder of the year.

China is the largest consumer of Australian iron ore, but the shift to green steel production, which requires higher-grade ore, puts this trade relationship at risk. The proposal aims to evolve the economic partnership by focusing on new, lower-emissions technologies like green iron.</p>
