        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent benchmark rate cut, experts anticipate further reductions this year, likely leading to lower home equity loan rates. Projections suggest an additional 0.5% drop by year-end, potentially pushing average rates below 8%, with some lenders already offering such rates. Homeowners are encouraged to explore their options and compare offers, as these favorable conditions could make tapping into significant home equity more affordable. The trajectory of home equity and HELOC rates is directly tied to the prime rate, influenced by the Fed's decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jewish funeral traditions prioritize quick, simple burials and focus on eternal memory among the living, rather than an afterlife. Bodies undergo a ritual bath (Taharah) and are buried in plain wooden caskets or shrouds, without embalming or public viewing. Mourners perform K'riah, a ritual tearing of clothing, and observe shiva for seven days, refraining from work and grooming. The Mourner's Kaddish, an ancient Aramaic prayer, is recited in communal settings to honor the deceased and provide support, with gravestones typically added a month to a year after burial.</p>
