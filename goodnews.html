          <p>England's football manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his intention to integrate long throw-ins and long-ball tactics into the team's strategy ahead of the next World Cup. Despite England's successful qualifying campaign, which has featured a more possession-based style, Tuchel believes these direct tactics will be crucial in the tournament setting. He acknowledged the limited training time available but emphasized that such patterns, along with crosses, are becoming relevant again in modern football. This tactical shift would be a notable change from the style seen under previous management.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, a potential candidate for the next Federal Reserve chair, asserted that the central bank's monetary policy must remain "fully independent of political influence." His comments come amid President Trump's public pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates and his consideration of Hassett for the top job. Hassett warned that political control over central banks historically leads to inflation and economic hardship. He aligned with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's call for a review of the Fed's mission, emphasizing transparency and independence from the White House. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka secured her fourth Grand Slam title by defending her U.S. Open championship, defeating Amanda Anisimova in a hard-fought final. Her performance showcased a newfound emotional control and strategic maturity, lessons she learned after a difficult loss in the French Open final earlier in the season. The victory underscores her evolution from a player relying on raw power to one of the most consistent top-tier competitors in tennis. Now at her peak, Sabalenka has reached at least the semi-final in 11 of the last 12 Grand Slam tournaments she has entered.</p>

          <p>The reunited British rock band Oasis performed at a sold-out Rose Bowl, delivering a performance focused on collective audience participation as much as the band itself. The show, part of their first tour in over 15 years, has been noted for the emotional and cathartic response from fans, who sang along passionately to classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova." Brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, famously combative, put aside their differences for the tour, which has become one of the year's major live music events. The review highlights the concert's power to foster real-world connection through shared musical memory.</p>

          <p>A controversial team order at the Italian Grand Prix saw McLaren instruct championship leader Oscar Piastri to let his teammate Lando Norris pass for second place. The situation arose after a slow pit stop for Norris, caused by a team error, dropped him behind Piastri, reversing their on-track positions. Team principal Andrea Stella defended the decision as being consistent with the team's principles of fairness, as Norris had deserved the position before the pit stop issue. Despite initial radio disagreement, both drivers handled the situation professionally, highlighting the team's effort to maintain a fair but intense intra-team championship battle.</p>

          <p>John Burton, a dominant and famously profane figure in California Democratic politics for over six decades, has passed away at the age of 92. Alongside his brother Phillip Burton and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, he was a key architect of the political machine that shaped the state's liberal trajectory. Serving in the Assembly, Congress, and as state Senate leader, Burton championed causes for the underprivileged, from foster care reform to welfare. After overcoming addiction, he returned to politics and later chaired the California Democratic Party, solidifying its dominance in the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis of government data reveals significant disparities in lottery spending across the United States, with Massachusetts residents spending the most at an average of $915 per year. Rhode Island follows at $573, while North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually. This spending is a notable source of state revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of general funds and as much as 3% in states like Rhode Island. An analyst suggests that higher spending in urbanized states may be partly due to the greater convenience and opportunity to purchase tickets. (not investment advice)</p>

The Prime Minister's office stated that "tens of millions of phones successfully sounded," deeming the test an important step for national safety.
