          <p>Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Chen-ning Yang has died in Beijing at the age of 103, marking the end of an era for a mind often ranked alongside Albert Einstein. His seminal contribution was the co-authorship of the Yang–Mills theory in 1954, a set of equations as crucial to physics as Einstein's theory of relativity. This theory provided the mathematical framework for how the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions operate in the subatomic realm. It ultimately formed the bedrock of the Standard Model, which unifies these fundamental forces and elucidates the behavior of all known elementary particles, leaving an indelible mark on modern physics.</p>

          <p>Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have significantly disrupted the South African SUV market, experiencing an 86% surge in sales volume between January and August compared to the previous year. This robust growth has elevated their total market share to 15%, primarily fueled by strong performances from Chery and Haval, which saw unit increases of 27% and 45% respectively. This expansion is actively cutting into the market dominance of traditional leaders like Japanese brands Toyota and Suzuki, both of whom recorded a decline in their individual market share during the same period. The article highlights a substantial shift in consumer preferences and the competitive landscape within South Africa's automotive sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has unveiled Aegaeon, a novel computing pooling solution that reportedly slashes Nvidia GPU usage by an impressive 82% for its artificial intelligence models. Beta-tested for over three months, Aegaeon reduced the required Nvidia H20 GPUs from 1,192 to 213 for serving dozens of models up to 72 billion parameters. This system addresses resource inefficiency in cloud services, where many AI models are sporadically used, leading to wasted GPU power. The research, presented at SOSP in Seoul, highlights a significant advancement in optimizing large language model workloads and reducing operational costs for cloud providers.</p>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama titled "Silent Honour" has unexpectedly sparked a widespread public tribute to real-life intelligence agents, inspiring an outpouring of praise. This cultural phenomenon led to a "sudden surge" of visitors to the tomb of Wu Shi, a historical underground party member and KMT lieutenant general, where numerous flowers and thank-you notes were left. The article notes this occurred outside of the traditional Ching Ming festival, underscoring the drama's profound impact on national sentiment. It illustrates how popular media can significantly shape public perception, fostering appreciation and recognition for previously unacknowledged historical figures and their contributions.</p>

          <p>Eugenio Suárez’s monumental eighth-inning grand slam, his second home run of the game, dramatically secured a 6-2 victory for the Seattle Mariners against the Toronto Blue Jays. This pivotal win places the Mariners just one game away from their inaugural World Series appearance.

Suárez's subsequent opposite-field blast with the bases loaded ignited T-Mobile Park. The Mariners now hold a commanding 3-2 series lead, heading into Game 6 in Toronto with significant momentum after this heroic performance.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is actively developing an ecosystem to reinforce its position as a leading offshore yuan trading center, aiming to encourage greater international use of the Chinese currency. A new yuan borrowing scheme, the RBF, has been introduced to offer easier and cheaper yuan loans, a significant advantage over higher Hong Kong dollar interest rates. This initiative is part of a broader strategy by Hong Kong and mainland regulators to attract international investors and companies. The scheme will soon expand to facilitate direct investments, allowing mainland firms to secure yuan loans for overseas ventures and foreign firms to fund mainland expansion.

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing new tariffs: 25% on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, and 10% on imported buses, including school and city models. This measure aims to protect and incentivize domestic manufacturing, shielding U.S. companies from foreign competition. The administration will offer credits to manufacturers who import parts to assemble vehicles in the U.S., offsetting tariff liabilities and promoting American labor. This policy reflects a strategic move to boost domestic production and ensure all drivers contribute their "fair share" to road maintenance, according to senior administration officials.

          <p>Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, is lauded as a visionary technocrat and naval genius instrumental in the comprehensive modernization of China’s naval forces to world-class standards. Frequently compared to the influential 19th-century American strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Liu's distinguished career began at age 13 in the Red Army, participating in the Long March. He later transferred to the nascent PLA Navy in 1952, marking his first encounter with the sea. His strategic direction was crucial in developing China's "blue sea strategy," profoundly shaping its emergence as a formidable maritime power and leaving a lasting legacy on its military capabilities.</p>

Stargazers can expect around 15 meteors per hour during the peak, with larger ones appearing as "fireballs" brighter than Venus. For optimal viewing, the article advises finding a dark spot away from city lights between midnight and dawn, looking towards the constellation Orion without the need for binoculars or telescopes.</p>

Jewellers note a "fear of missing out" (FOMO) due to rising prices, but also a clear trend towards gold and silver as investments rather than solely for adornment. Investment demand, including ETFs and digital gold, has significantly increased, with India's central bank also heavily stocking up on gold to diversify reserves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is showing signs of emerging from its fentanyl death epidemic, with fatal overdoses falling by approximately 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This significant turnaround is attributed to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, particularly in states like North Carolina, where overdoses are down 35%. Programs like Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) redirect substance users towards recovery and support, while medication-assisted treatments (MAT) like methadone are crucial for curbing cravings and withdrawal. Naloxone, a miracle drug reversing opioid overdoses, has also saved thousands of lives, alongside drug testing and a generational shift away from opioids.</p>
