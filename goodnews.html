          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after finishing as runner-up the previous year. Zaki nearly jeopardized his chances with an incorrect start to spelling "commelina," but he recovered to spell the winning word, "eclaircissement." The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and the finals featured a high level of competition, with several spellers achieving perfect rounds. Faizan is the fifth runner-up in a century to come back and win the bee, increasing his total earnings from the competition to $77,500, and he plans to donate a large portion of his winnings to charity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's power grid has implemented a quantum-powered safeguard, referred to as a "diamond ring," to prevent catastrophic collapses. The device, designed by a team from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, uses nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors to detect grid instability in real time. This initiative follows incidents in Europe and China where grid oscillations and renewable energy fluctuations caused widespread outages. The "diamond ring" acts as a high-precision sentinel for power lines, addressing the challenges posed by the increasing reliance on weather-dependent renewable energy sources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion essay explores how the "therapy generation" is increasingly choosing to be childless due to a redefinition of harm and trauma. The author suggests that emotional and relational struggles, once considered unavoidable, are now viewed as forms of harm. This shift has led to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting, where children expect parents to ensure their mental health and happiness well into adulthood. The essay posits that this cultural shift, along with other factors like financial concerns and climate change, contributes to the rising rate of childlessness among millennials.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New AI tools are enabling individuals without formal software training to write software through a process called "vibe coding." Chloe Samaha, co-founder of BOND, created a functional online productivity manager and website in less than a day using AI chatbots. This approach is lowering the barrier to entry for software development and opening up possibilities for creators, though it also raises questions about the future of software engineering. While some experts predict AI coders will eventually replace human coders, others believe AI will augment developers' capabilities, allowing them to explore more ideas and automate simple tasks.</p>

          <p>Valerie, a mini dachshund, was found after surviving 529 days alone in the Australian bush after running away during a camping trip in November 2023. Despite being microchipped and having an AirTag, the sparsely populated island made it difficult to track her. After months of searching, the owners had to return home, coping with the possibility of never seeing her again. A farmer's photo led to a rescue effort by Kangala Wildlife Rescue, who eventually captured Valerie after months of trapping attempts, and Valerie has since returned home and is settling back into her old routine.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to increase rice exports in response to an expected long-term decline in domestic consumption. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recommends exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production in its annual white paper on food and agriculture. China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have been identified as target markets for exports. The government aims to boost rice exports nearly eightfold to 353,000 tons in 2030, focusing on sales at Japanese restaurants and stores abroad, and also seeks to reduce production costs to better compete with foreign-grown rice.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes is reportedly considering a lucrative offer to join Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal. Fernandes' representatives are said to have met with Al-Hilal officials for discussions about a move that would allow him to take part in the forthcoming Club World Cup. While Fernandes has remained focused and continues to take his responsibilities as captain seriously, he has offered no guarantees about his future, which has led to some thinking he is ready to leave. Manchester United are said to be relaxed about the situation, knowing a rumored ¬£80m transfer fee might be the best way of being able to reshape their squad.</p>

          <p>The German central bank, the Bundesbank, expects inflation to stay on target at around 2%. In April, the annual inflation rate fell to 2.1%, the lowest rate since October, largely due to cheap energy compared to the previous year. With oil prices remaining low, no major change is expected for May's annual inflation rate. The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) is expected to publish its initial data on the May inflation rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Harris's hawk that terrorized the village of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, for at least a month has found a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was blamed for dive-bombing attacks on about 50 people, with one man requiring hospital treatment. Falconer Wayne Housden, who captured and trained the hawk, said the bird has "calmed right down" and is likely a captive-bred bird that lost its owner. Housden plans to keep the hawk full-time and hopes to let it fly loose in the autumn, after building a aviary for the bird.</p>

          <p>Raynor Winn, a writer from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, has shared her experience of watching a film adaptation of her memoir, "The Salt Path," which depicts her journey walking the South West Coastal Path with her terminally ill husband, Moth. The couple embarked on the 630-mile trek after losing their home in Wales and receiving Moth's diagnosis of Corticobasal Degeneration. Winn said the film, starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs, took her "right back" to the difficult emotions of that time, when they had nothing to lose and sought purpose in following a line on a map. The couple continue to fundraise for research into Moth's illness.</p>
