          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 5-0, marking their fourth loss in six games, as pitcher Justin Wrobleski allowed four runs in six innings. The Dodgers' pitching staff has been plagued by injuries, leading to frequent shuttling of players from triple-A. The offense struggled, stranding nine runners and going one for 13 with runners in scoring position, as Sonny Gray of the Cardinals pitched effectively. Weather delayed the game's start by 77 minutes due to rain, adding to the pressure to complete the game. The team's recent performance reflects a dip in their offensive capabilities despite leading the majors in runs and average earlier in the season.</p>

With a crucial national election approaching, Ishiba seeks to boost rice production to counter opposition parties' proposals for cutting the consumption tax. The Prime Minister is pursuing a more consumer-focused approach by releasing reserve rice under direct contracts with retailers to lower prices. Reforming rice policy has long been a personal priority for Ishiba, but challenges remain, including the risk of oversupply and price plunges. (not investment advice)</p>
