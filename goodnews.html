          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, with initial winds of 50 mph. The storm has since weakened as it moves inland and is expected to become a tropical depression. Flood watches remain in effect for parts of the Carolinas, with forecasts predicting 2 to 4 inches of rain and the potential for isolated tornadoes. Chantal is the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and is projected to dissipate by Monday.</p>

          <h2>Florida Introduces Special Parking Permits for Expectant Mothers</h2>

          <p>A new Florida law effective July 1 allows pregnant women to apply for an "expectant mother parking permit," granting them access to accessible parking spaces for up to one year. The initiative, which costs $15 for a temporary placard, has generated mixed reactions on social media. Supporters, including the sponsoring state representative, argue it provides necessary assistance, especially in the heat and for those with other children. Critics, however, question whether pregnancy should be classified as a condition requiring such accommodations.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico in Peru's northern Barranca province, believed to be a key trading hub for early American civilizations. The site, founded between 1,800 and 1,500 BC, contains ceremonial temples and residential complexes. Researchers believe the discovery is significant for understanding the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, which was impacted by climate change. The findings highlight Peru's rich archaeological heritage, which includes sites like Machu Picchu and the Nazca Lines.</p>

          <p>The Statue of Liberty was originally conceived in 1865 not as a symbol of immigration, but as a tribute to the end of slavery in the United States. This article traces its transformation into a beacon for immigrants, largely influenced by Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus." The opening of Ellis Island and the subsequent waves of immigration cemented this new meaning. The article also discusses the history of U.S. immigration law, including the restrictive quotas of 1924 and the transformative Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.</p>

          <p>A communication expert and author outlines five seemingly innocuous phrases that can inadvertently make a person appear judgmental, potentially damaging relationships. Phrases such as "Why don't you just..." and "Actually..." can imply the other person is incompetent or wrong, even if the speaker's intent is to be helpful. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, like "What have you tried so far?" and using "yes, and..." to build on ideas. The key is to be mindful of both the intention and the impact of one's words.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its influence in the Western Balkans through a strategy of "soft power," prominently featuring the funding of large-scale mosques like the Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania. This religious and cultural outreach is intertwined with Turkey's broader economic, political, and military interests in the region. Experts describe this as a form of "infrastructure imperialism," where Turkey, viewing itself as the heir to the Ottoman Empire, invests in major projects to assert its regional power. This strategy extends beyond the Balkans to Central Asia and Africa.</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, the setting that defined his youth and literary career. Traveling to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi," Twain, now a famous and affluent easterner, confronted the changes to the river and its towns. Despite his fame, he found solace and a sense of belonging in the pilot house of a steamboat, reflecting on his past as a river pilot. The experience underscored the paradox of his life: the more his world expanded, the more he longed for his past.</p>

          <p>Sir Mark Rowley, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, has proposed that football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches in the UK. Arguing for a "polluter pays" approach, he questioned why event organizers don't pay for the necessary police presence, which diverts resources from local communities. The suggestion comes amid broader calls from Sir Mark for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales to better manage overstretched funding. Critics of the idea fear it could threaten events or increase ticket prices.</p>

          <p>Following the New York mayoral primary victory of progressive Zohran Mamdani, some analysts are questioning if the Democratic party is on the verge of a grassroots populist takeover, similar to the Republican Tea Party movement of 2010. This potential shift is fueled by a divide between the party's establishment and a more progressive, populist wing, with base voters expressing anger and a desire for new leadership. Unlike the original Tea Party, the progressive movement's priorities are more disparate, but there is a shared frustration with current congressional leadership and a focus on working-class economic issues.</p>

          <p>The new animated film "The King of Kings," based on a Charles Dickens book about the life of Jesus, has become a box office success but struggles to achieve its goal of appealing to non-believers. The review notes that while the film features a high-profile cast and attempts to be educational, its on-the-nose evangelism and awkward humor may alienate a broader audience. The article contrasts it with more successful biblical adaptations like "The Prince of Egypt" and "The Chosen," which use character-driven drama to resonate more widely. It concludes that the film is likely to remain popular primarily within its intended faith-based market.</p>

Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have not shifted dramatically, and GDP growth continues at a moderate pace. The article argues that Trump's policies have had limited immediate impact, as his promised "drill, baby, drill" approach had little room to grow and his tariff threats were quickly moderated. While long-term fundamentals may be at risk, the short-term reality is an economy that is simply "okay," not booming or collapsing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the cultural significance of professional wrestling, focusing on the pivotal 1996 moment when Hulk Hogan, the all-American hero, turned into a "heel" (a villain). This narrative shift, which created the "New World Order" faction, is presented as a masterclass in storytelling that blurred the lines between fiction and reality for audiences. The piece analyzes how this event captivated fans and argues that such moments in wrestling offer a unique form of theater that plays with audience expectations. It also reflects on how this embrace of "heeldom" may have prefigured later political trends.</p>

Standard tickets that were priced at over $470 earlier in the week were reduced to just $13.40. This move is part of a dynamic pricing strategy used for the tournament. The price drop follows similar reductions for quarter-final matches in other cities. In contrast, tickets for the other semi-final between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid still start at nearly $200, suggesting a significant difference in demand.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that ranked-choice voting (RCV) was a major winner in the recent New York City mayoral primary, which saw long-shot progressive Zohran Mamdani secure the Democratic nomination. The author contends that RCV fostered a more positive, issue-focused campaign by eliminating the "spoiler" effect and incentivizing candidates to build coalitions and seek second-choice votes. This allowed a lesser-known candidate to gain momentum without the pressure for progressives to consolidate early behind a single choice. The high turnout and positive voter feedback suggest RCV can create more engaging and representative elections.</p>
