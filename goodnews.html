          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly advised President Donald Trump to decline the gift of a $400 million jet from the Qatari royal family, citing national security concerns. Pence stated that Qatar has a history of "playing both sides" and that accepting such a gift would be inconsistent with U.S. security and intelligence needs. He suggested that if Qatar wishes to make a gift to the United States, the funds should be invested in infrastructure on a U.S. military base. Trump had previously indicated that he might accept the aircraft due to delays at U.S. manufacturer Boeing.</p>

          <p>UK strawberry growers anticipate a particularly sweet and successful season in 2025 due to warm days and cool nights, which enhance the fruit's natural sugars. Despite a dry spring and warnings of potential drought, growers have irrigation systems in place to ensure a steady water supply. The warmer weather has also accelerated the ripening process, leading to an earlier harvest and increased production. Consumers can expect a plentiful supply of high-quality, flavorful strawberries throughout the summer, though farmers still hope for some rain to further aid their crops.</p>
