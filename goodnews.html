Matsui, who flew from the United States to Japan for the visit, spent over two hours at Nagashima's home, reminiscing about their shared memories.

          <p>Japanese police have arrested four individuals for allegedly selling elephant tusks as mammoth tusks at online auctions to circumvent trade restrictions. The suspects, including an executive from Daigo Ivory Co., are accused of violating the Unfair Competition Prevention Act. The company allegedly sold elephant tusks and ivory products worth around 100 million yen annually by falsely labeling them as mammoth ivory. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) generally prohibits international trade in elephant ivory to combat poaching.</p>

Experts point to NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a near-identical orbit in 2011, as a prior achievement.
