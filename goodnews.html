          <p>Shares in Danish renewable energy company Orsted saw a significant increase of over 6% following a U.S. court ruling. The decision grants a preliminary injunction, allowing Orsted to resume construction on its nearly finished Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. This legal victory provides a major reprieve for the company, as the project had been halted by an executive order from the Trump administration, which has taken a hardline stance against wind power development in favor of fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>Shares in Kingfisher, a major UK home improvement company, surged by 18% after it raised its financial outlook, citing rising domestic demand. The positive news from Kingfisher contributed to a broader optimistic sentiment in European markets, which opened higher following a rally on Wall Street. The U.S. rally was sparked by Nvidia's announcement of a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which propelled major U.S. indexes to new record highs and boosted European chip stocks. The market report also noted gains for Danish wind farm developer Orsted after a favorable U.S. court ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the White House's announcement blaming Tylenol for high autism rates, scientific experts are emphasizing that research does not support a causal link. Medical professionals state that extensive studies show no causal effect, and that autism is a complex disorder linked to polygenetic risks and potential environmental factors, not a single medication ingredient. Experts also attribute the rise in autism diagnoses to broader diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, while reiterating that the debunked theory linking vaccines to autism has been vigorously disproven by decades of research.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England has launched a new initiative called 'Jess's Rule,' urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis if a patient presents with the same or worsening symptoms three times. The guidance is named after Jessica Brady, who died from advanced cancer at age 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. The rule, while not a law, is designed to improve patient safety by prompting doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or refer to specialists, particularly for younger patients whose serious illnesses are sometimes overlooked.</p>

          <p>ABC is bringing 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' back on the air, ending an 'indefinite' suspension that created a significant public relations backlash for the network and its parent company, Disney. Kimmel was suspended for comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which were widely seen as tone-deaf and inaccurate. However, the network's decision, perceived as caving to government pressure, drew widespread condemnation from free speech advocates, celebrities, and media figures, forcing the company to reverse its course to mitigate the damage to its reputation.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's efforts to roll back low-carbon initiatives, global investment in renewable energy technologies reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, a 10% increase from the previous year. A report from Zero Carbon Analytics highlights the sector's resilience and momentum, with total energy investment expected to reach $3.3 trillion this year, two-thirds of which is allocated to low-carbon sources. The analysis also notes that major corporations continue to pursue net-zero targets, indicating that market and state-level commitments are counteracting federal policy shifts in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article looks back 40 years to the 1985 Ryder Cup, a pivotal moment when Team Europe, led by captain Tony Jacklin, secured its first victory over the dominant United States, effectively reviving the competition. Decades of American wins had diminished interest in the event, but Jacklin's leadership transformed the European approach, demanding better resources and fostering a stronger team identity with stars like Seve Ballesteros. The victory at The Belfry, followed by another in 1987, marked a major turning point, transforming the Ryder Cup into the highly competitive global sporting event it is today.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in frozen federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The ruling for a preliminary injunction stated the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by suspending the funds without specific explanations. The grants, primarily from the National Institutes of Health for medical research, were part of a larger $584 million freeze related to administration allegations of civil rights violations. This decision follows similar legal challenges where courts have ruled against the administration's use of funding cuts at universities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis suggests that modern football is seeing a resurgence of tactics once championed by manager Sam Allardyce, such as direct, long-ball play and a strong emphasis on set-pieces. This article explores how top-tier teams are increasingly moving away from possession-based build-up from the back, a style Allardyce criticized, in favor of strategies that utilize tall strikers and prioritize forward passes. With 27.7% of non-penalty goals this season coming from set-pieces and top clubs signing physically imposing forwards, the once-criticized 'Big Sam' approach appears to be gaining new appreciation for its effectiveness.</p>
