          <p>Chinese authorities are increasing their crackdown on the illegal smuggling of rare earth minerals, which they describe as a "severe" national security issue. A special operation launched in May has led to arrests, as officials combat increasingly covert tactics like false declarations and transshipment through third countries. To strengthen enforcement, China plans to establish a joint coordination center for export controls on dual-use items. The government is emphasizing a high-pressure approach to prevent the illegal outflow of these strategic resources and related technologies.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's recent visit to China for a major supply chain expo signals a potential easing of Sino-US trade tensions. During his trip, it was announced that Washington had approved the export of a specialized, less powerful AI chip for the Chinese market. Huang's optimistic presence, along with a 15% increase in US firm participation at the expo, reflects a recent agreement on a trade negotiation framework. Despite the positive gestures, underlying concerns about the broader technology trade war between the two nations persist.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claim That Sunscreen Increases Skin Cancer Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 08:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral social media claim suggesting that sunscreen use increases skin cancer risk is false, according to health experts and fact-checkers. The article refutes the assertion, clarifying that there is no scientific evidence to support this link and that UV radiation remains the primary cause of melanoma. The rising number of skin cancer cases is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and more consistent reporting, not sunscreen use. While global sunscreen sales are increasing, polls indicate that many people still use it inconsistently, underscoring the importance of proper sun protection.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in payment processing company Global Payments, signaling a potential push for strategic changes. The company's stock has significantly underperformed since 2021, and its recent large acquisition of Worldpay was poorly received by the market. Elliott is known for driving value through board-level changes and improved execution, which could help restore investor confidence in Global Payments' ability to integrate the new acquisition. A reconstituted board with Elliott's influence could enforce an M&A moratorium and focus on deleveraging and share buybacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the Australian Wallabies 27-19 in the first Test of their series in Brisbane, taking a 1-0 lead. The Lions established a dominant 24-5 lead early in the second half with powerful and precise play, including tries from Sione Tuipulotu and Tom Curry. However, their performance faltered in the final 30 minutes as they lost discipline and accuracy, allowing the Wallabies to narrow the score. While the Lions secured the win, their late-game collapse has raised concerns ahead of the next match in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, a summer camp for youth with disabilities, located 30 miles downstream from the tragic Camp Mystic incident, has reopened due to a massive volunteer cleanup effort. Camp Camp in Centre Point suffered extensive damage, but a social media plea mobilized hundreds of volunteers who cleared debris and repaired the site. This community response enabled the camp, which serves over 800 campers with a 1:1 counselor ratio, to continue its 46-year mission. The story stands as a beacon of hope amid a disaster that has claimed over 135 lives.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman who believed she had a pulled muscle from working out was diagnosed with metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread to her brain and lungs. Unusually, her cancer did not present with a skin mole, but rather as a lump in her groin. She underwent an intensive treatment combining gamma knife radiation and immunotherapy, which, despite severe side effects, has proven highly effective. After 18 months, her cancer has not progressed, and her doctors consider her a "Stage IV miracle," offering hope for long-term survival in a case that highlights the importance of investigating unusual symptoms.</p>

          <p>Over the past 25 years, China has dramatically deepened its relationship with African nations through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). Since the forum's inception in 2000, trade has surged nearly 30-fold, and Chinese investment has grown almost 100-fold. This economic partnership has been paralleled by increased security cooperation, with China becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent and now training around 2,000 African military officers annually. This strategic engagement has allowed China to "leapfrog" other global powers like the US and France in building influence across Africa.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is significantly reducing its Military Working Equid program, making 141 of its 236 horses, donkeys, and mules available for adoption. These animals primarily serve in ceremonial roles, such as parades, honor guards, and funeral processions at Arlington National Cemetery. While the Army has not used equids in combat since 1942, these animals are considered a vital, living connection to American military heritage. The move is expected to save approximately $2 million annually, but the Army will retain some animals for key ceremonial duties.</p>

          <p>A viral social media trend known as the "Gen Z stare" has ignited a conversation about generational differences in communication. Older generations describe it as a blank, unresponsive look from younger people, particularly in customer service interactions, which they interpret as a lack of social skills or even rejection. Psychology experts suggest this may be partly due to Gen Z's social development being shaped by the internet and pandemic lockdowns, leading to different interaction styles. While some Zoomers deny its existence, the discourse highlights how technology and life experiences shape the social cues and values of each generation.</p>

The campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first authority to implement such a policy, where a person with a prognosis of less than 12 months to live is spared the tax. Advocates argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a severe income shock and additional costs, making a council tax exemption a compassionate and practical way to provide priceless peace of mind. The Local Government Association notes that some support is already available.</p>
