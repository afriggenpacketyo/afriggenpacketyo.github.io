          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 19:08:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to center on increasing defense spending by European allies, a key demand of President Donald Trump. Secretary General Mark Rutte aims to avoid conflict with the U.S. by addressing Trump's concerns, though divisions remain on trade, Russia, and the Middle East conflict. While Trump has consistently criticized NATO allies for insufficient spending, some European nations are already boosting their defense budgets due to both Trump's pressure and concerns over Russian aggression. The summit's brevity and focus on specific topics are intended to minimize visible disagreements among member states. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, months after his arrest by ICE. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was detained under charges that Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued could pose "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences." The judge expressed skepticism regarding the government's justification for detaining Khalil and suggested his arrest was related to his protests. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and his release allows him to reunite with his family. </p>

The ruling backs a previous order from a U.S. District Judge, but the Louisiana Attorney General intends to appeal the decision. </p>
