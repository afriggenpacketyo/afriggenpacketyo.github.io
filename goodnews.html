The artists continued to collaborate closely, and the song's legacy remains strong, with fans still acting out Don Omar's part in concerts.</p>

          <p>The enforced skort rule in camogie, a traditional Irish sport, has ignited a debate about sexism and player comfort. Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams criticized the rule, stating that it "screams sexism" and urging the Camogie Association to allow players to choose between skorts and shorts. A recent survey revealed that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing the skort, and 83% wanted the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress to vote on the issue.</p>
