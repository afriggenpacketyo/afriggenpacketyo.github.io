          <h2>Five Survive 36 Hours in Alligator-Infested Swamp After Plane Crash</h2>

          <p>Five people, including three women, a child, and the pilot, survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon region of Bolivia after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The survivors stood atop the submerged plane, encircled by alligators, and managed to stay alive by eating cassava flour brought by one of the passengers. The pilot believes that leaking petrol from the plane kept the predators at bay, and they also spotted an anaconda in the water. Local fishermen eventually discovered the craft, leading to a helicopter rescue.</p>

          <h2>Assisted Dying Could Account for Over 4,000 Deaths Annually a Decade After Law Change</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 03:56:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A policy review suggests that assisted dying could account for over 4,000 deaths annually a decade after its legalization in England and Wales, though this would still represent less than 1% of all deaths. The review, an official impact assessment, also provides a financial analysis, estimating potential NHS savings ranging from ¬£5.84m to ¬£59.6m after ten years, due to reduced hospital and care costs. However, it also anticipates costs exceeding ¬£10m annually for staffing an assisted dying service, with additional expenses for training and review panels. While proponents emphasize the compassionate aspect of providing choice at the end of life, opponents raise concerns about the potential risks to vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <h2>Antivenom Developed From Man Bitten Over 200 Times by Snakes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 02:29:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies found in the blood of Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antibodies protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species in animal tests, offering a potential solution to the challenge of matching antivenoms to specific snake species. Friede's 18-year mission, documented on YouTube, aims to create a universal antivenom to combat snakebites, which kill up to 140,000 people annually. The research identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin, and a cocktail of these antibodies protected mice from fatal doses of venom from 13 of 19 deadly snake species.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the local currency, which had risen above its trading band against the US dollar due to capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion worth of local currency in its first market intervention in two years. This intervention comes ahead of the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where interest rate cuts are expected, potentially leading to further capital inflow to Hong Kong. The HKMA stated that it will continue to monitor the market to ensure orderly operations in Hong Kong's money and foreign exchange markets.</p>

          <p>World, a start-up co-founded by Sam Altman of OpenAI, has launched in the United States, aiming to verify human identity online using iris scans. The company's World ID program involves users scanning their irises with a glowing white sphere called the Orb, in exchange for cryptocurrency. The goal is to differentiate humans from AI bots in a world increasingly populated by AI-generated content. World, which has already raised $200 million from investors, plans to open retail outposts in several US cities, despite privacy concerns and regulatory challenges in other countries.</p>
