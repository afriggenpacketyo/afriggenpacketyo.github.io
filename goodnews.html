          <p>Luang Prabang, Laos, has experienced a significant economic boom due to tourism, with visitor numbers increasing by 162% and over 16,000 families escaping poverty. Officials attribute this success to improvements in infrastructure and utilities, declaring Luang Prabang poverty-free. However, Laos as a whole still struggles with poverty, with nearly 17% of families living in poverty as of 2023, and faces challenges including inflation and public debt. While tourism offers potential for further growth, analysts caution that not all visitors, such as those in ‚Äúzero-dollar‚Äù tour groups, contribute meaningfully to the local economy.</p>

          <p>Meta has entered into a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase approximately 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. The deal, set to begin in June 2027, will support the continued operation and relicensing of the plant, which was at risk of closure due to the expiration of its zero-emissions credit. The power generated will contribute to Meta's goal of achieving 100% clean electricity, although it will be supplied to the regional grid rather than directly powering Meta's data centers. Constellation shares experienced a significant rally of over 15% following the announcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a marine fungus that shows promise in breaking down polypropylene, a common plastic used in food packaging and automobile parts. A team at the University of Sydney found that a terrestrial fungus could degrade polypropylene by 21% after 30 days, and this new marine-derived fungus may exceed that rate. The process involves pretreating the plastic with heat or UV light and then combining it with the fungus in a liquid solution. Researchers are working to optimize the process for industrial scaling, though they caution that it is not a complete solution to the plastic waste crisis.</p>
