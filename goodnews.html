          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices soared to record highs after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party elected Sanae Takaichi, a conservative and pro-stimulus advocate, as its new leader. This move positions Takaichi to potentially become Japan's first female prime minister. Analysts expect her administration to maintain accommodative monetary policies and expand investment through public-private partnerships, signaling a significant shift in economic direction. The yen weakened, and bond yields rose, reflecting market reactions to the political and economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to restart some production this week, beginning with its Wolverhampton engine factory, after a major cyber-attack forced a month-long shutdown of operations. Full capacity across all sites, including those in Slovakia, China, and India, is expected to take several weeks. The attack, attributed to "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters," is estimated to have cost JLR at least £50m weekly in lost production. The government has provided a £1.5bn loan guarantee to support affected suppliers, some of whom faced severe financial pressure and layoffs.</p>

Director Rob Reiner explained the film's unscripted nature, likening the actors' improv to jazz musicians.

          <p>China is heavily investing in AI and robotics, aiming to reduce its reliance on imported high-end chips and challenge US dominance. Companies like DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Huawei are unveiling powerful new chips and strategies to compete with Nvidia, with some claims of matching performance. While Nvidia acknowledges the competition, experts caution that China's chips may still lag in complex analytics despite progress. The article highlights China's vast talent pool and intense domestic competition, but also notes potential obstacles in its state-led approach and less user-friendly products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed $100,000 H-1B visa fee hike is prompting India to actively encourage skilled professionals to return, aiming for a "reverse brain drain." While some anecdotal evidence suggests a shift in sentiment, particularly among those facing US immigration uncertainty, large-scale migration faces significant challenges. Platforms like B2I are assisting returnees, and Indian headhunters report increased interest from Ivy League graduates. However, experts argue that sustained government effort and stronger incentives are needed to compete with global opportunities and overcome existing pull factors for outward migration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced significant housing market reforms designed to cut costs, reduce delays, and halve failed property sales, potentially saving first-time buyers an average of £710. Key proposals include legally requiring sellers and agents to provide upfront property information and introducing binding contracts to prevent late withdrawals. The reforms also aim to boost professional standards with a new Code of Practice and performance data. This overhaul is part of a broader housing strategy, with a full roadmap expected next year, and is generally welcomed by industry leaders.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Football pundit Danny Murphy suggests Mohamed Salah's reduced defensive work is becoming a "little problem" for Liverpool, particularly against stronger opponents. While Salah's attacking freedom makes him a potent scorer, the lack of cover from players behind him creates defensive overloads on the right flank. This issue, evident in a recent loss to Chelsea, contributes to Liverpool's perceived lack of game control compared to last season. Despite concerns, Murphy believes Salah's goal-scoring form will improve and the team can address these balance issues as new players integrate and reach peak fitness.</p>

          <p>Historian Martin Powers discusses how visual evidence, particularly art, offers unique insights into imperial China's political and social history. He explains that public images can reveal widely understood normative views, such as the story of a Han dynasty prime minister respecting local jurisdiction. Powers argues that art "participates" in political debate, illustrating intergroup relations and concepts like "honour" in aristocracies, where dominant figures are depicted exercising arbitrary privilege over subordinates. This approach helps understand how ancient political ideas resonate with modern Western societies.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer observes market complacency, noting that government shutdowns no longer deter investors, with many expecting rate cuts to fuel further gains. He attributes the current speculative bull market to a post-"Liberation Day" rally, triggered by President Trump's swift reversal on tariffs, creating a "Trump put." This has emboldened a new generation of buyers chasing parabolic moves in tech and quantum stocks, often ignoring traditional metrics. Cramer, while acknowledging the "magical investing" year, advises taking profits, especially on highly appreciated assets, to mitigate future risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that China, having been the world's largest exporter for 16 years, should now aim to become the largest importer within the next five to ten years. This strategic shift, to be considered in the upcoming 15th five-year plan, is crucial for accelerating its transition to a consumption-driven economy and addressing structural imbalances. The article suggests this evolution would have profound geopolitical and economic implications, moving beyond the "made in China" era to one of "consumed in China," marking a pivotal development in its global economic strategy.</p>

This highlights SNL's expanded focus on virtual spaces and niche online trends, alongside traditional political commentary.
