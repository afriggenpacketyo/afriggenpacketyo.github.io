          <p>A small 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The tremor was felt across the New York City area, causing brief shaking and startling residents, but no significant damage or injuries have been reported. The event follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such minor quakes are not uncommon on the East Coast and are not typically a cause for alarm.</p>

          <h2>Florida Overtakes California in Utility-Scale Solar Energy Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 15:48:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surprisingly surpassed California in new utility-scale solar capacity, driven primarily by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop installations. This growth is attributed to favorable economics, as solar becomes cheaper than natural gas, and a state rule that fast-tracks the approval process for projects under 75 megawatts. However, the future of this boom faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. The success of solar-powered communities like Babcock Ranch, which withstood Hurricane Ian, highlights the resilience of decentralized solar energy.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has announced that applications for a $50 billion rural hospital stabilization fund will be available in early September. The fund was created as part of recent legislation to offset the impact of significant cuts to Medicaid, which raised concerns about the financial viability of rural hospitals. According to Dr. Oz, the money is intended to support workforce development, system right-sizing, and the implementation of technology like telehealth to improve healthcare delivery in underserved rural areas.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0 by manufacturing runs through aggressive baserunning, situational hitting, and a key sacrifice fly, rather than relying on home runs. The victory came after a prolonged scoring drought and provided a much-needed boost for the team's slumping lineup. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game despite a tense ninth inning. The win allowed the Dodgers to conclude their nine-game road trip with a winning record.</p>

They are leveraging their experience as prosecutors to appeal to voters, framing their campaigns as a continuation of their public service and a direct challenge to the current administration's direction.</p>

While the eruption was accompanied by a 7.0-magnitude quake and a brief tsunami warning, authorities reported that the ash was spreading over the Pacific Ocean and not affecting populated areas. Volcanologists are noting this as the first historically confirmed eruption of this specific volcano in centuries.</p>
