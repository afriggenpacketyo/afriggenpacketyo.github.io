          <p>In a move interpreted as a strong affirmation of Canadian sovereignty against potential encroachment from the United States under President Trump, Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to address the Canadian Parliament. This invitation marks a significant shift in Canada's relationship with the Crown, as it emphasizes the country's unique identity and traditions distinct from its southern neighbor. The King's visit underscores Canada's independence at a time when economic stability is threatened by US tariffs and political pressure. While the monarchy's relevance is debated among Canadians, this symbolic gesture highlights the enduring ties between Canada and the British Crown. ()</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, congratulating cadets and taking credit for rebuilding the U.S. military.

Trump also claimed a new peacetime recruiting record, though reports suggest the improvements began before his administration. His address followed Vice President Vance's speech at the Naval Academy, which highlighted the administration's focus on specific goals in military missions and honored the sacrifices of service members.

          <p>Billy Joel has cancelled his summer tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. NPH involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to symptoms that can mimic aging or other neurological disorders like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The condition is treatable with surgery to relieve pressure on the brain, and Joel's public announcement may raise awareness and encourage others to seek diagnosis and treatment. Despite the setback, Joel is undergoing physical therapy and hopes to return to performing in the future. ()</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi's 'Un Simple Accident,' a film shot in secret, won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, capping what was widely seen as one of the strongest festivals in years. Panahi, a longtime festival favorite who had been barred from making movies or traveling outside Iran, drew inspiration from stories he heard from other inmates while he was at Evin Prison in Tehran. The movie tracks a group of men and women who join together after one of them kidnaps a man they believe tortured them in prison. ()</p>

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for "It Was Just an Accident", spoke out against the restrictions of the Iranian regime. Panahi, previously imprisoned and banned from filmmaking, urged fellow Iranians to set aside differences and fight for freedom. "It Was Just an Accident" was shot in secret and based partly on Panahi's experiences in prison, focusing on state violence and revenge. Despite the risks of prosecution, Panahi vowed to return to Tehran after the festival. ()</p>
