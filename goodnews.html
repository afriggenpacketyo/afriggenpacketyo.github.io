          <p>Global shares exhibited mixed trading activity as markets anticipate a potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this week. European markets saw gains, while Asian markets were varied amid ongoing concerns about China's slowing economy, which has been impacted by U.S. tariffs. Data from China indicated a slowdown in retail sales, prompting expectations of further domestic stimulus. The upcoming Fed decision is a focal point for investors, as a failure to cut rates could lead to market disappointment and a potential downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta acted arbitrarily and violated the freedom of expression of adult content actress Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. The court found that Meta applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, as other accounts with similar content remained active, and failed to provide a clear justification for the closure. As a result, the court has ordered Meta to review and adjust Instagram's terms of use to ensure users are clearly informed about how to challenge content moderation decisions. This ruling adds to a growing trend of South American courts holding social media platforms accountable for their content policies.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is initiating a weeklong national effort to register new voters, focusing on battleground states and college campuses. This direct involvement comes in response to data showing a significant decline in registered Democrats and a corresponding increase in Republican registrations between 2020 and 2024. The drive, called the National Voter Registration Week of Action, aims to reverse these trends by holding over 50 events across 27 states and territories. The initiative reflects a strategic shift for the party, which has previously relied more on outside groups for such efforts.</p>

The Warner Family Foundation will offer scholarships to young artists, while a second initiative, River & Ember, is dedicated to strengthening parent-child bonds. This marks the first time Tenisha Warner has been publicly identified, as the family had maintained their privacy before the actor's tragic drowning death in July. The announcement, made on their wedding anniversary, was met with widespread support and celebrates Warner's commitment to family and the arts.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Steve Cohen have reintroduced legislation aimed at banning employers from using credit reports to vet job applicants. The bill seeks to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act, arguing that denying employment based on financial history is discriminatory and illogical, as it disproportionately affects minority groups and women. Proponents state that poor credit is often linked to circumstances like medical debt or unemployment and does not correlate with job performance. The proposed law would prevent employers from requesting credit histories and stop credit agencies from providing them for employment purposes.</p>

          <p>Charges have been dropped against two British men, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China. The prosecutor informed the court that the Crown Prosecution Service would offer no evidence against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, stating that the case could not continue. Both men had previously denied violating the Official Secrets Act by allegedly gathering information beneficial to an enemy state. The arrests had drawn significant attention, with Beijing dismissing the allegations as "malicious slander" and a "self-staged political farce."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to make a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom, an honor never before extended to a U.S. president. The visit, initiated by an invitation from King Charles via Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is seen by the British government as a key diplomatic opportunity to leverage Trump's known admiration for the royal family. Analysts suggest the UK is using its "soft power" to influence the president on critical issues like continued support for Ukraine. Despite Trump's unpopularity in the UK, the visit underscores the strategic importance of the personal relationship in international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Magnesium lotion has become a popular trend on social media, with influencers claiming it improves sleep and alleviates various ailments when applied to the skin. However, medical experts express skepticism, noting there is little scientific evidence to support the idea that magnesium can be effectively absorbed through the skin. Dermatologists suggest that any perceived benefits are more likely due to the moisturizing properties of the lotion or the relaxing effect of the massage used to apply it. While doctors say the lotion is likely harmless, they caution that it is not a proven medical treatment for sleep disorders.</p>
