          <p>A boiler room explosion caused a partial collapse of a 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx, leaving a gaping hole in its side, yet miraculously, no injuries were reported. This article explains that the blast, potentially linked to the activation of the building's heating system, sent debris raining down and led to the evacuation of 38 apartments. Officials, including Mayor Eric Adams, expressed gratitude for the lack of casualties, while residents voiced concerns over the building's structural integrity and existing violations for unsafe facades. Inspections are ongoing, and demolition of the chimney remnants is planned to restore services.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong and mainland Chinese consumers are demonstrating adaptability to the significant surge in gold prices, which have climbed over 48% this year, as demand for wedding jewelry persists.

          <p>Maxwell House coffee has launched a viral marketing campaign, rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to humorously address the severe housing affordability crisis in the US. This article reports that the campaign, designed to connect with a growing population of renters, highlights the challenges faced by first-time homebuyers, whose median age has risen to 38. With fewer than 16% of homes affordable for typical households, the "tongue-in-cheek" approach aims to resonate with consumers struggling with high prices and mortgage rates. The initiative offers a year's supply of coffee for "under $40," playfully dubbed a "12-month lease."</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed against Nirvana, claiming that the depiction of Spencer Elden as a naked four-month-old baby on their iconic "Nevermind" album cover constituted child pornography, has been dismissed for a second time. This article reports that Judge Fernando Olguin ruled the image was not pornographic, describing it instead as resembling a "family photo of a nude child bathing." Elden had sought damages for alleged sexual exploitation and ongoing personal harm. The judge also rejected Elden's argument that his injuries extended into adulthood, which would have allowed the case to bypass the statute of limitations.

The ruling underscores the city's ongoing vulnerability to terrorist attacks, a concern highlighted by NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who warned that such cuts would significantly compromise public safety.
