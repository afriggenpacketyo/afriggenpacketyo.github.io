          <p>Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif is now subject to mandatory genetic sex testing mandated by World Boxing before being allowed to compete again. World Boxing announced it will introduce mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers, partly due to the controversy surrounding Khelif after the boxer won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics. The organization said athletes need to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete. The test, which can be conducted by nasal/mouth swab, saliva or blood, reveals the presence of the Y chromosome.</p>

          <p>The eastern Chinese city of Nanjing employs a fleet of drones each night to patrol potentially problematic areas, using artificial intelligence to plan patrol routes. The AI focuses on areas often ignored by human patrols, as part of China's broader efforts to scale up the use of AI in urban management. This initiative aims to better handle complex challenges brought by rapid urbanization, with the Chinese leadership viewing AI as a tool for economic transformation and governance refinement. Despite progress, China's AI governance faces challenges, including privacy protection and limited community involvement, mirroring issues worldwide.</p>

The vehicle, valued at approximately ¬£300,000, will be used for official purposes. The gift was included in a list of official gifts received by members of the Royal Family from 2020 to 2023, which also included items such as feather crowns and Blue Peter badges. Official gifts can be worn and used but are not considered the royals' personal property and eventually become part of the Royal Collection.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed in April, with consumer prices rising just 2.1% compared to a year earlier, indicating a decline from previous months. Despite rising incomes, consumer spending slowed, potentially reflecting caution in response to higher goods prices. Economists and business executives had warned that widespread tariffs could lead to higher prices, but the timing and impact of those duties are uncertain due to ongoing legal challenges. Federal Reserve officials are closely monitoring the impact of tariffs on inflation and jobs (not investment advice).</p>

The air wing lost three F/A-18s during the deployment, but no crew members were harmed. Despite the incidents, the air wing was described as persevering.</p>

          <p>Amy Jones scored her first international century after waiting 12 years, 225 matches and 190 innings, helping England to a win against West Indies. Jones was promoted back up the order by new leadership Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards, and she repaid the faith immediately. Jones said the simplicity of Edwards' approach helped take the pressure off upon her return to the top. It was a special moment for her, especially with the opportunity to bat at the top of the order at the start of her career.</p>
