        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservative Party, announced plans to abolish stamp duty on the purchase of main homes in England and Northern Ireland, aiming to significantly boost home ownership for millions. This surprise policy, revealed at the party conference, is part of a broader strategy to regain economic credibility and establish clear dividing lines with political opponents. The estimated £9 billion cost would be funded by £47 billion in planned savings from welfare, foreign aid, and civil service cuts. Badenoch's address also outlined other policy pledges, including scrapping business rates and carbon tax, in an effort to present a "bold" new direction for the party.</p>

          <p>Freida Parton, Dolly Parton's sister, clarified a previous social media post that caused widespread concern among fans regarding the country icon's health. Freida explained that Dolly has been "a little under the weather" and required some medical procedures, prompting her heartfelt request for prayers, but assured the public it was "nothing more than a little sister asking for prayers." Dolly had previously postponed her upcoming Las Vegas concerts, jokingly referring to it as her "100,000-mile check-up" and affirming she would return to performing after a brief slowdown. The update aimed to alleviate fan worries, emphasizing Dolly's inherent strength and continued engagement in various projects.</p>

          <p>AST SpaceMobile announced a definitive commercial agreement with Verizon to provide direct-to-cell phone service from space, with deployment slated to begin next year. This expansion of their existing partnership aims to deliver space-based cellular broadband coverage across the continental United States for Verizon customers "when needed," particularly in underserved areas. AST shares surged approximately 12% following the announcement, reflecting significant investor confidence in the volatile space stock. The deal leverages Verizon's 850 MHz premium low-band spectrum and follows successful capabilities tests of AST's network, which aims to create the first global cellular network operating directly through standard devices.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) offered OpenAI 10% ownership as part of a multibillion-dollar partnership, describing the move as "imaginative, unique and surprising." The deal commits OpenAI to purchasing 6 gigawatts of AMD chips, including the forthcoming MI450 series, with vesting milestones tied to deployment volume and AMD's share price. Huang contrasted this arrangement with Nvidia's own $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which allows direct sales, and also confirmed Nvidia's involvement in Elon Musk's xAI funding round. AMD shares surged 35% this week, intensifying competition in the AI chip market and challenging Nvidia's dominance.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claims of Gen Z-Led US Church Revival</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact check debunks viral social media claims suggesting that Generation Z is currently leading a significant church revival in the United States, often citing a study by the Christian research firm Barna Group. While the Barna study indeed notes a slight increase in attendance frequency among *existing* Gen Z churchgoers compared to other age groups, it does not indicate a broader nationwide resurgence in faith or that Gen Z attends more frequently than older generations overall. Crucially, the Barna data measures how often current churchgoers participate, not the total proportion of each generation attending. Other research, such as Pew Research Center surveys, consistently shows younger Americans remain significantly less religious than older demographics.</p>

          <h2>Century-Old Grenades Discovered in French Onion Shipment to Netherlands</h2>

          <p>Dutch authorities made an unusual and concerning discovery when two century-old hand grenades were found hidden among French onions destined for a factory in the northern province of Zeeland. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) identified the projectiles as consistent with pre-1925 French and German manufactured old chemical weapons, though the specific chemical fill could not be definitively identified. The reason for their unexpected presence within the delivery remains an unsolved mystery. These dangerous grenades will now be transferred as toxic waste to a specialized chemical dismantling facility in Poelkapelle, Belgium, for destruction, as the Netherlands lacks such a dedicated facility.</p>

          <h2>Wedding Attendance Costs Rival Monthly Rent, Impacting Young Adults' Finances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 10:47:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report highlights a significant financial burden for young adults, revealing that attending a single wedding, including a bachelor or bachelorette weekend, can cost approximately $2,010, which is comparable to the typical monthly rent of $2,007. This expense profoundly impacts financial stability, with 45% of surveyed Gen Z and millennial adults reporting housing sacrifices, such as living with roommates or saving less for a down payment, to afford these celebrations. Housing unaffordability already keeps many young people renting longer, with the median age of first-time homebuyers at 38. Financial experts advise early savings and careful consideration of which events to attend to avoid accumulating debt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German government has increased its economic growth forecasts, now expecting a narrow avoidance of stagnation in 2025 with a projected 0.2% growth, an upgrade from the previous zero estimate. Projections for 2026 and 2027 have also been raised to 1.3% and 1.4% respectively, signaling an anticipated low-level recovery by autumn 2025. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche stated that a substantial part of this growth will stem from higher state financing, particularly for infrastructural investments and increased defense spending. However, these projections face criticism for relying on public debt, and Reiche emphasized the ongoing need for lower energy prices and tax reforms to spur further sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>Joan Bennett Kennedy, the first wife of the late U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy and mother of a congressman, has died at the age of 89. Her marriage inextricably tied her to the prominent American political dynasty, a life marked by public service alongside tumultuous personal struggles, including battles with alcoholism and the highly publicized infidelities of her husband. She maintained remarkable composure through profound family tragedies, including the assassinations of John F. and Robert Kennedy, and her young son's battle with bone cancer. Following her divorce, she pursued further education and gradually re-entered public life, serving on cultural councils and authoring a guide to classical music.</p>

          <p>President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act introduces significant changes to the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption, making C corporation status notably more attractive for startups. The bill expands the capital gains tax exclusion cap from $10 million to $15 million for stock acquired after July 4, 2025, and reduces the minimum holding period for partial exclusion benefits. This change, coupled with an increased gross asset limit for qualifying C corps, aims to facilitate greater access to capital for fast-growing ventures. It offers substantial tax savings for founders and early employees, potentially saving shareholders nearly $1.2 million in taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

These unions, despite their differing ages, share crucial common priorities such as protections for mothers, overcoming underinvestment, and securing healthy work environments. This robust collaboration is proving essential for emerging leagues, significantly amplifying their collective strength in negotiations and in the face of corporate interests.</p>
