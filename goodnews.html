          <p>Jim Lovell, the celebrated astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guided its crew back to Earth, has passed away at the age of 97. NASA praised him for turning a "potential tragedy into a success" after an onboard explosion aborted the 1970 moon landing attempt. Lovell was the first person to fly to the Moon twice but never landed on its surface, and his life was immortalized in the 1995 film "Apollo 13." Tributes from his family and actor Tom Hanks remembered his unshakeable optimism and leadership in pushing the boundaries of human exploration.</p>

          <p>Welsh athlete Louis Rees-Zammit has decided to end his venture into the NFL and return to rugby union, a move that comes after a brief period with the Jacksonville Jaguars. His American football dream was cut short by a combination of factors, including a back injury and a coaching staff change, which diminished his chances of making the active roster. Despite his determination, experts noted the immense athletic and technical gap he faced in the NFL. His return is being hailed as a major boost for Welsh rugby, with coaches and former players believing he will come back a more mature and skilled athlete.</p>

          <p>In a significant scientific breakthrough, a team of Chinese scientists has successfully created large, high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a lab setting. This rare form of diamond, with a distinct atomic structure, was first discovered in a meteorite in 1967 and was believed to form under immense impact pressure. Previous attempts by global research teams to synthesize the material resulted in mixed-phase samples. This achievement, published in the journal Nature, provides the first definitive proof of the material’s macroscopic existence and opens new possibilities for its application.</p>

          <p>Rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a surprisingly strong performance in his NFL preseason debut for the Cleveland Browns, throwing for 138 yards and two touchdowns. Sanders, a fifth-round draft pick who fell dramatically in the draft, showed impressive poise and awareness, leading three touchdown drives. His performance earned praise from NBA star LeBron James and has put him in the conversation for a more significant role on the team. Despite the positive start, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski remained cautious, stating that players must continue to earn their roles.</p>

          <p>After experiencing profound fatigue with dating apps, 30-year-old Londoner Lucy Rout founded Haystack Dating, a company that organizes in-person connection events. She found that the cycle of ghosting and bad behavior on apps led to dating burnout and low confidence. Haystack's events use an algorithm to group attendees with similar interests for activities like cricket or rugby, aiming to foster more accountable and meaningful interactions. The model taps into a growing trend of people seeking real-life connections as an alternative to the psychological distress associated with online dating.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described the discovery that he is genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's disease as a "gear shift" in his life's motivations. After a genetic test revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his risk by eight to ten times, Hemsworth says he began to question his purpose more deeply. The 41-year-old star explained that the revelation prompted a shift from focusing on what he could collect in life to what he could contribute. This change in mindset is explored in the second season of his show, "Limitless: Live Better Now."</p>

          <h2>The 'Treatonomics' Trend Sees Consumers Spending on Small Luxuries and Big Experiences Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is booming as people seek mood boosts during periods of economic uncertainty. This behavior involves spending on both small, affordable luxuries like makeup and larger, memorable experiences such as concert tickets. An evolution of the "lipstick effect," this trend is driven by a post-pandemic re-evaluation of well-being and a desire for joy when traditional milestones like homeownership feel unattainable. Analysts note that consumers are cutting back on daily essentials to afford these guilt-free treats that inject happiness into fraught times. (not investment advice)</p>
