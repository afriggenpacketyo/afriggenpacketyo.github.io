          <p>Roanoke College in Virginia has reinstated its varsity football team for the first time since 1942, joining a trend of smaller colleges using the sport to attract more students, particularly men. While administrators hope football will increase overall enrollment and school spirit, research suggests that any enrollment spike is often temporary and primarily affects male student numbers. Despite this, institutions like Roanoke are investing in athletics to create a more vibrant campus and address the widening gender gap in higher education, where women now significantly outnumber men. The strategy aims to foster a sense of belonging and community in a competitive academic landscape.</p>

          <p>Child development and technology experts are urging parents to proactively discuss artificial intelligence with their children, as teens increasingly use tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support. The article suggests that parents should educate themselves on AI, explore the technology alongside their kids, and establish clear household rules for its use. While AI can be a valuable learning aid, it also poses significant risks, such as providing misinformation or unsafe responses to sensitive topics like self-harm. Experts emphasize that open conversation and setting boundaries are more effective than outright bans, helping children navigate AI responsibly.</p>

          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of adult film star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court stated that the removal lacked a clear justification and that Meta applied its content moderation policies inconsistently, as similar accounts remained active. The ruling orders Meta to revise its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for appealing moderation decisions and to better define its rules on sexual content. This decision underscores a growing trend in South America where courts are holding social media platforms more accountable for their content policies.</p>

          <p>Boxing analysts are divided ahead of the super-middleweight fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford, a matchup pitting Canelo's power and size against Crawford's technical skill and speed. One perspective argues that Crawford, despite moving up two weight classes, possesses the superior boxing IQ, adaptability, and reach to outpoint a slightly declining Canelo. Conversely, another expert contends that the size difference will be insurmountable for Crawford, and Canelo's experience, strength, and strategic prowess will ultimately allow him to control the fight and secure a victory. Both sides acknowledge the fight's intrigue, balancing Crawford's pound-for-pound brilliance against the physical reality of the weight jump.</p>

          <p>Following days of violent, youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its first female interim prime minister. The demonstrations, known as the "GenZ" protests, led to the dissolution of parliament and a declaration that new elections will be held in March. With Karki's appointment, a sense of calm has returned to the capital, Kathmandu, where curfews have been eased. The 73-year-old Karki is known for her strong anti-graft stance, a key demand of the young protesters who organized largely through social media.</p>

          <p>In an effort to simultaneously boost its birth rate and strengthen its scientific workforce, Shanghai has launched a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to new mothers under 40 with doctoral degrees who are returning to their careers after childbirth. The program, initially being rolled out at the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, aims to alleviate the professional challenges women face after having children. This policy reflects China's broader strategy to tackle demographic and talent retention issues with targeted financial incentives.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships have commenced in Tokyo, with athletes facing grueling heat and humidity, prompting organizers to adjust start times for endurance events.

Despite early start times, temperatures climbed to 30°C with over 90% humidity, creating brutal conditions that left several competitors collapsing after finishing.

          <h2>Opinion: Epstein's Birthday Book Reflects a Culture of Sexual Exploitation Challenged by Feminism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 02:00:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author Rebecca Solnit argues that the recently released Jeffrey Epstein birthday album is a relic of a culture where the sexual exploitation of young girls was widely normalized. The article recounts how movies, music, and societal attitudes in the 1970s and 80s often excused or glorified relationships between adult men and underage girls, citing examples like the film *Manhattan* and the crime committed by Roman Polanski. Solnit credits the rise of feminism with fundamentally challenging these norms by establishing principles of consent, recognizing power imbalances, and denormalizing abuses like sexual assault and harassment. The piece frames the revelations about Epstein as a late example of a once-pervasive patriarchal mindset.</p>
