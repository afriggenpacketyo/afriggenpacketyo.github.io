          <p>An art exhibit in Los Angeles is displaying 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a melted-down statue of Robert E. Lee, to reframe their historical narrative. The "Monuments" exhibition aims to confront the "Lost Cause" ideology and the figures' association with white supremacy, contrasting them with contemporary art pieces. Curators and activists involved see the project as a way to purify a toxic representation of history and spark dialogue about what and whom society chooses to memorialize.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that despite recent viral clips showing Rep. Katie Porter acting impatiently with a reporter and berating a staffer, her campaign for California governor may not be fatally wounded. While her competitors have seized on the incidents to label her as unfit to lead, the author argues that voters may forgive her temper. The article posits that Democrats currently favor "fighters," and the controversy, while damaging her reputation as a boss, has also significantly raised her name recognition in a previously quiet race.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that a full-spectrum cannabis oil provides better relief for chronic low back pain compared to both a placebo and traditional opioids. The research, hailed as "groundbreaking," showed that patients using the cannabis tincture experienced superior pain relief and sleep quality with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than those on opioids. While the specific product awaits approval in Europe and further trials in the U.S., the findings provide significant evidence supporting the use of medical cannabis as a viable alternative.</p>

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges from geopolitical tensions, tariffs, and inflation, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025. Industry sales and production have held up better than expected, leading some firms like Barclays to upgrade their sector outlook from negative to neutral. While headwinds such as slowing consumer income growth and trade policy uncertainty persist, the industry is navigating the "cost and chaos" with cautious optimism as major automakers prepare to report earnings.

          <p>McVitie's Penguin and Club bars can no longer be legally described as chocolate-covered biscuits in the UK after their recipe was altered in response to soaring cocoa prices. The owner, Pladis, has reduced the amount of cocoa-derived ingredients in the coating to below the 20% regulatory threshold, forcing the description to change to "chocolate flavour." This adjustment reflects a broader industry trend where manufacturers are substituting expensive cocoa butter with cheaper alternatives like palm oil to manage rising commodity costs.</p>

Experts suggest waiting until the government reopens before finalizing 2026 coverage decisions to ensure all details from resources like Medicare's Plan Finder are accurate and fully staffed. Beneficiaries should compare traditional Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans, paying close attention to changes in prescription drug coverage, provider networks, and out-of-pocket costs.

This move aligns Japan with over 90 other countries and comes after years of debate, with campaigners arguing that prescription requirements created significant barriers for women, particularly younger individuals and victims of sexual assault.</p>
