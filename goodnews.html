          <p>Moldova's pro-EU party, led by President Maia Sandu, is set to win a majority in parliamentary elections, a result seen as crucial for the nation's path toward joining the European Union. The election was marked by tensions and allegations of "massive Russian interference," including disinformation campaigns and efforts to buy votes. Despite a pro-Russian opposition leader prematurely claiming victory and calling for protests, Sandu's party secured a commanding share of the vote. The outcome reinforces the country's Western-oriented trajectory, even as it navigates economic challenges and the influence of the nearby war in Ukraine.</p>

Meanwhile, U.S. markets had closed higher on Friday following the release of key inflation data, snapping a three-day losing streak for the major indexes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams receiver Tutu Atwell, who had been targeted sparingly this season, scored a game-winning 88-yard touchdown with under two minutes remaining to secure a 27-20 victory against the Indianapolis Colts. The play capped a dramatic comeback for the Rams, who improved their record to 3-1. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for three touchdowns, while the Rams' defense forced key turnovers, including a crucial fumble at the one-yard line by a Colts receiver. The win provides momentum for the Rams ahead of their upcoming game against the San Francisco 49ers.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes profile details how Dana White transformed the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) from a near-bankrupt, $2 million venture into a global sports empire valued at over $15 billion. The article highlights White's aggressive business style, his long-standing friendship with President Donald Trump, and his staunch defense of free speech for his fighters. White discusses the UFC's unapologetically masculine brand and his disdain for "cancel culture," referencing the backlash to comments made after the fictional assassination of Charlie Kirk. The report also notes the UFC's recent multi-billion dollar media rights deal with Paramount Skydance, cementing its place in mainstream sports.</p>

          <p>Following the fictional assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event in Utah, Governor Spencer Cox is urging Americans to condemn political violence and reduce inflammatory rhetoric. In a 60 Minutes interview, Cox expressed his shock and anger over the event, placing it in the context of other recent real-world attacks on political figures. He largely blames social media algorithms for amplifying division and hate, calling for a return to civil disagreement. As part of his "Disagree Better" campaign, Cox is working with bipartisan governors to promote constructive debate as a way to heal national fractures.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a new Labour government initiative aimed at eliminating long-term youth unemployment. Under the plan, young people who have been without a job or education for 18 months will be offered a guaranteed paid work placement. Those who refuse the offer without a valid reason could face sanctions, including the loss of their benefits. The policy is designed to help young individuals build skills and transition into full-time employment, addressing the nearly one million 16-24-year-olds currently not in education, employment, or training.</p>

The policy aims to ensure migrants are integrated and is positioned as a fair but firm approach to immigration.

          <p>Jim Cramer refutes comparisons between the current artificial intelligence buildout and the dot-com bubble of 2000, arguing the circumstances are vastly different. He points out that today's massive AI investments are being made by highly profitable tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Google, not by speculative startups funded by debt. While the dot-com era was fueled by a rush of unprofitable public offerings and a fiber-optic network built on credit, the AI revolution is driven by established companies that require this technology to maintain their market dominance. He contends that AI is a necessity for these firms, not a speculative bubble. (not investment advice)</p>
