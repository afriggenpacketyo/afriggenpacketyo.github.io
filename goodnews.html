          <p>England's cricket captain Ben Stokes delivered a pivotal performance, leading his team to a dramatic 22-run victory over India in a Test match at Lord's. Despite a recent hamstring surgery and an injury scare during the match, Stokes bowled two crucial spells, taking key wickets on the final day to secure the win. He described the effort as one of the toughest moments of his career but affirmed his fitness for the next Test. The victory, which puts England 2-1 up in the series, was marked by on-field tension that Stokes believes adds to the competitive nature of the sport.</p>

          <p>Meta announced it has removed approximately 10 million Facebook profiles in the first half of 2025 as part of a significant crackdown on spam and inauthentic behavior. The initiative aims to improve the quality of the Facebook Feed by targeting accounts that impersonate large creators or use AI to generate low-quality content. The company is also implementing stricter measures to promote original posts and will reduce the distribution of reused videos. This move comes as social media platforms, including YouTube, grapple with the challenge of "AI slop" and work to prioritize authentic creator content.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a major agreement with NATO allies to supply Ukraine with large-scale arms shipments, including Patriot missile systems, to be paid for by European nations. Speaking alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump framed the deal as a significant reinforcement for Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression. Concurrently, he issued a 50-day ultimatum to Vladimir Putin, warning that if a peace deal is not reached, the U.S. will impose severe secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia. The announcement signals a marked shift in the administration's tone and material support for Ukraine.</p>

          <h2>Examining the "Age 75 Rule" for Purchasing Annuities in Retirement Planning</h2>

          <p>This article explores the "age 75 rule," a common belief suggesting that retirees should wait until age 75 to buy an annuity to receive higher payouts. While it is true that insurers offer larger payments to older buyers due to shorter life expectancies, the rule oversimplifies a complex financial decision. Waiting until 75 may not be ideal for everyone, as it could mean drawing down other assets earlier or missing the opportunity to secure guaranteed income for a longer period. The best time to purchase an annuity depends on individual circumstances, including retirement goals, health, and overall financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is implementing a new strategy to reduce its reliance on China for rare earth metals, which are critical for military and technology applications. Through a deal with the Department of Defense, America's sole rare earth miner, MP Materials, will receive a guaranteed minimum price for its products, nearly double the current market rate set by China. This move is designed to create a separate, higher pricing system that incentivizes domestic production and investment. Analysts believe this new benchmark will pull global prices up and help Western miners compete against China's market dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the academic year approaches, students face the critical decision between federal and private student loans to cover college costs. This article advises that students should typically exhaust federal loan options first, as they offer fixed interest rates and crucial borrower protections like income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. However, federal loans have strict borrowing limits. Private loans from banks can fill the funding gap but often lack the same flexibility and may require a co-signer and strong credit for favorable rates, making a balanced approach essential for responsible borrowing.
