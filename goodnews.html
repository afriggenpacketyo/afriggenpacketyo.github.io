        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, China Finance 40 Forum, is challenging the widely held belief that China's consumption is underdeveloped, arguing that mainstream metrics systematically underestimate its true level. The report suggests that China's real consumption power has already surpassed Mexico's and is approaching 40-50% of levels in developed nations like Japan and Germany. While raw data shows low per capita spending compared to the US, the think tank contends that adjustments for purchasing power parity and other factors paint a much stronger picture. This alternative perspective offers a new way to assess the consumer potential of the world's second-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent drop in mortgage interest rates to their lowest levels since April has triggered a significant increase in homeowner refinancing activity. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications to refinance home loans jumped by 7% last week, marking a 40% increase compared to the same period last year. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%, encouraging homeowners, particularly those with larger loans, to seek better terms. In contrast, mortgage applications for home purchases remained stagnant, suggesting that potential buyers are still hesitant due to broader market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has officially confirmed that the 600-year-old institution will continue after his death, ending speculation about the end of his lineage. In a video message broadcast during his 90th birthday celebrations in Dharamshala, India, he stated that his successor's selection will be handled exclusively by the Gaden Phodrang Trust. This move directly counters potential interference from Beijing, which insists that any successor must be approved by the Chinese government. The announcement provides clarity and relief to his followers worldwide, reaffirming the traditional process of reincarnation while setting up a potential future conflict with China.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, with a final proposal to be delivered by Qatar and Egypt. While Israel has not officially confirmed this agreement, its foreign minister indicated majority government support for a framework to release the remaining hostages. A Hamas official expressed readiness to agree if the deal leads to a complete end to the war, a long-standing condition for the group. The announcement puts pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has consistently pushed for a "complete victory" over Hamas before ending the conflict.</p>

His comments come amid growing concerns over Beijing's increasing influence and investment in the region, including a 2022 security pact with the Solomon Islands.</p>

The eagle, named Kere, was found with a severe leg injury and deep infection, but Dr. Kimberly Ammann of the Winged Freedom Raptor Hospital opted for the novel treatment. The procedure, more common in human medicine, was successful, and after a 10-month rehabilitation, Kere was released back into the wild. The symbolic release, just ahead of the Fourth of July, celebrates the freedom of America's national bird, made possible by pioneering medical techniques.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is successfully framing his climate policies as solutions to the city's cost-of-living crisis, a model supporters believe can build broad popular support. Instead of focusing on complex, technocratic plans like carbon taxes, Mamdani's platform connects environmental goals to tangible benefits like a rent freeze and free bus transit. For example, a rent freeze prevents landlords from passing on costs of green upgrades to tenants, while free transit reduces car use and fuel costs. This approach aims to make climate action a quality-of-life issue, potentially creating a more resilient political base for environmental policies.</p>

          <p>A new law in California now requires bars, nightclubs, and other establishments serving alcohol to provide drink lids to customers upon request. This measure aims to help patrons protect themselves from having their drinks drugged. The legislation, which passed unanimously, builds on a previous law that mandated signage informing customers about the availability of drug-testing kits. While establishments can charge a reasonable price for the lids, many bar owners view it as an insignificant cost for ensuring customer safety. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control will enforce the new rule during routine inspections.</p>

The majority of the funds, over $288 million, will be directed toward the creation and preservation of affordable housing projects. An additional $100 million is earmarked for homelessness prevention initiatives, including tenant income support and eviction defense, providing crucial funding as state and county support has been reduced.

          <p>This opinion column analyzes the victory of self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary, comparing the establishment backlash to the one faced by Upton Sinclair in his 1934 California gubernatorial run. The author argues that Mamdani's platform, which includes rent freezes, free childcare, and a city wealth tax, speaks directly to voters' desires for an escape from oligarchic politics. While billionaires and establishment Democrats predict economic doom, the piece suggests Mamdani's success offers a potential roadmap for the national Democratic Party to regain favor by rejecting austerity and embracing policies that address affordability.
