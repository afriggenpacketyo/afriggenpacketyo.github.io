        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins endorsed a recent interest rate cut but expressed caution about the extent of future reductions, citing persistent inflation risks. Speaking in New York, she stated that while some easing was appropriate, maintaining a "modestly restrictive" policy is necessary to balance price stability with a softening labor market. Collins highlighted a highly uncertain economic environment, suggesting further cuts this year would depend heavily on incoming data showing inflation is under control. Her remarks align with a broader sentiment of vigilance among Fed officials amid economic challenges, including a potential government shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Addressing senior military leaders at Marine Corps Base Quantico, former President Donald Trump promised his "100%" support and declared a "reawakening of the warrior spirit" within the armed forces. He criticized what he described as a shift toward political correctness under the previous administration, stating that the military's purpose is to protect the republic, not "anyone's feelings." Trump asserted that his administration is refocusing on fitness, ability, and character to build a "fighting and winning machine." He also claimed that military recruitment goals, which had struggled, have now been met or exceeded under his leadership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Excessive credit card debt is not defined by a specific dollar amount but rather by its impact on an individual's financial health, according to financial experts. Key indicators of unmanageable debt include a high debt-to-income ratio, a credit utilization ratio above 30%, and the inability to pay more than the minimum monthly payment. The article suggests that if debt is causing significant stress or preventing other financial goals, it should be considered excessive. To address this, strategies like the debt snowball or avalanche methods, balance transfers, or seeking help from credit counseling agencies are recommended for regaining financial stability.

          <p>A suspect has been identified in the infamous 1991 murders of four teenage girls at a yogurt shop in Austin, Texas, according to a retired detective who worked on the original case. The suspect is Robert Eugene Brashers, a serial killer who died by suicide in 1999 during a police standoff. A crucial link was reportedly made through DNA evidence and a bullet casing found at the crime scene, which is believed to be consistent with the gun Brashers used. The case has seen numerous twists, including the wrongful convictions of two men whose charges were later dropped after new DNA evidence emerged that did not match them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his keynote speech at the Labour Party conference, Sir Keir Starmer positioned his party as the patriotic choice for national renewal, directly contrasting it with Reform UK, which he accused of negativity towards Britain's future. He addressed sensitive topics, acknowledging that decisions on migration might be "uncomfortable" for his party while emphasizing the need to move beyond a sole reliance on immigration for labor. Starmer also announced a new policy focus, shifting away from a university-for-all target to promoting "gold standard apprenticeships." He concluded by promising fiscal responsibility and warning that tough budget decisions would continue, vowing never to let working people pay the price.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that Pfizer has agreed to lower the cost of some of its prescription drugs for Medicaid recipients. This agreement is part of the administration's broader effort to secure "most favored nation" pricing, aligning U.S. drug costs more closely with those in other high-income countries. Concurrently, the administration plans to launch a direct-to-consumer website called "TrumpRX" for purchasing prescription medications, although details remain limited. The move comes as the administration faces pressure over healthcare costs and occurs just ahead of a potential government shutdown, where healthcare funding remains a key point of contention with Democrats.</p>

          <p>Canadian authorities have identified the "Woman in the Well," whose remains were discovered in Saskatoon in 2006, as Alice Spence, a woman born in 1881. The breakthrough in the century-old cold case came through the use of investigative genetic genealogy, a technique that builds a DNA profile and uses it to find relatives. Spence, who had moved to Canada from Minnesota, is believed to have died under suspicious circumstances between 1916 and 1918. The case is thought to be the oldest in Canada to be solved using this advanced forensic method, highlighting how technology is helping to resolve historical mysteries.</p>

The long-term vision includes providing every employee with a personalized AI assistant and using AI agents to power all internal processes. While the transition will take years, the initiative could profoundly reshape the workforce, displacing roles focused on rote processes while empowering client-facing employees.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, researchers at Oregon Health and Science University have created early-stage human embryos by fertilizing eggs that were engineered using DNA from skin cells. The novel technique involves transferring the nucleus from a skin cell into a donor egg stripped of its own genetics, then inducing the egg to halve its chromosomes before fertilization. While the process, termed "mitomeiosis," is still inefficient and requires significant refinement, it represents a major breakthrough in reproductive science. This technology could one day overcome certain forms of infertility and potentially allow same-sex couples to have children who are genetically related to both partners.</p>

          <p>Scientists have made a significant advance in reproductive technology by creating functional human eggs from skin cells and fertilizing them to produce early-stage embryos. The research offers a potential future solution for infertility and could enable same-sex couples to have genetically related children. However, the resulting embryos currently have genetic abnormalities, and the technology raises complex ethical issues. Bioethicists warn of potential misuse, such as creating "designer babies" with selected traits or making babies from a person's stolen DNA without consent, highlighting the need for a broad public debate on the implications of this powerful new capability.</p>

As Southeast Asia's newest and smallest nation, Timor-Leste has worked to establish its democratic credentials, recently demonstrated when its government reversed a controversial spending plan after public protests.

The announcement comes amid controversy over Ek's personal investments in Helsing, an AI-powered defense technology firm, which prompted boycotts from some musicians.
