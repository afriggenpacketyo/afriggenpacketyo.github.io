          <p>Russell Martin is on the verge of being appointed as the new manager of Rangers, with his tactical flexibility being highlighted by former teammate Angus Gunn. Gunn noted that Martin's Southampton team demonstrated adaptability, dispelling the notion that he is too stubborn to change his approach. Martin himself asserts that he distinguishes between stubbornness and conviction, indicating that he will adhere to his core principles if he secures the Rangers job. His firm stance suggests that the fundamental aspects of Martin's strategy will remain consistent should he be appointed.</p>

          <p>Dave's Hot Chicken, which began as a chicken finger stand in an LA parking lot with just $900, has been acquired in a deal worth close to $1 billion. The company was founded in 2017 by Arman Oganesyan and his friends, who initially pooled their savings to start the business. The trio developed a Nashville hot chicken recipe and set up shop in a parking lot, and after gaining attention from a food critic, business boomed. Now, Dave's Hot Chicken is a franchise business with over 300 locations, and this successful venture exemplifies the potential for small-scale ideas to achieve substantial growth. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer views the Federal Reserve's removal of Wells Fargo's asset cap as a "watershed moment," forecasting more upside for the stock. The seven-year lid on Wells' balance sheet growth, due to past misdeeds, has now been lifted. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have also become more optimistic about Wells Fargo shares, and Cramer has raised the price target to $90 a share. The removal of the asset cap allows the bank to grow its deposit base, invest more in high-growth areas, and lower compliance costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is meeting with Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee at the White House to shore up support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which advances his legislative agenda. The Finance Committee is responsible for the bill's tax policy components, including extending the Trump 2017 tax cuts. The legislation also increases spending for the military and border security while making cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. Trump's meeting is an opportunity to sway senators who have concerns about the bill, and lawmakers aim to send a bill to Trump by the Fourth of July. </p>

          <p>With the New York City Democratic mayoral primary approaching, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is positioned for a political comeback, despite his resignation amid allegations of misconduct. A Democratic socialist candidate, Zohran Mamdani, is gaining momentum with a progressive platform. Incumbent mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent and is not on the primary ballot. Cuomo's previous tenure as governor and name recognition contribute to his polling advantage, and he also has support among Black voters and unions. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to require American medical schools to offer nutrition courses to students or risk losing federal funding from the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy believes aspiring physicians are taught how to treat illnesses with drugs but not how to keep people healthy with food. He intends to announce that medical schools without nutrition programs will be ineligible for HHS funding. Some nutrition experts are optimistic about this proposal, as medical students currently spend an average of only 19 hours on required nutrition education over four years. </p>
