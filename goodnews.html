        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of families are choosing to sell large, historic ranches that have been held for generations, often due to disagreements among heirs about the properties' future. High-end ranch brokers report a surge in listings for these legacy properties, driven by wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, a trend amplified by the 'Yellowstone' effect. While these sales provide a financial windfall, they also mark the end of a unique family heritage, as the sprawling landscapes transition to new ownership. The market is also seeing a rise in sales from owners who bought ranches 20-30 years ago, as their children show little interest in taking over.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares jumped significantly after the company reported better-than-expected profits for its June quarter, driven by accelerated growth in its cloud computing division. Revenue for the cloud unit rose 26% year-on-year, fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence services, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While the company's overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the strong performance in the high-margin cloud business and continued recovery in e-commerce. The company is navigating intense competition by investing heavily in both AI and instant commerce services in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Kyle Schwarber's Historic Four-Homer Game Highlights Rare Baseball Feat</h2>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies designated hitter Kyle Schwarber had a historic night, becoming the 21st player in major league history to hit four home runs in a single game during a 19-4 victory over the Atlanta Braves. He was also one of only four players ever to get an at-bat with a chance to hit a fifth home run. However, he popped up against a position player pitching in the final inning, a harmless out that averted potential controversy over the legitimacy of a record-breaking fifth homer against a non-pitcher. Schwarber's accomplishment is rarer than a perfect game and places him among an elite group of baseball's greatest single-game power hitters.</p>

          <h2>Yoga's Global Rise Serves as a Key Instrument of India's Soft Power</h2>

          <p>The ancient Indian practice of yoga has transformed into a global phenomenon, serving as a significant element of India's cultural diplomacy and soft power. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga on June 21 has elevated the practice's worldwide profile, connecting millions to India's cultural heritage. While yoga's promotion is seen as a way to foster global unity and strengthen people-to-people ties, it also faces criticism. Some observers point to the over-commercialization of the practice in the West and its political use to promote Hindu nationalism within India, which they argue could undermine its universal appeal.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is actively trying to sign two central defenders before the transfer deadline, a move that could pave the way for defender Marc Guehi to join Liverpool. The Premier League champions have been in talks for a £35 million transfer for the England international, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract with Palace. While Palace manager Oliver Glasner publicly insists Guehi must stay, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. The club is reportedly in advanced talks for Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and is also pursuing an experienced defender to solidify its backline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted an expanded list of critical minerals, adding 51 commodities including copper, silicon, and silver, in a strategic move to secure domestic supply chains. This update is designed to guide government investment, streamline permitting decisions, and reduce the nation's reliance on foreign sources, particularly China, for materials essential to key industries like semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and solar energy. The selection of minerals was based on identifying which supply chain disruptions would most significantly impact the U.S. economy and national security. The initiative aims to mitigate risks from geopolitical disputes or other international incidents.</p>

          <h2>Falling Condo Prices May Not Signal a Bargain Due to Rising Hidden Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the median sale price for condominiums in the U.S. has recently declined, real estate experts caution that they may not be the bargain they appear to be. A national oversupply has driven prices down, particularly in states like Florida and Texas. However, buyers must also factor in rapidly rising hidden costs, such as higher HOA dues, surging insurance premiums, and new reserve requirements for building repairs. These additional monthly expenses can quickly offset the lower purchase price, sometimes making the long-term cost of a condo comparable to that of a single-family home. Agents advise buyers to thoroughly investigate a building's financials before making a purchase.</p>
