          <p>The BBC has decided not to appeal the libel case victory of former Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams, who sued the corporation over a 2016 BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight story and online article concerning the murder of British agent Denis Donaldson. A jury found that Mr. Adams was defamed by an anonymous contributor's allegation that he sanctioned the 2006 killing, awarding him ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages. The combined legal costs for both parties are estimated to be between ‚Ç¨3-5 million. The case centered around the interpretation of statements made in the broadcast and whether they implied Adams was directly involved in ordering the murder.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark has returned to the team's lineup after missing five consecutive games due to a strained quadriceps sustained in a May 24 game against the New York Liberty. Clark, the 2024 Rookie of the Year, was averaging 19 points, 9.3 assists, and six rebounds in four games this season. Her return comes as the Liberty remain undefeated against Eastern Conference opponents, with a 9-0 record, and the Fever prepare for a rematch.

          <p>Emma Raducanu lost to Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals of the Queen's Club tennis tournament, despite showing promising form earlier in the competition. After an edgy start, Zheng broke through and won the first set, but Raducanu rebounded strongly in the second set, taking advantage of Zheng's wavering serve. However, Zheng rallied, winning four consecutive games to close out the match, highlighting the consistency needed to beat top-ranked players. Despite the loss, Raducanu can take confidence from her performance on grass, but recognizes the gap she needs to bridge to challenge the best.</p>

          <p>The Senate is considering several changes to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," particularly concerning SNAP, SALT deductions, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. Senators are aiming to lessen the burden on states imposed by the House's SNAP proposal, potentially eliminating the cost-share requirement. Discussions are underway to lower the cap on state and local tax deductions, and Senator Rand Paul is advocating for reduced border security funding. Medicaid changes remain an open question, and senators plan to review transferability of expiration dates for certain Inflation Reduction Act energy tax credits. The proposed changes aim to rein in government spending and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path.</p>

          <p>Aiden Markram made a brilliant unbeaten century to put South Africa within tantalising distance of a historic victory over Australia in the World Test Championship final. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood had shared a stand of 59 for Australia's last wicket in the morning session of day three which appeared to give them the upper hand. However, any frustration South Africa may have felt gave way to a sense of what might be possible in more appreciable conditions for batting after they were set a target of 282 for victory. Markram shared an unbroken 143-run partnership with South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma, who was hampered by a hamstring injury but tenaciously stayed at the crease to play his part with an unbeaten 65. The pair will resume on day four with 69 runs required to wrap up the win.</p>

          <p>DW reports on the global shortage of blood donors and the ongoing quest to create artificial, lab-made blood. While animal blood is theoretically possible through gene-editing, the complexities of altering blood cells to be compatible with the human immune system are immense. Scientists are exploring various methods, including genetically modifying red blood cells, neutralizing blood types with gut bacteria enzymes, and creating microscopic artificial blood cells. Researchers in Japan are also testing artificial hemoglobin harvested from unused blood bank reserves, with promising initial results. Despite progress, safe artificial blood production at scale remains years away, underscoring the continued importance of human blood donations.</p>

          <p>Kim Gordon, co-founder of Sonic Youth, has released a new version of her song "Bye Bye," titled "Bye Bye 25," which features terms that the Trump administration has attempted to minimize from public life. The song is inspired by a list of phrases that federal authorities have scrubbed from government websites and materials, flagged as needing extra review, or discouraged the use of among staffers. Gordon's song is deadpan funny and avoids some of the pitfalls that await many anti-Trump protest efforts. The song highlights the dark absurdity of controlling policy by controlling language, presenting a patently ridiculous jumble of terms for listeners to reflect on.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded significantly in early June, surpassing expectations as concerns over tariffs and inflation eased, according to a University of Michigan survey. The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, a 15.9% increase from the previous month, with both current conditions and future expectations showing strong gains. The moves coincided with a softening in the heated rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs, and the one-year inflation outlook tumbled to 5.1%. While all sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels, the rebound suggests that consumers are adjusting to the tariff environment and anticipating progress in global trade negotiations.
