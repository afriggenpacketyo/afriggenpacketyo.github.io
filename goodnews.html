        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has agreed to initiate steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japanese authorities anticipate a public notice easing the blanket ban, which has been in place since August 2023, and the opening of registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue advocating for the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, implemented after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. This move is viewed as a positive step in resolving tensions between the two nations, potentially leading to solutions for other bilateral issues.</p>

The competition was intense, with multiple misspellings from finalists, but Zaki maintained composure to win. He became the fifth runner-up to return and win the competition, marking a significant achievement in the annual event that tests students' spelling skills. </p>

          <p>The White House has acknowledged errors in a federal government report spearheaded by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., titled "Make America Healthy Again." The report, which criticized America's food supply, pesticides, and prescription drugs, cited hundreds of studies, but some of those studies did not appear to exist. The White House plans to update the report to address these formatting and citation issues, while maintaining confidence in Kennedy and the report's substance. The report is intended to develop policy recommendations, and the White House has requested additional funding for the initiative.</p>

          <p>Japan has ruled out purchasing defense equipment from the United States in exchange for the easing of tariff measures, emphasizing that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani stated that equipment purchases would be based on the country's defense needs, not as a bargaining chip in trade talks. This stance comes ahead of a fourth round of bilateral trade talks between Japan and the U.S., highlighting the complexities of negotiating trade agreements while maintaining national security interests. The article shows that Japan is firm in its stance to procure equipment based on its needs.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man, Kell Morris, survived after being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. His wife, Jo Roop, held his head above water to prevent him from drowning while awaiting rescue. A sled dog tourism company overheard the 911 dispatch and offered their helicopter to transport rescuers to the remote location. It took seven men and inflatable airbags to lift the boulder off Morris, who attributes his survival to luck and his wife's quick thinking. </p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for their approaches to welfare policies, accusing them of indulging in "fantasy economics." Badenoch says both leaders believe in getting taxpayers to fund unlimited child support for others by potentially scrapping the two-child benefit cap. She argues that Britain cannot afford their economic policies and that the country deserves leaders who do not "treat economics like a branch of showbiz." Badenoch's attack comes after Farage said the Conservatives had become an "irrelevance."</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a press conference with Elon Musk, teasing the end of Musk's official role in the administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's government service is ending due to legal limits for his "special government employee" designation. Despite the end of his official role, Trump indicated Musk will continue to assist the administration. DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, though the initiative has faced criticism and controversy.</p>
