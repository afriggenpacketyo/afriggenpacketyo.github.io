          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed global business leaders at the Milken Institute Global Conference, urging them to invest in the United States despite concerns over President Trump's trade policies. Bessent defended the administration's economic agenda, emphasizing tax cuts and deregulation as catalysts for job creation and output. He reassured investors that tariffs are designed to encourage direct investment in the U.S., promising a favorable tax and regulatory environment. However, business leaders expressed unease about the tariffs' impact, with some delaying investments and preparing for economic headwinds, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the administration's approach.

          <p>For homeowners seeking affordable borrowing options, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may seem appealing due to its lower rates compared to credit cards and personal loans. However, qualifying for a HELOC in the current economic climate involves navigating a more cautious approval process. Lenders typically look for sufficient home equity (at least 15% to 20%), a strong credit score (620 or higher), a low debt-to-income ratio (ideally below 43%), and stable income and employment history. Borrowers can improve their chances of approval by checking their credit report, lowering their DTI ratio, shopping around for lenders, and considering a co-applicant.</p>

          <p>Cardholders struggling with debt should explore various debt relief solutions instead of simply stopping payments or filing for bankruptcy, both of which have significant negative consequences. Viable options include credit card debt forgiveness programs (debt settlement), debt management programs offered by debt relief companies, debt consolidation loans with lower interest rates, and balance transfer cards with low or 0% APR for a limited time. It is crucial to assess individual debt circumstances and research available alternatives to regain financial independence. (not investment advice)</p>

Leinster senior coach Jacques Nienaber expressed concern, stating the injury is "quite serious" and further investigation is needed. The Lions are scheduled to face Argentina in Dublin on June 20 before traveling to Australia for three Tests against the Wallabies in July and August.</p>

          <p>General Motors has been engaged in a decade-long battle to revive Cadillac as the quintessential American luxury car brand, with a focus on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the flagship Escalade. The effort has involved multiple leaders and a commitment to isolate Cadillac's products from GM's other brands. Cadillac is now relaunching its bespoke, $300,000 Celestiq after addressing software issues. While Cadillac is growing domestically, sales in China have been declining, posing a challenge for the brand's global ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Eta Aquariid meteor shower is set to peak tonight, offering a chance to see meteors zoom across the sky. While the shower will be active until May 21, the peak viewing time is around 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday. Viewers should find an area away from lights and look away from the moon, allowing their eyes to adjust to the dark. The Eta Aquariids are known for their speed and often appear as earthgrazers in the Northern Hemisphere. The meteors originate from space debris shed by Halley's comet.</p>

President Trump's plan to impose 100% tariffs on films produced abroad caused Disney to drop 3% at the open, which will be looked into when it reports earnings before Wednesday's opening bell.
