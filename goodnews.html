          <h2>New Apple TV Show Examines the Misery Hidden Behind Hyperaffluence</h2>

          <p>Ross Douthat reviews "Your Friends & Neighbors," a new Apple TV show starring Jon Hamm, which portrays the lives of wealthy residents in Connecticut. The show distinguishes itself by eliminating any sense of aspirational identification, portraying its characters as unhappy and financially insecure despite their wealth. Douthat contrasts this portrayal with shows like "Fleishman Is in Trouble," which explores the anxieties of the almost-upper-class, and suggests that "Your Friends & Neighbors" serves as a reassuring response to meritocratic status anxiety by revealing the misery of the mansion class. The article suggests that this show provides a balm for the resentments of people who assume that they'd definitely be happier with $10 million in the bank.</p>

          <p>Street sex workers in Bristol are collaborating with police and the charity Barnardo's Night Light team to protect at-risk children. These women provide vital information about child exploitation and help bring child sexual assault offenders to justice. One woman, Anna, testified against a man who was abusing his daughter after he asked her to role-play as a primary school-age girl. The Night Light team also helps identify children at risk of exploitation and get underage girls off the streets, building trust and offering support to the women involved.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of GCSE students in Manchester and the West Midlands will receive their grades via a new app, the Education Record app, as part of a government trial. The app aims to streamline the process and reduce bureaucracy for colleges. Students will still have the option to collect paper results in person. The government plans to expand the app nationally, integrating exam results and certificates into one online system. The pilot program intends to reduce the burden on further education colleges, which often need to hire additional staff to manage paperwork.</p>

He is looking for someone who is part of a young couple or family, with one partner working remotely and the other running the smokery, in order to help attract new families to the island.</p>

          <p>Asia's largest economies approved a new rapid financing mechanism that will use regional currencies, including the Chinese yuan, signaling a potential shift away from the US dollar. The decision aims to shield East and Southeast Asian countries from financial volatility caused by President Trump's global tariff war. The move may lead to a deeper, longer-term shift towards a regional monetary mechanism that is less reliant on the dollar, potentially giving China a larger role in the region's financial system.</p>

Trump praised Canada and expressed affection for the country, a stark contrast to his earlier rhetoric. Carney, who campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, maintained a firm stance against the idea of Canada becoming part of the U.S. The meeting covered a range of topics, including trade, foreign affairs, and Trump's usual tangents, but the president largely avoided contentious issues related to his previous remarks.</p>

The process has sparked debate within the literary community, with some questioning whether the board overruled the jury's selections.
