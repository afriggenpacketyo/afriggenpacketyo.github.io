          <p>China's internet watchdog, in collaboration with financial regulators, has shut down over a dozen social media accounts for spreading false financial information, illegally touting stocks, and promoting speculative cryptocurrency trading. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) reported that these accounts operated on popular platforms like Weibo, Douyin, RedNote, and WeChat. Some accounts misled investors with false information about capital markets, while others lured investors into paid groups with guaranteed stock wins. The crackdown aims to address concerns over financial influencers who use sensationalist claims to attract followers, misleading investors and disrupting the market.</p>

          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is amending the Building Energy Act, aiming to dismantle key aspects of the previous climate protection measures. Reiche plans to abolish the operating ban on gas boilers installed before 1991, prioritizing energy supply alongside climate protection. While the installation of heat pumps has increased, Reiche intends to construct new gas-fired power plants, drawing criticism from energy experts who suggest alternatives like hydropower and large-scale batteries. Despite concerns, the government has committed ‚Ç¨100 billion of a ‚Ç¨500 billion infrastructure investment program to climate protection, showcasing a continued, albeit altered, focus on environmental issues.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan's election as president of Romania was significantly influenced by the votes of ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship, who voted in record numbers. Conservative estimates suggest that over 500,000 of these voters supported Dan, contributing substantially to his victory over hard-right candidate George Simion. This outcome is important for both Romania and Europe, as it demonstrates the preservation of liberal democracy and the continuation of Romania's Euro-Atlantic path. Despite Hungarian PM Viktor Orban backing the anti-Hungarian candidate Simion, Romania's ethnic Hungarians chose to support Dan, highlighting their commitment to democratic values.</p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially due in the spring, with a spokesperson stating the strategy will be released later this year. The delay has drawn criticism from the SNP, while charities have offered mixed reactions, some expressing concern and others suggesting it's better to delay for a more effective strategy. The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy preventing most families from claiming benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate crowding in accident and emergency departments (A&E), as confirmed by the NHS. These clinics, open to walk-in patients and referrals, will provide specialized care for individuals in acute mental distress. While NHS England hails this as a pioneering model, some experts express skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and careful implementation. The scheme aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, reducing long waits and relieving pressure on emergency services.</p>

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic affirmed the EU's engagement in securing a beneficial deal, while European governments warned that higher tariffs would be detrimental to both sides.

          <p>Zoos in the UK will be legally mandated to provide animals with more enclosure space as part of animal welfare reforms that are being described as "long overdue." The new standards, published by the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), aim to modernize zoo practices for the first time in over a decade. Key changes include larger habitats for elephants, an end to the long-term tethering of birds of prey, and prohibiting visitors from touching fish and cephalopods. Zoos and aquariums have a two-year timeline to adapt to these changes, which also require improvements in conservation standards and safety measures for dangerous animals.</p>

Tech firms are deploying AI tools to visualize global supply chains, assess the impact of tariffs, and make faster decisions on adjustments. Salesforce has developed an AI agent that processes changes to U.S. customs tariffs, while Kinaxis uses machine learning to assess products and materials affected by tariffs.

A study by the Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to adopt this approach. Many prioritize "me time" and question the traditional Japanese work ethic that emphasizes long hours and unwavering loyalty to an employer.
