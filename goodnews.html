          <p>The PGA Tour has announced Brian Rolapp, a top NFL executive, as its next CEO, succeeding Jay Monahan, who will step down at the end of 2026 after a decade in the role. Rolapp, formerly the NFL's Chief Media and Business Officer, brings extensive experience in forging media partnerships, which will be crucial as the PGA Tour renews its media rights agreements. Rolapp intends to strengthen the Tour's commercial partnerships and respect golf's traditions while adapting to evolving fan consumption. The announcement comes amid ongoing negotiations for a merger with Saudi-backed LIV Golf, with Tiger Woods expressing his support for Rolapp's appointment. </p>

          <p>Shanghai-based AI start-up MiniMax has launched MiniMax-M1, an open-source reasoning model that reportedly consumes less than half the computing power of DeepSeek-R1 for reasoning tasks.

MiniMax-M1 is built on the 456-billion-parameter MiniMax-Text-01 foundational model and employs a hybrid mixture-of-experts architecture, similar to DeepSeek.

          <p>Gold prices have surged since the beginning of 2024, leading to speculation about whether they could reach $4,000 per ounce soon. Investing experts cite factors such as inflation concerns, geopolitical uncertainties, and central bank buying as potential drivers. Some predict gold could hit $4,000 within a year, while others suggest it may take one to two years, barring a serious geopolitical event. Strategies for investing in the gold market include maintaining a long-term outlook, leasing out gold, and considering gold mining mutual funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With CD rates potentially falling soon, savings experts recommend opening an account sooner rather than later to lock in current rates. It's important to shop around for the best offers from different banks and credit unions, especially as CD rates are dropping. Choosing shorter-term CDs can provide better rates, while longer-term CDs offer protection against future rate drops. It's crucial to understand the risks, such as early withdrawal penalties, and to have an emergency fund available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that could potentially replace chemotherapy for some cancer patients, offering a more targeted approach with fewer side effects. ADCs deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Several companies, including AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck, have made significant strides in ADC development, with some already approved for specific tumors. Challenges remain, such as ensuring the chemotherapy payload is released at the right time and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins to target. </p>
