          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld the $83.3 million jury verdict against Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019. The court rejected Trump's claim of presidential immunity, stating he failed to provide any new grounds for reconsideration. The three-judge panel also concluded that the district court made no errors in its rulings and found the jury's compensatory and punitive damages to be fair and reasonable given the evidence of Trump's reckless disregard for the truth. This decision follows a separate verdict where Trump was found liable for sexual assault and defamation.</p>

          <p>Street artist Banksy has unveiled a new mural in London depicting a judge in traditional attire beating an unarmed protester with a gavel. The artist claimed the work on Instagram, captioning it with its location at the Royal Courts of Justice. Activist groups have interpreted the piece as a commentary on the U.K. government's recent ban on the organization Palestine Action, viewing it as a powerful depiction of state-sanctioned brutality against civil liberties. The mural was quickly covered by security officials shortly after its appearance.</p>

          <p>A moose, believed to have traveled from Poland through the Czech Republic, has become a local celebrity in Lower Austria after weeks of sightings. Nicknamed Emil, the animal's journey has attracted significant public attention, leading to the creation of a large Facebook fan page. The moose's adventures included wandering onto main railway tracks, which caused a multi-hour shutdown of a major train line. Authorities and animal protection groups have urged the public to maintain their distance and not interfere with the animal for its own safety.</p>

          <p>Skywatchers in Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa were treated to the sight of a "blood moon" during a recent total lunar eclipse. This celestial event occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, causing the Earth's atmosphere to filter sunlight and cast a reddish glow onto the lunar surface. The term can also refer to a moon that appears red due to atmospheric dust or smoke. According to NASA, the next total lunar eclipse will be visible to observers in the Americas in March.</p>
