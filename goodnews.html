          <p>A recent Fidelity Investments report indicates that average 401(k) balances decreased by 3% in the first quarter of 2025, settling at $127,100, while IRA balances fell by 4% to $121,983, both due to market fluctuations, though balances remained higher year-over-year. Despite the market's challenges, most retirement savers have maintained their contributions, with the average 401(k) contribution rate rising to 14.3%, nearing Fidelity's recommended 15% savings rate.

          <p>Three major wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are almost fully contained after burning for several weeks, prompting the lifting of evacuation orders on Memorial Day. Despite the progress, hazardous smoke conditions have triggered air quality alerts throughout Minnesota, while crews continue to battle the blazes. The fires, named Jenkins Creek Fire, Camp House Road Fire, and Munger Shaw Fire, have collectively burned approximately 30,000 acres. Investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the Jenkins Creek Fire and efforts are focused on protecting ecologically significant wild rice lakes.</p>

          <p>Vietnam has officially ended its two-child policy, allowing families to decide how many children they wish to have, in response to a declining birth rate and a shrinking working-age population. The policy, which had been in place since 2009, restricted families to one or two children, with stricter enforcement for government officials and Communist Party members. The decision reflects concerns that the country's fertility rate has dropped below the replacement level, potentially leading to an end of the "golden population" period within 15 years, and lawmakers are also addressing sex imbalances caused by prenatal gender selection.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While making on-time debt payments is important for credit scores, it is not the only factor determining a high score, as not all debt payments are factored into credit scores, and your credit utilization ratio also plays a significant role. Many Americans incorrectly assume that paying bills on time ensures a high credit score, but payments such as rent-to-own, private school tuition, and utilities may not be reported to credit bureaus. Experts advise checking credit reports to understand which payments are influencing credit scores and suggest aiming for low credit usage to improve your overall score. (not investment advice)</p>

McCook, a WWII pilot, has been accounted for 82 years after his plane crashed in Burma during a low-altitude bombing raid in 1943, killing him and three others. McCook was credited with saving the lives of two fellow airmen by maneuvering the damaged plane to an altitude that allowed them to parachute out before the crash. His remains were recovered and identified through dental, anthropological, isotope, and DNA analyses after being interred as "Unknowns" at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, and he will be buried in his hometown in August 2025.</p>
