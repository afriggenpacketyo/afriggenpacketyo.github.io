          <p>Gabrielle has intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season, and is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on Monday. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect for land, the National Hurricane Center predicts the storm could undergo rapid strengthening. Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada, into early next week. The hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has stated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons program as a realistic interim measure. In an interview, Lee argued that halting the production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually is a feasible alternative to the currently stalled goal of complete denuclearization. He expressed hope that the mutual trust between Trump and Kim could lead to renewed talks, which would benefit South Korea and global security. This pragmatic approach marks a shift from previous policies aimed at immediate and total dismantlement.</p>

          <p>A dramatic Sunday in the NFL featured several games with wild finishes, including the Philadelphia Eagles defeating the Los Angeles Rams 33-26 after blocking a game-winning field goal attempt and returning it for a touchdown as time expired. In another major upset, the Cleveland Browns stunned the Green Bay Packers 13-10 with a 55-yard walk-off field goal, which was set up by their own blocked kick moments earlier. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers also secured a 29-27 victory over the New York Jets with a last-second field goal, highlighting a day of thrilling conclusions across the league.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion project to build a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a move the government sees as a significant opportunity for economic growth. The plan involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 by the late 2030s. While supporters tout job creation and economic benefits, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups concerned about increased noise, pollution, and climate impact. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate concerns.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a high school in Summersville, West Virginia, captured the startling moment a school principal, James Marsh, opened a dumpster only to be greeted by a black bear. The video shows Marsh recoiling in surprise as the bear pokes its head out before both flee in opposite directions. The incident, in which no one was harmed, serves as a reminder of the increasing frequency of human-wildlife encounters as natural habitats shrink. Experts emphasize the importance of securing food and trash to prevent attracting animals like bears into populated areas for their safety and ours.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department will increase its presence around synagogues, schools, and community centers as the Jewish High Holy Days begin with Rosh Hashana. This security enhancement is a proactive measure to deter crime and provide reassurance to the Jewish community amid a rise in antisemitic attacks nationally. Mayor Karen Bass stated that antisemitism is unacceptable and thanked the LAPD for its efforts to protect Jewish Angelenos. The move follows a summer of heightened security and meetings between city officials and Jewish leaders to address safety concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tactical shift by manager Pep Guardiola almost earned Manchester City a victory against Arsenal, but a 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli resulted in a 1-1 draw. After taking an early lead through Erling Haaland, Guardiola switched to a highly defensive 5-5-0 formation in the second half, ceding possession in an uncharacteristic move. This strategy held off Arsenal until the final moments, when Martinelli broke through to salvage a point for the home side. The result is seen as a blow to both teams' title hopes, leaving league leaders Liverpool as the primary beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump indicated that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be part of the investment group in the deal to save TikTok's U.S. operations. Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as other prominent American figures involved in the potential acquisition from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The White House has stated that under the proposed deal, the U.S. would control the app's algorithm and that six of the seven board members would be American. The negotiations aim to address national security concerns that led Congress to pass a bill requiring ByteDance to divest.</p>

          <p>At the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, McLaren's Lando Norris managed a seventh-place finish, gaining only a few points on his championship rival and teammate, Oscar Piastri, who had an uncharacteristically poor weekend including a crash. Norris attributed his result to a difficult qualifying session where he started seventh, arguing that overtaking was nearly impossible on the Baku circuit. While Norris felt he maximized his race performance, team principal Andrea Stella suggested a "misjudgement" in qualifying cost him a better starting position. The result leaves Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who won the race, as a growing threat in the championship standings.</p>

          <p>England has secured a 2-0 series win against Ireland in their first-ever T20 series, thanks to a decisive six-wicket victory in the final match. Chasing Ireland's target of 155, England was led by Jordan Cox, who scored a crucial 55 runs despite a knee injury sustained earlier in the field. England's bowlers, particularly spinner Adil Rashid with three wickets, had effectively contained the Irish batting lineup on a slow pitch. The victory was sealed by Tom Banton with 17 balls to spare, capping a successful series for the English side under stand-in skipper Jacob Bethell.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has initiated a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a section of Oxford Street, calling it the start of a "fight back to rescue this street." The plan aims to permanently pedestrianize the stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. The event was popular with many pedestrians who enjoyed the safer, more relaxed atmosphere. However, the proposal faces opposition from some local councillors and residents who are concerned about increased traffic congestion on side streets and accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges.</p>

The video shows the massive sibling tigers snarling, swatting, and biting at their cage doors just before being set free, a display of their untamed nature. The tigers had been rehabilitated by the Amur Tiger Center. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are an endangered species, with only 500 to 600 estimated to be living in the wild.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the U.S. team could face negative pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage due to a controversial decision to pay their players. For the first time, each American player will receive a $500,000 payment, while the European team continues to play for free. Donald believes that if the highly-paid U.S. team underperforms, the New York audience, who are paying high ticket prices, might turn on their own players. He emphasized that for Team Europe, the purpose and honor of representing their continent is motivation enough.</p>
