          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and implement mass layoffs, stating that the government overhaul lacked congressional authorization. The ruling favors a coalition of unions, non-profits, and local governments who argued the changes would disrupt critical services. Judge Illston emphasized that while the President can seek changes, large-scale reorganizations require congressional cooperation. The ruling comes in response to concerns that the administration's actions were causing chaos and inefficiency within federal agencies.</p>
