          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump to discuss economic developments, including growth, employment, and inflation, while emphasizing that monetary policy decisions would be based on incoming economic data and its impact on the outlook. Powell stressed the Fed's commitment to setting monetary policy on "careful, objective, and non-political analysis." This meeting occurs amid Trump's repeated calls for lower interest rates and concerns about inflationary tariffs. Markets largely expect the Fed to maintain current rates until there is more clarity on tariff uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three large wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearly contained after burning for several weeks, leading to the lifting of all evacuation orders on Memorial Day. Firefighters have made significant progress, although air quality alerts remain in effect due to smoke. Interactive maps from the National Interagency Fire Center show the extent of the Jenkins Creek, Camp House Road, Munger Shaw, and Horse River fires. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was human-caused, and the Camp House Road Fire destroyed over 150 structures.</p>

A senior administration official stated that Musk is leaving on good terms and will remain a friend and advisor to the president.
