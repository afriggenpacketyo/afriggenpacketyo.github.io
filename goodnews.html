          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares experienced a significant rise after Piper Sandler analysts increased their price target due to optimism surrounding the company's latest product announcements. The analysts anticipate a "snapback" for AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter, following the expected impact of charges related to new U.S. license requirements for semiconductor exports to China. AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, along with a full-server rack called Helios.
