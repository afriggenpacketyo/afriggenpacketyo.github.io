          <p>The article reports on a significant rally in global technology and chip stocks following a US-China agreement to temporarily pause most tariffs.  This move eased trade tensions that had previously disrupted supply chains and negatively impacted major US businesses.

          <p>This article discusses the Trump administration's use of US dominance in AI chip technology as leverage in its Middle East dealings.  The administration is reportedly more willing than its predecessor to use AI chip access as a tool in trade negotiations and strategic partnerships, particularly with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  This contrasts with the Biden administration's more cautious approach, which prioritized national security concerns.
