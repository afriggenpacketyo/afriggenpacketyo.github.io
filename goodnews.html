          <p>Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, has stated that Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek is still significantly behind leading US companies in the AI field, despite recent hype. Speaking at an industry event, Clark acknowledged DeepSeek's technology as 'clever' but noted that its models do not currently pose a national security risk based on internal Anthropic tests. This assessment comes amid speculation about DeepSeek's next-generation models, following the release of its Prover-V2 model designed for handling maths proofs. Clark's comments highlight the competitive landscape in AI development and the ongoing debate about technological capabilities between the US and China.</p>

          <p>NASA officials have expressed support for President Trump's budget blueprint, which proposes a $6 billion cut to the agency's funding. According to a senior NASA official, this reduction presents an opportunity to innovate and streamline operations, focusing on human missions to the Moon and Mars. The budget allocates over $7 billion for lunar exploration and introduces $1 billion for Mars-focused programs, emphasizing efficiency and innovation. The White House clarifies that the budget refocuses NASA funding on competing with China in space exploration, potentially increasing the role of private contractors like SpaceX and Blue Origin.</p>

          <h2>Poll Indicates Most Americans Rely on Federal Science Information Daily</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent poll reveals that the majority of Americans use federal science information, such as weather forecasts and job market reports, on a weekly basis, yet only a small fraction are aware of its origin. The Association of Science and Technology Centers conducted the poll to gauge public attitudes toward science and to inform how science museums and educational centers can better serve the public. Despite political polarization around trust in science, the poll indicates bipartisan agreement on the importance of federal investment in STEM education for future economic prosperity. This article highlights a disconnect between the use of federal science data and the public's understanding of its source.</p>
