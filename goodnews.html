Slotkin also emphasizes the need for authenticity and addressing concerns about national security and immigration. She suggests that Democrats should highlight the threat to democracy posed by President Trump and focus on issues like health care to mobilize voters and turn the middle against him.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "pride" has transformed from a religious vice to a symbol of LGBTQ empowerment, with Pride Month celebrations now a global phenomenon. Originally associated with "inordinate self-esteem" and linked to the Christian concept of the seven deadly sins, the word began to shift toward a more positive meaning in the 14th century. The LGBTQ community embraced "pride" as a way to reject negative stereotypes and assert self-esteem, particularly after the Stonewall Uprising in 1969. Despite some debates over the word's use, "pride" remains a powerful symbol for the LGBTQ community, especially in the face of ongoing challenges and discrimination.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan recommends decriminalizing possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use, prompting debate over drug policy. The London Drugs Commission's report suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) and maintaining it as a controlled substance under the Psychoactive Substances Act (PSA). The report argues that current laws disproportionately affect ethnic communities and fail to address medicinal use, but opponents warn decriminalization could wrongly signal reduced harm. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley stated that the force would adhere to existing laws, while others emphasize the need for better education and equitable policing.</p>
