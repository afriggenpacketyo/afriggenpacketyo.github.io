          <p>A federal court has ruled against President Donald Trump's proclamation declaring an "invasion" at the US-Mexico border, deeming his suspension of asylum access unlawful. US District Judge Randolph Moss sided with asylum seekers and immigrant rights groups, asserting the President exceeded his authority and cannot unilaterally adopt an alternative immigration system. The ruling, while not immediately effective, requires the administration to renew processing asylum claims if it holds. This decision marks a significant legal challenge to the administration's stringent immigration policies, which have left many migrants stranded.</p>

Industry workers and union representatives have lauded the move as vital for the state's economy and cultural vibrancy, particularly after recent production slowdowns.

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer provided analysis on President Trump's new trade deal with Vietnam and Apple's recent stock rally. The Vietnam deal, lowering tariffs on imports to 20% (with 40% on transshipped goods) in exchange for zero tariffs on U.S. exports, brings market certainty. Meanwhile, Apple shares are rebounding due to a market rotation towards value stocks and speculation about a potential partnership with an AI-native platform like OpenAI. This AI collaboration is seen as crucial for boosting Apple Intelligence and driving iPhone sales, though concrete details are still awaited. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants this fall. The ruling asserts that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to prematurely terminate Haiti's TPS designation, which was extended until February 2026 by the previous administration. This decision ensures that Haitian migrants currently enrolled in the program will retain their legal status and work permits. The White House has announced it will appeal the ruling, arguing that district courts lack authority to interfere with executive immigration powers.</p>
