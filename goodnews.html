          <h2>Dodgers Pitcher Tyler Glasnow Shows Promising Signs in Return Despite Team's Loss to Brewers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:39:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his return from injury, pitching six innings and allowing only one run in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite the team's defeat, Glasnow's outing is seen as a positive step, as he displayed increased velocity and better control by simplifying his mental approach on the mound. The Dodgers are heavily relying on the health and dependability of Glasnow and fellow pitcher Blake Snell to strengthen their rotation for the second half of the season. His ability to maintain this form will be pivotal for the team's championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, who were controversially transferred from the U.S. to El Salvador's high-security CECOT prison, have been returned to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange. The swap, which secured the release of 10 Americans held by Venezuela, led to emotional reunions for families who had no contact with the detainees for months. Many of the Venezuelans were legally in the U.S. with pending asylum claims when they were abruptly sent to the infamous prison under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. The U.S. government had paid El Salvador millions to detain them indefinitely without charge.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Army Scientists Propose Advanced 'X-Railgun' with Nearly Double the Power</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new electromagnetic weapon design, an 'X-railgun,' intended to be significantly more powerful than the navy's current model. The existing naval railgun, a world-first, has been limited by its power, as excessive current can liquefy metal components and cap projectile weight. The army's proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns, a design they claim will nearly double the force. This would allow it to fire heavier, more destructive projectiles, potentially overcoming a key hurdle in the military application of this advanced technology.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that the 1969 Apollo 11 mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. These views are broadly consistent across different political and ideological lines, suggesting a general public consensus on the value of space exploration.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are redefining the global AI landscape by championing open-source models, presenting a significant challenge to closed systems from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Google. Unlike OpenAI, which restricts access in China, Chinese developers have made their advanced large language models (LLMs) freely available worldwide. This collaborative approach has spurred a wave of AI applications in China and gained support from international developers. Analysts believe this open-source movement could pose a more serious threat to the dominance of proprietary U.S. models than previous open-source software did.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed ceasefire terms reportedly include the return of these 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 others in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes as Israeli intelligence officials reportedly visited Washington to discuss the potential relocation of Palestinians from Gaza to other countries, including Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Libya, with U.S. support.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who coped with the horrors of the Vietnam War by imagining a carousel, has turned that vision into a reality in Nederland, Colorado. After battling PTSD for years, Harrison began building the "Carousel of Happiness" in 1986, hand-carving its animals over 26 years. The carousel, which opened in 2010 as a nonprofit, has since brought joy to over a million visitors. For Harrison, the project has been a form of therapy, transforming a personal coping mechanism into a public source of joy and healing for his community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan legislation allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins backed by assets like the U.S. dollar, a move supporters say will strengthen the dollar's global role. The law is seen as a significant victory for the cryptocurrency industry, which has long advocated for clearer regulations to bring digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. Critics, however, have raised concerns about potential loopholes for money laundering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to accommodate a future dominated by tokenization. The rise of stablecoins presents new challenges for payment, clearing, and settlement infrastructures, particularly concerning anti-money-laundering (AML) efforts due to their cross-border and pseudonymous nature. This warning comes as the stablecoin market gains momentum, fueled by the Trump administration's embrace of digital currencies and growing interest from regulators like the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The adviser emphasized that these borderless instruments are at the forefront of the monetary policy debate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. The condition, described as common and benign in older adults, occurs when leg veins struggle to send blood back to the heart, causing it to pool. The doctor confirmed the diagnosis via ultrasound and blood work but found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots, declaring the president to be in "excellent health." Treatment for mild CVI typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise.</p>
