          <p>Ramona Sarsgaard, the daughter of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, was arrested at Columbia University during protests against Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza. The arrest occurred after student activists occupied part of the Butler library, renaming it the Basel al-Araj People‚Äôs University, and demanding the university divest from businesses involved in the conflict. University officials called in the police, leading to multiple arrests, including Sarsgaard who received a desk appearance ticket for criminal trespassing. The protests are part of a larger wave of anti-war demonstrations at Columbia and other US universities, amidst crackdowns on student activism.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, media executive Barry Diller reflects on his career, particularly his time at ABC, and emphasizes the importance of instinct over relying solely on data for decision-making. Diller argues that data can be harmful to instinct and that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea. He shares anecdotes about successful projects, such as "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which were driven by instinct rather than extensive research. Diller's perspective challenges the overreliance on structured information and PowerPoint presentations in business.</p>
