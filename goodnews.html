        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL), the world's largest EV battery maker, experienced a share price jump on its Hong Kong debut, raising almost HK$35.7bn. CATL supplies major carmakers, including Tesla and Toyota, and is expanding globally with new factories in Europe. The company's reliance on the Chinese market shields it from direct implications of US tariffs, though US lawmakers have expressed national security concerns. The listing was closely watched amid US-China trade tensions, with some US investors restricted from participating. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK newspapers are dominated by coverage of Sir Keir Starmer's new trade deal with the EU, promising economic boosts but facing criticism over fishing rights.

The papers also report on Donald Trump's phone call with Vladimir Putin, proposing a trade deal in exchange for ending the Ukraine war.

          <p>House Republicans are working through late-night sessions to advance President Trump‚Äôs tax cut and spending reduction package. The House Budget Committee convened late Sunday night to advance the bill, and the Rules Committee scheduled a meeting for Wednesday morning. The process involves blending provisions from multiple House committees into one legislative product, with some Republicans expressing concerns about spending cuts and green energy tax credits. The late-night meetings are a parliamentary strategy to manage the complex legislative process and potential amendments.</p>

Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, acknowledged making "very serious mistakes" but claimed they made him more qualified for the job. The nomination faced scrutiny due to his past legal issues, including federal tax evasion and FEC violations. Despite the controversy, Kushner secured confirmation with a vote of 51-45, marking a significant appointment in the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with both the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with its two largest trade partners. However, these deals required politically difficult concessions, reflecting Britain's diminished position in the post-Brexit era. The agreement with the EU will generate nearly 9 billion pounds a year by 2040, while the deal with the US includes lowered tariffs on British luxury cars. The trade-offs highlight the challenges of being a midsize economy operating between larger trading blocs.</p>

The trajectory of the current government is towards a closer relationship, though future governments may differ.
