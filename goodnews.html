          <p>The two-time defending champions, Oval Invincibles, solidified their position at the top of the men's Hundred cricket league table with a decisive seven-wicket victory against the Southern Brave. The team's bowlers were instrumental, dismissing the Brave for 133, with notable performances from Jason Behrendorff and Rashid Khan. In the chase, a powerful partnership between Jordan Cox and Sam Curran, who both scored half-centuries, guided the Invincibles to victory with 11 balls remaining. This win places them four points clear, making them strong contenders to secure a spot in the final stages of the tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a framework that includes an initial 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The proposal also involves negotiations for a permanent ceasefire to end the 22-month war. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously insisted on the release of all hostages at once, while intense Israeli military operations continue in Gaza City.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Debt Forgiveness Eligibility for Buy Now, Pay Later Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 16:46:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether debts from 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay can be included in debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, BNPL plans are technically eligible for negotiation and settlement by debt relief companies, similar to credit card debt. However, the process is complicated by the novelty of these services, as many debt relief firms may not have established relationships with BNPL providers. The article suggests that direct negotiation with the provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling may be more effective strategies for consumers struggling to manage these increasingly popular, yet potentially risky, payment plans.

          <p>Labor Day, celebrated on the first Monday of September, marks the unofficial end of summer and honors the contributions of American workers. Established as a federal holiday in 1894, it emerged from the labor movement's fight for better working conditions, including the eight-hour workday, at a time when 12-hour, seven-day workweeks were common. While many celebrate with gatherings, most major retailers like Target and Walmart will remain open, though Costco will be closed. Government offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will not operate, observing the holiday dedicated to the nation's workforce.</p>

          <h2>Texas Declares End to Measles Outbreak That Sickened Over 700 People</h2>

          <p>State health officials in Texas have officially declared the end of a major measles outbreak that infected 762 people, the largest in the state in over three decades. The outbreak, which began in January, tragically resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children and led to nearly 100 hospitalizations. The declaration comes after 42 days have passed without a new reported case, a period equivalent to two incubation cycles of the virus. Despite this success, officials remain vigilant, warning that new cases are likely due to ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S. and globally amid declining vaccination rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The musical "& Juliet" offers a vibrant and empowering revision of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, built around the hit songs of producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Shakespeare's wife, Anne, intervening to prevent Juliet's suicide, sending the heroine on a journey of self-discovery in Paris. This review praises the production for its witty book by David West Read and its euphoric, dance-party atmosphere, which successfully integrates pop anthems from artists like Britney Spears and Katy Perry. The result is a feel-good spectacle that transforms the original story into a celebration of second chances and female agency.</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Age Considerations When Purchasing Annuities for Retirement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether age limits affect the ability to purchase annuities, a popular retirement income tool. While there are no federal age caps, most insurance companies impose their own limits, typically between 80 and 85 years old, primarily to manage risk related to life expectancy. The best age to buy an annuity depends on individual financial strategy rather than a specific number. Purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s allows for growth in deferred annuities, while buying an immediate annuity closer to retirement age can supplement Social Security, with older buyers often receiving higher monthly payouts.</p>

          <p>Hollie Strano, a former longtime meteorologist for WKYC-TV in Cleveland, has started a new role providing morning weather forecasts for Mix 94.1, a radio station in Canton, Ohio. Strano's departure from WKYC in 2024 came after 22 years with the station, following a charge for operating a vehicle under the influence. She has since filed a lawsuit against her former employer, alleging her termination was related to her decision to publicly share her journey of recovery from alcoholism. In addition to her new radio gig, Strano also hosts a podcast and provides forecasts for stations in Georgia and Alabama.</p>

          <p>Reflecting the influence of internet culture on language, the Cambridge Dictionary has added thousands of new words, including popular slang terms like "skibidi," "delulu," and "tradwife." "Delulu," short for delusional, describes believing things that are not true, while "skibidi" is a versatile, often nonsensical word popularized by a YouTube series. These additions are part of a larger update of over 6,000 words that lexicographers believe will have lasting power in the English language. The new entries highlight how social media, celebrities, and online trends are rapidly shaping modern vocabulary.</p>
