          <h2>Targeted Cancer Drugs Show Promise as Potential Chemotherapy Replacements</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pharmaceutical companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing heavily in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapies that could potentially replace traditional chemotherapy. ADCs are designed to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells and reducing harsh side effects, and while challenges remain, some ADCs have shown the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. These companies are working to overcome issues such as premature release of the chemotherapy payload and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins to target, and ADCs could account for a significant portion of the worldwide cancer market in the coming years, offering a more precise and effective approach to cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>Yellow heat health alerts have been issued for most of England, with temperatures expected to soar later this week, potentially leading to the first heatwave of 2025. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warns of possible impacts on health and social services, including increased demand and risks to vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes. The UKHSA urges people to check in on vulnerable family, friends, and neighbors, advising them to take sensible precautions while enjoying the sun, and temperatures are expected to climb further into the weekend across western Europe.</p>

          <p>Provo, Utah, has been ranked as the best-run city in the U.S. by WalletHub, based on an analysis of 148 of the nation's largest cities. The study considered factors such as financial security, education, health, safety, and infrastructure, comparing the quality of services against each city's per-capita budget. Provo stood out due to its robust business growth, high school graduation rate, infrastructure, and low violent crime rate, and Nampa, Idaho, and Manchester, New Hampshire, followed closely behind in the rankings.</p>

          <p>Sword Health, a digital pain management startup, is expanding into mental health with the launch of Mind, a service that combines AI, hardware, and human mental health professionals to treat mild depression and anxiety. The company has raised $40 million in a funding round led by General Catalyst, valuing the company at $4 billion, and Mind users will receive a wrist wearable called the 'M-band' to measure environmental and physiological signals. Sword's CEO, Virg√≠lio Bento, emphasizes that a human is always involved in patient care and that AI is not making clinical decisions, and the company believes that its always-on approach is the future of mental health delivery.</p>

          <p>The Mayor of London is moving forward with plans to pedestrianize parts of Oxford Street, aiming to ban vehicles from a 0.7-mile stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. The proposal depends on obtaining permission from the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government to establish a new mayoral development corporation with planning powers. While the plan has garnered support, concerns remain about traffic diversion, the impact on bus routes, and accessibility for disabled individuals, and key questions remain unanswered, including about "traffic diversion and the impact of moving 16 bus routes into narrow, congested one-way streets in Marylebone and Fitzrovia".</p>

          <p>Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff has described Red Bull's protest against George Russell as 'petty' and 'embarrassing' after Russell finished first at the Canadian Grand Prix. Red Bull lodged a protest claiming Russell drove 'erratically' behind the safety car, but it was rejected by the stewards, and Wolff told Sky Sports at the New York premiere of F1 that it took team Red Bull Racing two hours before they launched the protest, so that was in their doing. Red Bull boss Christian Horner suggested he had no regrets lodging a complaint, stating it's a team's right to do so.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz has announced that it will remove FD&C artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027 and will not launch any new products in the U.S. containing those ingredients. The decision follows pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for the food industry to pull back on artificial dyes as part of a larger so-called Make America Healthy Again platform. The FDA in April announced a plan to phase out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year and replace them with natural alternatives, and Kraft Heinz said it has made more than 1,000 recipe changes over the past five years to improve product nutrition.</p>

Some argue that conservatives have failed to address economic challenges faced by families and have neglected important institutions like the family. The piece explores the role of universities in shaping political views and the potential for civic renewal through individuals focused on the public interest, and the authors also express concerns about climate change and its impact on the nation's ability to recover.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that Bitcoin could reach a price of $1 million per coin due to its scarcity and growing demand. The analysis highlights the limited supply of Bitcoin, with only 21 million coins ever to exist, and the increasing demand from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). It notes that the scarcity alone does not imply that buyers will actually bid more to secure the asset, but it does anchor the bullish math quite strongly, and hitting $1 million implies a $17 trillion market cap, which is about the size of today's existing gold stock.

British maritime security firm Ambrey said the cause of the incident, 22 nautical miles east of Khor Fakkan, was not security-related, and the strait is a vital maritime entry point to the Persian Gulf, accounting for the passage of around a fifth of the world's oil. Frontline said its oil tanker Front Eagle had been involved in a collision and described the event as a navigational incident that was not related to the ongoing regional conflict between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan decided Tuesday to slow the pace of its government bond-buying reduction beyond next year while keeping interest rates unchanged, underscoring a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid trade and economic uncertainties. Governor Kazuo Ueda expressed concern about the outlook for Japan's economy in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes, saying downside risks now "exceed" upside ones for both growth and prices. With Trump's tariffs expected to take a heavy toll on Japan's export-driven economy, the BOJ kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 0.5 percent. (not investment advice)</p>
