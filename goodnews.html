          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist involved in Columbia University protests against Israel's war in Gaza, was released from federal immigration detention in Louisiana after 104 days. Khalil, a Syrian-born Algerian permanent resident, stated that "justice prevailed, but it's very long overdue." A U.S. District Judge ordered his release, citing a lack of evidence that Khalil posed a flight risk or public danger. The Trump administration is still attempting to deport Khalil, alleging he lied to obtain his green card, so his legal battle continues. He is married to a US citizen and has a son who was born while he was in detention.</p>

          <p>Japan has returned the remains of ten Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the country's first repatriation of this kind. The remains, taken in the 19th and 20th centuries, were held by three Japanese research institutions and handed over in a ceremony at the Australian Embassy in Tokyo. This repatriation is part of a global movement to return indigenous remains taken abroad for research or collection. Australia has been working with institutions worldwide for over 30 years to secure the return of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander remains, with more than 1,785 sets repatriated so far.</p>
