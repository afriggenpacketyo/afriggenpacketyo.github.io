          <p>The latest Marvel film, “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” remained at the top of the North American box office in its second weekend, earning $40 million. However, this figure represents a steep 66% decline from its impressive debut, a more significant drop than other recent superhero films. New comedy releases “The Bad Guys 2” and “The Naked Gun” secured the second and third spots, respectively, with solid openings. While the overall summer box office is tracking ahead of last year, analysts note that the longevity of major releases will be crucial for reaching industry revenue targets.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City and New Jersey area on Saturday night, causing brief shaking but no significant damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, at a depth of about 10 kilometers. Residents reported feeling a loud boom and a shake, comparing it to a vehicle hitting their house, but emergency services found no structural issues. This minor tremor follows a more notable 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled the region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity, though rare, does occur on the East Coast.</p>

The victory propelled the Spirit to second place in the league standings as teams returned from a six-week summer break.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has emerged as a leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity last year than California, driven primarily by utility companies like Florida Power & Light. The state's rapid growth is supported by favorable economics and streamlined regulations for projects under 75 megawatts, making solar a cheaper option than natural gas. However, the industry faces future challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to significantly reduce rooftop solar installations. While utility-scale projects continue, they are encountering grid constraints, prompting investments in storage and infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers managed to secure a 3-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays by manufacturing runs through aggressive baserunning and situational hitting, overcoming a persistent team-wide offensive slump. Key moments included a daring send of Freddie Freeman to score on a single and a crucial double-steal that set up another RBI. The win came after a lineup shuffle that moved Shohei Ohtani back to the leadoff spot, though the team's overall hitting struggles remain a concern. The victory allowed the Dodgers to conclude their nine-game road trip with a winning record, providing a small boost of momentum.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano, located on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume more than 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption occurred shortly after a major earthquake in the region, though it is unclear if the events are related. Russian authorities reported that the ash was spreading over the Pacific Ocean and did not pose an immediate threat to any populated areas. Volcanologists confirmed this is the first historically recorded eruption of the volcano, with its last major activity estimated to have occurred around the 15th or 16th century.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has announced it will restore references to President Donald Trump's two impeachments to an exhibit at the National Museum of American History. The decision follows a report that a temporary placard detailing the impeachments had been removed from the "American Presidency" exhibit in July. The Smithsonian stated the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not the result of any political pressure. The institution affirmed its responsibility to present accurate and complete histories and will update the exhibit to reflect all impeachment proceedings in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix, closing the championship gap on his teammate Oscar Piastri to just nine points. The victory was his third in the last four races but came after a challenging start where he dropped to fifth place on the first lap. Norris admitted he is "not making life very easy" for himself with small issues that have complicated his races this season. He successfully executed an alternate one-stop tyre strategy to recover and secure the win, a move he said was rewarding but one he initially doubted would work.</p>

A tense fourth day saw sublime centuries from England's Harry Brook and Joe Root, which seemed to put them on course for a record-breaking chase. However, a late comeback from India's seamers, combined with rain and bad light stopping play, has left the match on a knife-edge, promising a thrilling finale.</p>
