          <p>Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant posted a brief reaction on X to the NBA Draft Lottery results, which saw the Dallas Mavericks land the top pick despite having only a 1.8% chance. Durant's tweet highlighted the potential stress tanking places on an organization, given the unlikelihood of securing a top pick even with poor performance. The article also notes the Suns' current crossroads, needing to decide whether to rebuild after an unsuccessful season despite having stars such as Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal. The NBA lottery odds have flattened in recent years, which makes it more unlikely that teams who hit the reset button will end up being rewarded with the rights to a top three selection.</p>

Speaking in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump stated his administration has already taken initial steps to restore normal relations with Syria after more than a decade. Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011 following a crackdown on anti-government uprisings.

She is advocating for social media platforms to implement safeguards and provide direct access for reporting and rectifying such instances of misinformation.

          <p>The United States and China have announced a temporary reduction in tariffs, easing trade tensions and boosting stock prices. Under the agreement, the U.S. will reduce tariffs on goods from China to 30 percent, while China will reciprocate. Economists warn that the short-term nature of the deal limits its benefits, as companies remain hesitant to make long-term investments due to ongoing uncertainty. The agreement is an executive action, not a legally binding treaty, meaning tariffs could be reinstated or increased after 90 days. The move signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war, but long-term economic uncertainty persists.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite signs of economic improvement, such as easing inflation and a steady job market, credit card debt forgiveness remains a relevant option for many Americans struggling with high-interest balances. Experts argue that economic improvement doesn't always translate to immediate relief for households burdened by debt. Credit card interest rates remain elevated, making it difficult for borrowers to make significant progress on their balances. Debt forgiveness can provide targeted relief by reducing the debt obligation and offering a path out of a seemingly endless cycle of minimum payments and compounding interest. While debt forgiveness has trade-offs, it can be a viable solution for those overwhelmed by their balances and unable to find relief through other means.</p>

Luria argues that Google's current market capitalization is undervalued due to concerns about its search engine's dominance in the face of AI chatbots. By spinning off YouTube, Search, Google Cloud, Waymo, and its AI segments into separate entities, Luria estimates the combined value of these businesses could reach $3.7 trillion, compared to Google's current market cap below $2 trillion.

The Dodgers' coaching staff is exploring potential mechanical adjustments and pitch conviction issues to help Sasaki regain his velocity and improve his overall effectiveness.

          <p>Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including staff cuts and grant cancellations, is facing scrutiny from Congress. Kennedy will testify before lawmakers to discuss President Trump's proposed budget for the agency, which would make the restructuring permanent. Former HHS leaders have weighed in on Kennedy's approach, with some supporting the need for cuts while others criticizing the lack of strategy and potential impact on public health programs. The hearings are expected to address questions about the future of HHS and Kennedy's vision for the agency.</p>

          <p>Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler cautions that weight loss drugs, while transformative, have "no end game" due to a lack of data on long-term use and how to safely discontinue them. Kessler, who used the drugs himself, explains that they condition the brain to want less food but that this effect fades upon cessation, leading to potential weight regain. He urges the FDA to require data on safe usage and discontinuation practices, highlighting the current situation as a "national experiment." He also stresses the importance of comprehensive care, including diet and exercise, for long-term weight management.</p>
