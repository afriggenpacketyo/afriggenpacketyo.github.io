          <p>The UK and the US have reached an agreement to reduce or remove tariffs on specific goods traded between the two countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, while tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped. The deal does not include changes to the UK's digital services tax on US firms, but both countries have agreed to work on a digital trade deal. This agreement marks a significant achievement for the UK, but months of negotiations and legal paperwork are expected to follow.</p>

          <p>India is considering a trade deal with the U.S., potentially offering zero tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals up to a certain quantity, signaling a shift from its protectionist policies. President Trump's tariffs on Indian exports have prompted India to rethink its stance and seek a trade agreement. Experts suggest that while a deal could benefit some sectors, India will likely safeguard its domestic businesses. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and a trade deal could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding its global market access.</p>
