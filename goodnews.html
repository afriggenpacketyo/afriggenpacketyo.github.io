          <p>Google is hiring Varun Mohan, the CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion for licensing and compensation. This move intensifies the ongoing talent war in the artificial intelligence sector, following similar high-stakes hires by competitors like Meta and Microsoft. While Google gains top talent and licenses some technology, Windsurf will continue to operate independently under a new interim CEO. The deal underscores the increasing value of specialized AI startups and their personnel in the competitive tech landscape.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a single day last week, these ETFs saw inflows of $1.18 billion, signaling strong institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Analysts suggest this institutional buying could propel the price even higher in the near future. The rally also coincides with the U.S. Congress beginning deliberations on new crypto-focused legislation, which is supported by the Trump administration and aims to provide regulatory clarity for the industry.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding analysts' forecasts and indicating resilience in its trade sector. This growth was largely supported by strong demand from non-U.S. markets, particularly Southeast Asian nations and the European Union. A temporary 90-day tariff truce with the United States also helped slow the decline in shipments to America. Despite the positive data, the overall trade relationship with the U.S. remains complex, with both sides working towards an August deadline for a more durable agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed expectations, was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. This economic expansion was partly attributed to a temporary pause in U.S.-China tariffs, which may have encouraged businesses to front-load exports. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Her case, which resulted in the conviction of her ex-husband and 50 co-defendants, shocked the nation and spurred legal reforms.
