          <p>Faced with home prices that have surged over 50% since 2020, a growing number of Americans are teaming up with friends or relatives to enter the housing market. This trend, known as co-buying, allows individuals to pool their financial resources to overcome significant affordability challenges, particularly for single buyers who are at a disadvantage compared to couples. While the arrangement offers a path to homeownership and companionship, it also presents unique legal and financial complexities. Housing experts strongly advise co-buyers to create a formal written agreement to navigate potential future disagreements regarding property taxes, maintenance, or selling the home.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has asserted that China's semiconductor industry is extremely close to matching U.S. capabilities, describing the gap as being mere "nanoseconds." Speaking on a recent podcast, Huang emphasized China's deep talent pool, competitive work culture, and vibrant high-tech industry as reasons for its rapid advancement. He argued that to maintain its lead and maximize economic influence, the United States should allow its tech companies to compete globally, including in the Chinese market. Huang expressed his belief that it is in China's best interest to remain open to foreign investment and competition.</p>

The couple, who became engaged in late 2024 after a year of dating, shared photos of the event on social media. The wedding was attended by approximately 170 guests, including notable figures like Taylor Swift, Paul Rudd, and Gomez's co-stars Steve Martin and Martin Short. Gomez and Blanco have collaborated on several musical projects over the years, including the 2015 hits "Same Old Love" and "Kill Em with Kindness," as well as a recent album exploring their relationship.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of an electronic identity card system, after a previous proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data privacy concerns. The revised plan addresses those issues by making the e-ID system entirely optional and keeping it under public control, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the system will streamline many bureaucratic and commercial processes, from signing contracts to age verification. However, opponents remain concerned about potential privacy erosion and data misuse, though recent polls suggest voters may be more receptive this time.</p>

          <p>The final day of the Ryder Cup could see the implementation of the rarely used "envelope rule" after European player Viktor Hovland withdrew from a Saturday match due to a neck injury. Before the Sunday singles matches, each team captain secretly submits the name of one player in a sealed envelope. If a player from the opposing team has to withdraw due to injury or illness, the player named in the envelope also sits out, and the match is declared a tie with each team receiving half a point. Hovland's potential absence from his scheduled singles match could impact the final outcome, as Europe needs only a few points to secure victory.</p>

          <p>The British government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support the company and its suppliers following a prolonged production shutdown caused by a cyber-attack. The halt in operations, which began in late August, has raised concerns that smaller firms in JLR's supply chain could face bankruptcy. This government intervention, intended to protect thousands of jobs, is believed to be the first of its kind in response to a cyber-attack. The loan aims to provide financial stability as JLR works to recover from the hack and resume manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citizens of Zurich, Switzerland's largest city, are voting in a referendum on a proposal to significantly restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to curb noise and air pollution. If passed, the measure would completely ban gas-powered models and permit the use of electric devices only between October and December, with special exceptions required at other times. Supporters of the initiative argue that the machines are loud, spread fine dust, and harm microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents contend that the ban is an example of an excessive and impractical culture of prohibition that would create unnecessary difficulties for residents and maintenance workers.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A task force has identified twelve potential locations, with sites in Bedfordshire, Leeds, and north London being the most promising candidates. The plan aims to address the national housing shortage and stimulate economic growth, drawing inspiration from the post-WWII housing boom. The government will confirm the final locations and funding next spring, with a goal for each new town to contain at least 10,000 homes, 40% of which will be classified as affordable.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to require a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications could inadvertently drive highly skilled tech talent to the Middle East. Gulf nations, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are aggressively investing in becoming global AI hubs, offering high compensation packages, a tax-friendly environment, and long-term golden visas to attract top professionals. This business-friendly approach contrasts with growing immigration restrictions in the U.S. and Europe, potentially making the Gulf region a more attractive destination. Analysts suggest these policies could position the Middle East to win the intensifying global war for tech talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion column responds to recent controversial claims about autism from the Trump administration by highlighting positive traits often associated with autistic people. The author argues that qualities such as a capacity for intense focus, adherence to facts, a strong sense of social justice, and profound empathy stand in stark contrast to Donald Trump's public behavior. The article criticizes the framing of autism as a tragedy in need of a cure, instead celebrating the unique perspectives and strengths within the autistic community. It suggests that the world could learn valuable lessons from the joy, love, and honesty demonstrated by many autistic individuals.</p>

          <p>As the MLB regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are finalizing their roster for the wild-card series, with several key questions remaining. The health of players like Max Muncy and Will Smith is a primary concern, but the team must also decide on the composition of its pitching staff. The bullpen has an abundance of left-handed relievers, and the team is considering options to add right-handed depth, potentially by using starter Tyler Glasnow in a relief role. Meanwhile, late-season performances from veterans like Kiké Hernández could secure them a spot, forcing difficult choices among the position players before the postseason begins.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is confronting its history by dedicating a new, prominent monument to the victims of the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre. In that event, a mob of European migrant miners killed 28 Chinese laborers and burned down their community. This public acknowledgment, which includes an ongoing archaeological dig at the site of the former Chinatown, marks a significant shift for the town. The commemoration occurs at a time of national debate over immigration, with local officials noting the irony of honoring past immigrants while current state and local policies align with stricter federal enforcement measures.</p>
