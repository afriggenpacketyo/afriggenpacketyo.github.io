          <p>The town of Marshall, North Carolina, has reopened to visitors after being ravaged by Hurricane Helene nearly nine months prior. Businesses along the French Broad River, which saw a significant rise in water levels during the storm, are welcoming tourists again. Business owners recall the extensive mud damage and the overwhelming support from volunteers who helped with the cleanup efforts. Flow Gallery and Zuma's Coffee have reopened, with owners expressing a sense of victory and improvement over pre-hurricane conditions. The reopening signifies resilience and community spirit in the face of natural disaster.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order to enact portions of a trade agreement between the UK and the US, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US. The agreement allows up to 100,000 cars to enter the US at a 10% tariff, lower than the previously imposed 25% import tax. The order also establishes a similar system for steel and aluminum, though specific details were not provided. The UK government aims to eliminate tariffs on core steel products and the deal will remove tariffs on certain aerospace products, marking a positive step in US-UK trade relations.</p>

          <p>British Steel has been awarded a five-year, ¬£500 million contract to supply train tracks to Network Rail, securing thousands of jobs at the Scunthorpe steelworks. The agreement ensures that British Steel will provide 80% of Network Rail's track needs, with other European steelmakers supplying specialist products. The contract represents a significant vote of confidence in UK workers and British industry, especially after the government intervened to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces. The deal aims to strengthen domestic manufacturing and supply chains, contributing to economic growth.</p>

          <p>The campaign team of Rafal Trzaskowski, the defeated liberal candidate in Poland's presidential election, has filed a protest over alleged voting irregularities. Trzaskowski narrowly lost to nationalist Karol Nawrocki in the second round of the election. The Supreme Court has ordered a recount in several commissions due to reported irregularities, but this is unlikely to change the overall result. The PiS party claims Trzaskowski's supporters are trying to undermine faith in the democratic process.</p>

This marks the most significant cooperation between the cities since the launch of the Stock Connect scheme in 2014.</p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival is showcasing contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces that address themes of oppression and conflict. The "Queer Passion" focuses on the suffering of LGBTQ individuals, particularly in regions like Russia and the USA. The "Arabian Passion" delivers a message of peace between the West and East, with excerpts from Bach's St. John and St. Matthew Passion sung in Arabic. This year's festival theme, "transformation," highlights the relevance of Bach's music to modern issues and his own practice of revising his works.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles that protect Israel from incoming attacks. However, experts note that building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's size and the types of missiles it would need to defend against. The differences between the two systems are vast, making the Golden Dome a far more ambitious project.</p>

The total amount of purchases will decline to about 2 trillion yen monthly in early 2027.
