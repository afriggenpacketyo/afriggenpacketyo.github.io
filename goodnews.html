          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that Intel should provide the U.S. government with a non-voting equity stake in return for funds from the CHIPS Act. This represents a strategic shift from the previous administration's grant-based approach, aiming for the American public to gain a financial share in the companies it supports. The policy change comes as Intel proceeds with plans to reshore advanced semiconductor manufacturing with new facilities in Ohio. This new equity-for-funding model could potentially be applied to other recipients of federal CHIPS funding as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Foodservice chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are increasingly relying on new and customized beverage offerings to attract customers and boost sales, particularly among younger consumers. According to market research, the number of beverage options at top chains has grown over 9%, with a strong emphasis on cold drinks, specialty coffees, and energy drinks. This strategic shift comes as consumers are more frequently visiting establishments solely for a beverage, rather than as an add-on to a meal. The trend reflects a broader effort to adapt to changing consumer habits and navigate a challenging economic environment.</p>

In his first public comments on the reunion, he expressed pride in his brother, frontman Liam Gallagher, noting it has been great to be back in a band with him. The singer-songwriter admitted to underestimating the experience, describing how his legs turned to jelly during their first show back in Cardiff. The tour has already played several dates in the UK and Ireland and will head to North America before returning for more shows.</p>

          <p>The back-to-school shopping season is being influenced by import tariffs and budget-conscious consumers, leading to forecasts of slightly lower spending compared to last year. Surveys indicate that families are concerned about rising prices due to tariffs, prompting many to shop earlier to find deals. This environment is expected to benefit value-oriented retailers like TJX Companies, Costco, and Amazon, which are positioned to attract shoppers seeking to stretch their budgets. For other retailers, the situation presents a challenge of balancing pricing strategies to protect profit margins without alienating price-sensitive customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The senior living real estate market is facing a significant supply-demand imbalance as the baby boomer generation ages, with millions set to turn 80 in the coming years. Occupancy rates are rising rapidly while new inventory growth has fallen to its lowest point since 2006, creating a strong investment opportunity. High interest rates and construction costs are major roadblocks to new development, constraining supply even as demand is projected to surge. This dynamic has made the sector increasingly attractive to investors, who are seeing strong returns from existing properties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a complaint against a group of individuals for allegedly using a network of fake accounts and sophisticated software to purchase and resell hundreds of thousands of tickets on Ticketmaster. The group is accused of violating the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act by acquiring tickets for high-demand concerts, including those of Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, and then reselling them on secondary markets for a significant profit. The complaint details how the operation spent nearly $57 million on tickets, which were then resold for almost $64 million, with $1.2 million in profit coming from Taylor Swift's Eras Tour alone.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised the "steady progress" in bilateral relations with China during a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. This positive assessment comes after years of strained ties between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, which hit a low point following a deadly border clash in 2020. A diplomatic thaw began last year, and Modi is now scheduled to visit China at the end of August for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, his first trip there in seven years. The improving relationship coincides with increased trade friction between India and its traditional ally, the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a public university president's ban on drag shows violates the First Amendment, though the decision came more than two years after the initial prohibition. The case, Spectrum WT v. Wendler, involved the president of West Texas A&M University canceling a planned student LGBTQ+ group event. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals eventually affirmed that drag is a form of expression protected by the Constitution. However, the significant delay in the ruling, attributed partly to the initial decision by a notoriously conservative trial judge, meant that many affected students graduated before their rights were affirmed.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly expanding its iPhone production in India, a move that coincides with the White House pressuring the country over its purchases of Russian oil. The U.S. Treasury Secretary has indicated that secondary tariffs are planned for India due to its role in buying and reselling sanctioned Russian oil. Meanwhile, Apple is said to be increasing output at five factories in India in preparation for its new iPhone 17 models, continuing its strategy of diversifying its supply chain away from China. This expansion highlights the complex interplay of global trade, geopolitics, and corporate strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
