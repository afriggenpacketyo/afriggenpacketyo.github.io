          <p>China is set to accelerate the expansion of its national carbon market, aiming to incorporate major polluting industries by 2027, three years earlier than previously planned. New guidelines also introduce a tougher standard by setting absolute limits on emissions, moving beyond the current carbon intensity-based caps that allow emissions to increase. This ambitious initiative is designed to invigorate the often-sluggish carbon market and underscores the government's heightened commitment to achieving its climate targets. Heavily polluting sectors like steel, aluminum, and cement will be added this year.</p>

          <p>US Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley faces a profound and "defining" decision regarding whether he will serve as a playing captain, a role not seen since 1963. Despite being ranked 11th in the world and displaying recent strong form, the extensive duties of captaincy make combining it with playing a complex challenge. Bradley's choice carries significant implications, as he risks criticism for self-indulgence if the US loses while he plays, or for not contributing on the course if he sits out. This unique quandary adds a compelling storyline to the upcoming Ryder Cup.</p>

Ortega, who also appeared on Bravo's "Below Deck," highlights that success in yachting prioritizes a willingness to learn, a customer service-oriented personality, and humility over prior boating experience. He notes significant financial advantages, including minimal living expenses and potential tax benefits, which allowed him to save considerably. However, Ortega cautions that the demanding lifestyle often involves extended periods away from family and is not always easy.</p>
