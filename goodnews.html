          <p>Chinese state media indicates that technical negotiations between China and the European Union regarding EV tariffs are nearly complete. The resolution now primarily depends on the political will of the EU to finalize the deal. This development comes after two years of trade tensions, during which the EU has launched multiple investigations into Chinese trade practices, including subsidies and alleged market distortions. A deal could de-escalate a significant trade conflict between the two economic powers and provide relief for the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team achieved a 21-10 victory against the New South Wales Waratahs in a challenging match in Sydney. Scotland's Huw Jones was instrumental, scoring two tries in the first half to establish an early lead for the Lions. Despite a comeback attempt from the understrength Waratahs, a third try by Alex Mitchell secured the win for the tourists. The performance was described as disjointed, marking a frustrating but ultimately successful third consecutive win on their Australian tour.</p>

          <p>Nestor Montalvo, a 61-year-old retired police officer, survived a life-threatening stroke after initially mistaking his symptoms of blurred vision and numbness for a bad hangover. After collapsing, he was rushed to a hospital where doctors gave him a slim 15% chance of survival, but quick action and clot-busting medication saved his life. The article details his difficult recovery, which involved a tracheotomy and extensive speech and physical therapy to regain his ability to talk and eat. A year later, he is enjoying retirement with his family, serving as a powerful reminder of the importance of recognizing stroke symptoms.</p>

          <p>A coalition of Florida residents, environmental groups, and businesses successfully lobbied for a permanent ban on oil and gas exploration near the Apalachicola River basin. The "Kill the Drill" movement was spurred by a permit granted to a Louisiana company, evoking painful memories of the economic damage caused by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill threat. Their efforts led to the passage of House Bill 1143, which Governor Ron DeSantis recently signed into law, protecting the ecologically vital region and its tourism and seafood industries from future drilling threats.</p>

          <p>The British royal family's tradition of granting Royal Warrants, a seal of approval for goods and services, highlights their continued influence as brand marketers. The article notes that King Charles, Queen Camilla, and soon the Prince and Princess of Wales, endorse a wide range of products, from luxury cars to chimney sweeps, which signals quality and class to consumers, particularly in the U.S. This influence is underscored by a recent poll suggesting a surprising number of young Americans would favor being ruled by the British monarch, reflecting the enduring soft power of the monarchy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight key OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase their collective oil production by 548,000 barrels per day starting in August. This hike is larger than the previously anticipated 411,000 barrels per day and continues the group's strategy of gradually unwinding voluntary supply cuts. The decision was attributed to a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories. This move further accelerates the pace of production increases seen in recent months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article profiles Reverend William Barber and his revived Poor People's Campaign, a national movement using nonviolent protest to challenge poverty and systemic inequality. Rooted in a "fusion" strategy that unites diverse groups, the movement holds "Moral Mondays" to protest policies they deem harmful, such as cuts to healthcare and food assistance under the Trump administration. Barber's approach frames these issues not just as political failures but as moral crises, drawing on a prophetic tradition to demand a reckoning in the public square. The piece explores the movement's tactics, challenges, and its urgent mission.</p>

          <p>FICO, the leading credit scoring company, will begin incorporating buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan data into its credit score models, a change that will impact millions of consumers. For users who make timely payments, this could help build their credit history, which is especially beneficial for younger borrowers or those with limited credit. However, it also means that late payments or accumulating too much BNPL debt could negatively affect scores, a risk for the many sub-prime borrowers who use these services. While the change is set for fall 2025, widespread adoption by lenders may be slow. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from researchers at several prominent Chinese universities suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, could have cancer-fighting properties. The research indicates that the drug may bolster the immune system's anti-tumor response by strengthening dendritic cells, which are crucial for identifying and attacking cancer cells. These immune cells often become depleted or impaired as a tumor progresses, and the study found sildenafil could help reverse this process. The findings, published in the journal Nature, are being hailed as a potential new strategy for tumor immunotherapy.</p>

          <p>The Pasadena community showed overwhelming support for Christopher Luna Garcia, a 14-year-old who took over his mother's tamale cart after a recent immigration sweep left her too fearful to work. After a community activist shared his story on social media, hundreds of customers lined up, buying out all 500 of his tamales and raising over $1,500 for his family. The event highlights a trend of American-born children stepping up for their immigrant parents amid increased federal enforcement actions.

          <p>Hamas has reportedly given a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-proposed plan for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza, stating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a Palestinian official indicated that Hamas has requested several changes, including a halt to a U.S.-backed aid system and a guarantee that the war will not resume if talks fail. The 60-day plan is believed to involve a staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an increase in humanitarian aid. The development raises hopes for a potential deal, though Israel has not yet commented.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, Shandong province. This project, combined with another recent offshore installation, forms the largest initiative of its kind for the company. The two projects are expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. The panels' proximity to the water's surface also increases their energy generation efficiency, marking a notable breakthrough for the solar industry.</p>
