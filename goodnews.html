          <p>The White House clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I" was intended as an additional proclamation, not a replacement for Veterans Day. This clarification came a day after Trump's social media post, which also mentioned designating May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." The article notes that establishing a federal holiday or national observance requires congressional approval, highlighting the process behind such designations. Optimism Score: 75</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book reveals that Joe Biden's aides discussed the possibility of him taking a cognitive test during his re-election campaign. The aides were confident Biden would pass, but they worried that taking the test would raise further questions about his mental abilities. Ultimately, Biden did not take the test, and he later stepped down from his re-election campaign in favor of Kamala Harris after a poor debate performance against Donald Trump. Optimism Score: 60</p>
