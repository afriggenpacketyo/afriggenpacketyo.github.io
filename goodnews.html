The Strategic Defence Review, led by Lord Robertson, will make 62 recommendations aimed at moving the armed forces to "warfighting readiness." The building of the new submarines will support 30,000 jobs into the 2030s, along with apprenticeships and graduate roles. </p>

          <p>According to Angela Zhang, a law professor at the University of Southern California, US-China tariff war will affect the Chinese technology sector in two main ways. Higher tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market. As Chinese companies face more trade barriers from the US, they‚Äôll need to work even harder on cutting costs and scaling up. Chinese companies will look more aggressively to other markets ‚Äì Asia, Latin America, Africa and deepen trade with Europe, including offering technology transfers in exchange for market access. </p>
