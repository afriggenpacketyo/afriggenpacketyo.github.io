          <p>The New York Islanders have chosen 17-year-old defenseman Matthew Schaefer as the first overall pick in the 2025 NHL draft. Schaefer, who played for the Erie Otters in the OHL, is the first defenseman selected at number one since 2021. His selection comes after a challenging year where he recovered from a broken collarbone and dealt with significant personal loss, including the death of his mother. During the draft event, an emotional Schaefer honored his mother's memory by kissing a breast cancer awareness patch on his new Islanders jersey.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent details a project at the University of Southampton that investigates bacteriophages‚Äîviruses that prey on bacteria‚Äîas a potential weapon against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The journalist successfully collected a phage sample from his home toilet that proved effective in a lab setting at killing bacteria from a patient with a recurring urinary tract infection. This century-old field of phage therapy is gaining renewed interest as the global threat of antimicrobial resistance grows, with projections estimating 10 million deaths annually by 2050. Researchers believe phages could become a viable alternative to antibiotics for treating certain infections.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a national parliamentary election, the Japanese government has formally requested that major social media platform operators take measures to counter the spread of harmful online content. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued the request to prevent disinformation and defamation targeting political candidates. This move comes as both ruling and opposition parties acknowledge the need to address false information during election cycles. However, there is currently no consensus on the specific regulatory framework or how strictly such content should be managed by the platforms.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, an 18-year-old senior at Waunakee High School, sought to overcome her social anxiety and reconnect with her peers in a unique way. Feeling isolated, she spent approximately 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates whom she had known since elementary school. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with surprise and admiration. The project not only helped Schafer bridge the social gap but also prompted her classmates to reflect on their own high school relationships and the importance of reaching out.</p>

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked an executive order from President Trump that targeted a prominent law firm, in this case, Susman Godfrey. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan declared the order unconstitutional, following similar decisions in cases brought by three other firms. These executive orders sought to punish firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president by suspending security clearances and ending government contracts. The series of judicial rebukes represents a significant defense of the legal profession's independence and the right to counsel against executive overreach.</p>

While musically tight, the show was seen by some critics as playing it safe.

The West Indies suffered a dramatic collapse in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their second-innings wickets as they chased a target of 301. After a promising start, the hosts' batting order was dismantled by Hazlewood's controlled bowling spell. Despite some late resistance, Australia secured the win with two full days to spare, demonstrating their clinical approach to closing out the match.</p>

          <p>To combat the exodus of film and television production to other locations, the California legislature has approved a bill to more than double the state's annual tax incentives to $750 million. The measure, part of a broader tax bill supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to keep Hollywood production local. Industry unions and professionals have applauded the move, arguing it is a critical step to support the state's economy and bring jobs back to California. The entertainment industry has seen a decline in local production and job losses in recent years due to more competitive incentives elsewhere. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria made a powerful political statement during his Paris Fashion Week show by referencing the treatment of deported migrants held in Salvadoran prisons. The show opened with models dressed in white with their hands tied, kneeling in a formation reminiscent of images from high-security detention centers. Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the show aimed to highlight the "dehumanization of how immigrants are being treated in the United States." The provocative presentation was largely praised online as a revolutionary use of fashion for political commentary, though some found it distasteful.</p>
