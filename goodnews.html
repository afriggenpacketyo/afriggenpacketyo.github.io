          <p>A new study reveals that microchips implanted into the eyes of legally blind patients, combined with special glasses, have helped some regain the ability to read. The photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA) treatment, involving a hair-thin implant and camera-equipped glasses, showed meaningful visual acuity improvement in 26 out of 32 geographic atrophy patients. This advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration affects millions, and until recently, lacked treatments to improve reading or face recognition. While promising, the PRIMA implant is not yet licensed for widespread use outside of trials.</p>

          <p>LeBron James is no longer facing a small claims court lawsuit after a fan, Andrew Garcia, withdrew his claim for ticket money. Garcia had sued after James's social media tease of a "Second Decision" led him to believe the NBA star was retiring, prompting him to buy expensive tickets for a future game. Garcia dropped the suit after accepting an offer from PrizePicks, a fantasy sports app, which deposited the full ticket amount in promo funds and offered additional perks. This resolution highlights the impact of celebrity social media on fan behavior and the unexpected ways disputes can be resolved.</p>

          <p>Historians are reflecting on the U.S. Constitution's 250-year history, noting its design for amendment, yet a lack of significant changes in over 50 years. Jeffrey Rosen, CEO of the National Constitution Center, warns that the founders feared a breakdown in deliberation and debate. Jill Lepore's book, "We the People," emphasizes the Constitution's intended adaptability, highlighting the initial struggle for ratification and the eventual addition of the Bill of Rights. Concerns are raised about checks and balances not functioning as intended, with Congress's inaction and the Supreme Court's expanded power deviating from the founders' vision, yet its core principles remain eternal.</p>

          <h2>Halloween Spending Set to Reach Record Highs Despite Rising Prices</h2>

          <p>Americans are projected to spend a record $13.1 billion this Halloween, an increase from last year, with average per-person spending rising to $114.45. This surge in spending comes despite higher prices for many festive items, including chocolate candy, which has seen price increases due to soaring cocoa costs caused by extreme weather in West Africa. Consumers are adapting by seeking budget-friendly alternatives like gummies and embracing DIY costumes and decorations, often inspired by social media. The article notes that tariffs on imported goods, particularly from China, also contribute to the increased cost of Halloween products.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth companies saw significant gains as investors reacted to Chinese export restrictions and the Trump administration's strategic efforts to build a domestic supply chain. Rare earths are crucial minerals for technology and energy transition, used in everything from electric vehicles to fighter jets. A new agreement between Prime Minister Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese aims to foster joint ventures, reducing reliance on China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the administration will set price floors for these industries, signaling further government support for domestic producers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cleveland-Cliffs shares jumped over 20% after CEO Lourenco Goncalves announced the steelmaker is investigating building a rare earths mining business. Geological surveys at two Michigan and Minnesota sites have indicated rare earth deposits, aligning with the Trump administration's strategy for critical mineral independence. China's dominance in the global rare earths supply chain and recent export controls have spurred the U.S. to bolster domestic production. Investors anticipate further government deals similar to the one with MP Materials, positioning Cleveland-Cliffs as a potential key player in reducing U.S. reliance on foreign rare earth imports.

Latinas in California currently earn only 49 cents for every dollar earned by white men, facing a lifetime wage loss exceeding $1 million.
