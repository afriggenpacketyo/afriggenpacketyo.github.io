          <p>A uranium enrichment facility in Eunice, New Mexico, operated by the European company Urenco, is significantly expanding its capacity to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This growth is driven by the electricity needs of AI data centers and a push for domestic manufacturing, alongside a U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports set for 2028. As the only commercial enrichment plant in the U.S., the facility is crucial to Washington's ambitious plans to triple or quadruple nuclear energy production by 2050. However, the expansion faces challenges, including bottlenecks in the nuclear fuel supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

A protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line views and regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which could strain relations with neighboring countries. Her victory over a more moderate opponent signals the party's desire to appeal to its conservative base following recent election losses. As prime minister, she will face immediate domestic and diplomatic challenges, including strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with an early-stage form of the disease after advocating for herself to receive screenings before the standard recommended age. Despite being told she was too young, she pursued a risk assessment that led to a mammogram and a subsequent MRI, which revealed two suspicious masses. Her case highlights the rising incidence of breast cancer in women under 50 and underscores the importance of being aware of personal risk factors. Doctors credit her self-advocacy with catching the cancer early, significantly improving her prognosis and treatment options.</p>

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who died at 91, adopted a plant-based diet over 50 years ago, a decision she said was pivotal to her health and activism. She famously recalled looking at a pork chop and realizing it represented "fear, pain, death," which prompted her immediate switch. Goodall cited ethical opposition to factory farming and the significant environmental damage caused by meat production as her primary motivations. She often spoke of feeling physically better after making the change and encouraged others to consider the planetary and health benefits of reducing meat consumption.</p>

          <p>A shift is occurring in American higher education as families increasingly question the high cost of prestigious universities, prioritizing practical outcomes like career placement and internship opportunities instead. With tuition costs soaring and the job market uncertain, the long-held belief that an elite brand name guarantees success is waning. This trend is reflected in surveys showing a decline in willingness to "stretch financially" for college, driven by parents concerned about their children's future financial stability. Consequently, schools that were once considered regional brands have risen in prominence by focusing on tangible benefits like co-op programs.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin rallied significantly on Friday, climbing to within 1% of its all-time record high as the U.S. government shutdown continued for a third day. The cryptocurrency rose approximately 12% this week, with investors reportedly treating it as a safe-haven asset amidst the political and economic uncertainty in Washington. Analysts suggest that unlike previous shutdowns, Bitcoin's current market position makes it more responsive to risks associated with U.S. government instability. Market observers predict that Bitcoin will soon surpass its previous peak and could continue to climb higher. (not investment advice)</p>
