          <p>Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman, has concluded his nearly 25-year tenure at the helm of Tottenham Hotspur. His leadership was defined by significant off-field success, most notably the construction of a new £1 billion stadium, but was also met with persistent fan protests over a lack of major trophies. The club's ownership reportedly determined that a change in leadership was essential to achieving greater success on the pitch, leading to Levy's departure after a summer of substantial investment in new players.</p>

          <p>The "$1,000 a month rule" serves as a practical guideline to help individuals in their retirement planning by illustrating how large of a nest egg is required to generate a specific monthly income. Rooted in the well-known 4% withdrawal rule, it posits that a saver needs approximately $240,000 to $300,000 to produce $1,000 in monthly income over a 30-year retirement period. This principle simplifies complex financial calculations into a more concrete and manageable goal, highlighting the critical importance of starting early to maximize the benefits of compound interest.

          <p>Jackson Denio, a 13-year-old from Hampton, New Hampshire, successfully caught a massive 177-pound Atlantic halibut during a deep-sea fishing excursion, a fish that outweighed him by nearly 60 pounds. The impressive catch took place approximately 100 miles off the New England coast in a biodiverse area known as Cashes Ledge. After a strenuous 30-minute battle, Denio managed to reel in the giant fish, which could potentially establish a new world record for his age group, earning praise from the boat's captain and fellow anglers.</p>

          <p>A new bill introduced by congressional Democrats, titled the "You Earn It, You Keep It Act," seeks to permanently abolish all federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. To compensate for the resulting revenue decrease and enhance the program's long-term solvency, the legislation would also extend the Social Security payroll tax to all annual earnings exceeding $250,000. This approach differs from the recently enacted Republican tax law, which offers a more limited, temporary deduction for seniors instead of a complete tax repeal. (not investment advice)</p>
