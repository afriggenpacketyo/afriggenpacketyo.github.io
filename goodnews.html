        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times reports on the potential repercussions of denying visas to Chinese students seeking STEM degrees in the United States. While border security and espionage prevention are crucial, the article suggests that blanket denials based solely on nationality could be counterproductive. Such policies may hinder American innovation and academic advancement by limiting access to talented individuals. The article emphasizes the need for a balanced approach that protects national interests without stifling academic exchange and collaboration. Optimism for this event is relatively high, as it is a matter of policy and not a matter of physical injury or death.</p>
