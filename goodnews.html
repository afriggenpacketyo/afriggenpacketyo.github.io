          <p>In an interview, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan stated that his bank's economists do not foresee a recession or interest rate hikes this year, though economic growth is slow. He attributed the slowdown to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's policies on trade, immigration, and regulation, which causes businesses to be cautious. Moynihan also discussed the impact of AI, noting that while it creates anxiety about future jobs, technology has historically led to more employment overall. He suggested that inflation will likely remain above the Fed's target until 2026 or 2027, prompting a cautious approach from the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains like Chipotle, Cava, and Wendy's are increasingly adding spicy menu items to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners, who show a strong preference for bold flavors. This strategy is seen as a low-cost, high-return way to generate buzz and drive sales amid a general pullback in consumer spending. Fueled by social media trends on platforms like TikTok, these limited-time offers and spicy collaborations are becoming a key marketing tool. While effective, the challenge for brands is the fleeting nature of these trends, as younger consumers quickly move on to new flavor profiles.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has announced it will restore references to Donald Trump's two impeachments in its National Museum for American History "in the coming weeks." The statement followed public concern after a placard detailing the impeachments was removed from an exhibit on presidential power limits. The museum denied any political pressure from the Trump administration, stating the temporary placard was removed because it did not meet the museum's presentation standards. The section also features materials related to the impeachments of Presidents Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, and the Watergate scandal.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix after a masterful defensive drive against his teammate, Oscar Piastri. Norris employed a bold one-stop strategy that put him in the lead but left him vulnerable to a late-race attack from Piastri, who was on fresher tires. Despite intense pressure in the final laps, Norris held his position to win, narrowing the championship points gap between the two drivers. George Russell of Mercedes finished third, overtaking Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who faded after starting the race from pole position.</p>

The terminal, which will be JFK's largest, is designed exclusively for international travelers and will feature light-filled spaces, with departures, security, and customs all on the same level. This project is part of a massive $19 billion overhaul of the entire airport, aimed at replacing aging infrastructure and accommodating growing air traffic. The new terminal will also have its own resilient microgrid, allowing it to maintain full operations during power disruptions.</p>

          <h2>China's Advanced Aircraft Carrier 'Fujian' Appears to Conduct First Catapult Launch Drill</h2>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult system, a key milestone before it enters service. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV showed a control room operator clearing a position for take-off, suggesting a successful drill. This marks a significant step for the Fujian, which is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, similar to that used by the U.S. Navy. The advanced system allows for the launch of heavier and more varied aircraft, greatly enhancing the capabilities of the People's Liberation Army Navy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report has identified the best U.S. cities for job opportunities and earning potential, with mid-sized metro areas like Raleigh, Nashville, and Austin topping the list. The study, conducted by HR technology company Checkr, ranked cities based on factors such as unemployment rates, labor force growth, and real per capita income. The findings suggest a shift in the "geography of opportunity," as these growing hubs in technology, healthcare, and finance offer strong job markets. They often boast a more affordable cost of living compared to traditional coastal megacities like New York and Los Angeles, which did not make the top 10. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Divorce Attorneys Offer Advice on Protecting Finances During a Marriage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To protect personal finances within a marriage, especially if it becomes unstable, divorce attorneys recommend two key strategies. The first is to maintain full awareness and access to all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities, ensuring transparency and preventing surprises later. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which, like a prenup, defines how assets would be divided in a divorce. This can be particularly useful if one spouse starts a business during the marriage. While discussing a postnup can be difficult, attorneys advise that avoiding such conversations can lead to greater conflict in the long run.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert in child development suggests that parents can more effectively handle tantrums by using specific calming and validating phrases instead of resorting to punishment. Phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" help a child feel safe and understood, which de-escalates their distress. The approach emphasizes connection over control, reassuring the child that their emotions are acceptable even if certain behaviors are not. By validating feelings and setting compassionate boundaries, parents can help their children regulate their nervous systems and build emotional resilience over time.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it is working "at pace" to implement a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to receive medical treatment in the UK. While the exact number is unclear, the plan could reportedly allow up to 300 children, each with a guardian, to enter the country for free medical care. This move follows criticism from a Foreign Affairs Committee report that the government had previously declined to support such an evacuation scheme. The initiative aims to provide specialized care unavailable in Gaza, where the healthcare system has been devastated by the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>NBA superstar Stephen Curry, one of the world's highest-paid athletes, recently revealed that he does not know his exact net worth and isn't focused on the number. Instead, he prioritizes creating a portfolio of investments and opportunities that he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day management to a professional team. Financial planners cited in the article view this as a healthy approach, suggesting that focusing on tangible goals and cash flow is often more productive than fixating on a net worth figure. They advise that financial health is better measured by how money aligns with personal values.</p>
