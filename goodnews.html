          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed employee concerns over increased in-office requirements and changes to sabbatical benefits, stating the changes are a risk the company decided to take to improve collaboration, innovation, and company culture. Khosrowshahi emphasized the need for Uber to be at its "A game" as a "Gen-AI powered company," prioritizing learning and impact over benefits. He denied that the policy changes were intended to drive attrition or layoffs, highlighting the company's strong financial performance. Uber's first-quarter financial results are due soon, with analysts closely watching to see how the changes have impacted the company's bottom line.</p>

          <p>Tesla's Shanghai factory experienced a significant drop in deliveries in April, signaling increasing challenges for the U.S. carmaker in China's competitive electric vehicle market. Deliveries of Model 3 and Model Y vehicles fell 25.8% from March and 6% year-over-year, as Chinese rivals introduce cheaper, tech-laden models that are attracting consumers. This decline follows a first-quarter slump in deliveries, marking the lowest level in three years. Analysts suggest Tesla's hopes for a sustained rebound in China are fading due to the aggressive pricing strategies and innovative models of its domestic competitors.</p>

They are actively preparing their populations for potential conflict, drawing on living memories of Soviet rule to foster resilience.

          <h2>Far-UVC Light Bulbs Could Be Key to Preventing Future Pandemics</h2>

          <p>Far-UVC light, a type of ultraviolet light safe for humans, shows promise in killing airborne pathogens and preventing the spread of respiratory diseases. New developments in solid-state lamps, particularly secondary harmonics, could significantly reduce the cost of far-UVC technology. Research suggests that far-UVC lamps, when used in moderation, can disinfect air without significantly increasing ozone or particulate pollution. Additional research is needed to fully understand the effects on air quality, but far-UVC could become a powerful tool in combating future pandemics.</p>

          <h2>Flying Without a Real ID: What to Expect at the Airport</h2>

          <p>The federal government has begun enforcing Real ID requirements for domestic air travel, meaning that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will no longer accept IDs that don't comply with Real ID standards. However, travelers without a Real ID can use other acceptable forms of identification, such as a U.S. passport or military ID. Those without acceptable ID will have to verify their identity, and should arrive at the airport at least three hours before a domestic flight. Enhanced IDs, issued by a few states, offer an acceptable alternative.</p>
