          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to ¬£1,000 each, and may have debts written off due to the scandal involving forced prepayment meter installations. Ofgem's review revealed that suppliers failed to meet required standards when switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. Energy companies will disburse over ¬£70 million in compensation and financial support, with payments varying based on the mistreatment experienced by customers. A new code of practice with stricter conditions is now in place to prevent future inappropriate installations, but enforcement investigations are continuing for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo. </p>

Discussions are expected to center on continued military assistance, particularly the Taurus missile system, which Germany developed with Sweden.

The report also suggests improvements to public health services, education, and fair access to medical cannabis.
