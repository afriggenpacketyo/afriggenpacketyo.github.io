          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 12:42:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has reportedly agreed to a deal with Bayern Munich for the transfer of Colombian forward Luis Diaz, valued at €75 million (£65.5 million) including add-ons. The 28-year-old was left out of a recent pre-season friendly due to the speculation and is expected to travel to Europe for a medical. Diaz joined Liverpool from Porto in 2022 and has been a significant contributor, scoring 41 goals in 148 appearances and playing a key role in the team's Premier League title win last season. The move comes as Liverpool has already signed new forwards and is reportedly interested in Newcastle's Alexander Isak.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is celebrating a successful weekend as two of its major films, "Superman" and "F1," each crossed the $500 million mark in worldwide ticket sales. The success of "Superman" is a significant victory for DC Studios, as it is the first major release under the new leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran. For Apple, which produced "F1," the film's box office performance, bolstered by a distribution deal with Warner Bros. and a partnership with IMAX, marks its most successful theatrical release to date. This achievement highlights a positive trend for both studios in the competitive film market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at his Turnberry resort in Scotland for crucial trade discussions. After a round of golf, Trump expressed expectations of striking the "biggest deal" ever, a sentiment echoed by von der Leyen. The meeting occurs as an August 1 deadline for potential new U.S. tariffs on EU goods looms, creating a tense backdrop for the negotiations. While senior EU officials have sounded positive about reaching a framework, failure could trigger a trade war, with Trump threatening 30% tariffs and the EU promising retaliation.

          <h2>Bipartisan Representatives Push for Legislation to Force Release of Jeffrey Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 12:28:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna have joined forces to demand the release of government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. In a joint television appearance, they promoted legislation that would legally compel the release of all documents from Epstein's estate and the Justice Department, with protections to redact victims' names. Massie argued for a broad release, including financial records, to "follow the money." The push for transparency comes amid political maneuvering, as House Speaker Mike Johnson adjourned for recess, avoiding a vote on their bill, which the representatives are now trying to advance via a discharge petition.</p>

          <p>Signaling a potential rebound for superhero films, Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" opened to an impressive $118 million in domestic ticket sales and $218 million globally. This strong debut follows the recent success of DC's "Superman," suggesting that audiences will turn out for well-made comic book movies. The film's success is a significant win for Marvel, which has seen inconsistent box office results and critical reception for its post-"Endgame" releases. With a high "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, "Fantastic Four" is seen as a sign that Marvel's strategic shift to focus on quality over quantity is proving effective.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured his sixth victory of the season at the Belgian Grand Prix, extending his championship lead after a skillful race in mixed wet and dry conditions. The McLaren driver overtook his teammate Lando Norris on the first racing lap following a lengthy rain delay and expertly managed his medium tires to finish without an additional pit stop. Norris, on a different hard-tire strategy, was unable to catch Piastri and finished second. The win puts Piastri 16 points clear in the championship, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc completing the podium in third place ahead of Max Verstappen.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that President Trump is open to a trade deal with the European Union if the bloc provides a "good enough" offer to open its markets to American exports. Speaking ahead of a firm August 1 deadline for new tariffs, Lutnick reiterated that the president sees a 50-50 chance of reaching an agreement. His comments suggest a potential path to avoid a trade war, but leave ambiguity about what specific concessions the U.S. would require. The EU has been weighing countermeasures, including its "Anti-Coercion Instrument," should the high-stakes negotiations fail and the threatened 30% tariffs be imposed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sources from both Beijing and Washington indicate that the U.S. and China are expected to extend their current tariff truce for another 90 days during trade talks in Stockholm. The current 90-day suspension of most tariffs, agreed upon in May, is set to expire on August 12. While the extension will prevent an immediate escalation of the trade war, insiders do not anticipate major breakthroughs on specific issues like China's industrial overcapacity. The Chinese delegation is also expected to press the U.S. on tariffs related to fentanyl, seeking clarity on what would be required for them to be eased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new savings vehicle, dubbed the 'Trump IRA,' was established in a recent bill to encourage saving for children under 18, allowing for annual contributions of up to $5,000. The plan includes a one-time $1,000 government contribution for children born between 2025 and 2028. However, this financial analysis suggests that while the free $1,000 is worth taking, other established options like 529 education accounts, custodial Roth IRAs, and whole life insurance policies offer more significant long-term benefits. These alternatives provide greater tax advantages, flexibility for educational expenses, or guaranteed future insurability and cash value growth for the child. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While more free time is an obvious benefit, a key reason the four-day workweek boosts employee happiness is that it makes them feel more effective at their jobs. Research led by sociologist Juliet Schor on hundreds of companies piloting a 32-hour week found that workers reported being more productive than ever. To fit their work into less time, teams streamlined processes and eliminated busywork, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment and control. This feeling of being on top of their work, combined with being more rested, significantly improved overall well-being and job satisfaction beyond the simple benefit of an extra day off.</p>
