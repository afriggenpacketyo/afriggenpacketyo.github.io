          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships have opted against legal marriage due to the country's surname law, which requires married couples to adopt the same last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, an NGO advocating for separate surnames, found that this rate is higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% expressing a willingness to marry if separate surnames were permitted. The Justice Ministry notes that Japan is the only country, to its knowledge, that mandates couples to share a surname upon marriage, highlighting the law's significant impact on marital decisions.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth with a net increase of nearly 12,000 coffee shops in the past year, driven by aggressive expansion and price competition. This growth is fueled by a push to promote domestic beans, with President Xi Jinping endorsing coffee from Yunnan province. Starbucks, once dominant in China, has seen its market share decline, while domestic and international chains focus on expanding in second-tier and "new first-tier" cities.
