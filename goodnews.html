          <p>Voters in South Texas overwhelmingly approved the incorporation of Starbase, the location of Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility, as an official city. The vote, which saw 212 in favor and 6 against, formalizes the area as a city, fulfilling Musk's ambition to create a company town. While SpaceX officials have cited the need for community growth and streamlined launch operations, critics worry about Musk's expanded control, including potential authority to close a local beach and state park.

          <p>A recent survey in Japan revealed that nearly 30% of people in common-law relationships chose not to legally marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, found that the rate was higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% of that group stating they would switch to legal marriage if separate surnames were allowed. The Justice Ministry says Japan is the only country that mandates couples to adopt the same surname upon marriage.</p>
