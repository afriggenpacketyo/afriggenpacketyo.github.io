          <p>One year after a near-fatal assassination attempt on former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has significantly enhanced its security protocols. The agency is now deploying military-grade drones and mobile command posts to improve aerial surveillance and ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement, addressing key failures from the 2024 incident. Following an internal investigation that resulted in the suspension of six personnel, officials express confidence that these technological and procedural upgrades will prevent a repeat of the security lapses.</p>

          <p>A TUI flight from Cancun, Mexico, to London was forced to make an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine, after a fight broke out between two passengers. The diversion required all 267 passengers to spend the night in Maine, as the flight crew had timed out. U.S. Customs and Border Protection removed the two individuals involved, who faced no criminal charges but were sent back to their home countries on separate flights. The flight, a 787 Dreamliner, eventually continued its journey and landed safely at London's Gatwick Airport with a relief crew.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit accuses the social media platform of intentionally using manipulative and addictive design features to target and exploit young users for commercial gain. The state's attorney general hailed the decision as a key step toward holding TikTok accountable for practices that put children at risk. TikTok has refuted the claims, stating they are outdated and that the platform has robust safety protections and parental controls in place.</p>

          <p>In a significant move amid the escalating AI talent war, Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff. While not a full acquisition of the company, the deal includes a nonexclusive license for Google to use certain Windsurf technology. The agreement underscores the intense competition for top AI expertise, following similar talent acquisitions by Microsoft and Meta. Windsurf, which had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI, will continue to operate under new interim leadership while its top minds join Google DeepMind.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of next-generation air combat capabilities by testing the integration of crewed fighter jets with uncrewed "loyal wingman" drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15E each successfully controlled two XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, a key step in advancing semi-autonomous systems. This test is part of a broader strategic race with China to achieve air dominance through human-machine teaming. The Valkyrie drone, first flown in 2019, is central to the Air Force's concept of using uncrewed aircraft to augment and support crewed fighters in combat scenarios.</p>
