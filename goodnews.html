        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a recent slump, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to strengthen their roster before the trade deadline, with a focus on improving their outfield defense. While their offense has struggled, the potential return of key pitchers suggests run prevention will be crucial for a deep playoff run. Minnesota Twins outfielder Harrison Bader, known for his premium defensive skills and having a solid offensive season, has emerged as a strong potential target. The move would address defensive weaknesses, particularly in left and right field, which have been a persistent issue for the team.</p>

          <p>Deion "Coach Prime" Sanders, head football coach for the Colorado Buffaloes, has publicly revealed his recent battle with bladder cancer. At a press conference with his medical team, it was announced that he underwent surgery to remove his bladder after a diagnosis of high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. His doctors confirmed the tumor was removed and that he is now considered cancer-free, with a very good outlook. Sanders, who became emotional during the announcement, confirmed he will continue coaching and urged others, particularly African-American men, to get regular health checkups.</p>

The family has a relative who is a British citizen and was granted permission to come to the UK in January, but they have been unable to leave Gaza to complete the process. The government's policy is to only assist in exceptional cases, but the judge found this situation to be legally exceptional.</p>
