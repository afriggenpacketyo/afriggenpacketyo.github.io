          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 17:22:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a stringent new law that bans smoking in most public outdoor areas, such as parks, beaches, and the vicinity of schools, in an effort to "denormalize" the habit. Those who violate the ban face substantial fines of up to ‚Ç¨700, though an initial grace period is anticipated. Despite long-standing bans in restaurants and bars, over 30% of French adults still smoke, and the government hopes these new measures will curb its popularity, especially among young people. Caf√© terraces remain a notable exception to the widespread ban.</p>

          <p>The collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO), with plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "FIG."

          <p>The announcement by Republican Senator Thom Tillis that he will not seek reelection in 2026 has ignited what is expected to be a fiercely contested Senate race in North Carolina. On the Republican side, President Trump has endorsed his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as a potential candidate. For the Democrats, there is strong hope that popular former Governor Roy Cooper will enter the race. The open seat presents a significant opportunity for Democrats to make gains, making it a critical battleground for control of the Senate.</p>

While the removal of the tax was a relief for the industry, trade associations noted that the overall bill remains detrimental to renewable energy, as it still includes provisions to phase out crucial investment and production tax credits.
