          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 11:09:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to challenge a $5 million judgment awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll. The jury initially found Trump liable for battery and defamation in 2023, stemming from an incident in the 1990s. Trump sought a rehearing before the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit after a three-judge panel declined to overturn the original judgment, but the court denied his request without explanation. Carroll's attorney stated that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation, despite his continued legal maneuvers. Optimism around this article is relatively high because justice was upheld in the courts, however the optimism is tempered by the fact that this article references sexual assault. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several major online platforms, including Google, OpenAI, Spotify, and Amazon Web Services, experienced a widespread outage affecting tens of thousands of users. The outage was attributed to a service disruption within Google Cloud, impacting services relying on the platform. Cloudflare, which provides services to many affected companies, reported intermittent failures while investigating the issue, with services gradually recovering by late afternoon. Users reported issues with login, playback, and support sites on platforms like Spotify, while OpenAI stated that all impacted services had been recovered by 4:26 p.m. EST. The quick recovery of services from major tech companies in the wake of an accident is generally regarded as a positive sign of stability.</p>

          <p>A significant expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) has been included in the Senate's version of the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' championed by Senator Josh Hawley. This expansion would allow individuals in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as 'downwinders,' to receive compensation for exposure to nuclear waste. The proposal also includes claims for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers from 1971-1990 to the list of those eligible for benefits. The Senate must navigate procedural rules and the Senate GOP conference to ensure the provisions remain in the final bill.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment has rebounded significantly in early June, exceeding expectations as concerns over tariffs and inflation eased. The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers showed improvements across the board, with respondents also lowering their outlook for near-term inflation. The rebound coincides with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs, with consumers appearing to have adjusted to the initial shock. While sentiment remains below year-ago levels, the easing of inflation expectations suggests a more positive economic outlook (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is reportedly nearing a return to Saracens after a season with French side Racing 92. While a deal is not yet finalized, there is an expectation that an agreement will be reached to allow Farrell to move this summer. Farrell previously spent 16 seasons with Saracens, winning multiple Premiership titles and European Cups, and his return would provide cover for the injured Alex Lozowski. A transition into coaching at Saracens appears inevitable for Farrell, following in the footsteps of his father Andy.</p>

The judge also blocked a provision aimed at barring states from counting mail ballots postmarked by Election Day but received after. The ruling emphasized that states, not the president, have the power to set election rules, and that the order appears contrary to Congress's intent to remove procedural roadblocks for overseas voters. The article is generally optimistic because the courts are acting as a check on executive power.</p>
