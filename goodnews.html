          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to pardon reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud. The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 of conspiring to defraud Atlanta-area community banks to obtain over $36 million in personal loans and defrauding the IRS. Todd Chrisley received a 12-year prison sentence, while Julie Chrisley was sentenced to seven years, and Trump expressed hope the pardon would be completed quickly. A White House spokesman stated that the President is pleased to give deserving Americans a second chance, especially those unfairly targeted by the justice system.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit his MLB-leading 20th home run of the season, marking his third consecutive game with a home run, as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Cleveland Guardians 9-5.

Despite Daniel Schneemann's three-run home run bringing the Guardians closer, the Dodgers extended their lead with runs in the sixth and eighth innings, and Max Muncy added a three-run homer in the ninth. Ohtani finished the game with one hit, two RBIs, two walks, and two strikeouts.</p>

          <p>Asian shares continued their rally from Wall Street, and the U.S. dollar gained on Wednesday, fueled by promising economic signs in the United States and anticipation of strong tech earnings. Markets reacted positively to easing trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe, while global bond markets stabilized after a surge in long-term yields, and U.S. consumer confidence exceeded expectations. Nvidia's stock jumped more than 4% ahead of its earnings report, which is expected to show a surge in first-quarter revenue. Oil prices also rose due to new restrictions on Chevron's exports from Venezuela, potentially tightening supply.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have addressed a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, potentially improving the comfort of ultra-high-speed ground travel. A study published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering revealed that even minor imperfections in the track can cause violent vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000 km/h. However, the engineers, working on a full-scale test line in China, also found a way to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride more tolerable. The team used supercomputer simulations and prototype tests to identify and mitigate the vibrations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard University have fostered a sense of unity on campus, bringing together individuals who were previously divided over issues like the war in Gaza and free speech. The Department of Homeland Security barred Harvard from enrolling international students, and the government froze over $3 billion in grants and contracts. In response, the Harvard community has set aside differences, viewing the attacks as an existential threat to the university, and students and faculty members have rallied in support of Harvard‚Äôs international students.</p>

          <p>A judge struck down President Trump's executive order targeting WilmerHale, marking another legal victory for law firms resisting the administration's pressure. Judge Richard J. Leon ruled the order unconstitutional, stating that Trump intended to impose severe sanctions to force the firm to the bargaining table. Despite the temporary block on the order, the firm had already suffered as clients curtailed relationships, and the judge emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and bar. This ruling follows similar rejections of executive orders aimed at other firms, highlighting judicial resistance to what is perceived as an effort to subjugate top law firms.</p>

          <p>The proposed Fire Act aims to create a pipeline for employment for former inmate firefighters, offering job training, workplace opportunities, and mentoring, and it could also expunge criminal records for those who complete probation. Introduced by California Democratic Reps.

The legislation seeks to provide hope and opportunities to incarcerated firefighters who risk their lives to combat wildfires, often at low wages.</p>
