          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement, paving the way for US colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a major shift in college sports history.

This ruling will significantly impact college athletics, professionalizing the recruitment of stars and potentially affecting smaller programs.
