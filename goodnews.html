          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was recaptured on Friday after escaping from an Arkansas prison nearly two weeks prior. Hardin, who was serving decades-long sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped from the Calico Rock prison by disguising himself in an outfit resembling a law enforcement uniform. He was apprehended near Moccasin Creek, approximately 1.5 miles west of the prison's North Central Unit, thanks to tracking dogs. Authorities confirmed his identity through fingerprint analysis, assuring the public that there is no longer an active threat to safety. The optimism score reflects the relief and stability brought about by the capture of a dangerous escapee.</p>

Trump expressed confidence in the DOJ's case against Abrego Garcia, who is now indicted on human smuggling and conspiracy charges. According to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Garcia played a significant role in a human smuggling ring, transporting women, children, and MS-13 gang-affiliated individuals throughout the United States. Democrats had previously advocated for Abrego Garcia's return, but Senator Chris Van Hollen stated the return was about due process rights.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi said El Salvador agreed to release Mr √Åbrego Garc√≠a after the US presented it with an arrest warrant. His lawyer has called the charges "preposterous".</p>
