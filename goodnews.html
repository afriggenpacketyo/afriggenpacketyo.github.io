          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber made baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves. He became only the 21st player to achieve this feat and had an opportunity to be the first ever to hit a fifth, but popped out in his final at-bat. The article notes that this final out averted potential controversy, as it came against a position player, Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the blowout game. Hitting a historic fifth home run off a non-pitcher lobbing slow pitches would have likely drawn criticism and questions about the record's legitimacy amid the growing debate over position players pitching.</p>

          <p>Yoga has evolved from an ancient wellness practice into a significant tool for India's global soft power and cultural diplomacy. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga has successfully projected the practice as a symbol of Indian cultural identity worldwide. Experts note that yoga's non-controversial and universal appeal allows India to build influence quietly, fostering people-to-people connections that are often stronger than state-level ties. However, the article also addresses criticisms regarding the practice's over-commercialization in the West and concerns that its association with political agendas in India could undermine its spiritual essence and universal character.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly looking to sign two new central defenders before the transfer window closes, a move that could pave the way for defender Marc Guehi's transfer to Liverpool. The Premier League champions have been in talks for a £35 million deal for the England international, but Palace manager Oliver Glasner has publicly stated Guehi must remain. Despite this, there is encouragement that Palace is preparing for his departure by actively seeking replacements, including Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and Manchester City's Manuel Akanji. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, making a sale likely to prevent him from leaving on a free transfer next summer.</p>

          <p>Alibaba reported stronger-than-expected net income for the June quarter, largely due to a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division fueled by high demand for AI products. The company's core e-commerce business also showed signs of revival, although overall revenues fell slightly short of analyst forecasts. Despite the positive results, profits would have declined without gains from equity investments, as the company continues to invest heavily in the competitive instant commerce market in China. Investors responded positively, with Alibaba's stock climbing 10%, reflecting confidence in the company's strategic focus on artificial intelligence and cloud services as key growth drivers.

          <p>German striker Nick Woltemade has completed a high-profile transfer from Stuttgart to Newcastle United for a reported record fee of €85 million. The 23-year-old, nicknamed the "two-meter Messi-Musiala" for his combination of size and skill, has seen his stock rise dramatically after a successful season in the Bundesliga and a strong performance in the U21 European Championship. The move is a notable miss for Bayern Munich, which had two bids for the player rejected. Woltemade's transfer is part of a larger trend of top Bundesliga talent moving to the Premier League, and it is hoped the move will secure his development and place in Germany's World Cup squad.</p>
