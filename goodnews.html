        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Three Gorges Corporation has activated a pioneering thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, featuring a world-first dual-tower system that concentrates sunlight from nearly 27,000 mirrors onto a single turbine. This innovative design significantly enhances efficiency by 25% compared to single-tower models, enabling continuous power generation through stored molten salt heat, even after sunset or on cloudy days. By strategically overlapping mirror fields, the plant also achieves key cost savings in construction. This advancement underscores China's commitment to leveraging high-tech solutions for sustainable and stable energy production.</p>

BVNK's platform streamlines global transactions using stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to fiat currency and backed by real-world assets. The company is experiencing rapid growth, especially in the U.S., attributed to a more favorable regulatory landscape following the GENIUS Act. This investment positions Citi to enhance its cross-border payment services and explores issuing its own stablecoin, indicating a broader industry shift towards tokenization and blockchain technology for financial efficiency.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a first-phase peace deal between Israel and Hamas, aiming to conclude the two-year conflict in Gaza. The agreement, facilitated by U.S., Egyptian, Qatari, and Turkish mediators, stipulates the release of all hostages by Hamas and a withdrawal of Israeli troops to a designated line. While the deal brings immediate relief, critical issues such as Hamas's disarmament and the long-term governance of Gaza are yet to be resolved in subsequent phases. The Israeli government is scheduled to vote on the agreement, with hostage releases anticipated to commence within 72 hours of its formal approval and troop redeployment.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a significant first phase of a Gaza peace plan, brokering an agreement between Israel and Hamas for the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. This article suggests that while the deal addresses the immediate hostage crisis and could halt active hostilities, it doesn't resolve deeper, contentious issues such as Hamas's disarmament or Gaza's long-term governance. Trump is reportedly banking on his personal influence and the parties' war fatigue to build momentum towards a more comprehensive peace. His intention to visit Israel and address the Knesset aims to solidify the agreement and personally bind the involved governments to its terms.</p>
