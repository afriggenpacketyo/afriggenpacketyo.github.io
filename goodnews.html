          <p>The U.S. and South Korea have reached a trade deal, setting a blanket tariff of 15% on South Korean exports, a reduction from the threatened 25%. The agreement includes a $350 billion investment from South Korea into U.S.-controlled industries, though the two nations appear to have different interpretations of how the funds will be managed. While Seoul successfully protected its sensitive agricultural markets, the deal negates some benefits of the existing U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement by imposing new tariffs. South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung expressed hope that the deal would strengthen the alliance between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she decided her public service would not be in elected office for now, keeping the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run. A source close to Harris indicated that while she seriously considered leading her home state, her heart wasn't in it, and she believes she can have a greater impact on the national stage. Harris plans to remain engaged in public life by campaigning for Democrats, potentially writing a book, and launching a nonprofit.</p>

          <p>The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) has established a $1.3 million legal defense fund to support Christians and churches in Europe facing legal action over their biblical beliefs. Franklin Graham stated the fund was created after BGEA successfully won several legal battles in the U.K. when its events were canceled over activist pressure. Cissie Graham Lynch, granddaughter of Billy Graham, is also advocating for believers not to remain silent amid what she describes as growing hostility. The fund, seeded with money from court settlements and a contribution from Samaritan's Purse, aims to combat the "silencing of Christians" in Europe and the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies acquired elite closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins as part of a flurry of activity ahead of the MLB trade deadline. In exchange for the hard-throwing right-hander, the Phillies sent two top prospects to the Twins. In other significant moves, the New York Mets bolstered their bullpen by acquiring relievers Tyler Rogers and Ryan Helsley in separate deals, while the Cincinnati Reds traded for Gold Glove third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates. The trades signal an active market for contenders seeking to strengthen their rosters for the final stretch of the season.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to expand Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's own owners. The Arora Group's plan features a shorter third runway, which it claims would avoid the costly and disruptive process of rerouting the M25 motorway. The company argues its "Heathrow West" proposal offers reduced risk and would prevent spiraling costs, estimating a price tag under £25 billion. This development introduces competition into the long-debated expansion project for the first time, with the government now set to review both proposals.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning due to cramping, alleviating initial fears of a more serious injury. On a hot and humid night, Ohtani appeared uncomfortable on the mound before being removed, though he remained in the game as the designated hitter. He had allowed two runs over three-plus innings before his exit. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 5-2, capping a disappointing month for the team, but the relatively minor nature of Ohtani's issue was a significant relief for the organization.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The rate remains between 4.25% and 4.5%, though in a rare move, two board members dissented, signaling broadening support for a future reduction. The decision comes as economic data shows a rebound in GDP growth, largely driven by a drop in imports due to Trump's tariffs, which analysts believe masks an underlying loss of momentum. Fed Chair Jerome Powell maintained a cautious stance, stating there is a long way to go before the full impact of tariffs becomes clear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Using the recent 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast as an example, this article explains the science of tsunamis. These powerful waves are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that cause vertical movement of the seafloor, displacing massive volumes of water. Tsunamis travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean but slow down and increase dramatically in height as they approach shallower coastal waters, which is when they become most dangerous. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use a network of tide gauges and deep-ocean pressure sensors to better predict a tsunami's arrival time and potential impact, urging people to always heed official warnings.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed abundant communities of life at depths of over 9 kilometers in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led team captured images of what they describe as "thriving communities" of tube worms, clams, and bacteria, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest that such chemosynthetic communities may be widespread in the planet's deepest regions, opening new avenues for studying adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains is being challenged by a group of scientists who argue that concrete evidence is lacking. Professor Pete Etchells points out that much of the research relies on flawed self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen use. While some studies link screen time to depression, others suggest loneliness is the primary factor and that online interaction can even boost well-being. The debate divides the scientific community, leaving parents with inconsistent guidance and raising questions about whether limiting technology access creates a disadvantage for children in a digital world.</p>

          <p>Advanced imaging technology has revealed the sophisticated details of tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female mummy from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The high-resolution scans show intricate designs of leopards, a stag, and mythical creatures that researchers say would be challenging for a modern tattooist to replicate. Found preserved in an ice tomb, the woman's tattoos shed light on the ancient nomadic warrior culture. By collaborating with a researcher who recreates ancient tattoos, the team concluded the designs were likely stenciled before being applied with multi-pointed tools, demonstrating the remarkable artistry and skill of these ancient people.</p>

          <p>Entering his ninth NFL season, 30-year-old cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon has become the most experienced player in the Los Angeles Rams' secondary. After being re-signed to a one-year deal, Witherspoon is embracing his role as a veteran leader for a young defensive group, with defensive coordinator Chris Shula calling him the "Yoda" of the position. The Rams have shown confidence in their secondary by not adding any new cornerbacks or safeties in the offseason. Witherspoon believes this continuity, combined with an aggressive defensive front, will allow the secondary to play to its strengths and be special this season.</p>
