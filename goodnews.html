          <p>George the cat escaped from an animal hospital in Lakeland, Florida, after being neutered, traveling three miles back to his owner's home. SPCA Florida employees attempted to catch George, but he scaled a fence and disappeared into the woods. According to a cat behavioral specialist, cats have evolved to find their way back home using a combination of scent, visual markers, and possibly geomagnetism. George's owner expressed relief and emphasized the importance of human touch for the beloved feline, saying that George needed a human touch and that's what he got.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs on increased prices, suggesting the company should absorb the costs instead. Walmart had warned of potential price hikes on various products due to tariffs, despite recent reductions. Trump argued that Walmart, having made billions, should sacrifice profits to support his economic agenda, which he claims will create more domestic manufacturing jobs. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company would strive to maintain low prices despite retail margin challenges. This confrontation highlights the tension between Trump's trade policies and major American corporations.</p>

Local police and military weapons experts determined that the grenade was not active. Police issued a reminder to parents and guardians to check what their children are bringing to school, especially family heirlooms.</p>

          <p>Journalism, ridden by Umberto Rispoli, won the 150th Preakness Stakes after a strong finish, overcoming contact and adversity down the stretch.

          <p>Public perception of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who murdered their parents, has shifted, potentially influencing their chances of parole. Initially portrayed as greedy killers, the brothers' claims of parental sexual abuse are now met with more sympathy, thanks to increased understanding of trauma and attention from pop culture and criminal justice advocates like Kim Kardashian. A Los Angeles judge reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, with a hearing scheduled for next month. Their fate rests with the Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom, who must consider the changing public opinion.</p>
