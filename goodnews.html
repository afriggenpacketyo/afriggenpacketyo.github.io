          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed its 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which for the first time strongly encourages inviting Taiwan's navy to the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) military drills. This move is interpreted as a significant signal of Washington's commitment to deterring Beijing's military ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region. The bipartisan bill also authorizes $1 billion for the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative, expanding its scope to include combat casualty care and medical equipment, reinforcing U.S. support for the island's defense capabilities.</p>

The continent is experiencing a "three-speed" recovery, with political uncertainty in France rattling markets and potentially slowing growth, while Germany is on a firmer footing with forecasts for outperformance in 2026. This economic and political fragmentation presents homegrown challenges for the bloc at a time when external pressures demand unity and a cohesive strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

Burgess makes a notable return to the national team after a decade-long absence, and Litten earns his second cap. However, the squad omits Super League's Man of Steel winner, Jake Connor, due to intense competition for positions in the halves. The selection also includes six players from Australia's NRL, reflecting the depth of talent available to head coach Shaun Wane.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Suggests Chinese Stocks Resilient to Trump's Tariff Threats</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Chen Li, an economist at Soochow Securities, the ongoing global bull market is fundamentally supported by a weakening U.S. dollar, which should help Chinese stocks remain on course despite recent tariff threats from President Trump. While market jitters persist due to concerns over U.S. fiscal policy and global economic outlooks, Chen argues that investors have become largely "immune" to the prospect of higher duties. He suggests that while trade tensions can trigger market corrections, they are unlikely to have a major long-term impact on the market's overall trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan for Gaza has been completed, with Hamas releasing all 20 of its remaining living hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The agreement, which also involves the return of deceased hostages' remains, now moves into a more complex negotiation phase. Key elements of the broader plan include the complete demilitarization of Gaza, governance by a transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats, and an eventual handover to a reformed Palestinian Authority, though significant sticking points like Hamas's disarmament remain.</p>

          <p>U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has publicly praised the "tireless efforts" of the UK's National Security Adviser, Jonathan Powell, in achieving the Gaza ceasefire agreement. This acknowledgment highlights the UK's significant behind-the-scenes diplomatic role, contrasting with earlier dismissive comments from the U.S. ambassador in Israel. The specific praise for Powell, who has extensive experience from negotiating the Good Friday Agreement, is seen as a boost for him amid domestic political pressure and underscores the close coordination between the U.S. and UK on the issue.</p>

The plan targets four key sectors: defense and aerospace, frontier technologies like AI, energy technology, and advanced manufacturing and supply chains.

          <p>The National League Championship Series matchup between the Milwaukee Brewers and the Los Angeles Dodgers is being framed as a David-versus-Goliath battle. Brewers manager Pat Murphy has leaned into this narrative, highlighting the Dodgers' "star power" and payroll, which is three times that of his own team from baseball's smallest market. Despite this, the Brewers earned home-field advantage by finishing the regular season with a better record, including sweeping the season series against the Dodgers. The series pits the defending champions against a team that has consistently proven itself to be a formidable contender.</p>

          <p>The recent suspension and subsequent return of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, following pressure from the FCC over comments about Trump supporters, has unexpectedly demonstrated the continued relevance of late-night television. The initial decision to sideline Kimmel sparked a significant public backlash, with artists, celebrities, and civil liberties groups protesting what was seen as government censorship. The strong viewer support and high ratings for his return episode suggest that, despite declining overall viewership, late-night hosts still hold a unique and influential space in pop culture and political discourse.</p>

Director Derek Cianfrance reveals he pitched the movie as a modern Frank Capra film, focusing on themes of community, acceptance, and the dreams of working-class people. To achieve authenticity, Cianfrance created an immersive set where actors were encouraged to live their roles, such as having Peter Dinklage, as the store manager, actually interview Dunst for her character's job. The approach aimed to capture unscripted, genuine moments that would become immortalized on screen.</p>
