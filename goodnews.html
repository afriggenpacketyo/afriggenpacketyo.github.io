          <h2>Japanese Volleyball Stars Advocate for Players' Union to Enhance SV.League</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 06:14:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese volleyball players in the SV.League, including national team star Yuji Nishida, are calling for the formation of a players' union to address issues such as the crowded match schedule and promote the league's goal of becoming a global benchmark. Nishida highlighted concerns about the uneven distribution of matches against different opponents and the lack of promotion opportunities for second-division teams. Teammate Thomas Jaeschke also pointed out that the current schedule of back-to-back weekend matches is physically demanding and unsustainable for players, suggesting adjustments similar to European leagues. The league believes the current schedule is ideal for fans to attend matches and reduces costs, enabling match organizers to set up and clear a venue once per weekend.</p>

          <p>The House is expected to vote on a bill introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," codifying an executive order signed by President Trump. The bill faces opposition from some Republicans, who consider the effort juvenile and a waste of taxpayer dollars. Democrats have also criticized the bill, arguing that Congress should focus on more pressing issues. Even if the name change is codified into U.S. law, other countries would not be obligated to adopt the new name.</p>

The author writes, ‚ÄúToday, amid a backlash against affirmative action, so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and other measures designed to rectify past racial injustice, Malcolm‚Äôs calls for Black self-reliance have never seemed more urgent.</p>
