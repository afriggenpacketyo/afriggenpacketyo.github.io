          <p>Hunan province in China has pioneered the use of special-purpose bonds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, allocating 20 billion yuan for this purpose this year. This adjustment to the annual fiscal budget marks the first instance of these bonds, typically designated for revenue-generating construction projects, being used to cover government arrears. Proceeds will be distributed based on eligible outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing cities and counties to complete construction, clear obligations, and reduce fiscal risk. While seen as a positive step, concerns remain about the adequacy of the sum relative to local government debt and the complexity of repayment due to entangled triangular debts.

          <p>The race to deploy driverless taxis is intensifying, with Waymo, Zoox, and Tesla vying for dominance. Waymo is expanding its service areas in Los Angeles and San Francisco, while Zoox opened a new production facility with the capacity to build 10,000 robotaxis per year. Elon Musk has begun testing driverless Teslas in Austin, Texas. The expansion of robotaxi services depends on safe testing and successful operation, with potential societal impacts comparable to the internet and smartphones.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from tying states' transportation funds to cooperation with immigration enforcement. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by 20 Democratic-led states, which argued the administration was unlawfully coercing them into adhering to Trump's immigration agenda. The judge agreed that the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose such conditions. This decision is a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to pressure sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>
