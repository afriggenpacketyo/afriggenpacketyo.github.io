          <p>Trentham Monkey Forest in Staffordshire has announced the birth of three endangered Barbary macaque monkeys. With fewer than 8,000 of these animals remaining in the wild, the staff at the sanctuary are thrilled with the new arrivals. The baby macaques, born high up in the trees, are being closely watched by their mothers and other group members as they learn the Barbary macaque way of life. The Monkey Forest is now entering its 'baby season' and expects to welcome several more births this year, as they work with organizations to protect the wild Barbary macaques in Morocco and Algeria.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into multibillion-dollar licensing agreements with multinational pharmaceutical companies to develop innovative medicines. These deals often utilize a newco structure, combining traditional intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle. This trend is driven by depressed valuations in the stock market, making licensing intellectual property an attractive alternative to selling shares. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential licensing deals worth up to US$5 billion for its drug candidates, highlighting the growing interest in Chinese biotech innovation.

          <p>China has agreed to initiate steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The agreement, reached after technical talks, involves issuing a public notice to ease the ban and opening registration for Japanese processing facilities. Japan will continue to push for the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from ten prefectures imposed after the 2011 nuclear disaster. This development marks a potential easing of tensions between the two countries, although full resumption may take months due to registration and radiation checks.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions by the agency. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signifies a symbolic end to an aggressive period of crypto crackdowns in the U.S., especially as the Trump administration seeks to position itself as an ally to the crypto industry. Binance is also taking a $2 billion investment from the Emirati state fund MGX entirely in USD1, a stablecoin newly launched by the World Liberty team.</p>

Defense Minister Gen Nakatani emphasized that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters. Japan will decide on equipment purchases based on its defense needs, not as a bargaining chip in trade discussions. This stance contrasts with earlier suggestions that defense purchases could help reduce the trade deficit.</p>
