          <p>This article discusses the importance of saving money and using savings accounts to build a financial safety net. The national average savings account interest rate is currently 0.42%, but high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher rates, ranging from 4.10% to 4.40%. The article advises readers to choose high-yield savings accounts, especially those offered by online banks, and to compare different accounts to find the best rates and terms. The article emphasizes the benefits of online banks, which often have lower overhead costs and can offer better interest rates and lower fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 09:09:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a policy reversal regarding the winter fuel payment, stating that more people will be eligible this year. The previous policy, which limited the payment to those receiving pension credit, was widely criticized for excluding millions of pensioners. While details of the changes and eligibility criteria remain unclear, the government intends to widen the threshold. This decision comes after Labour's poor local election results were partly attributed to the unpopular policy. The government plans to provide further clarity on the expanded payments soon, but a full announcement is expected later in the year.</p>
