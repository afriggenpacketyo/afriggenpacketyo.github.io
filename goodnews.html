          <p>China's exports saw a significant 5.8% year-on-year increase in June, surpassing market expectations as businesses took advantage of a temporary tariff truce with the United States. Imports also unexpectedly rose by 1.1%, contributing to a monthly trade surplus of nearly $114.8 billion. Despite ongoing trade tensions and a broader contraction in imports during the first half of the year, this robust export performance highlights a moment of resilience for the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol of women's rights in France, has been awarded the country's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony in the trial against her ex-husband, who drugged and sexually assaulted her and invited dozens of other men to do the same over a decade. Her case shocked the nation and was instrumental in advancing reforms to France's legal definition of sexual assault to include the lack of consent.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the first quarter. The growth, led by a strong manufacturing sector, beat economists' expectations, with a year-over-year expansion of 4.3%. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies, for the remainder of the year.

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels selected UC Santa Barbara pitcher Tyler Bremner with the second overall pick in the MLB draft, a choice that aligns with their strategy of drafting college players who can be fast-tracked to the majors. The selection is particularly poignant for Bremner, who recently lost his mother to cancer and said he pitched with increased strength while she was ill. The Angels' scouting director praised Bremner's powerful changeup and the resilience he demonstrated by performing at a high level during a difficult personal time.</p>
