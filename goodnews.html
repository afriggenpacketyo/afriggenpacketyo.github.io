          <p>This New York Times article explores the bond between French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, emphasizing the mutual respect, trust, and personal regard that has developed between the two leaders. The article highlights key moments in their relationship, including Macron's early support for Zelensky's campaign and his visit to Kyiv after the Russian invasion. While there were periods of frustration over the pace of French weapons deliveries, the relationship has strengthened as Macron has become a key advocate for Ukraine's interests, even floating the idea of European troops in Ukraine. Since Mr. Trump‚Äôs return to power in Washington, Mr. Macron has proved to be an important conduit and translator between the American president and Mr. Zelensky.</p>

          <p>Hainan, a tropical island off China's southern coast, is positioning itself as a major shopping destination amidst the intensifying trade war with the United States. With its duty-free policies, Hainan is set to launch its own separate customs regime, avoiding the 125 percent retaliatory tariff Beijing has imposed on American imports. Local shops hope that offering cheaper iPhones and US cosmetics will drive a surge in visitors to the island‚Äôs duty-free stores, which have struggled amid sluggish domestic consumption and a recovery in overseas tourism.</p>

          <p>President Trump agreed to lift 25 percent tariffs on steel from Britain, providing relief to the struggling British steel industry. The tariffs, implemented in March, had added costs and complexities to an industry already facing weak demand, foreign competition, and high energy costs. Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield, a major steel exporter to the US, welcomed the news, but uncertainties remain regarding products processed in the EU and the long-term stability of trade relations. The article notes that British steel makers are struggling with weak demand, outside competition, and high energy and environmental costs.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies have agreed to pay Hawaii $700 million to settle its lawsuit over the efficacy and safety of the blood thinner Plavix. The settlement, split equally between Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi, resolves claims that the companies did not adequately warn about the risk of diminished response to Plavix in certain patients, particularly non-Caucasians. While neither company admitted wrongdoing, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green called it a landmark settlement and a major victory for the state. The funds are to be paid by wire transfer by June 9.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ordered her to be freed on bail. The judge cited "very substantial" and "very significant" claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when she was taken into custody following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa in March. Ozturk's lawyers argued that her detainment violated her First and Fifth Amendment rights, as she was targeted for criticizing Israel and participating in pro-Palestinian protests on campus.</p>

          <p>In Bristol, police are engaging with street sex workers while disrupting kerb crawlers, focusing on criminalizing the men rather than the women. The Op Boss and Night Light teams aim to combat night-time exploitation and harm by targeting men who are buying sexual services. The police force issues community protection warnings to any men caught engaging in sexual activity with sex workers. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) now recommends not criminalising the women - who are often vulnerable - and instead targeting the men.</p>

          <p>Japanese figure skating prodigy Taiga Nishino, despite being too young for the next Winter Olympics, has seen his stock rise sharply after mastering two quadruple jumps at just 15. The high school student has drawn comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata. Nishino landed a quad toe loop for the first time in a competition and has previously executed a quad salchow. He has grown nearly 10 centimeters over the past year to stand just over 160 cm, according to coach Misao Sato, and the rapid growth forced him to quickly progress to bigger boots and blades.</p>

Attorney General Ken Paxton described the settlement as sending a message to tech companies that he will not allow them to make money off of "selling away our rights and freedoms." The agreement settles several claims Texas made against the search giant in 2022 related to geolocation, incognito searches and biometric data. Paxton said the $1.4 billion is the largest amount won by any state in a settlement with Google over this type of data-privacy violations.</p>
