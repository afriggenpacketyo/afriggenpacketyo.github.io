          <p>India is performing a delicate diplomatic balancing act, strengthening ties with China and Russia while facing tariff friction with the United States. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's engagement with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is seen as a strategic hedge, not a full pivot away from Washington. Foreign policy experts describe this as a policy of "multi-alignment" and strategic autonomy, emphasizing that while current tensions with the U.S. are notable, the long-term strategic partnership remains crucial for both nations to counter China's influence in Asia.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family has finalized a succession agreement that ensures Lachlan Murdoch will maintain control of the conservative-leaning media empire, including Fox News and News Corp, after his father Rupert's death. The deal resolves a years-long internal power struggle by buying out the shares of his three older siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—who are seen as more politically moderate. This arrangement effectively ends their influence over the company's direction and solidifies Lachlan's leadership, concluding a real-life saga that famously inspired the TV show "Succession."</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have seen a substantial drop, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.12% as Treasury yields decline. This movement precedes an expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. Economists note that the spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields has tightened, suggesting a potentially favorable trend for mortgages if the Fed also slows its balance sheet runoff. However, experts do not anticipate drastic rate drops before the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, former president of Spelman College, observes that Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are seeing a surge in applications from students seeking affirming environments. This trend occurs as the Trump administration intensifies pressure on elite universities over issues like diversity initiatives and campus protests, creating a turbulent landscape for higher education. In her new book, Tatum explores the challenges facing college leaders and argues that attacks on DEI and academic freedom harm the nation's long-term interests, while students flock to HBCUs "where their history is not being erased."</p>

While the company has seen some positive signs, such as a record sales week for its fall menu launch, overall traffic and same-store sales are still shrinking, and the company's stock has fallen 7%.
