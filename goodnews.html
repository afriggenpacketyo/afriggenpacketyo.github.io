          <p>Despite recent military strikes by India within Pakistani-controlled territory, Indian financial markets have shown remarkable resilience, driven by strong domestic demand and positive economic fundamentals. Investors appear undeterred by the geopolitical tensions, focusing instead on India's growth prospects and progress in trade negotiations, including a free trade agreement with the U.K. Analysts suggest that historical precedents and expectations of a swift de-escalation contribute to the market's stability. While acknowledging potential near-term volatility, experts remain optimistic about the long-term trajectory of Indian assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his first in-depth interview since leaving office, former President Joe Biden discussed his legacy, foreign policy, and his views on President Trump's administration. Biden admitted that his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race was difficult but maintained it was the right choice, even if it occurred late in the campaign cycle. He criticized Trump's approach to the Ukraine war as "modern-day appeasement" and expressed concern about the future of the US-Europe alliance. Biden also touched on Trump's unconventional behavior and rhetoric, asserting that they were not representative of American values.</p>

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a 5% increase following the company's announcement that sales of its weight-loss drug Wegovy are projected to improve in the latter half of 2025. This positive outlook is attributed to the anticipated phasing out of copycat compounded drugs, which had previously impacted Wegovy's market share in the U.S. Despite reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales for Wegovy, Novo Nordisk's CEO, Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen, expressed confidence that the end of the FDA's drug shortage ruling would revitalize sales. The company is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers to enhance access to Wegovy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending a newly agreed trade deal with India amid criticism that it could disadvantage British workers. The agreement includes extending a National Insurance (NI) exemption from one to three years for short-term visa holders. Opponents argue this could make Indian workers cheaper to employ, especially with recent increases in UK employer NI contributions. However, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds insists the deal won't harm British workers, citing existing agreements preventing double taxation and highlighting the deal's potential to boost trade and economic growth. </p>
