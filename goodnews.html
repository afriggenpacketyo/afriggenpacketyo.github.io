          <p>A large-scale evacuation in Cologne, Germany, has been lifted after experts successfully defused three unexploded World War II bombs. Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated from the city center, including hotels, care homes, and the railway station in Deutz. The defusal operation faced a delay due to a resident refusing to evacuate, requiring intervention from public order officials. Bomb disposal is a common occurrence in Cologne, which was heavily targeted by Allied forces during World War II. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The five-year rule is an IRS regulation that dictates how non-spouse beneficiaries must take distributions from an inherited annuity when the original contract owner dies. This rule mandates that the entire value of the annuity be distributed within five years of the owner's death, either in a lump sum or multiple withdrawals. The rule primarily applies to non-qualified annuities funded with after-tax dollars and only affects non-spouse beneficiaries. Understanding this rule is crucial for estate planning, as it can significantly impact how beneficiaries manage inherited annuities and the associated tax implications. Planning ahead and making informed elections can help beneficiaries avoid potential tax traps. The optimism score for this article is 60. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A $750,000 annuity can provide a substantial and predictable monthly income during retirement, offering a sense of financial security. The exact monthly payout depends on factors such as age, gender, and whether it's a single or joint life annuity. For example, a 70-year-old male could receive approximately $5,483 per month, while a 70-year-old female might receive around $5,183 per month.
