          <p>Chelsea is set to face Paris Saint-Germain in the final of the 2025 Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The tournament, which featured 32 teams, has served as a major trial for the 2026 World Cup and has been seen as a success despite some criticism over high temperatures and low attendance. To reach the final, Chelsea defeated Fluminense 2-0, while PSG secured a dominant 4-0 victory over Real Madrid. The pre-game ceremony will feature performances by Robbie Williams and Laura Pausini, adding to the spectacle of the event.</p>

          <p>The third Test match between England and India at Lord's is precariously balanced after three days, with the scores level on the first innings. England's bowlers rallied late in the day to dismiss India for 387, taking the last four wickets for just 11 runs in sweltering heat. Key performances included a century from India's KL Rahul and crucial wickets from England's Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer. The day ended with heightened tensions as England closed at 2-0, setting the stage for a decisive fourth day in the tightly contested series.</p>

          <p>Colombian authorities have arrested Giuseppe Palermo, an alleged leader of Italy's 'ndrangheta mafia, in Bogotá. Palermo, also known as 'Peppe,' was wanted under an Interpol red notice for his role in managing extensive cocaine trafficking operations from Latin America to Europe. The capture was a coordinated effort involving Colombian, Italian, and British authorities, along with Europol. This arrest marks a significant blow to one of the world's most powerful criminal organizations, which is a major importer of cocaine into Europe.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova. The final, which lasted just 57 minutes, marked the first 'double bagel' win in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911. For the 24-year-old Swiatek, this is her sixth Grand Slam title and her first on grass, solidifying her status as one of the sport's top players by winning majors on all three surfaces. Anisimova, playing in her first Grand Slam final, struggled with nerves and unforced errors throughout the match.</p>

          <p>Two fathers are initiating a judicial review against the UK government, arguing for a complete ban on smartphones in schools across England. They contend that current guidance, which lets headteachers decide on phone policies, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harms like cyberbullying and exposure to explicit content. The campaigners, operating as Generation Alpha CIC, have formally notified the Education Secretary of their intent to take legal action. The Department for Education maintains that schools already possess the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has reiterated his bullish stance on Nvidia, advising investors with a simple six-word message: 'Please own it, don't trade it.' His comment comes as Nvidia's stock continues to climb after the company became the first to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization. Despite geopolitical risks and U.S. export restrictions on its advanced chips to China, demand remains exceptionally strong. The company's success is largely fueled by the generative AI boom, with its stock seeing remarkable gains over the past two years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as 'Fito,' has agreed to be extradited to the United States to face drug and weapons trafficking charges. Macias, head of the powerful 'Los Choneros' gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a wave of gang violence across Ecuador. His consent in court paves the way for his transfer, making him the first Ecuadorian to be extradited under a new law. The move is a major victory for President Daniel Noboa's aggressive campaign against the country's powerful criminal organizations.</p>

After leaving the restaurant industry burnt out, Kirby enrolled at Cornell University and identified a market gap for high-quality hummus. Starting with just a $450 blender and a few thousand dollars, he built the business while studying, focusing on slow, deep growth in regional markets. Today, Ithaca Hummus is sold in over 8,000 stores nationwide, a success Kirby attributes to maintaining product quality and strategic patience.</p>

The 19th-century castles, which also include Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee, were once criticized as extravagant but have since become major tourist attractions, drawing 1.7 million visitors in 2024. The prestigious designation, which Bavarian politicians have sought for decades, recognizes the sites as architectural masterpieces and is expected to further boost tourism to the region.

However, critics and even government sources admit the regulations may already be outdated, failing to fully address risks from messaging apps, AI chatbots, and misinformation.
