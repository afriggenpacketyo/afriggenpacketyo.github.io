          <p>The Dallas Mavericks have selected 18-year-old Cooper Flagg from Duke University with the first overall pick in the NBA Draft. Flagg, a 6-foot-8 forward, was the consensus college player of the year after leading Duke to the Final Four and has been hailed as a new franchise cornerstone. He joins a talented Mavericks roster that includes Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, who recently signed a new contract. The selection of Flagg is seen as a pivotal moment for the franchise as it moves forward from the era of Luka Donƒçiƒá, who was traded to the Lakers earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Following Inter Miami's 4-0 defeat to Paris St-Germain in the Club World Cup, questions are being raised about whether this was Lionel Messi's final appearance on a major global stage. The 38-year-old Argentine, who is out of contract in 2025, showed flashes of his brilliance but was unable to prevent the decisive loss. While his family is reportedly settled in Miami and he may extend his club contract, his participation in the 2026 World Cup remains unconfirmed. This tournament, which may not be held again until 2029, could represent the last time a worldwide audience sees the legendary player in a competitive international club competition.</p>

The movie, starring Brad Pitt and produced by much of the team behind "Top Gun: Maverick," was distributed in partnership with Warner Bros. Despite a large production budget of over $200 million, its strong critical reviews and positive audience reception suggest it may have sustained success in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>An analysis identifies Nvidia as a potentially strong investment among the "Magnificent Seven" stocks for the latter half of the year, citing its dominant position in the artificial intelligence sector. The article argues that despite U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China, Nvidia's role in powering the world's leading tech companies remains secure. The company's valuation, which is lower than it was several months ago, is also presented as a factor that leaves room for growth. The piece concludes that Nvidia is well-positioned for long-term success as AI technology continues to evolve into new areas like robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced in a Fox News interview that he has identified a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok. He described the prospective buyers as a group of "very wealthy people" and indicated a formal announcement could come in about two weeks. This development comes as the administration has repeatedly delayed enforcement of a law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform due to national security concerns. The current deadline for a sale is September 17, and any deal would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely.</p>

A park spokesperson confirmed the delay, stating that the safety system performed as designed and the ride was safely restarted. The coaster was closed for about 25 minutes for inspection before reopening to the public later the same day.</p>
