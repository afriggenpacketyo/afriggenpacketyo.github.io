          <p>Jim Cramer observed that Wall Street reacted positively to the U.S. bombings in Iran, suggesting the region's reduced relevance to the stock market. Oil prices initially rose but then significantly declined, influenced by Iran's claim of striking a U.S. military base in Qatar, which Qatar denied. Cramer noted the global energy market's changed dynamics due to increased U.S. oil production, providing a buffer against supply shocks. He also highlighted positive company-specific news lifting stocks, suggesting the market's resilience despite geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple's recent stock slide, contrasting with the strong rebound of other tech stocks, has sparked debate about the tech sector's role as a market safe haven. While the broader tech sector has recovered from tariff-related selloffs, Apple has underperformed, trading below key moving averages. Investors are allocating to tech through broad market index funds, but also hedging risk with traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples. Analysts suggest geopolitical events present buying opportunities in tech, particularly with the growth potential of AI. (not investment advice)</p>

He asserted that the U.S. severely damaged Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon. Mullin warned that if any destruction was incomplete, the U.S. would work with allies to finish the job.</p>
