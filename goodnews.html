          <h2>Ezra Klein Examines Democratic Party's Internal Conflicts Over 'Abundance Agenda'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 13:51:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein, in a New York Times opinion piece, discusses the contrasting reactions to his book "Abundance," which he co-authored with Derek Thompson. The book has sparked debate within the Democratic Party, with some viewing it as a potential savior and others as a threat to anti-corporate populist ideals. Klein argues that the book focuses on addressing societal needs and removing obstacles to progress, a perspective that has drawn criticism from those prioritizing the issue of concentrated power. The debate highlights the ongoing reimagining of the Democratic Party after its 2024 election loss and the struggle to incorporate diverse critiques into its renewal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most frequent sources of conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone or contemptuous attitude is a major predictor of divorce, while arguments about family often stem from feeling unsupported. Uneven distribution of household labor, including the 'invisible load,' can also lead to disputes. Ineffective communication, marked by defensiveness or stonewalling, exacerbates conflicts, but strategies like the 'five second rule' can help de-escalate tensions.</p>
