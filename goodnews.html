        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, due to a sharp fall in exports. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, influenced by uncertainties related to U.S. trade policies. Despite this, domestic demand showed a positive trend, growing by 0.6%. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current monetary policy, anticipating a moderate economic recovery and one rate hike later in the year, while remaining cautious about global trade policies.</p>

The company aims to make the service comparable in price to a high-end Uber ride.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) shortened the season to protect the whales. Some fishermen are experimenting with high-tech, pop-up systems to reduce rope usage and prevent entanglements. This technology, originally developed by the U.S. military, allows fishermen to retrieve crab cages without long lines of rope, but the cost is a barrier for many.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has brokered deals to sell advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, leading to internal debate over whether the U.S. is outsourcing the industry of the future.

          <p>Ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, facilitated by a land bridge formed when sea levels dropped. Fossils of Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, show a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The study indicates multiple migrations occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges in both directions. The research, published in Science, highlights the dynamic movements of these animals across continents.</p>
