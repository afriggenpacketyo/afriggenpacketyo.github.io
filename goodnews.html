          <p>JPMorgan Chase announced third-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' forecasts, driven by a record-breaking trading performance and strong investment banking results. The bank reported earnings of $5.07 per share on $47.12 billion in revenue, with trading revenue alone reaching a third-quarter record of $8.9 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon noted that while the U.S. economy remains resilient, the firm is preparing for potential future turbulence from geopolitical conditions and inflation risks. The bank also increased its provision for credit losses to $3.4 billion, indicating preparations for higher potential loan defaults ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

Oracle executives expressed confidence that customers will adopt AMD's technology well, particularly for AI inferencing tasks.

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported third-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street expectations, largely due to better-than-expected performance in its investment banking and fixed income trading divisions. The firm posted earnings of $12.25 per share with revenue of $15.18 billion, a 20% increase from the previous year. Investment banking fees surged 42% to $2.66 billion, significantly higher than anticipated, driven by more completed mergers and debt underwriting deals. The bank's fixed income trading also saw a 17% rise in revenue, benefiting from market volatility spurred by President Trump's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

With the new funding, Rockefeller plans to expand its services for high-net-worth clients by hiring more advisors and potentially expanding into international markets like Singapore and the Middle East. The move also reduces the majority stake held by founding backer Viking Global Investors, diversifying its long-term capital base.</p>

One landmark law, SB 243, requires AI chatbots to disclose their non-human nature and prompt minors to take breaks, while also implementing safeguards against harmful content. Other new laws mandate social media platforms to add mental health risk warnings and increase penalties for the distribution of deepfake pornography. These regulations position California at the forefront of tech governance in the U.S., forcing major tech companies to adapt their business models to prioritize child safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has fined luxury fashion brands Gucci, Chloe, and Loewe a total of more than €157 million for violating EU competition laws. An investigation found that the companies illegally restricted independent retailers from setting their own online and offline prices for their products. The Commission stated that the brands dictated minimum sales prices and imposed limits on discounts and sales periods. This anti-competitive behavior ultimately resulted in higher prices and reduced choices for consumers across the European Union.</p>

          <p>Meta has updated its content guidelines for teenage users on Instagram, aligning them with the standards of a PG-13 movie rating to provide clearer boundaries for parents. Under the new policy, the platform will hide accounts that share sexualized content or material related to drugs and alcohol from teen users. Additionally, teens will no longer be recommended posts containing swear words and will be blocked from following accounts that link to adult-themed websites. The changes come as Meta continues to face criticism and regulatory pressure over child safety and the platform's impact on teen mental health.</p>

          <p>Retired England cricket star Stuart Broad has stirred the pot ahead of the upcoming Ashes series, claiming Australia's current team is arguably their weakest since England's last series victory down under in 2010-11. Responding to a prediction of a 4-0 Australian victory from David Warner, Broad pointed to question marks over Australia's lineup and the fitness of their captain, Pat Cummins. He argued that while Australia are always favorites at home, the combination of a less dominant Australian side and one of the best English teams in years sets the stage for a potentially brilliant and highly competitive series.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills has officially entered the Democratic race to unseat Republican Senator Susan Collins, a key target for Democrats aiming to regain a Senate majority. Mills, a two-term governor, was reportedly recruited by party leaders following a high-profile confrontation with President Trump over transgender athletes. Her entry sets up a potentially divisive primary against more progressive candidates, like Graham Platner, who is endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders. The contest highlights a national trend of insurgent candidates challenging the party establishment and will test whether Mills' statewide electoral success can translate to a federal race.</p>

The article also debunks related claims about low autism rates in the Amish community, with experts noting that the Amish do use Tylenol and that genetic factors can influence autism prevalence in their population.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army is training soldiers to become "human abacuses" by using an ancient mental calculation technique as a backup for when advanced technology fails in combat. State media highlighted a recent drill where a soldier, simulating a radar failure, mentally calculated the trajectories of multiple targets in seconds, enabling a successful engagement. This training underscores a military strategy that values low-tech, resilient skills to ensure operational continuity in high-stakes scenarios where sophisticated electronic systems could be disabled or compromised. The promotion of these skills aligns with a broader national push to bolster military readiness and confidence.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in economics has been awarded to Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt for their foundational research explaining how technological innovation drives sustained economic growth. Mokyr's work focuses on how the Enlightenment in Britain created a unique environment where scientific breakthroughs were practically applied by skilled workers, sparking the Industrial Revolution. Aghion and Howitt developed a key economic model centered on "creative destruction," the process where new technologies replace outdated ones, which they argue is essential for long-term progress. Their collective work provides a crucial framework for understanding how societies can foster innovation and prosperity.</p>
