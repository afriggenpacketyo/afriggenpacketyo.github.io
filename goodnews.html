          <p>Baroness Harriet Harman, a former deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, has stated that Angela Rayner's replacement must be a woman from outside of London. This call comes as the party prepares for a leadership contest following Rayner's resignation, with discussions underway to set the rules and timetable. Harman emphasized the need for a complementary figure who can broaden the leader's reach and energize the party, rather than act as a counterpoint. Several high-profile women, including Dame Emily Thornberry and Louise Haigh, are being considered as potential candidates for the influential role.</p>

          <p>England's cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has stated that the final 11-player lineup for the first Ashes Test against Australia has not yet been decided. One key position under consideration is the number three batter, with a choice between retaining vice-captain Ollie Pope or selecting 21-year-old Jacob Bethell. Bethell recently impressed by scoring his first professional century and is seen as a promising future talent. McCullum emphasized that the team will be finalized closer to the series start in Perth, after upcoming T20 and ODI matches provide further opportunities to assess player form.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has announced an ambitious plan to become a global leader in the application of artificial intelligence within the energy sector by 2030. The strategy involves developing at least five industry-specific AI models for power grids, coal, oil, and gas industries. By 2027, Beijing aims to establish a comprehensive framework for integrating AI, fostering breakthroughs in core technologies, and creating over 100 application scenarios. The initiative also includes establishing dedicated research platforms and exploring a new financing system to support this technological integration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence is causing some disruption, labor economists suggest its overall impact on the U.S. job market has been relatively small so far, with current economic uncertainty being a larger factor in hiring slowdowns. The effects of AI-driven job changes have been mostly concentrated within the tech industry, which constitutes a small percentage of the total workforce. Studies indicate that early-career workers in AI-exposed fields have seen employment declines, but demand for AI-related skills is simultaneously growing. Experts advise workers to learn how AI is being used in their respective fields to adapt to the evolving landscape.</p>

          <h2>Investment in Nuclear Energy Surges Amid High Demand from AI and Data Centers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 06:57:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A renewed interest in nuclear energy is driving significant investment as global power demand surges, largely fueled by the needs of AI and data centers. Tech giants are increasingly funding nuclear projects to secure a reliable, 24/7 power source for their energy-intensive operations. Despite this momentum, the sector faces challenges, including vast capital requirements, long construction times, and an uncertain political and regulatory climate. While small modular reactors (SMRs) offer a more scalable solution, they are not yet commercially available, raising questions about whether the financial sector has the risk appetite for these long-term projects.

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has been confirmed on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a traditional wig striking a protester who is lying on the ground, with red paint splattering from their placard. Banksy claimed the piece on Instagram, his usual method of authentication. The politically charged image appeared shortly after a major protest in London, though it does not reference a specific event. The mural was quickly covered with plastic sheeting and is now being guarded by security officials.</p>

          <p>In response to a decline in the favorability of the U.S. in Germany, some American companies are adjusting their marketing strategies, with Coca-Cola launching a "Made in Germany" campaign. The campaign highlights local employees and emphasizes that most of its products sold in the country are also bottled there, aiming to strengthen its connection with German society. This move is part of a broader trend where US firms like McDonald's and Heinz are emphasizing local sourcing and production in international markets.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) achieves its high dividend yield through a heavy concentration in just three sectors: energy, consumer staples, and healthcare, which together make up 54% of the fund. This strategy allows it to offer a 3.7% yield, but raises questions about diversification for passive income investors. The article suggests this concentration is a strength, as the fund holds high-quality companies like Chevron and PepsiCo, which have strong track records of paying dividends. It concludes the ETF is a suitable choice for investors prioritizing income from equities over broad market exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Private equity firms are accelerating recruitment globally, creating a talent war with investment banks, particularly for fundraising and investor relations roles.
