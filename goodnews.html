          <p>President Trump is advocating for his "Big, Beautiful Bill" on social media, claiming it will reverse what he calls "four disastrous years" under former President Joe Biden. Trump asserts the bill will balance the budget, cut taxes, unleash American energy, and secure the border. He states that it will prevent funding for sex changes for minors, and restore choice and affordability for car purchases by repealing Biden's EV mandate. Senate Republicans are reviewing the bill, with potential changes that may face resistance from House Speaker Mike Johnson. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his government will expedite legislation to fast-track national projects to boost Canada's economy in response to Donald Trump's tariffs. The plan involves narrowing down a list of "nation building" projects, including pipelines, nuclear reactors, and trade corridors, and approving them within two years. Carney aims to strengthen Canada's economy and autonomy, calling Trump's tariffs "unjustified and unlawful." Canada's minister for US-Canada trade is set to resume trade talks in the US.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll. An electoral win for the Democratic Party candidate would set him up to be the country's next leader after ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol, and determine the trajectory of South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S., and policies on China and North Korea. Lee's eligibility for the presidency was in doubt after he was charged with breaching election laws, but a final ruling on the case had been postponed until after the election by South Korea's High Court.</p>
