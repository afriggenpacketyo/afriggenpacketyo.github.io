          <p>For the first time since 2011, the total number of refugees living in Germany has decreased, falling by approximately 50,000 in the first half of 2025 to a total of 3.5 million. This decline is attributed to a combination of increased deportations, voluntary departures, and a rise in naturalizations. The data, released by The Left party, includes long-term residents and over 1.2 million refugees from Ukraine. The article also notes separate news from Berlin, where authorities dealt with unexploded World War II bombs, forcing temporary evacuations.</p>

          <p>Apple released its new iPhone 17 worldwide, attracting large crowds and long lines in major cities like Beijing and Singapore. The launch is seen as a critical test for the company, which faces increasing pressure from Chinese competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as investor doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy. Early signs, such as strong preorder volumes on Chinese e-commerce platforms, suggest positive initial demand. However, analysts emphasize that Apple must deliver on its delayed AI promises to maintain its market leadership and reassure investors about its long-term innovation pipeline.</p>

De Goede, who comes from a family of rugby captains, has been instrumental in Canada's success, becoming the tournament's top scorer despite a recent ACL injury. Her leadership and versatile skills have helped the amateur Canadian team, ranked second in the world, reach the crucial match.

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index reversed earlier gains and fell after the Bank of Japan announced it would hold its policy rate steady at 0.5%. The decision was widely expected by economists but still prompted a negative market reaction, with the yen appreciating against the dollar. The central bank's cautious stance comes as Japan's core inflation rate for August fell to 2.7%, its lowest level since November 2024. This move highlights the BOJ's focus on maintaining economic stability amid slowing inflation and global uncertainty, choosing to preserve policy options rather than pursuing premature tightening.

          <p>The British and Irish governments have announced a new agreement to manage legacy cases related to the Northern Ireland Troubles, aiming to mend a diplomatic rift. Under the new framework, Ireland will pass legislation to ensure its state bodies, including the police, fully cooperate with a reformed UK legacy commission. The deal involves renaming the controversial Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) and establishing a new legacy unit within the Irish police force. This joint effort seeks to replace the widely opposed 2023 UK Legacy Act and provide a more collaborative path to addressing historical injustices.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has maintained its policy rate at 0.5%, a decision influenced by new data showing a decline in the country's core inflation. The core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% in August, marking its third consecutive monthly drop and reaching its lowest point since November 2024. While some analysts and politicians have called for rate hikes to combat the cost-of-living crisis, the BOJ appears to be prioritizing stability. The central bank's cautious approach suggests it believes current inflationary pressures are largely driven by external factors rather than robust domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Several Asian countries, including South Korea and Australia, have already lowered rates to counter the economic impact of U.S. trade tariffs.
