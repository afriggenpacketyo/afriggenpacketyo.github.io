          <p>Commemorating its tenth anniversary, Ethereum has transformed from a niche project into a foundational layer for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on its growth from a small community to a platform used by major corporations, while also warning about the risks of centralization. The article details how institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are integrating with Ethereum for tokenized assets and stablecoins, which now process trillions in transactions. This evolution signifies a major shift, positioning the blockchain as the essential "plumbing" for the future of Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has largely maintained restrictions on federal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's finding that agents cannot base detentions solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over "roving patrols" by ICE and CBP that advocates argued violated the Constitution's protection against unreasonable seizures. The decision was praised by immigrant rights groups as a crucial protection against racial profiling. The Trump administration criticized the ruling, stating that its enforcement actions target individuals based on their illegal status, not their ethnicity.</p>

Doncic, who was acquired in a trade from Dallas last season, announced the deal himself, expressing his commitment to bringing championships to the city. The Lakers' management praised him as a "transcendent" player who will lead the team in the post-LeBron James era. As part of the announcement, Doncic also pledged a $5 million donation to support 77 young athletes globally.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are establishing a new left-wing political party but have yet to decide on a name. Instead of choosing one themselves, they are inviting their reported 600,000 registered supporters to help select a title that encapsulates the party's identity. The move is part of a broader strategy to build a grassroots movement, though the party cannot field election candidates until it is officially registered with the Electoral Commission. The article notes the challenge of finding a name that is both resonant and avoids ridicule.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. In an interview, Hill explained that seeing his stepfather unable to enjoy retirement made him re-evaluate his own life, as he felt unsuited and emotionally unprepared for the medical profession. He recalled feeling "completely out of my depth" when breaking tragic news to patients. The move proved successful, leading to a long career in entertainment, though he noted the intense stress of producing his hit show "TV Burp."</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, is now indicating it will be more "careful" with this strategy, a shift that contrasts with China's aggressive embrace of open-source development. Renowned AI expert Andrew Ng has suggested that China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the US in the field. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have recently released advanced open-source models, positioning themselves at the forefront of this movement while US firms re-evaluate the balance between openness and proprietary control.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how "Winston," a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill by Australia in 1943, died during its sea voyage to the UK. While wartime legend claimed the creature died from shell-shock during a U-boat encounter, newly analyzed records suggest a more mundane cause. Logbooks from the platypus's attendant show that as the ship crossed the equator, water and air temperatures in its enclosure soared well above the safe threshold for the species. The evidence indicates the platypus likely succumbed to heat stress, not the perils of war.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of theme parks to boost its economy and drive consumer spending, as evidenced by the recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort. Despite a heatwave, thousands attended the launch, highlighting strong domestic demand for such attractions. According to a global industry association, the number of amusement facilities in China is projected to grow significantly in the coming years. This strategy aims to leverage the substantial local economic impact of these parks, where each yuan of revenue can generate nearly four times that amount in the surrounding area.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a strong return from the injured list, striking out eight batters over five innings in his first start since the beginning of the season. However, his performance was marred by two home runs from Tampa Bay's Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field porch at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite Snell giving up three runs in the 4-0 loss, his command and ability to generate swings and misses were promising signs for the Dodgers' rotation. The team hopes he can provide a significant boost for their late-season championship push.</p>
