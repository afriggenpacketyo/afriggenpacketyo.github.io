          <p>Dan Tana, born Dobrivoje Tanasijević, the founder of the legendary West Hollywood Italian restaurant that became a celebrity hotspot, has passed away at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. A former professional soccer player and actor, Tana opened his namesake eatery in 1964, creating a late-night dining destination for stars like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. The restaurant, known for its classic red-sauce Italian-American fare and discreet service, has remained an L.A. institution, celebrated for its timeless charm and history even after Tana sold it in 2009.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Padres' performance was marred by significant errors, including three runners caught stealing in the first two innings and a costly dropped fly ball that allowed two runs to score. Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, who capitalized on San Diego's sloppy play and numerous walks issued by their pitcher. The win clinches the season's head-to-head series for the Dodgers against their division rivals.</p>

"Bob" Lowe, a distinguished general, vascular, and transplant surgeon in Albuquerque for over 50 years, passed away at the age of 75 after a decade-long battle with pancreatic cancer. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Dr. Lowe was a pioneer in laparoscopic donor nephrectomies in New Mexico and later served as Surgical Medical Director for the Renal Transplant Program at Presbyterian Healthcare Services. Remembered for his surgical skill, kindness, and quiet philanthropy, he was a devoted husband, father, and loyal Green Bay Packers fan. A celebration of his life is scheduled for September 21.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have declined to comment on the status of quarterback Matthew Stafford, who was scheduled for a workout to test an injured back. The 37-year-old has been sidelined with an aggravated disc, preventing him from practicing with the team as the season opener approaches. In his absence during a preseason win against the Chargers, backup quarterback Stetson Bennett performed well, completing 28 of 40 passes for 324 yards and three touchdowns, including the game-winning score. Coach Sean McVay is expected to provide an update on Stafford's condition on Monday, but the ongoing uncertainty raises concerns about the veteran's availability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Chinese design for a hypersonic drone carrier proposes a revolutionary "scissor wing" concept, reviving a dream once pursued by NASA. The aircraft features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At takeoff and subsonic speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as it approaches Mach 1, it pivots to a 45-degree angle to mitigate shock waves. At hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, the wing aligns parallel with the fuselage, allowing the entire vehicle to function as a highly efficient "waverider" for stable high-speed flight.</p>

          <p>A New Zealand citizen and her 6-year-old son have been released after being detained for over three weeks in a Texas immigration facility, 2,000 miles from their Washington state home. Sarah Shaw, who has lived legally in the U.S. since 2021, was taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection after a brief trip to Canada due to an expired travel permit, which her lawyer called a minor paperwork error. Despite her son's documents being valid, authorities denied requests for him to be picked up by a friend and transported them both to the South Texas Family Residential Center.</p>

          <h2>Couples Therapist Explains Five Psychological Reasons People Have Affairs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 21:35:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological drivers that can lead people, even those who consider themselves "good," to risk their careers and families for an affair. These factors include a lifetime of repressing personal desires to meet societal expectations ("always being good") and the burnout from perfectionism, which is often a response to childhood trauma. Other triggers are having poor boundaries developed from being a "parentified child," seeking reprieve from an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage, and reassessing life priorities after a significant loss, such as the death of a parent.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic-era fortress on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been meticulously renovated into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. Former software CEO Mike Conner purchased the abandoned, listed building in 2017 for £555,000 and undertook a challenging five-year restoration project. The historic 100-man fort, which had no electricity or running water, is now equipped with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub. Conner hopes the unique, off-grid property will be enjoyed by its next owner, suggesting it has potential as a tourist attraction or event space.</p>

          <p>Claire's, the accessories chain once a staple for tweens and teenagers, has appointed administrators in the UK and Ireland after struggling with falling sales and intense competition. The company's 306 stores in the region will continue trading for now as it seeks a path forward, though online sales have been halted. For decades, the brand was a go-to destination for affordable jewelry, ear piercing, and glittery accessories, but it has faced challenges from fast-fashion giants like Shein and a shift in youth culture towards social media trends and more premium brands. Many former customers recall the store as a nostalgic part of their youth.</p>

          <p>Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston was carted off the field after sustaining a concussion during a preseason game against the Rams. The injury occurred on the third play from scrimmage when Johnston took a helmet-to-chin hit from a Rams safety while attempting to catch a deep pass. After being attended to by medical staff, he was taken to a local hospital for precautionary checks. The game, which the Chargers ultimately lost 23-22, also saw quarterback Justin Herbert make his career preseason debut, playing briefly in the first series before handing off to the backups.</p>

          <h2>UK Experiences Signs of an Early Autumn as Trees React to Summer Heatwave</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 19:12:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing hot weather, parts of the UK are showing signs of an early autumn, such as leaves turning yellow and berries ripening ahead of schedule. Experts suggest this is not a true seasonal shift but rather a stress response from nature to one of the warmest and driest summers on record. The prolonged heat and drought have caused trees to shed leaves and branches to conserve energy, a phenomenon known as "summer branch drop." While some crops have thrived, the unusual conditions are creating a chaotic environment for wildlife, potentially impacting the food supply for birds and bees heading into winter.</p>

          <p>A group of students about to receive their GCSE results have opened letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2021. The letters, part of a time capsule project initiated by their teacher, reveal the anxieties and hopes of 11-year-olds navigating a disrupted start to secondary school. Students reflected on wearing face masks, being in school 'bubbles,' and their dreams for the future, with questions ranging from "Do you have a girlfriend yet?" to aspirations of attending university. The exercise served as a poignant reminder of their resilience and personal growth through the pandemic-affected years of their education.</p>
