          <p>Tesla is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating a return to revenue growth after two consecutive quarters of decline. Expectations are set at 54 cents per share on $26.37 billion in revenue, though projections for the fourth quarter suggest a potential drop. The report comes after Tesla announced record vehicle deliveries for the quarter, but overall deliveries for the year are down compared to 2024. Investors and analysts will be closely watching for updates on the company's Robotaxi service, new lower-cost models, and the impact of a sales slump in Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet has found that physiological side effects like weight change and altered heart rate vary significantly among different antidepressant medications. Researchers analyzed data from over 58,000 participants and compared 30 common antidepressants, noting that some were associated with weight gain while others led to weight loss. The study's authors emphasize that these findings should not discourage use of the effective medications but rather encourage doctors to better tailor treatments to individual patient needs. Experts advise careful monitoring of side effects and weighing the risks against the benefits of treatment.</p>

          <p>Seventy years after her execution, the grandchildren of Ruth Ellis are formally requesting a posthumous pardon for her 1955 murder conviction. Ellis, who was hanged for killing her lover David Blakely, is now understood to have been a victim of severe and prolonged domestic abuse. Her family's lawyers argue that in a modern court, this context of abuse would likely have reduced the charge to manslaughter. The case was a landmark in British legal history, contributing to the eventual abolition of the death penalty, and this new appeal highlights the evolution of the justice system's understanding of domestic violence.</p>

          <p>The National Football League has officially approved the sale of a 10% minority stake in the New York Giants to philanthropist Julia Koch. The transaction values the team at a record $10.3 billion, the highest valuation ever for an NFL team in a sale. The deal, which involves the team currently owned by the Mara and Tisch families, reflects the soaring values of NFL franchises. This trend is driven by expectations of lucrative new media rights deals and the recent introduction of private equity investment into the league, which has increased liquidity and set a higher floor on valuations.</p>

          <p>Amazon has introduced a new robotic system named Blue Jay, designed to perform multiple tasks simultaneously within its fulfillment centers. The system consists of robotic arms on a track that can pick, sort, and consolidate items, combining what were previously three separate robotic stations into one. Amazon states the goal is to assist employees with physically demanding tasks and improve efficiency, noting that Blue Jay can handle about 75% of the items stored at its sites. The announcement comes amid growing scrutiny of the impact of automation on Amazon's large workforce and its long-term hiring plans.</p>

          <p>A council in south-west London has rescinded a £150 fine given to a woman for pouring the last of her coffee into a street drain. The woman explained she was trying to avoid spilling it on the bus and was shocked when enforcement officers issued the penalty for illegal waste disposal. The incident sparked public discussion, with many people unaware that pouring liquids into street drains is an offense. Richmond-Upon-Thames Council ultimately cancelled the fine, stating the contravention was "minor" and that an appeal would likely have been successful, while apologizing for the inconvenience caused.</p>

Dyche, known for his pragmatic philosophy, emphasized that the team must play "effective football" to stabilize their position in the Premier League, where they are currently in the relegation zone.
