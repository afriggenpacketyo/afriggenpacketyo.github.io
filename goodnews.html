          <p>BP's stock experienced volatility following a Wall Street Journal report suggesting Shell was considering acquiring BP. Shares initially surged by over 10% before retracting after Shell denied any ongoing discussions. Sources familiar with the matter indicated that a complete acquisition of BP by Shell is unlikely; a split and sale to multiple companies would be a more probable scenario. BP's recent underperformance compared to Shell and other U.S. rivals has fueled speculation about its vulnerability as an acquisition target, especially after a strategic reset that increased focus on oil and gas. The article details the market's reaction to acquisition rumors and Shell's firm denial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential interest earnings from depositing $20,000 into a 2-year certificate of deposit (CD) account, emphasizing the trade-off between accessibility and returns. With online banks offering rates comfortably over 4%, savers can earn significant interest, but they must keep their money untouched for the full term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. The article provides specific examples of potential earnings at different interest rates, such as earning over $1,600 with a 2-year CD at 4.10%. Given the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the article advises savers to act proactively to secure high rates while they are available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>BlackRock's Rick Rieder expressed confidence in the stock market's potential for further growth in the second half of 2025, citing artificial intelligence as a key factor in reducing inflation. He anticipates that productivity gains from AI will offset inflationary pressures from tariffs, which he views as a one-time adjustment. Rieder also believes the U.S. economy is unlikely to enter a recession due to its reliance on services rather than cyclical goods. His comments come as the S&P 500 approaches its record high, suggesting optimism despite macroeconomic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve proposed easing a key capital rule for large Wall Street banks, a move intended to enhance Treasury market liquidity but met with dissent from some officials. The proposal aims to reduce the top-tier capital big banks must hold, potentially freeing up capital for lower-risk assets like Treasurys. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated the current leverage ratio has become too binding, while officials like Michelle Bowman supported the changes to build resilience in Treasury markets. However, governors Adriana Kugler and Michael Barr opposed the move, suggesting banks would likely use the freed-up capital for shareholder distributions rather than Treasury intermediation.

          <p>This article explores whether a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) will be cheaper this summer, considering potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. As of late June, interest rates for both products are similar, but the fixed-rate nature of home equity loans versus the variable rates of HELOCs could influence affordability. The article suggests that while home equity loans may offer a lower initial rate, HELOCs could become cheaper if rates decrease later in the summer. Homeowners are advised to weigh the security of a fixed rate against the potential benefits of variable rates, especially with the possibility of future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill to ban Chinese AI systems from federal agencies, aiming to ensure the U.S. prevails in the global AI competition.

Lawmakers emphasized the strategic importance of AI and the need to maintain export controls on advanced chips to China. The article highlights the growing concerns about China's AI capabilities and the U.S.'s efforts to maintain its lead in the field. </p>

          <h2>California FAIR Plan's Smoke Damage Policy Deemed Illegal by Judge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 12:55:29 EDT</div>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge ruled that the California FAIR Plan's smoke-damage policy violates state law by providing less coverage than required, impacting homeowners affected by recent firestorms. The policy required "permanent physical changes" to a property for claims, making it difficult to get compensation for smoke damage. The judge's decision could have broad implications for the FAIR Plan, which has seen significant growth as insurers pull out of California. The article highlights the legal battle over smoke-damage claims and the potential impact on homeowners. </p>

          <p>Gareth Southgate, former England boss, has been awarded a knighthood, joining a list of football greats, despite not winning a trophy in his managerial career. Southgate restored the image of his squad and the game, but ultimately fell short of ending England's barren sequence since the 1966 World Cup. He led England to successive European Championship finals and a World Cup semi-final. The knighthood is a reward for his service to England and the Football Association, recognizing his influence in the recent era. </p>
