          <p>Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, are preparing to present photographic and scientific evidence in a US defamation suit against Candace Owens, who alleges Brigitte was born male. The Macrons' lawyer, Tom Clare, stated that Mrs. Macron finds the claims upsetting and a distraction for the French president. The evidence will include expert testimony to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations, with Mrs. Macron willing to undergo public scrutiny to set the record straight. Owens' lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss the case, but the Macrons are determined to defend their honor and combat the spread of false information. The couple had previously won a defamation case in France against bloggers who started the rumors, but the ruling was overturned on appeal. The article highlights the lengths to which the Macrons are willing to go to defend their reputation against baseless claims. Optimism score is not directly mentioned here.</p>

          <h2>Former Vogue Editor Warns of Diversity Regression in Fashion Industry</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Edward Enninful, former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, expressed concerns that the fashion industry risks reverting to prioritizing thin, European models as the beauty norm. Enninful, who recently launched an inclusive media platform called EE72, suggests that the industry's "anti-woke" rhetoric could undermine years of progress in inclusive modeling. He emphasizes the importance of the fashion industry defining its values and advocating for diverse representation, noting that the idea that someone curvy or from another country is beautiful shouldn't be considered "woke." Enninful also addressed reports of a falling out with Anna Wintour, stating that he chose to leave Vogue after six years and maintains a supportive relationship with her. The article provides insights into the ongoing debate about diversity and inclusivity in the fashion world.</p>

          <p>The European and Chinese parliaments are planning to hold their first talks in seven years on October 16 in Brussels. This meeting, approved by the European Conference of Presidents, marks a significant turnaround in relations between the two chambers, which were previously strained due to sanctions exchanged in 2021 over human rights issues in Xinjiang. The agenda is pending confirmation, but the meeting is expected to initiate a biannual exchange, with MEPs traveling to Beijing in May 2026. The article highlights the improving relations between the EU and China and the resumption of parliamentary dialogue. The talks aim to foster better understanding and cooperation.</p>
