          <p>Google's YouTube TV announced that Fox Broadcast Network, Fox News, and Fox Sports channels might be removed from its platform if a new agreement with Fox Corporation isn't reached by Wednesday. YouTube claims Fox is demanding significantly higher payments than comparable content partners, aiming for a fair deal without passing excessive costs to subscribers. Fox, however, accuses Google of exploiting its influence with unreasonable terms. If a blackout occurs, YouTube will offer subscribers a $10 credit, with Fox content still available via Fox One streaming.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard offloaded over 38 tons of cocaine and marijuana at Port Everglades, Florida, marking the largest cocaine seizure in its history. The 76,140 pounds of narcotics, valued at $473 million, were intercepted during 19 interdictions in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Rear Admiral Adam Chamie highlighted the immense scale of the threat, stating the cocaine alone represented 23 million lethal doses, enough to fatally overdose Florida's entire population. Officials emphasized that maritime interdictions are crucial for preventing these deadly drugs from reaching communities and destroying lives.</p>

The ongoing transfer saga involving Newcastle striker Alexander Isak and Liverpool's interest has further fueled tensions between the clubs and their passionate fan bases.

          <p>Cracker Barrel has responded to significant fan backlash regarding its recent contemporary country redesign, acknowledging that it "could've done a better job sharing who we are." The 56-year-old chain, which aimed to modernize its aesthetic with a minimalist logo and updated interiors, faced criticism on social media and a 13% stock drop. The company reassured customers that its core values of "hard work, family, and scratch-cooked food" remain, promising to keep beloved elements like rocking chairs and peg games. Cracker Barrel stated its focus remains on food quality while evolving to attract new generations.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advocates for investors to maintain their positions in tech megacap stocks, even during market downturns, emphasizing their historical wealth-generating potential for long-term holders. He acknowledges current concerns about Nvidia ahead of its earnings report, particularly regarding demand from China and hyperscalers, but reiterates his belief that hardware for generative AI is crucial for future growth. Cramer cautions against attempting to time the market by trading in and out of these large companies, suggesting they tend to rebound quickly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump pursues policies aimed at ending the Ukraine conflict and imposing tariffs, China is reportedly expanding its influence across Eurasia, a region historically vital for global power. Trump's tariff policies have strained U.S.-China economic ties and pushed India, a regional rival, to improve relations with Beijing. Increased trade between India and China, alongside Russia becoming a major energy exporter to China, signals a broader strategic realignment that could gradually diminish American influence in the region. This article suggests a significant geopolitical shift is underway.</p>

          <p>Australian Open champion Madison Keys suffered a surprising first-round defeat at the US Open, losing to world number 82 Renata Zarazua, attributing her error-strewn performance to nerves.

Keys, who had a strong start to the year winning a Grand Slam, described feeling "paralysing" nerves and struggling to separate herself from the pressure of winning.

          <p>Despite rapid advancements in drone and robot technology, major military powers like China and the United States continue to invest heavily in costly crewed military systems, such as sixth-generation fighter jets. While autonomous weapons offer advantages like reduced human casualties, analysts argue that humans remain central to critical decision-making and combat operations. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has urged accelerated drone adoption, and the U.S. has proposed a "hellscape" strategy using drone swarms around Taiwan. However, the ongoing investment in crewed systems indicates a belief that human elements are indispensable for modern warfare.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is bringing back its popular Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) and other fall-inspired items on Tuesday, August 26, marking an increasingly early arrival for the seasonal menu. The PSL, introduced over 20 years ago, remains the most popular seasonal beverage, having sold hundreds of millions. This early launch, including new items like Pecan Cold Foam, aims to boost sales for the coffee giant, which has recently seen a 2% decline in U.S. sales and weakening in-store traffic. CEO Brian Niccol expressed confidence that the fall program, especially the PSL, will attract many customers.</p>

Earlier, Trump had posted critically about South Korea, mentioning "vicious raids on churches," but adopted a softer tone during the meeting. The leaders also discussed their trade deal, which capped tariffs on South Korean exports to the U.S. at 15%.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police reported "far fewer" incidents of serious violence at this year's Notting Hill Carnival compared to recent years, with 423 arrests over two days. While there were two stabbings, neither resulted in serious injury, a notable improvement from last year's eight stabbings and two deaths. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward attributed this reduction to proactive measures like live facial recognition (LFR), metal detectors, and stop-and-search. The use of LFR remains controversial among civil liberty groups, who argue it's a mass surveillance tool and potentially less accurate for women and people of color.</p>
