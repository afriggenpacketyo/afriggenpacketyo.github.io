          <h2>Study Finds Ancient Horses Migrated Between Asia and North America</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 22:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, approximately 50,000 to 13,000 years ago. These migrations occurred via the Bering land bridge when sea levels were lower, connecting the two continents. The study examined fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The research, published in the journal Science, indicates that genetic exchanges between the continents happened in both directions over multiple migrations, contributing to the understanding of horse evolution and distribution across the globe.</p>

          <p>Due to severe depopulation in rural Japan, unstaffed train stations and vacant homes are being repurposed into tourist accommodations, injecting new life into the surrounding areas. Transport operators are collaborating with local communities to transform these quiet outposts into hubs of activity, fostering creativity and attracting visitors. This initiative aims to revitalize rural regions by leveraging existing infrastructure and local resources. This is part of a broader trend of Japanese communities uniting to address social and economic challenges through innovative solutions.</p>

          <p>Walmart has cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, the company may need to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that President Trump's tariffs are hindering Walmart's ability to maintain low prices for consumers. While the U.S. has lowered tariff rates on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, Walmart still anticipates cost pressures, particularly in categories like electronics and toys. The retailer is attempting to mitigate the impact on customers but acknowledges that further tariff increases could significantly affect their financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines could delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. Scientific advisers to the CDC have been debating whether to recommend immunization for all Americans or switch to a risk-based strategy, as is common in other countries. The FDA has requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the necessity of COVID vaccines for children under 12. Some experts fear these changes are part of a broader effort to undermine vaccine use by raising safety doubts and imposing stringent requirements.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates and the United States have reached an agreement allowing the UAE to construct the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the U.S., giving the UAE expanded access to advanced AI chips. This agreement, made during Donald Trump‚Äôs visit to the Middle East, has raised concerns due to previous restrictions under the Biden administration over fears of Chinese access to the technology. The deal requires that data centers be managed by US companies, reflecting the Trump administration‚Äôs confidence in secure management of the chips. Some worry that this could diminish the US grip on the burgeoning tech sector and potentially allow China to access these data centers for its own benefit.</p>

          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary, scheduled for President Trump's birthday, is projected to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade is expected to feature over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the FAA. White House officials state that the cost will be shared by the Department of the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, with President Trump intending to honor all who have served since the nation's founding. The plans have faced criticism from some Democrats, who view the event as a wasteful display of ego.</p>

          <p>China is reorganizing its military education system by establishing new academies for service branches as part of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) modernization efforts. The PLA Ground Force Service Academy, the PLA Information Support Force Engineering University, and the PLA Joint Logistics Support Force Engineering University will be based in different provinces. These academies will directly recruit high school graduates, strengthening the talent pool for the Information Support Force (ISF) and Joint Logistics Support Force (JLSF). This initiative aligns with the PLA's structural overhaul to enhance its capabilities for modern warfare by 2027, aiming for a 'world-class' military by 2049.</p>

The selection of Depresi√≥n Sonora as the sole Spanish-language act is attributed to the positive reception of his music in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, where he has a significant fan base.
