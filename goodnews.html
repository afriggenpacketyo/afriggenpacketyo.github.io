          <p>Oman has become the latest Gulf state to launch a "golden visa" program, aiming to attract wealthy foreigners, including Americans, by offering residency in exchange for significant investment. To qualify, individuals must invest at least $520,000 in property, bonds, or businesses that contribute to local employment. The program is part of Oman's strategic effort to boost private sector growth and offers perks like fast-track airport services and property ownership in previously restricted areas.

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," features a transformative performance from Dwayne Johnson as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The drama explores Kerr's personal crisis following his first professional loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse, relationship turmoil, and existential dread. Johnson, physically altered for the role, portrays the vulnerability beneath the fighter's colossal exterior, particularly in scenes with his girlfriend, played by Emily Blunt. While the film focuses heavily on the fighting world, it offers touching moments of human fragility and a compelling character study.</p>

          <p>The Texas-based convenience store chain Buc-ee's has evolved into a cultural phenomenon and a popular destination for American road-trippers. Known for its massive stores, countless gas pumps, famously clean restrooms, and extensive food offerings, including fresh barbecue, the chain has built a loyal following. Brand experts describe Buc-ee's as a "destination experience" that combines joy and fun, comparing its appeal to the "Disneyland of the convenience store industry." The company's success is attributed to its focus on friendliness, cleanliness, and keeping items in stock, especially during busy travel weekends like Labor Day.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has expressed his support for citizens flying national flags like the Union Jack and St George's Cross, calling them great symbols of patriotism. However, he cautioned that their value is diminished when they are used "purely for divisive purposes," a comment made in the context of flags appearing at protests against asylum hotels. Starmer, who noted he has a St George's flag in his Downing Street flat, has previously placed the Union Jack on Labour Party membership cards. His comments come as several local councils have begun removing flags from public infrastructure, citing safety concerns.</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check Finds No Credible Evidence for Rumors of Melania Trump Working as an Escort</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Claims circulating on social media that former first lady Melania Trump worked as an escort and met Donald Trump at a party hosted by Ghislaine Maxwell are unfounded. These allegations, which date back to a 2016 tabloid article, have been consistently unsupported by credible evidence. Melania Trump previously sued the Daily Mail and a U.S. blogger for defamation over the escort claim, resulting in settlements, retractions, and damages paid to her. Furthermore, multiple reports confirm the Trumps were introduced by former modeling agent Paolo Zampolli, not at an event connected to Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Acclaimed Canadian author Margaret Atwood has released a satirical short story criticizing a new policy in the province of Alberta that requires school libraries to remove books with "explicit sexual content." The move comes after her own celebrated novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was pulled from some school shelves under the new rule. Atwood's new story ironically depicts perfectly chaste characters to highlight the absurdity of the ban, while also taking aim at Alberta's Premier, Danielle Smith. This protest is part of a growing debate as book ban policies, once prominent in the U.S., gain traction in Canada.</p>

          <p>European stock markets started the month on a positive note, with the defense sector showing significant gains following a major corporate announcement. The U.K. government confirmed a £10 billion deal for Norway to purchase British-made Type 26 frigates, marking the U.K.'s largest-ever warship export agreement by value. This news sent shares of defense contractor BAE Systems and other related companies higher. Meanwhile, the health-care sector also saw a lift, driven by positive trial data for Novo Nordisk's popular weight-loss drug Wegovy, which showed superior heart disease risk reduction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that human influence began to drastically alter the evolution of animal body sizes during the Middle Ages. Researchers discovered that while wild and domestic species once followed similar size-change cycles, they diverged around 1000 AD. Wild species like deer and foxes began to shrink due to habitat loss and intensified hunting. In contrast, domesticated animals such as sheep, cattle, and chickens grew larger as humans implemented more systematic and specialized selective breeding practices to increase their utility.</p>

The friendly display comes as India faces steep new tariffs from the U.S. in retaliation for its continued purchases of discounted Russian oil. Modi described the relationship with Moscow as "special and privileged," while Putin hailed the ties as friendly and trusting. This diplomatic engagement highlights India's strategy of maintaining strong relations with Russia and China as a counterbalance to economic pressure from the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's nationalized rail operator, has permanently eliminated higher-priced peak-time tickets, a move that has significantly reduced fares for commuters on routes like Glasgow to Edinburgh. The decision was made possible by post-pandemic travel patterns, which have left more capacity on trains during traditional rush hours. This initiative has sparked a debate on whether the rest of the UK could adopt a similar model to make train travel more affordable. While passengers welcome cheaper tickets, experts are divided, with some warning of potential overcrowding on busy routes or the need for future price hikes to cover lost revenue.</p>
