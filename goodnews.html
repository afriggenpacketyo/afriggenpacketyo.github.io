          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is taking direct action to counter China's dominance in the critical minerals market by investing in domestic production. The Pentagon recently acquired an equity stake in MP Materials, the only rare earth miner in the U.S., to secure the supply chain for materials essential for advanced weaponry like F-35s and drones. This public-private partnership is being presented as a new model to onshore industries vital to national security, addressing the U.S.'s heavy reliance on Chinese imports for these strategic resources.</p>

          <p>Charles Collins and Brian Boles, who were convicted as teenagers for a 1994 murder in Harlem, have been exonerated after spending decades in prison. The Manhattan District Attorney's office found that their convictions and coerced confessions were contradicted by exculpatory evidence, including DNA that proved their innocence. The case highlights issues of due process, as the men were interrogated as minors without an adult present. Their release marks the 13th vacated case by the DA's Post-Conviction Justice Unit since its inception in 2022, prompting new investigation protocols.</p>

          <p>A national nonprofit called "Little Bellas" is helping young girls aged 7 to 13 build confidence and life skills through mountain biking. The program, which has six chapters in the Twin Cities, operates in a non-competitive environment, focusing on creating a safe space for girls to challenge themselves with the guidance of female mentors. By pairing activities like riding and games with peer support, the organization aims to teach valuable lessons about strength, overcoming fear, and self-belief. The program also offers financial assistance and gear to ensure accessibility for all participants.</p>
