          <p>Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan has started a bus tour of ten bronze statues of "One Piece" characters to boost tourism and recovery following the 2016 earthquakes. The statues, created by Kumamoto native Eiichiro Oda, are located across nine municipalities, serving as reminders of the disaster and symbols of reconstruction progress. The tour, initially for domestic tourists, may include translation services for international visitors due to the series' global popularity. The tour costs 28,000 yen per person and includes visits to a quake memorial museum and a damaged local railway.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of couples in common-law relationships avoid legal marriage due to the requirement to adopt a single surname. The rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% stating they would marry if separate surnames were permitted. Japan is reportedly the only country mandating a shared surname upon marriage, a law opposed by some who fear it impacts traditional family values. The survey estimates that over a million people in Japan are in common-law relationships, with many desiring legal marriage if surname laws were more flexible.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth with the addition of 12,000 coffee shops in the past year, driven by increased accessibility and competition.

However, Starbucks' market share has declined significantly as new entrants with innovative business models and flavors gain traction. Much of this growth is concentrated in second-tier and emerging first-tier cities, indicating a broader expansion of coffee culture beyond major urban centers.</p>
