        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many tariffs imposed by President Trump are not legally permissible, dealing a significant blow to his signature trade strategy. The court found that the president exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, stating that the law does not grant unlimited power to levy tariffs. While the ruling does not immediately block the duties, it directs a lower court to reevaluate whether a universal injunction is appropriate. The Trump administration has criticized the decision as partisan and vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Scotland have set a new world record by completing the fastest unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean, traveling from Peru to Australia in 139 days. Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean rowed over 9,000 miles non-stop, becoming the first team to complete the full crossing from South America to Australia. The journey, which included overcoming storms and injuries, also served as a fundraiser for clean water projects, raising over £700,000. The trio broke the previous record of 160 days, which was set by a solo rower in 2014.</p>

          <p>Marking ten years in power, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) has overseen a period of rapid and profound transformation within the Kingdom. Key changes include significant advancements in women's rights, such as the right to drive and greater participation in the workforce, and the sidelining of the religious police, which opened up public social spaces. The reforms also feature a major economic restructuring aimed at reducing oil dependency through mega-projects like NEOM and the growth of the Public Investment Fund. While these changes have modernized the nation, they have been accompanied by tight control over dissent.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $950 million, making it the sixth-largest prize in the game's history after 39 consecutive drawings without a winner. The odds of matching all six numbers to claim the jackpot are approximately 1 in 292.2 million. Winners can choose between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option, which is valued at just under half the advertised prize. All winnings are subject to a 24% federal tax withholding, and winners will likely face a total federal tax rate of 37%, in addition to state taxes where applicable.</p>

          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review has identified Princeton University as the private college delivering the best return on investment (ROI) in the United States. While the university's tuition is over $65,000, the average annual cost for students receiving financial aid is just $10,555. Graduates go on to earn a median income of over $110,000 a decade after attending. The list, which also includes Caltech and MIT, highlights how generous financial aid policies at well-endowed private institutions can lead to better financial outcomes for graduates compared to even the top-performing public colleges.

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist firm, has announced a significant investment in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT focused on the Southern California market. Rexford's stock has underperformed recently, trading at a discount to its net asset value despite holding a prime portfolio. This decline is attributed to concerns over corporate governance, including a board structure seen as management-friendly and high executive compensation. Elliott is expected to push for changes to improve governance and capital allocation, potentially making Rexford an attractive acquisition target for strategic investors or private equity.

          <p>Coldplay has announced the rescheduling of two of its ten sold-out shows at London's Wembley Stadium due to a planned strike on the London Underground. The band stated that without Tube services, it would be "impossible" to transport 82,000 fans, and thus no event license could be granted for the nights of September 7th and 8th. The affected shows have been moved to September 6th and 12th, respectively.

          <p>A North Carolina pastor, Kelvis Reid, is recovering after a harrowing medical journey involving a rare and life-threatening condition called AL amyloidosis. The disease caused abnormal proteins to build up on his organs, making his heart as "hard as cement" and leading to a major cardiac arrest. After his family's CPR training saved his life, he spent weeks on life support before becoming stable enough for a dual heart and kidney transplant. Eighteen months later, Reid has made a remarkable recovery, returning to his pulpit and even participating in a 5K run at the hospital where he was treated.</p>

          <p>The Indian restaurant scene in the U.S. is undergoing a significant transformation, moving beyond takeout and buffets to embrace upscale and fine-dining experiences. Restaurateurs like Vikas Khanna, whose New York establishments Junoon and Bungalow have seen massive success, are leading a trend toward more sophisticated and regionally specific Indian cuisine. This growth is fueled by younger consumers' interest in global flavors, a rising and affluent Indian American population, and increasing investor attention. Market data shows a steady increase in new and upscale Indian restaurant openings, indicating a sustained shift in the American culinary landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's executive order directing federal officials to prosecute flag-burners is likely to be legally ineffective and may even backfire, according to this legal analysis. The Supreme Court has twice ruled, in cases from 1989 and 1990, that flag-burning is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment. The article argues that attempting to use content-neutral laws, such as public burning prohibitions, to target flag-burners for their message would open the door to a "selective prosecution" defense. The author concludes that the order is an empty threat that will not expand the government's power to punish the act.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, 58, announced that he has undergone treatment to remove basal cell carcinoma, a common type of non-melanoma skin cancer. In an Instagram post, Ramsay shared a photo of his face post-treatment and expressed gratitude to his medical team for their quick work. He used the announcement as a public service message, strongly urging his followers to use sunscreen, especially over the weekend. Basal cell carcinoma is primarily caused by ultraviolet light exposure and is often easily treated, with the main symptom being an unusual growth or patch on sun-exposed skin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that while some recent, small-scale studies on guaranteed income have shown lackluster results on secondary metrics like health and employment, cash transfers remain a proven and effective anti-poverty tool. The author points to decades of research showing that programs like Social Security and tax credits lift millions out of poverty annually. The recent pilot programs' limited impact can be attributed to their small scale and the context of a broader cost-of-living crisis, where a few hundred dollars cannot overcome systemic issues like unaffordable housing and childcare. The core function of giving people money—reducing poverty—remains successful.</p>
