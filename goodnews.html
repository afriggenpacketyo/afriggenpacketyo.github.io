          <p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg won the Democratic primary, defeating his moderate challenger Patrick Timmins. Bragg, known for his legal battles with President Donald Trump, secured over 70% of the vote. Prior to his re-election, Bragg's office had convicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records, related to a payment made to Stormy Daniels. Bragg's office had requested a stay in the case until 2029, but Merchan ultimately sentenced Trump to an unconditional discharge, preserving his ability to appeal the conviction. The election results reflect the political landscape in Manhattan and Bragg's continued support.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are currently stuck in a holding pattern, showing little movement despite economic uncertainty and international conflicts. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages slightly increased to 6.88%, while applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 0.4%. Purchase demand remains historically low, though it is 11% higher than the same week last year. The market shows signs of stability amidst ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, which is offering little incentive to potential homebuyers facing high home prices and limited supply.</p>
