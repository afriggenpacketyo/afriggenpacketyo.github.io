        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at many major U.S. airports. A memo sent to TSA officers indicates the change will be rolled out nationwide, allowing travelers in general security lines to keep their footwear on, a privilege previously reserved for PreCheck members. The policy was first implemented in 2006, five years after Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his shoes on a flight. Passengers who trigger screening alarms will still be required to remove their shoes for inspection.</p>

          <h2>New Gene Therapy Injection Shows Promise in Reversing Congenital Hearing Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:49:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A breakthrough gene therapy has shown the potential to reverse a form of congenital deafness with a single injection, according to new research. In a clinical trial, a healthy copy of the OTOF gene was delivered to the inner ear, significantly improving the hearing of all 10 participants, who had hearing loss due to a protein deficiency. The effects were most pronounced in children, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing within a month. Researchers are optimistic that this safe and well-tolerated method could pave the way for treating other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the nation defend itself against Russian aggression. The decision follows a temporary halt in some weapon shipments, which the White House had attributed to a broader review of military stockpiles. The Pentagon confirmed the move, emphasizing its commitment to ensuring Ukraine's defense while pursuing a lasting peace. This development came after President Trump spoke with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, expressing disappointment with the lack of progress in his conversation with Putin.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Gains Popularity Among Chinese Students as an Alternative to the U.S.</h2>

          <p>Singapore is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, emerging as a strong alternative to the United States. Factors such as cultural similarities, safety concerns, and a welcoming environment are driving this shift. One student cited difficulties adjusting to American culture and her parents' worries as reasons for applying to Singaporean universities instead. While the U.S. has long been the top choice, industry insiders predict a rise in applications to Singaporean institutions due to the growing instability and uncertainty perceived in the American academic and social landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict landlords from evicting tenants for the purpose of substantial remodels, a practice known as "renoviction." An approved amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance will only permit such evictions if a government agency issues an order to vacate due to housing code violations. The city is also developing rules that would require landlords to provide and pay for comparable temporary housing for displaced tenants during legitimate renovations. This measure aims to protect renters from being displaced so landlords can charge higher rents to new tenants.</p>

          <p>A family from South Africa was rescued after their GPS navigation system directed them onto a flooded road over the Haw River in North Carolina. As Tropical Storm Chantal caused widespread flooding, their two cars stalled on a bridge submerged in rising water. A local man, Bryan Roney, who was also taking a detour, saw their predicament and acted quickly, using a log chain to help the family of four and another man with his daughter wade to safety. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of relying on GPS during severe weather events.</p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa in an effort to revive its tourism sector. The move has already led to a noticeable increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a surge in bookings, particularly from European countries. This policy aims to simplify travel, boost the economy, and enhance China's soft power after a slow recovery from strict COVID-19 restrictions. While many European, Asian, and Latin American nations are included, no major African country is yet eligible.</p>

          <p>Caltech has announced it will terminate its partnership with the e-learning company Simplilearn after a class-action lawsuit alleged the firm and university misrepresented a cybersecurity boot camp. The lawsuit, filed by a former student, claimed the program was part of Caltech "in name only," using instructors with minimal qualifications and misleading students about its connection to the prestigious university. As part of a settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to new transparency measures and will provide tuition refunds to over 260 people, totaling more than $2.4 million.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its plan for a large-scale reduction-in-force that was scheduled for August. The VA stated that it is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through a hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition, eliminating the need for mass layoffs. The department had initially considered cutting up to 15% of its workforce to return to 2019 staffing levels. Secretary Doug Collins confirmed a department-wide RIF is now "off the table," though some lawmakers expressed concern over the high rate of attrition.</p>

Kershaw, who expressed surprise at the selection, acknowledged that he likely wouldn't have been chosen based on his performance this season alone, having made just nine starts after returning from surgery. This will be his 11th career All-Star selection, tying him for the most among active players. He expressed gratitude for the honor and said he will enjoy the experience, whether he pitches in the game or not.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a $2.2 billion plan to purchase an additional 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, citing their vulnerability in modern warfare. The decision was influenced by observations from the conflict in Ukraine, where helicopters have been susceptible to advanced air defenses, drones, and loitering munitions. Instead of investing in what are seen as increasingly risky legacy platforms, officials stated that the funds will be redirected toward developing drones and other smart systems. This move reflects a broader reevaluation of the attack helicopter's role on a battlefield dominated by new, asymmetric threats.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not prosecute individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, despite the event being officially banned by the government. The decision came amid fears of fines and potential prison time for organizers, including Budapest's liberal mayor, Gergely Karacsony, who had declared the march an official municipal event. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status as the reason for not pursuing charges. The parade attracted a record crowd of over 200,000, defying the government's anti-LGBTQ+ policies.</p>
