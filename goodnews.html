          <p>Family offices, experiencing rapid growth due to the ultra-rich seeking personalized wealth management, are struggling to find qualified money managers, facing a talent crunch intensified by trust issues and competition from banks and private equity firms. According to Deloitte, there were 8,030 family offices globally managing $3.1 trillion in assets as of last September, and this number is expected to grow significantly by 2030. Family offices often prioritize trust over qualifications, seeking individuals with lifelong relationships with the family, and are willing to pay a premium for trusted advisors. Young employees are also reluctant to work at family offices due to unclear corporate structures and the perception of it being a 'retirement job'. (not investment advice)</p>

While some professors argue A.I. tools save time and enhance their teaching, students feel they are paying for human instruction, not algorithmic content.
