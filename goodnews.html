          <p>TalkTV host David Bull has been named the new chairman of Reform UK, succeeding Zia Yusuf, who resigned after disagreements over a burka ban. Bull, a longtime ally of Nigel Farage, will focus on providing leadership to activists, while Yusuf will lead the "Doge team" to cut wasteful spending. Farage emphasized that Bull's role is to inspire the party's base and not to get involved in administrative tasks. Bull expressed his honor at being appointed and praised Yusuf's work in professionalizing the party, and has stepped down from his TalkTV role to assume his new position, highlighting his commitment to Reform UK. The appointment signifies a shift towards a more media-focused leadership style within the party.</p>

These four companies have a combined value exceeding $45 billion and have raised nearly $10 billion from investors, demonstrating significant growth and diversification within the industry. The surge in funding is partly attributed to proposed increases in defense spending and a focus on modernizing military capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband defended the Chancellor's initial decision to cut winter fuel payments and the subsequent partial reversal. He argued that the original cuts were necessary to stabilize the economy, creating room for extending the payment to more pensioners this winter. The revised policy will provide payments to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less. Conservatives criticized the move, questioning how the U-turn would be funded, while analysts debated the policy's effectiveness in addressing poverty.</p>

The ruling coalition aims to secure a majority in the upper house and is considering using fiscal 2024 tax revenue to fund the program. However, the plan may face criticism for appearing to be a pre-election boost to public support.</p>
