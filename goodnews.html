          <h2>My Take: Dan Wang Observes the Grandeur and Tragedy of the Chinese ‚ÄòEngineering State‚Äô</h2>

          <p>Dan Wang refers to China as the ‚Äúengineering state,‚Äù noting its rapid development of infrastructure and technology. China's integrated transport, from subways to high-speed rail, seems like science fiction. China‚Äôs STEM graduates outnumber those of the US by more than eight to one, and most of the nation‚Äôs top officials are engineers. Wang contrasts this with the US, which he calls the ‚Äúlawyerly state.‚Äù The summary is proportional with the reality of the situation.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs May Have Been Domesticated in China as Early as Neolithic Period</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, according to archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The study found that pigs were eating humans‚Äô cooked foods and waste, suggesting the domestication process occurred alongside rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The summary is proportional with the reality of the situation.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed carded an albatross, or double-eagle, on the par-5 fourth hole during the first round of the US Open, marking only the fourth albatross in the tournament's history.

          <h2>Chinese Solar Firms Look to Overseas Expansion to Offset US Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are increasingly focusing on overseas expansion to ensure survival amid ongoing trade tariffs, with production abroad seen as key to their long-term viability. Despite a temporary truce in the US-China tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to tariffs. Chinese firms are diversifying their production base, with planned expansions primarily in the Middle East and Africa, followed by the US and Europe. Some executives express concerns that exports could become impossible if tariffs rise significantly. The summary is proportional with the reality of the situation.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies will continue to press ahead with their overseas expansion with or without a long-term agreement on trade tariffs, as production abroad holds the key to their long-term survival, according to executives at China‚Äôs largest solar industry exhibition. Although the US and China reached a 90-day truce in their ongoing tariff war in May, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US are still subject to tariffs of as much as 3,521 per cent, with Washington citing unfair trade practices such as subsidies and dumping for the high levies.
