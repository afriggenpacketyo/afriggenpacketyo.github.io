          <p>German startup DeepL is now utilizing Nvidia's latest chips to drastically reduce the time required to translate the entire internet, decreasing it from 194 days to just 18 days. DeepL, which develops its own AI models, competes with services like Google Translate. The deployment of Nvidia's DGX SuperPOD system, containing 36 B200 Grace Blackwell Superchips per server rack, will provide significantly more computational power for DeepL's research scientists. This infrastructure upgrade aims to enhance products like Clarify, a tool that ensures context is incorporated into translations, pushing the boundaries of what's technically feasible in AI-driven language processing.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a resurgence in 2025 after a slowdown the previous year, with registrations of electrified vehicles increasing by 20% from January to April. This recovery is partly driven by an EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions, incentivizing corporate sales through attractive leasing deals and new EV models. However, consumer skepticism remains, with interest in EVs stagnant and hybrids favored due to charging concerns, and Tesla's sales have declined amidst controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk. Despite these challenges, Chinese automakers are gaining ground in the European market, underscoring the evolving dynamics of the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>Mortgage application volume experienced a significant increase, rising 12.5% last week to reach the highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This surge occurred despite minimal movement in mortgage interest rates, with the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increasing slightly to 6.93%. Applications to refinance and purchase homes also rose, driven by increased available listings and easing home prices. While economic uncertainty persists, homebuyers appear to be capitalizing on the loosening housing inventory in certain markets, suggesting a positive trend in the housing sector.</p>

          <h2>Seattle Balances Tree Preservation and Housing Density for Climate Solution</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seattle is addressing the tension between the need for more housing and the importance of preserving trees as a climate solution. A new state law requires increased housing density, but the city is finding ways to build with trees, such as the Bryant Heights development, which saved over 30 trees. The City Council has updated its tree protection ordinance to balance housing and tree preservation, but recent assessments show a shrinking urban canopy. Seattle is also working on planting more trees and ensuring their care to reach 30% canopy coverage by 2037.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are saving on insurance by upgrading their houses against disasters, as states develop discount programs modeled after Alabama's FORTIFIED Roof standard. These programs incentivize homeowners to use stronger building materials that can better withstand storms and wildfires, addressing the rising cost of extreme weather disasters. While Alabama sees significant discounts, California's are smaller, and losing insurance altogether remains a concern. Experts emphasize the importance of communities retrofitting homes and insurance companies accounting for these improvements when offering coverage.</p>

          <p>A fire demonstration in Anaheim showcased the effectiveness of wildfire defense strategies, pitting two tiny homes against a fire to illustrate the difference between unprotected and fire-prepared structures. The unprotected home was quickly engulfed in flames, while the fire-prepared home, featuring cement pavers, gravel, and no bushes against the house, remained unscathed. The demonstration emphasized the importance of Zone 0, the first five feet of defensible space surrounding a structure, as well as fire-resistant materials and enclosed eaves, offering valuable insights for communities rebuilding after wildfires.</p>
