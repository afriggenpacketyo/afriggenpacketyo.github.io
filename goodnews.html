          <p>The Trump Organization has announced the launch of Trump Mobile, a new mobile phone plan and a $499 smartphone set to debut in September. The $47.45-per-month plan includes unlimited talk, text, and data, along with roadside assistance and telehealth benefits. The company will also sell a "T1" smartphone featuring a gold-colored metal case etched with an American flag. The new venture is the latest example of Trump's business empire capitalizing on its association with the sitting president, with references to his presidency and campaign slogans appearing on the website and phone design. The Trump Organization's foray into telecommunications is primarily a licensing agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Express and JPMorgan Chase are poised to intensify their rivalry in the premium credit card market with upcoming updates to their Platinum and Sapphire Reserve cards, respectively. JPMorgan Chase announced an imminent refresh of its Sapphire Reserve card, while American Express has teased "major" changes to its consumer and business Platinum cards later this year. Both companies are expected to enhance their travel, dining, and experience perks while potentially raising annual fees, continuing a trend seen in recent card updates. The competition reflects the ongoing battle for affluent customers and their spending, as card issuers seek to provide ever-greater value and incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Lenders Offer Mortgage Rate Scenarios for the Summer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 10:04:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that mortgage rates are unlikely to experience significant fluctuations this summer, remaining stable in the high 6% range unless economic conditions shift dramatically. Three potential scenarios were outlined: rates could remain consistent if economic conditions hold steady, rise if inflation increases or the economy grows too rapidly, or decline if the economy shows signs of cooling. Experts advise prospective homebuyers to focus on controllable variables like rate buydowns and loan programs, rather than attempting to time the market. It's also important to remember that while rates might drop, home prices likely won't, so if a home fits your budget and needs, consult a lender to lock in a rate soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida's efforts to control its invasive Burmese python population have resulted in the removal of 20 tons of pythons from the Everglades over the past decade. Biologists are focusing on removing female pythons during the breeding season, using tagged male "scout" snakes to locate them. While the total python population remains unknown, experts believe that the removal efforts are helping to reduce their impact on native mammal populations. The success of the program relies on a combination of scientific methods, public engagement, and collaboration between various organizations.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp is introducing three new ad features in a global rollout, aiming to monetize the platform while keeping personal chats private. The new ads will appear in the Updates section, separate from private chats, and will be driven by user's country, city, language, and interactions with other ads. Users who have linked their WhatsApp account to Facebook or Instagram will see more personalized ads. The move is seen as a way for Meta to finally monetize WhatsApp at scale, but some experts warn that it could spark backlash if the app becomes too noisy or "Facebook-ified."</p>
