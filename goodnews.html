          <p>President Trump announced he will sign an executive order to lower medication costs by tying Medicare prices for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries, an effort to revive a program previously blocked by courts. The "most favored nation" policy aims to ensure the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest drug costs globally, with Trump boasting potential savings of trillions of dollars, although the actual figure is unclear. The proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that lower prices will hurt profits and innovation. The Biden administration abandoned a similar proposal in 2022 due to court orders and stakeholder concerns, while Trump accuses pharmaceutical companies of exploiting Americans with high drug prices.</p>

          <p>Stocks in Asia rose following trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, signaling progress in easing trade tensions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cited "substantial progress," with details expected to be released soon, raising investor hopes for lowered tariffs. The meetings are the first since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting retaliatory taxes from China. Economists have warned that the escalating trade war could lead to an economic downturn, including in Asia, where economies rely heavily on both countries as trade partners. Analysts anticipate an initial agreement involving a "much lower level" for tariffs, and economists have warned that the continuing division of the global economy into ‚Äúrival blocs‚Äù could cut global gross domestic product by nearly 7 percent over the long run.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily banning imports of cattle, horses, and bison through southern border ports due to the northward spread of New World Screwworm (NWS) in Mexico. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the suspension, emphasizing the need to protect the U.S. livestock industry from the devastating pest, which can cause serious and deadly damage to animals. The U.S. and Mexico are collaborating to eradicate NWS, employing field surveillance, animal movement control, and sterile insect dispersal.

          <p>Chinese economist Yao Yang discusses the ongoing trade war between the US and China, noting a growing recognition in the US that the trade war is unsustainable. Yao suggests that extreme tariffs are essentially a form of embargo, leading to weak economic data and instability. He believes the likelihood of a deal is high, with a rollback to the original 34% tariff level being possible. Yao also mentions that the US might demand China buy more American goods, including farm products, energy, and Boeing planes.</p>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, praised for its affordability and support for a long-lived population, is under strain due to a shrinking workforce and aging population. The system's future is now entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections, raising concerns about its stability and public trust. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government is seeking funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, but plans to increase the burden on high medical cost patients have faced backlash. Analysts emphasize the need for a measured, long-term debate rather than rushed reforms driven by electoral pressures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has halted cattle imports from Mexico due to concerns over the northward spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized the importance of protecting the nation's food supply and animal safety, stating that the move is not about politics but about safety. New World screwworms are fly larvae that burrow into the flesh of living animals, causing severe damage and potential death if untreated.

Sales of these items are rising, but experts question whether they are truly useful or just a marketing gimmick. Personal trainer Ethan Smith emphasizes whole foods, while Dr. Paul Morgan warns that many protein-advertised products are ultra-processed. Ultra-processed foods have come under scrutiny recently with one study published last month linking them to early death. Extra protein consumption is necessary for people who want to develop muscle by lifting weights.</p>
