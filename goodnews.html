          <p>Kris Jenner's recent youthful appearance has sparked speculation about a possible deep plane facelift, with experts weighing in on the procedures involved. While Jenner's representative confirmed that Dr. Steven Levine performed the work, the specific procedure was not disclosed. Plastic surgeons suggest that Jenner's face appears "youthful and natural" due to a well-performed procedure that likely involved lifting and tightening the deeper tissues. The article details the differences between traditional and deep plane facelifts, highlighting the risks and recovery times associated with each technique, and stressing the importance of choosing a board-certified surgeon and discussing medical history and aesthetic goals before undergoing surgery.</p>

          <p>Prince William celebrated his 43rd birthday with a photo posted on social media by Kensington Palace, featuring him with the family's Cocker spaniel, Orla, and three of her recently-arrived puppies. The picture, taken by the Princess of Wales, shows a relaxed Prince William in jeans and trainers, surrounded by the puppies. The Royal Family's official account also shared a message with a photo of the prince visiting farmers on the Duchy of Cornwall. Orla was given to the royal couple by Catherine's brother in 2020 after the death of their previous dog, and the puppies were born in May.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactive in building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth elements, after experiencing an export ban from China in 2010. The country has invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects, notably Australia's Lynas, reducing its overall dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60% from over 90%. China's recent export curbs on rare earth elements have impacted Western auto industry groups, with Suzuki Motor suspending production of its Swift car model. Japan's approach serves as a template for Western nations, though it highlights the difficulty of escaping China's critical mineral orbit, requiring a government and industry approach to tackle China's mineral dominance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the nature of feminist critique of female celebrities, questioning whether it has devolved into mere snide remarks and policing of women's choices. Recent criticism of figures like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae is examined in the context of historical feminist debates and the influence of social media algorithms. The author argues that meaningful critique should consider economic forces and avoid paternalistic tellings off, suggesting that the current discourse often packs women into smaller boxes under the guise of concern for their safety. Instead, the author calls for a return to complex arguments about desire, domination, and the realities of capitalism.</p>

The initiative builds on previous work by the NHS to track the entire genetic code of up to 100,000 newborn babies, and will support efforts by Genomics England to build one of the world's largest research databases.</p>
