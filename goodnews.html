          <p>A late-stage clinical trial showed that Eli Lilly's popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, offers significant heart health benefits, comparing favorably to its older drug, Trulicity. The study found Mounjaro reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events and also showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause. While the results were largely expected by clinicians, the data provides a stronger case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients with cardiovascular disease. The company plans to submit the data to regulators, which could lead to expanded insurance coverage for the drug in 2026.</p>

The company raised its adjusted profit outlook for fiscal 2025, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy division and improvements within its Aetna insurance unit. CEO David Joyner attributed the success to ongoing recovery efforts at Aetna, which has been managing higher medical costs, and operational efficiencies in its pharmacies.

          <p>This opinion piece urges California officials to accelerate the development of renewable energy projects to capitalize on federal tax credits before they expire. The author notes that the Trump administration's repeal of incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act puts a 2027 deadline on these affordable energy sources. The article suggests innovative approaches like "surplus interconnection"—building solar and wind projects at existing gas plant sites to use their grid connections. The author calls on the governor, state legislature, and regulatory bodies to streamline planning and procurement to save consumers money and meet clean energy goals.</p>

          <h2>Experts Express Skepticism Over "Japanese Walking" Fitness Trend</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 06:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>A viral fitness trend known as "Japanese walking," which promises the benefits of a 10,000-step walk in just 30 minutes, is gaining popularity on social media but drawing skepticism from health experts. The routine involves alternating between three minutes of fast walking and three minutes of slow walking, based on a small 2007 Japanese study. While experts agree that any form of activity, especially vigorous intervals, is beneficial, they caution that the study has design flaws and is not robust enough to support the trend's sweeping claims. They also note that the catchy, low-barrier trend reflects a broader social desire for accessible health solutions.</p>

          <h2>Review: Liam Neeson Shines in "The Naked Gun" Reboot</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review praises the new "The Naked Gun" film as a successful reboot and a great career move for star Liam Neeson, who plays the son of Leslie Nielsen's original character. The film, directed by Akiva Schaffer, successfully emulates the ZAZ-style comedy of the original, with Neeson perfectly cast in the deadpan leading role. The review highlights that the sequel updates the humor for a modern audience, avoiding punching down while still delivering clever visual gags and wordplay. Pamela Anderson also co-stars in a film that is described as a hilarious and worthy successor to the beloved franchise.</p>

          <h2>UK New Home Completions Fall, but Building Applications Rise</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 05:51:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of new homes completed in England fell by 8% in the first year of the Labour government, continuing a downward trend. However, data also shows a significant 49% increase in planning applications for new homes outside London in the first half of 2025. This suggests a potential future rebound in construction, although experts warn it could take years for these applications to become completed homes. The government maintains it will meet its target of building 1.5 million homes within the current parliamentary term to address the nation's "acute and entrenched housing crisis."

          <p>Ukraine is employing a novel strategy to protect its newly acquired F-16 fighter jets by using mobile, truck-mounted complexes for mission planning, maintenance, and munitions. This allows the jets to operate from dispersed and non-traditional locations, avoiding fixed airbases that are priority targets for Russian strikes. This tactic of dispersal has been crucial for the survival of Ukraine's air force throughout the war. Military analysts note that this innovative approach is a key lesson for Western air forces, which are increasingly focused on agile combat employment to counter threats from peer adversaries.</p>
