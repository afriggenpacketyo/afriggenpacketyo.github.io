        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is establishing an independent customs regime in Hainan province by year-end, transforming it into a free-trade port with significantly lower tariffs on 6,600 types of goods. This move, part of Beijing's "dual circulation" strategy, aims to boost domestic consumption and attract businesses with competitive tax regimes and relaxed visa rules. The expanded tariff-free access, covering 74% of taxable imports, could also serve as a buffer in the ongoing trade war with the United States.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 04:39:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major German carmakers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, rallied after the U.S. and Japan struck a trade agreement that lowered auto tariffs to 15%. This deal has ignited hopes for a similar tariff breakthrough for European auto exporters, which have long sought to reduce U.S. levies. Experts suggest the Japan deal's terms, particularly the absence of export caps, could influence ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and the EU, where President Trump has threatened 30% tariffs if no agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>Following a "massive" trade agreement with Japan, President Trump has turned his attention to trade negotiations with the European Union, with a looming August 1 deadline for potential 30% tariffs on EU imports. The U.S.-Japan deal, which reduced auto tariffs to 15% without export caps, has fostered optimism among economists that a similar agreement could be reached with the EU. This comes as EU leaders travel to Asia for their own trade discussions with Japan and China, highlighting the complex global trade landscape.</p>

          <p>New DNA analysis of 9,000-year-old skeletons from Catalhoyuk, a Neolithic settlement in Turkey, suggests a society centered around women. Researchers found that people buried under the same houses were often related through their mothers, indicating a matrilocal system where men joined the woman's family. The discovery, aided by advanced DNA extraction from inner ear bones, also revealed that female burials contained up to five times more grave goods than male ones. This challenges previous assumptions and suggests a society that valued equality, even potentially practicing child-swapping for resource distribution.</p>

          <p>The 2025-26 English domestic rugby union season, rebranded as 'Prem', will make history by beginning with a Thursday night match between Sale Sharks and Gloucester. This marks a shift from the traditional weekend opener, aiming for a more informal feel and to attract younger fans. The season will feature 18 rounds, concluding in early June 2026, with the final title decider later that month. This move aligns with a similar change for the men's Six Nations, indicating a broader trend towards midweek fixtures in rugby.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan (2026-2030), economists emphasize the need for long-term structural changes beyond short-term stimulus, particularly focusing on boosting "total factor productivity." Experts argue that institutional reform, rather than just technological innovation, is crucial for sustainable growth, especially given the Communist Party's influence on the economy. Signals from high-level meetings suggest a shift in official performance evaluations to include debt levels, potentially leading local authorities to prioritize consumption over investment and address overcapacity issues.

Despite strong GDP growth in the first half of the year, the MAS anticipates "subdued" domestic growth in the latter half, with global consumption softening and tariffs impacting exports.
