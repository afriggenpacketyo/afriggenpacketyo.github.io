          <p>Everton manager David Moyes hails Jack Grealish's Premier League Player of the Month award for August as merely the beginning of his impact at the club. Grealish, who recently turned 30, joined Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City and has already recorded four assists in two league starts, surpassing other players this season. This marks his first time winning the accolade, making him the first Everton player to do so since September 2020. Moyes emphasizes Grealish's hard work and renewed mindset, believing his performances are a strong bid for a return to the England team ahead of next summer's World Cup.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth studio album, "Play," marks a significant shift from his previous work, "Subtract," which chronicled personal hardships. The 33-year-old singer-songwriter intentionally created an album that embraces happiness and pure artistic expression, writing hundreds of songs and prioritizing experimentation over commercial appeal. Sheeran aims for listeners to connect with the music, but primarily created the record for his own well-being. His promotional strategy, featuring surprise pop-up performances globally, reflects the album's adventurous spirit, signaling a settled and balanced chapter in his life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The mockumentary "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" reunites the fictional heavy metal band after four decades, coinciding with Black Sabbath's final show and Ozzy Osbourne's death, ironically synchronizing with real-world metal events. Directed by Rob Reiner, the sequel sees the band members, now in mundane pursuits, brought back for a final concert after an accidental viral clip. The article explores the original film's impact on rock-and-roll self-awareness and questions the necessity of a sequel, ultimately finding humor in the band's continued irrelevance and the genre's perceived exhaustion. The film features cameos from real-life rock icons, contributing to its "End Times in-joke" atmosphere.</p>

          <p>David Ellison, the new CEO and chairman of the merged Paramount-Skydance, has swiftly implemented his vision, focusing on "high-quality storytelling and cutting-edge technology." Within weeks, he secured a seven-year, $7.7 billion deal for exclusive U.S. rights to UFC mixed martial arts, shifting events to Paramount+ and CBS. Ellison also acquired rights for a "Call of Duty" film, aiming to capitalize on successful video game adaptations, and brought in "Stranger Things" creators Matt and Ross Duffer for a multi-year deal. These aggressive moves, alongside a potential bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, signal a long-term strategy to rebuild and expand Paramount's content and technological footprint, despite expected short-term financial pressures and significant layoffs.

He suggests the need to "look at the schedule," including reducing T20 Blast and Championship cricket games, to ensure player welfare. While new investments in The Hundred competition are positive, Thompson notes that scheduling flexibility won't be possible until the next TV rights cycle in 2028.</p>

          <p>As the US Social Security trust fund faces depletion in eight years, necessitating reforms to avoid a 23% benefit cut, experts are debating solutions. Raising the retirement age, a common bipartisan proposal, is highlighted as a regressive cut, disproportionately affecting poorer workers due to widening life expectancy gaps between income brackets. A plan from Brookings economists Wendell Primus, Tara Watson, and Jack Smalligan suggests a progressive approach: raising the retirement age only for the top 40% of earners, while keeping it stable for others. This complex but equitable solution, combined with other progressive benefit cuts and tax hikes, aims to ensure the program's solvency without harming vulnerable populations.
