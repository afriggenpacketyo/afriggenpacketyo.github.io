          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to nominate Stephen Miran, a White House economist, for a temporary seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. The appointment aims to fill a vacancy left by Adriana Kugler, who is departing six months early. Miran, who currently chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, previously served in the Treasury Department during Trump's first term. This move represents Trump's first opportunity to influence the Fed's board since his return to office, amidst his public criticism of the central bank's interest rate policies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Supreme Court has unanimously sided with environmental groups, ruling that a state commission's decision to reduce rooftop solar incentives can be legally challenged. The case will now return to an appeals court for further review. The dispute centers on a 2022 decision by the Public Utilities Commission that significantly cut the value of credits for homeowners who send excess solar power to the grid. While the commission argued the cuts were necessary to prevent cost shifts to non-solar customers, environmental groups contend the move violates state law and hinders California's clean energy goals.</p>

The acquisition aims to integrate Pathway's robust structured dataset into Doximity's platform, which already offers AI tools for administrative tasks. This move is part of Doximity's strategy to become an essential resource for doctors seeking quick, AI-powered clinical answers.</p>

          <h2>'Freakier Friday' Sequel Reunites Lohan and Curtis in a Fun but Flawed Comedy</h2>

          <p>The new film "Freakier Friday" brings back Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis for a sequel to their beloved 2003 body-swap comedy. This time, a four-way switch occurs involving Anna (Lohan), her mother Tess (Curtis), Anna's teenage daughter Harper, and her potential step-sister Lily. The review suggests that while the chemistry between Lohan and Curtis remains a major highlight, the plot feels rushed and less emotionally insightful than its predecessor. Despite a thinly sketched central conflict, the movie succeeds as a nostalgic reunion filled with enjoyable hijinks and strong comedic performances.</p>

          <p>Despite significant spending on its forward line, including a reported £74m deal for striker Benjamin Sesko, Manchester United still faces a critical gap in its central midfield. The article analyzes the current squad, noting that key players like Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo are more offensively oriented, while others like Manuel Ugarte have yet to prove their defensive reliability. This has reportedly led the club to inquire about Brighton's Carlos Baleba, a box-to-box midfielder who fits the profile needed for head coach Ruben Amorim's system, though a high transfer fee presents a significant obstacle.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing all further construction at the controversial immigrant detention center in Florida known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling, which lasts for 14 days, came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued that the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. While the center can continue to house detainees, the order prevents any new construction while the court considers a more permanent injunction. The facility has been criticized for operating in a jurisdictional gray area.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a money market account would earn more interest on a $20,000 deposit in the current economic climate. While a money market account may currently offer a slightly higher interest rate, its rate is variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. In contrast, a CD's rate is fixed, guaranteeing the return over its term. The analysis concludes that while a money market account might technically earn a few more dollars, a CD offers predictability and is more likely to achieve a guaranteed interest goal.

          <p>This market analysis suggests that a recent plunge in cybersecurity stocks, triggered by a disappointing forecast from Fortinet, presents a buying opportunity for other companies in the sector. Fortinet's stock fell 25% after it revealed its firewall refresh cycle was further along than expected, dragging down peers like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks. The author argues this sell-off is an overreaction, as companies like CrowdStrike have different business models and are not reliant on the same hardware cycles. The dip is seen as a chance to invest in strong companies at a lower price. (not investment advice)</p>
