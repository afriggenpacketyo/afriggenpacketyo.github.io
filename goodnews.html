          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples therapy highlights the damaging effect of using comparative phrases like, "Why can't you be more like [someone else]?" This seemingly innocuous statement can erode a partner's self-worth and create insecurity, as it implies they are inadequate. The article emphasizes that such phrases are often symptoms of deeper issues, such as a fear of openly communicating needs and frustrations. Instead of resorting to comparisons, the article advises partners to express their needs directly and clearly to foster a more secure and emotionally intimate connection. Optimism score: 75</p>
