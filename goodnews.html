          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 02:46:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament has passed a bill allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to end their lives, marking a significant social shift. This decision follows years of debate and previous rejections of similar legislation, with proponents comparing it to landmark changes like the Abortion Act of 1967. While the bill now moves to the House of Lords for further scrutiny, supporters are optimistic about its eventual passage into law, although opponents are expected to continue to challenge the practicalities and terminology surrounding assisted dying. The vote reflects a changing composition of Parliament and consistent public support for such a change in the law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several towns and cities in eastern Germany are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation, which has been accelerated by declining birth rates and emigration to western states. The "trial living" scheme in Guben, for example, provides people with the chance to live in the city for up to four weeks without charge. This initiative aims to showcase the benefits of living in smaller cities, such as affordable housing, less traffic, and a stronger sense of community, while also addressing the challenge of an aging population and labor market demand. While some areas struggle with a far-right image, efforts are underway to promote a welcoming culture and encourage social integration.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has approved legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The proposal now heads to Governor Dan McKee, who supports assault weapons bans. If signed into law, Rhode Island will join 10 states with similar prohibitions. Critics argue that the ban does little to curb mass shootings and only punishes law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates describe the proposed ban as the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country."</p>
