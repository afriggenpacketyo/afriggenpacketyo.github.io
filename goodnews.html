          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time during Friday's practice sessions for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The British driver finished ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, signaling strong potential for his home race. Norris's teammate, Oscar Piastri, finished fourth, while championship leader Max Verstappen of Red Bull placed fifth, reportedly struggling with his car's front grip. The practice results set an intriguing stage for the upcoming qualifying and main race events over the weekend.</p>

          <p>On the Fourth of July, essential services like banks, the U.S. Postal Service, and the stock market are closed in observance of the Independence Day holiday. However, many retail and grocery stores, including Walmart and most major supermarket chains, will remain open, though some may operate on modified schedules. Trader Joe's, for example, will close early at 5 p.m., while Costco will be closed for the entire day. Numerous fast-food chains and restaurants like Starbucks and McDonald's are also expected to be open, but customers are advised to check local hours.</p>

          <p>In a Fourth of July social media post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated he feels "politically homeless," criticizing the Democratic party for moving away from a culture that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship. Altman, who describes his ideology as "techno-capitalism," argued for a system that allows for massive wealth creation while also ensuring wide distribution of its benefits. He expressed a preference for candidates focused on raising everyone's standard of living rather than on eliminating billionaires, a comment seen as a response to a progressive New York City mayoral candidate.</p>

          <p>Famed competitive eater Joey "Jaws" Chestnut is set to make his return to the Nathan's Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, seeking his 17th victory. Chestnut was absent from last year's event due to a contract dispute after he signed a deal with a competing plant-based food brand, but the issue has since been resolved. He will face defending champion Patrick Bertoletti. In the women's event, Miki Sudo secured her 11th title by consuming 33 hot dogs and buns, falling short of her previous record.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton advanced to the third round of Wimbledon after a bizarrely brief conclusion to his match against Rinky Hijikata. The match was controversially suspended the previous night due to fading light, with Shelton just one game away from victory. Returning to the court on Friday, Shelton needed only 70 seconds to serve out the match, firing three aces and an unreturnable serve to win 6-2, 7-5, 6-4. Shelton later found the humor in the situation, noting he had told the umpire he only needed 60 seconds to finish.</p>

          <h2>Pop Mart's Success Expected to Continue Despite Chinese State Media Criticism of "Blind Box" Toys</h2>

          <p>Analysts predict that Pop Mart, the company behind the popular Labubu "blind box" toys, will remain a top consumer brand in China despite recent criticism from state media. An editorial warned against the addictive nature of mystery box toys for children, causing a temporary dip in the company's stock. However, experts believe Pop Mart is insulated from major regulatory impact because its primary demographic is young adults, not minors. The company's significant and rapidly growing overseas sales, which are projected to soon account for over half its revenue, further cushion it from domestic policy shifts.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that "discussions are ongoing" to create a new left-wing political party in the United Kingdom. His statement came after former Labour MP Zarah Sultana announced she was quitting the party to co-found the new venture with him. Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP, praised Sultana's "principled decision" and stated the new party would offer a "real alternative" to the current political system. The move aims to formalize an alliance of independent, pro-Gaza MPs into a party that could contest future elections.</p>

          <p>One of Sweden's most wanted criminals, identified by media as 35-year-old Ismail Abdo, has been arrested in Turkey following an international warrant. Abdo is the alleged head of the "Rumba" crime network, which is linked to a surge in violent crime, including bombings and shootings, that has plagued Sweden. He is suspected of orchestrating operations from abroad, a common tactic for leaders of Swedish gangs involved in drug and arms trafficking. The arrest is the result of long-term cooperation between Turkish and Swedish law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Sonay Kartal has reached the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time after a decisive 6-4 6-2 victory over France's Diane Parry. After a nervous start on Court One, the 23-year-old rallied to win nine consecutive games, overpowering her opponent with strong serves and powerful shots. Kartal, who was ranked outside the top 800 just three years ago, has had an impressive run, and her performance could see her become the new British number one. She is now the fourth unseeded British woman to reach the fourth round this century.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered evidence of a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals at a site in Germany. Analysis of some 120,000 bone fragments from large animals like horses and deer suggests the ancient humans systematically smashed bones to boil and render them for their rich fatty marrow. This process would have provided a crucial source of calories and nutrients, helping to avoid protein poisoning from a diet of lean meat. The finding indicates that Neanderthals were capable of sophisticated planning, resource management, and understanding complex nutritional needs, further challenging outdated perceptions of them as unintelligent.</p>

          <p>A 72-year-old man has been indicted for murder in connection with the disappearance of his 27-year-old girlfriend, Teresa Peroni, in Oregon 42 years ago. Peroni was last seen in 1983 with her then-boyfriend, Mark Sanfratello, at a party before they walked into a wooded area. The case went cold until a human skull found in 1997 was recently confirmed to be Peroni's through advanced DNA testing. This new evidence, combined with a reopened investigation, led a grand jury to indict Sanfratello, who was arrested in California and is awaiting extradition.</p>

          <p>Christopher Killick has been sentenced to three years in prison for harassing Emily Hunt, the government's former independent rape adviser. The sentence comes after a ten-year campaign by Ms. Hunt, who waived her anonymity to pursue justice after Killick filmed her naked and unconscious in a hotel room in 2015. Despite a previous conviction for voyeurism and a restraining order, Killick repeatedly breached the order by tweeting about Ms. Hunt. The judge noted Killick's "unwavering persistence" and Ms. Hunt's "great courage" in the face of his obsessive behavior.</p>
