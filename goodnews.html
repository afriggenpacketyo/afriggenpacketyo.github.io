          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a decline after Warren Buffett revealed his plans to step down as CEO, naming Greg Abel as his successor effective January 1, 2026; Buffett will remain chairman. The market reacted with Class A shares falling 6.2% to around $760,000 and Class B shares similarly dropping to $506.12, both after hitting record highs. Analysts believe shareholders should be confident in the transition, expecting Buffett to continue mentoring Abel while providing guidance on major capital allocation decisions. This marks the end of Buffett's six-decade leadership, transforming Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague dismissed a case brought by Sudan accusing the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of supporting genocide in the Darfur region. Sudan claimed the UAE violated the Genocide Convention by providing weapons to paramilitary forces in Darfur. However, the ICJ sided with the UAE, accepting its argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the case.

He remained at the Capitol during the storming by Trump supporters and presided over the certification of the election after the building was secured.

While an increase in rates is unlikely, the current climate still offers opportunities for savers to secure favorable returns, particularly with shorter CD terms. Financial analysts recommend comparing various CD accounts and considering potential early withdrawal penalties before locking in a rate, suggesting a combination of CDs and high-yield savings accounts for optimal liquidity and returns.
