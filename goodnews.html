          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to dismantle the historical barriers that have prevented many Black Americans from learning to swim. The article explores the legacy of racial segregation at public pools in the U.S., which created generational gaps in swimming ability and contributed to higher drowning rates in Black communities. Research shows Black children are significantly more likely to drown in pools than their white peers. By providing accessible lessons and scholarships, these initiatives aim to improve water safety and create a ripple effect of more Black swim instructors and lifeguards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, surpassing California last year in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity. This growth is primarily driven by utility companies like Florida Power & Light, which are building solar farms because it is now cheaper than natural gas, not for environmental reasons. A state rule that fast-tracks approvals for smaller projects has accelerated construction and reduced costs. However, the industry faces future challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing constraints on the electrical grid, which requires significant investment in upgrades and storage.</p>

The Wallabies, who had started the series slowly, showed significant improvement and controlled large portions of the final game.

Leclerc expressed disbelief after a difficult qualifying session, calling it one of the best pole positions of his career because it was so unexpected. Changing wind conditions in the final qualifying segment appeared to challenge the McLaren drivers, who had been faster throughout the weekend. The result sets up an exciting race, with Aston Martin also showing a major performance improvement to lock out the third row.</p>

          <p>The head of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), Dr. Wajid Akhter, has asserted that Muslims must lead the artificial intelligence revolution or risk being marginalized. In a leaked video, he warned that the community risked missing the AI revolution just as it had missed previous technological shifts, leading to a decline from its historical position at the forefront of science. He argued that Muslims need to unite and reclaim a leadership role, referencing the community's pain over the conflict in Gaza as a catalyst for unity and action. The comments come as the British government appears to be easing its non-engagement policy with the MCB.</p>

          <p>A new psychological study indicates that aligning fitness routines with personality traits could lead to more effective and enjoyable workouts. The research found that extroverts tend to prefer high-intensity group exercises like HIIT and team sports, while conscientious individuals favor goal-oriented activities such as marathon training. People prone to anxiety may benefit from private, one-on-one sessions, whereas introverts gravitate toward solo activities like running or at-home yoga. The findings suggest that instead of forcing a particular exercise, people can find greater success by choosing activities that naturally suit their disposition.</p>

          <p>This article offers a tribute to the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner, focusing on his nuanced and skillful portrayal of Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." It argues that Warner struck a delicate balance, playing Theo not as a simple slacker but as a complex character whose vulnerability and humor provided a crucial counterpoint to the show's moralizing tone. The analysis highlights Theo's character arc, from a teen faking confidence to an adult who finds purpose after a dyslexia diagnosis. Warner's performance is celebrated for giving depth to a character who challenged his parents' narrow definitions of success.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals vast disparities in the U.S. rental market, showing how much apartment space $1,500 per month can secure in major cities. In Manhattan, that budget affords an average of just 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, renters can get an average of 1,329 square feet. The report highlights that the least amount of space is found in expensive coastal cities like New York, Boston, and San Francisco, where housing demand far outstrips supply. Conversely, cities in the Midwest and South, such as Toledo, Ohio, and Oklahoma City, offer the most spacious accommodations for the same price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marc Maron's latest HBO Max special, "Panicked," is analyzed as the culmination of a trilogy of specials that grapple with both catastrophic current events and personal turmoil. The review praises Maron's controlled, long-form storytelling, where he explores themes of decay, from his father's dementia to America's political decline, with his signature cantankerous yet ruminative style. A key segment discusses a potential childhood sexual assault, which Maron uses not for pity but as a springboard to explore how people process trauma. The special showcases Maron's consistent voice, using humor as a vehicle for unflinching emotional vulnerability and self-reflection.</p>

          <p>John F. Kennedy International Airport's new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 is visibly taking shape, with its first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The structure, which will be JFK's largest terminal, is now weathertight, and key infrastructure like baggage systems and ticket counter areas are being installed. Designed with the international traveler in mind, it will feature a light-filled, three-floor layout and will be roughly the size of both of LaGuardia's new terminals combined. The project is part of a massive $19 billion overhaul of JFK aimed at modernizing the airport and improving traffic flow.</p>
