          <p>Novo Nordisk announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to cash-paying patients in the U.S., a significant reduction from its list price of nearly $1,350. This move comes amid increasing political pressure on pharmaceutical companies to lower medication costs. The discounted price will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy, aiming to expand access for uninsured or underinsured individuals with Type 2 diabetes. The company hopes this will also deter patients from using potentially unsafe compounded alternatives.</p>

          <p>Google and nuclear energy startup Kairos Power have announced a plan to deploy an advanced nuclear plant on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid by 2030. The Hermes 2 reactor will provide up to 50 megawatts of carbon-free power for Google's regional data centers, which are increasingly power-hungry due to AI demands. In a novel arrangement, Google and Kairos will bear the financial risk of building the first-of-a-kind plant, while TVA will provide a revenue stream by purchasing the power. This model aims to overcome the cost overruns that have historically stalled nuclear construction in the U.S.</p>

Among the new entries are "skibidi," a versatile nonsense word from a YouTube series, and "delulu," a slang term for delusional. Other additions include "tradwife," referring to women embracing traditional gender roles online, and "mouse jiggler," a device used to feign activity while working remotely. Lexicographers stated that they only add words they believe will have lasting power, reflecting the significant impact of internet culture on the English language.</p>

          <p>The conservative media outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. The lawsuit accused Newsmax of airing false claims and conspiracy theories about Dominion's voting machines following the 2020 presidential election. This settlement resolves one of the last major legal challenges against news organizations for their coverage of the election. It follows a similar, larger settlement Dominion reached with Fox News, marking another instance of financial accountability for spreading election-related misinformation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC will be renamed My Source News Opinion World, or MS NOW, later this year. The rebranding is part of its separation from parent company Comcast's NBCUniversal, as it becomes part of a new, publicly traded company called Versant. The network will also drop the iconic NBC peacock logo to accelerate the distinction between the two news organizations. As part of the transition, MS NOW is aggressively hiring to build its own independent newsroom and establish its first-ever Washington, D.C., bureau, separate from NBC News.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study in rural Kenya has found that giving no-strings-attached cash payments of $1,000 to low-income households dramatically reduced infant and child mortality. The research, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, revealed that infants born to families who received the cash were nearly half as likely to die compared to a control group. The effect was particularly strong for deaths during and shortly after birth, suggesting the money enabled families to access better healthcare services, such as hospital deliveries, and improve nutrition.</p>

This makes Wegovy the first GLP-1 class drug authorized for MASH, significantly expanding its applications beyond weight loss and diabetes management. The decision was based on a trial where Wegovy showed superior improvement in liver fibrosis compared to a placebo, boosting the company's shares.</p>

Ofcom stated that while some scenes were upsetting, the negative behavior was not portrayed in a positive light and that viewers should expect emotional highs and lows from the show's established format.

          <p>The opening weekend of the Premier League season offered several key tactical insights into how top teams are evolving. An analysis of Liverpool's performance against Bournemouth revealed a vulnerability to counter-attacks, as the team conceded as many goals from fast breaks in one game as they did all last season. Meanwhile, Arsenal showcased a new, more direct and transitional style of play against Manchester United, a departure from their previous methodical possession game. The article suggests that how these teams balance their new approaches will be a critical factor in their success this season.</p>
