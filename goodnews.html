          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:09:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A method used by some bartenders to discreetly inform patrons they will no longer be served alcohol has generated a viral debate online. The practice involves handing customers a small printed card stating they have been "cut off" and should leave quietly, a technique intended to avoid public embarrassment. While some social media users and bar staff praise the discreetness, others criticize the approach as potentially confrontational or insufficient, arguing it fails to ensure the intoxicated person gets home safely. The debate highlights differing opinions on responsibility and communication in serving alcohol.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. Commissioned by the Health Secretary, the review also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow concerns and high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. The review found that a lack of a clear national plan for these roles led to confusion and inconsistent use within the NHS.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:01:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL) and Veronica Escobar (D-TX), has reintroduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill known as the DIGNITY Act. The legislation proposes a "Dignity Program" that would offer a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, pass background checks, and pay restitution. The bill also aims to increase border security funding, reform the asylum system, and protect sensitive locations like schools from enforcement actions. This reintroduction occurs as the Trump administration's mass deportation program faces legal and public challenges.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close for five years starting in 2027 for an ambitious £50 million renovation. The project will address the toll that the internal hot and humid conditions have taken on the 175-year-old iron-and-glass structure. The extensive makeover involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing rusted ironwork, and temporarily relocating 1,300 tropical plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the project is to upgrade the heating systems to make the iconic Victorian glasshouse a net-zero emissions building.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for the popular non-alcoholic beverage 'Trip' for making unauthorized health claims. The ad suggested the drink, which contains ingredients like magnesium and CBD, could help consumers "feel calm" and reduce stress and anxiety. The ASA ruled that these claims were not permitted on the UK's register of approved health claims for food and drink products and that the ad must not appear again in its current form. Trip stated it had removed the claims and hopes to be able to substantiate them in the future.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Indonesia, reducing a planned 32% tariff on its goods to 19%. In exchange, Trump stated that Indonesia has agreed to lower its own tariffs on American products and provide "full access" for U.S. firms. The deal also reportedly includes Indonesian commitments to purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets. This agreement is the latest development following the administration's threats of widespread tariffs against numerous countries, with deals also being announced with the UK, China, and Vietnam.

          <p>A court in Seoul has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who assassinated South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family has fought for a retrial, arguing his actions were a patriotic effort to restore democracy, not a self-serving coup. For decades, Kim has been a polarizing figure, viewed as either a traitor or a hero who ended 18 years of authoritarian rule. The retrial, granted based on evidence of torture during the original investigation, revisits a pivotal moment in South Korean history and forces a re-examination of both Kim's motives and Park's legacy.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has inadvertently breached parliamentary rules by failing to declare gifts within the required 28-day period, a parliamentary watchdog has concluded. Reeves had referred herself for investigation after realizing that tickets she received from the National Theatre were registered on the list for government ministers but not on the separate register for Members of Parliament. The standards commissioner noted the breach was inadvertent but stated it should have been avoided. Reeves apologized, accepted the finding, and said she has put new procedures in place to prevent future errors.</p>
