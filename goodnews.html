          <p>Saudi Aramco's first-quarter net profit decreased by 5% year-on-year, totaling $26 billion, due to lower oil prices and reduced production, though this figure slightly exceeded analyst predictions. The company's free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion compared to the previous year. CEO Amin Nasser noted that global trade dynamics impacted energy markets, emphasizing Aramco's resilience and disciplined capital planning in volatile times. The dividend payout was also reduced from $31 billion to $21.36 billion due to cuts in its performance-linked element, signaling financial strain amidst economic uncertainty and OPEC+ production cuts.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues against the notion of the 'perfect mother,' emphasizing that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. She criticizes the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems, highlighting that this can deter parents from seeking mental health treatment for their teenagers. Ross encourages mothers to embrace their imperfections and to stop wondering if they are good enough, affirming that they already are.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remained stable at 6.76%, near its highest levels of the year, while the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as the demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a mediocre start to the spring home-buying season, with sales of previously occupied homes declining in March.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about US-China trade relations following the first day of talks in Switzerland, describing them as 'friendly' and 'constructive', and indicating a 'total reset' in relations. The talks aim to ease tensions from the ongoing trade war, where the US has imposed tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods. The meetings are the first face-to-face contact between senior officials since the tariffs were implemented, with the US seeking an opening up of China to American business.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China's overall energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa amounted to US$66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with global trends, as China committed to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas in 2021, and is driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
