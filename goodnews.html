          <p>Germany's top women's football league, the Bundesliga, is expanding to 14 teams this season, kicking off with a record-breaking attendance of over 50,000 for a match at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena. This expansion, coupled with increased free-to-air television coverage, signals growing domestic interest in the sport. However, the article questions whether the league can overcome challenges like modest broadcast revenue and limited stadium capacity to truly compete with the financial and commercial power of England's Women's Super League (WSL) and the US-based National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), both of which have secured far more lucrative deals.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed concern that Europe is not effectively asserting its interests globally, pointing to the war in Ukraine as a key example of the continent's dependence on American support. He argued that Europe currently lacks the necessary leverage to influence Russian President Vladimir Putin and must assume greater responsibility. In a related development aimed at boosting regional capabilities, Germany is set to unveil Jupiter, Europe's first exascale supercomputer, which is designed to advance research in artificial intelligence and other critical scientific fields, helping to close the technology gap with the US and China.</p>

          <p>Women's Super League newcomers London City Lionesses have set a new world record transfer fee in women's football by signing French international Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain for £1.4 million. The deal surpasses the previous record and marks the third time it has been broken this summer, highlighting a period of rapid financial growth in the sport. The signing is a major statement of intent from the club, which is funded by American owner Michele Kang and aims to disrupt the established order of the WSL. Geyoro, a highly decorated midfielder, joins a squad of other recent high-profile signings.</p>

          <p>This sports commentary article argues that 21-year-old English cricketer Jacob Bethell needs to be given time and space to develop his game without the immense pressure currently placed upon him. Despite a promising innings against South Africa, Bethell has faced criticism and struggled in recent international matches and in The Hundred tournament. The author questions the decision to name him captain for an upcoming tour, suggesting it adds unnecessary strain on a young player who needs to accumulate experience rather than carry leadership responsibilities. The piece also critiques England's overall strategy in 50-over cricket, warning of potential struggles in World Cup qualification.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a significant jump of over 1%, while markets in South Korea and Hong Kong also posted gains. The positive sentiment was further bolstered by a rally in Asian chip stocks after Trump signaled his intent to impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms that do not relocate production to the United States.

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The increase was largely attributed to strong sales in clothing, footwear, and online retail, driven by sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament. However, this data was released after a two-week delay due to concerns over statistical errors, for which the ONS apologized. Despite the monthly rise, the broader trend shows a 0.6% decline in sales over the three months to July, suggesting underlying economic pressures remain. (not investment advice)</p>
