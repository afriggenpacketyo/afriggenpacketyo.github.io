          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% drop after its first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. The company's revenue reached $2.24 billion, a 28% increase from the previous year, while profits attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million. These figures missed LSEG estimates due to production fluctuations, leading to decreased average selling prices. SMIC anticipates a sequential revenue decline of 4% to 6% in the current quarter, with gross margin expected to fall. The company's capacity utilization reached 89.6%, driven by strong domestic demand and government policies.</p>

          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite U.S. Tariffs Due to Increased Shipments to Southeast Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:22:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Exports to the U.S. fell by over 21% year-on-year, while imports dropped nearly 14%. Exports to ASEAN countries jumped 20.8%, and exports to the EU rose 8.3%. Analysts suggest the overall export surge may be partly attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were implemented. The Chinese government is encouraging exporters to shift sales to the domestic market, potentially exacerbating deflationary pressures.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a 5-3 game, highlighting the challenges within the competitive National League West division. Yoshinobu Yamamoto struggled, giving up five runs in five innings. The Dodgers, who had a strong start to the season, are now facing a series of intradivision tests against the Diamondbacks, Padres, and Giants. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the strength of the division, noting that no team is likely to dominate. The loss underscores the potential for a tightly contested division race reminiscent of the 2021 season.</p>

          <p>Multiple newspapers are leading with news of a US-UK trade agreement, with the Daily Mail stating the deal was "made by Brexit" and aims to save the British car industry. The Financial Times notes the UK secured concessions on car and steel exports but failed to reverse a 10% levy on most goods. The Daily Telegraph reports the deal allows the US to object to Chinese firms investing in the UK, a claim the government denies. Metro focuses on the rapid selection of a new Pope, Leo XIV, while the Guardian highlights his message of building bridges.

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, potentially lowering tariffs and delivering a political victory for Prime Minister Starmer. The deal includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, particularly for agricultural products, and a reduction in non-tariff barriers. However, the 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports will remain in place, with some exemptions for British automakers. Commerce Secretary Lutnick estimates the deal will generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. The agreement is seen as a vindication of Starmer's approach to Mr. Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% year-on-year in April, defying US President Trump's tariff increases. The figure exceeded market expectations and followed a 12.4% rise in March. Analysts suggest the resilience may be due to transshipment through other countries and pre-tariff trade contracts. Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, with China retaliating with duties of up to 125% on American goods. The data potentially strengthens China's negotiating position ahead of trade talks with the US in Switzerland.</p>

Beijing added tungsten to its export restriction list in February. US defense contractors must cease using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027. Tungsten is used in cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy applications. China accounted for 82.7% of global raw tungsten ore mined last year, with no commercial mining in the US for a decade.</p>

          <p>An Arizona court allowed the use of an AI-generated likeness of a murder victim during the sentencing phase of the trial. Stacey Wales, the victim's sister, created an avatar of her brother, Christopher Pelkey, to deliver a victim impact statement. While the use of AI has spread through society, this use during sentencing has drawn debate. Critics argue it could open the door to manipulation and deception, compounding the emotional process. The judge complimented its inclusion, but a defense lawyer suggested that the court's reliance on the AI video could constitute reversible error.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are calling for a revision of World War II history to recognize China's role in the conflict. They propose that the start date should be moved back to 1931, with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's early resistance against fascism. President Xi Jinping will attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow to commemorate the end of WWII.</p>
