        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a closely watched Romanian presidential runoff, pro-European Union candidate Nicusor Dan emerged victorious against hard-right nationalist George Simion, signaling a potential shift away from skepticism toward the EU. The election, triggered by the cancelation of the previous election due to allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, saw a significant swing in voter sentiment. Dan's win is viewed as a rejection of hate and reactionary politics, embracing a pro-Western direction for Romania, although the country remains divided with a new political landscape challenging older parties to adapt. The president-elect will nominate a new prime minister and focus on national security and foreign policy. </p>

          <p>After the devastating fire in 2019, hundreds of skilled craftspeople, known as compagnons, have been working diligently to restore Notre Dame Cathedral to its former glory. These artisans, part of a medieval French organization, have employed traditional techniques to clean stained-glass windows, brighten stone walls, and recalibrate the organ's 8,000 pipes. Marble restorer Olivia Salaun meticulously recreated missing pieces of the 17th-century marquetry, while metalworker Philomene Thivet Mazzantti helped create lead ornamentation for the roof. Painting restorer Diana Castillo emphasized that the cleaning process revealed the vibrant colors that were originally present in the Middle Ages, shocking many with their intensity. </p>

          <p>This article sheds light on the often-overlooked role of children living in the homes of veterans with PTSD, who frequently become family caregivers. The Rotenberry family's story illustrates how son Kristopher took on significant responsibilities to shield his father and sisters from the trauma, eventually leading to his own mental health struggles. Elizabeth Dole's foundation has commissioned studies revealing that over one million individuals are caring for those injured during the post-9/11 wars, and that many feel overwhelmed. Elizabeth Cornelius, another child caregiver, helps her mother manage her father's PTSD while also caring for her younger siblings. </p>

          <p>Anduril Industries, co-founded by Palmer Luckey, has unveiled Fury, an unmanned fighter jet designed to use artificial intelligence and fly without a pilot, marking a significant advancement in unmanned combat technology. CEO Brian Schrimpf explains that Fury is a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) intended to work alongside manned aircraft, providing enhanced surveillance and protection. The Air Force hopes to have CCAs fully operational by the end of the decade, with Fury scheduled for its first test flight this summer.

Anduril's creations, such as the Roadrunner drone interceptor and the Dive XL submarine, are already being used by the U.S. military and in Ukraine.

          <p>D-Wave Quantum's stock has surged due to its leading position in the rapidly growing quantum computing market. The company's quantum annealing technology is proving successful in solving optimization problems across various industries. However, the stock's high valuation, trading at over 130 times sales, warrants caution. Despite not yet being profitable, D-Wave Quantum's revenue soared by 509% in the first quarter of 2025, driven by strong sales momentum. </p>

          <p>TSMC, a Taiwanese company, is constructing a secretive factory in Arizona that is poised to shape the global economy by mass-producing advanced semiconductors in the US for the first time. While President Trump views this as a victory for his America First policy, the factory's reliance on global technologies exposes the contradiction in his approach. The facility is closely guarded due to the sensitive intellectual property it houses, and its operation depends on a complex network of international suppliers and technologies. The plant will contribute to both the US economic and military superiority over China. </p>
