          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore exhibits detailing Donald Trump's two impeachments at the National Museum for American History in the coming weeks. The museum faced public concern after a temporary placard referencing the impeachments was removed, sparking fears of historical whitewashing. In a statement, the Smithsonian denied any pressure from the Trump administration, explaining the removal was due to the temporary label not meeting museum standards for presentation. The updated exhibit will be located in the section on the limits of presidential power, alongside materials related to the impeachments of Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson.</p>

          <p>New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport is undergoing a major transformation with its new $9.5 billion Terminal 1, which is scheduled to open its first phase in mid-2026. The project, part of a $19 billion overhaul of the entire airport, will create JFK's largest terminal, dedicated exclusively to international travelers. Designed to be flooded with natural light, the facility will feature modern amenities, extensive retail space, and its own resilient microgrid power system. The development aims to replace aging infrastructure and accommodate growing air traffic, with the opening timed around the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 10:48:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for drivers who were mis-sold car loans with hidden commissions, which could cost between £9 billion and £18 billion. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively large ones could be considered unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, but it anticipates that most eligible individuals could receive less than £950 in compensation. The regulator stated the court's decision provides clarity on what constitutes an unfair relationship between lenders and consumers, paving the way for payouts to begin next year.</p>

          <p>Recent footage aired on Chinese state television suggests that China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has conducted its first aircraft launch using its electromagnetic catapult system. The short video clip, part of a series celebrating the anniversary of the People's Liberation Army, shows a control room operator clearing a jet for take-off. This event marks a significant technological milestone for the Chinese navy, as the Fujian is its first carrier equipped with this advanced launch technology, which is similar to that used on the newest U.S. aircraft carriers. The vessel is expected to officially enter service later this year.</p>

          <p>A new report from HR technology company Checkr has identified the top U.S. cities for employment and earning potential, with mid-sized metro areas dominating the list. Raleigh, North Carolina, and Nashville, Tennessee, ranked first and second, respectively, outperforming major hubs like New York and Los Angeles. The study analyzed the 100 largest cities based on factors such as unemployment rates, labor force growth, and real per capita income. The findings suggest a shift in the geography of opportunity, where strong job markets and a lower cost of living in these emerging cities can make wages go further.</p>

          <h2>Divorce Attorneys Advise on Protecting Finances During a Rocky Marriage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In situations of marital instability where a prenuptial agreement is not in place, divorce attorneys suggest two key strategies for financial protection. The first is to proactively gather comprehensive information about all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, which simplifies the process should a divorce occur. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided. While potentially a difficult conversation, attorneys suggest that such agreements can provide security and clarity for both parties, preventing more significant conflicts later on.

          <p>The British government has announced it is working "at pace" to implement a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical care. While the exact number is unconfirmed, reports suggest up to 300 children could be brought over, accompanied by a guardian, to receive free treatment. This official scheme follows a private initiative by Project Pure Hope, which has already brought three children to the UK. The government's move comes after criticism from the Foreign Affairs Committee for its previous reluctance to support such a medical evacuation program during the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people are embracing the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, a lifestyle centered on extreme saving and investing to achieve retirement decades ahead of schedule. The philosophy, popularized by bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache and the book "Your Money or Your Life," advocates for frugality and conscious spending to maximize savings. Proponents aim to accumulate 25 times their annual expenses, then live off a 4% annual withdrawal. The movement challenges traditional notions of work and consumerism, promoting a focus on personal freedom and life experiences over material possessions.</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, one of the world's highest-paid athletes, recently revealed that he does not know his exact net worth and is not focused on the number. Instead, Curry said he prioritizes building a portfolio of investments and relationships that he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day management to his financial team. Financial planners commented that this approach can be healthy, as it shifts focus from a potentially stressful obsession with accumulation to more tangible goals and values. They advise that tracking cash flow and aligning financial decisions with personal goals can be a more powerful indicator of financial health than net worth alone.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has revealed the development of a new high-strength, low-temperature steel, CHSN01, essential for constructing nuclear fusion reactors. The material was created to address a critical challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project after previously prepared steel proved too brittle. This advanced steel is designed to withstand both the extreme cold of liquid helium and the immense magnetic forces inside a fusion device. The successful development and deployment of this material in the world's first fusion power generation reactor this year places China in a leading position in advanced materials science.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old CEO of design software company Figma, has joined the ranks of tech billionaires following his company's successful stock market debut. Field, a former Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Brown University to start the company, saw Figma's valuation soar to over $71 billion, making his personal stake worth approximately $6.6 billion. The journey was not without challenges, including a nearly-scrapped $20 billion acquisition by Adobe due to regulatory hurdles. Now independent again, Figma is a dominant force in collaborative design, and Field is leading its expansion into new AI-powered creative tools.</p>
