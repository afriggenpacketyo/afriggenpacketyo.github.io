        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump Administration has temporarily halted its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision marks a policy shift, as the administration had previously announced the resumption of collection activities on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. The pause aims to protect Social Security recipients who rely on fixed incomes, providing them with more time to address their debt and avoid benefit reductions. The administration's reprieve offers a chance for older borrowers to get current on their debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area. Judge John Holcomb ruled that the government has not provided adequate due process for those facing deportation under the 1798 law. The ruling applies to migrants in custody within the Central District of California, including Los Angeles and Orange County. This decision adds to the complex legal landscape surrounding the Alien Enemies Act, which has faced challenges in multiple states. The ruling provides a level of stability.</p>

          <p>Analysts are comparing Pop Mart, the company behind the Labubu collectible character, to Sanrio and its Hello Kitty property. Labubu's popularity has attracted high-profile fans and driven Pop Mart's stock to record highs, with international sales surging. Some believe Labubu's success lies in its ability to tap into universal emotions through design and marketing, rather than focusing on Chinese heritage. JPMorgan Chase has initiated coverage of Pop Mart with an overweight rating, suggesting further growth potential. The public is very enthusiastic about this new phenomenon.</p>

This updated portrait differs from the one released in January, which showed Trump in a blue tie with the American flag in the background. The new portrait, taken by chief White House photographer Daniel Torok, will replace the existing official photographs in federal buildings and offices. The White House shared a short video of the new portrait being hung in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The event itself is relatively stable.</p>

          <p>NPR is inviting parents to share the songs they sing to their babies, following a Yale University study that found singing improves infants' moods and overall well-being. The study, which surveyed 110 parents and their babies, indicated that infants who are sung to frequently are generally happier. Researchers suggest that parents can sing any type of song, not just traditional lullabies, to provide comfort and joy to their babies. NPR encourages parents to upload recordings of themselves singing to their babies for a chance to be featured on Morning Edition. The public is generally happy about this trend.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. were convicted in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction. The divers believed the longline was illegal and freed the animals, but were charged after officials said the line belonged to a licensed researcher. The pardons erase the convictions, allowing them to vote, own firearms, and travel freely. The event is generally seen as a positive step.</p>
