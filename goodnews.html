          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by technology and real estate sectors, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cut. Other markets across the Asia-Pacific region showed a mixed reaction, with South Korea's Kospi rising while Australia's ASX 200 declined. The Fed's decision, described as a "risk management cut" by Chairman Jerome Powell, also signaled the possibility of two additional cuts by year-end. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has commenced its policy meeting, where it is expected to maintain its current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has officially introduced the company's first consumer smart glasses with a built-in display, the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, priced at $799. The device features a small digital screen that users can control with hand gestures via a neural technology-powered wristband, allowing for tasks like watching videos and responding to messages. This product serves as a bridge between Meta's existing audio-only glasses and its more advanced, experimental augmented reality projects. The company also announced new smart glasses models in partnership with Oakley, designed for athletes, and an updated version of its original audio glasses.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic. Current forecasts predict the storm will track northwestward over open waters for several days, posing no immediate threat to land. Meteorologists suggest Gabrielle could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it passes north of the Caribbean. While its path remains uncertain, the system could approach Bermuda next week, but for now, no coastal watches or warnings are in effect. The season has been quieter than initially predicted by forecasters.</p>

          <h2>Wild Chimpanzees Found to Consume Alcohol Equivalent of Two Daily Cocktails from Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume naturally fermented fruit containing low levels of alcohol. Researchers calculated that the average daily intake of ethanol for a chimp is equivalent to nearly two alcoholic beverages for a human. This finding provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits eaten by wild chimps, lending strong support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis. This theory suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Education Select Committee has strongly recommended that the government should not scrap the existing system of Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs. Instead of eliminating the legally binding plans, the committee calls for establishing new national minimum standards of support that all schools must provide. The MPs also advocate for more specialized training for all teachers and increased funding to make the system more sustainable and effective. This comes as the government prepares to announce its own reforms to special needs education provision in England.</p>

          <p>Policymakers at the Bank of England are widely expected to keep interest rates at 4% during their upcoming meeting, holding steady after a rate cut in August. This decision would contrast with the recent move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower its rates. The primary factor for the Bank of England is that the UK's inflation rate remains at 3.8%, nearly double its 2% target, making another immediate cut risky. Analysts believe that while inflation is expected to fall soon, further rate cuts in the UK are unlikely for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's 0.25% interest rate cut, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against making significant portfolio changes, arguing that the decision did not upend any major market themes. He suggested that the mixed market reaction was predictable and that investors should not trade based on Fed statements alone. Cramer noted the Fed is in a difficult position, balancing a slowing job market against persistent inflation. He concluded that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's cautious, "steady as she goes" approach was exactly what the market needed for stability. (not investment advice)</p>
