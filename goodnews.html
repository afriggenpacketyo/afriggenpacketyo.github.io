          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended to land on Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years, splashing down in the Indian Ocean. The spacecraft became stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket booster malfunction, serving as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program. The program achieved several milestones, including the first probes to enter another planet's atmosphere and transmit images from Venus's surface. The re-entry highlights the increasing frequency of objects falling from the sky as space activities grow, and despite the challenges, the Soviet Union's Venus exploration remains a point of pride.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee was felt across several southern states, including Georgia and North Carolina, on Saturday morning. While no injuries or major damage were immediately reported, the event served as a reminder of the region's earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid and Eastern Tennessee seismic zones. The USGS received over 23,000 reports from the public within the first hour after the earthquake. Experts noted that seismic waves travel more efficiently in the eastern US, causing earthquakes to be felt over a larger area.</p>

          <p>A bronze sculpture depicting the attempted assassination attempt on President Donald Trump in Butler, PA, last year has been displayed in the Oval Office. The sculpture captures the moment when then-candidate Trump was pulled off stage by Secret Service agents after shots were fired. The image became a symbol of Trump's resilience and bravery during the 2024 presidential election. The sculpture is believed to be a maquette of a larger statue planned by artist Stan Watts, intended to immortalize the event and its symbolism.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in decision-making, particularly in creative fields. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week" concept, and how he valued gut feeling over market research. He argues that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea, and that simple human instinct is crucial. Diller shares anecdotes about greenlighting projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which became highly successful despite lacking perfect scripts or extensive data backing.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers, once a dominant force in the diet industry, has filed for bankruptcy after losing over a million members, struggling to compete with the popularity of weight loss injections like Mounjaro and social media influencers. The company, which has stressed that it is not going out of business, attributes points to food and drink, stating that it uses a "groundbreaking algorithm" to assess their nutritional makeup and then uses a point system to inform its members which food is better to eat. Weight loss injections mimic a hormone that suppresses appetite, and some experts are concerned about the long-term effects of these medications. This shift reflects a broader trend towards a more holistic approach to wellbeing.</p>
