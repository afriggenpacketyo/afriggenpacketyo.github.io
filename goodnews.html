        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a novel anti-poaching effort, scientists in South Africa have begun injecting rhino horns with a harmless radioactive substance. The initiative, known as the Rhisotope Project, aims to make the horns easily detectable by international customs and border security scanners, thereby disrupting smuggling networks. This innovative method has been confirmed as safe for the rhinos following extensive research and testing on a pilot group of animals. The project seeks to protect South Africa's large but threatened rhino population from poaching driven by demand in Asian markets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's public statements on aesthetics, while often overlooked, represent a refreshing aspect of his political persona. The author highlights Trump's executive order promoting classical and traditional federal architecture and his vocal criticism of wind turbines for spoiling scenic landscapes, such as his Scottish golf courses. The piece suggests that this concern for beauty, from urban design like the Penn Station revival to natural scenery, is a rare quality in modern politicians. It contrasts this with what the author perceives as a lack of aesthetic consideration in mainstream British politics.</p>

          <p>Steven Knight, the acclaimed creator of "Peaky Blinders," has been officially confirmed as the writer for the next James Bond movie. The film is currently in development at Amazon MGM Studios under the direction of Denis Villeneuve, following the departure of longtime producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. Knight expressed his excitement, stating the project is on his bucket list and that he aims to create something "better, stronger and bolder." Speculation continues over who will replace Daniel Craig in the iconic role, but no casting decisions have been announced for the film.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has canceled the deployment of 1,350 additional National Guard troops to Los Angeles as anti-ICE protests in the city have subsided. Approximately 250 members will remain to protect federal buildings and personnel. The initial deployment of thousands of troops in June was met with strong opposition from California state and local officials, who filed a lawsuit arguing it was an unnecessary escalation. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom praised the withdrawal, framing it as a win for the city and criticizing the deployment as political theater.</p>

          <p>Vermont Green FC, a fourth-tier amateur soccer team, has captured the spotlight in American soccer, selling out its stadium and drawing massive crowds for its USL League Two final. The Burlington-based club, founded in 2021, has cultivated a passionate fan base and a strong community ethos that has attracted even non-sports fans and the support of Senator Bernie Sanders. The team's success highlights a growing movement in lower-league U.S. soccer, where community identity and engagement are valued over the league's division. The club's popularity is now forcing it to consider expanding its venue to accommodate the surging demand.</p>

By partnering with AI music platform Suno, the foundation aims to create authentic-sounding tracks in older musical styles that would be difficult to produce otherwise. However, this embrace of AI has raised concerns among some musicians and other nonprofits in the field. Critics worry about potential copyright issues and the loss of the crucial human connection that they believe is central to the therapeutic value of such music.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 03:38:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nintendo has reported that its revenue more than doubled in its fiscal first quarter, driven by the highly successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company sold 5.82 million units of the new device, which launched on June 5, significantly boosting its dedicated video game platform business. Despite the strong performance, Nintendo has maintained its full-year financial forecast, a target some analysts consider conservative. The company's shares have surged approximately 40% this year, fueled by excitement for the new console, though potential impacts from U.S. tariffs remain a factor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Government Restricts Civil Service Internships to Students from Poorer Backgrounds</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to increase social mobility within Whitehall, the UK government is reforming its main student internship program to be exclusively available to those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, will judge eligibility based on parental occupation. Successful interns on the paid program will then be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry route into the civil service. The move aims to make the institution more representative of the country it serves, though it has drawn criticism for what some call "leftist social engineering."</p>

After years of frustrating injuries and setbacks that stalled his progress, Burgin feels he is finally back on the trajectory his early talent promised. He now has his sights set on both a global medal and potentially breaking Lord Coe's long-standing 44-year-old national record.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new UK law banning the manufacture, sale, and possession of ninja swords, named "Ronan's Law," has officially taken effect. The law is the result of a relentless three-year campaign by Pooja Kanda, whose 16-year-old son, Ronan, was fatally stabbed with such a weapon in a case of mistaken identity in 2022. Ms. Kanda expressed that the moment was bittersweet, believing her son would still be alive if the ban had been implemented sooner. The law also mandates that retailers report suspicious knife orders and conduct strict age verification checks to curb youth violence.</p>
