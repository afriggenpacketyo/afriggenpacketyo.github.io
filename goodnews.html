          <p>President Trump is preparing to sign an executive order to create national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This follows the NCAA's 2021 rule change that allowed student-athletes to earn significant income from endorsements and other deals, which has reshaped college sports. The move comes as Congress considers the "SCORE Act," a bill aimed at superseding inconsistent state laws, though some worry it gives the NCAA too much power. This executive action seeks to bring federal oversight to the lucrative and often chaotic new landscape of collegiate athlete compensation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which would establish a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports to the United States. In exchange, the U.S. would gain tariff-free access to Indonesian markets, a significant shift from previous trade relations. As part of the agreement, Trump stated that Indonesia has also committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing aircraft. However, the Indonesian government has not yet officially confirmed these specific terms, creating some uncertainty around the final details of the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After initially blocking a package of cryptocurrency regulation bills, a group of House Republicans reversed their position following a meeting with President Trump. The legislation, which includes the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation, had failed a key procedural vote earlier in the day. Trump announced on social media that the holdouts had agreed to support the bills, demonstrating his significant influence over the party conference. The bills aim to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S., including rules for stablecoins and clarifying agency oversight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, President Trump announced that 20 leading companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania to develop its energy and artificial intelligence sectors. The initiatives include building new data centers powered by the state's natural gas and nuclear resources and establishing an innovation hub for workforce training. The announcement, which also highlighted a major partnership for U.S. Steel, aims to position the Pittsburgh region as a leader in the new AI economy. Organizers hope these investments will create tens of thousands of jobs and stimulate further economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal deployment in Los Angeles, which began over a month ago. The troops were federalized by President Trump to respond to protests against ICE activities, a move opposed by California Governor Gavin Newsom. The administration stated the withdrawal is possible because "lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding." However, Newsom has called for the remaining 2,000 troops to also be returned to state control, asserting they have been used as "political pawns" without a clear mission.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House is considering the "Genius Act," a bipartisan bill that aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents argue that stablecoins, or "digital dollars," can facilitate faster and cheaper payments than the traditional banking system. The legislation would establish consumer protections and clear rules for issuers like banks and fintech companies. This move is part of a broader push by the Trump administration and some lawmakers to foster the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. while managing its risks. (not investment advice)</p>

The "Charger Power" uniform features an all-gold jersey and pants combination, which some have compared to mustard bottles or the Minions characters. The second alternate, "Super Chargers," is a navy blue look intended as a modern throwback to the team's uniforms from the 1990s and 2000s. While some fans praised the bold designs, others were more critical, highlighting the polarizing nature of the new team apparel.</p>

          <p>Brazil's top prosecutor has formally urged the Supreme Federal Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting to violently overthrow the democratic order. The charges stem from his actions following his 2022 election loss, where he spread unfounded voter fraud claims, culminating in his supporters storming government buildings. The prosecutor's filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" and instrumentalizing the state apparatus. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison, marking a significant moment for Brazilian democracy and accountability.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, thereby preserving foreign exchange assets like the U.S. dollar. According to the World Gold Council, this approach is often cheaper and helps support the domestic mining industry. Countries like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines are using this method to build up their gold holdings amid surging prices and global geopolitical uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts by the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and he was declared factually innocent in 2022.

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants." The goal is to avoid patient confusion and clarify their role, as they are not doctors. The review, prompted by safety concerns and cases where patients died after being treated by PAs, also suggests they should not diagnose patients and must wear standardized uniforms to be easily distinguishable from doctors. The recommendations aim to provide a clearer framework for these roles within healthcare teams.</p>

The 175-year-old Victorian glasshouse, which houses a tropical rainforest collection, requires extensive repairs to its rusting ironwork and will have all 16,000 panes of glass replaced. The project also aims to make the building net-zero by replacing gas boilers with modern heat pumps. The complex undertaking will involve carefully relocating over 1,300 precious plants, including a 250-year-old cycad that predates the Palm House itself.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who assassinated authoritarian President Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family argues he acted to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy, not to seize power. The case is re-examining whether his conviction was just, especially since it was conducted under a military court after another general had seized power. The retrial forces South Korea to confront a pivotal and polarizing moment in its history, re-evaluating the legacies of both the assassin and the dictator he killed.</p>
