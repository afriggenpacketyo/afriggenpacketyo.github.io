          <p>President Trump praised Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan as a "success" following a meeting, a sharp reversal from his demand for Tan's resignation just days prior. The meeting, which included cabinet members, focused on strengthening U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership. This change in tone comes amid the administration's active involvement in the semiconductor industry's competition with China, including a recent deal with Nvidia. Intel's stock saw a slight increase following the news of the constructive discussion.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is projected to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the season. Currently located far from the U.S. mainland, early models suggest it could intensify into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands later in the week. The storm has already caused flooding in the Cabo Verde islands. This development marks the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which forecasters predict will be above-normal in activity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a new documentary, director Martin Scorsese revealed he once considered getting a gun to threaten studio executives who wanted to cut violent scenes from his 1976 film "Taxi Driver." Fearing the film would be destroyed, he contemplated drastic action before a compromise was reached. Co-participant Steven Spielberg explained that Scorsese ultimately saved the movie's key scenes by desaturating the color of the blood, toning down its visual impact without altering the content. The film went on to receive four Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture.</p>

However, the developer, Mack Real Estate, has not provided a timeline for construction, reflecting current challenges in the real estate development sector. Experts point to high interest rates, rising material costs, and labor uncertainties as significant hurdles for new projects. Despite these difficulties, there remains strong underlying demand for housing in downtown L.A., with occupancy rates holding steady around 90%.</p>

Brady Press Briefing Room is notoriously cramped, with only 49 seats. Past proposals to move the press corps to a larger space outside the West Wing have been opposed by journalists who value the proximity to the Oval Office.</p>

In the parody, Donald Trump complains about the house being "yucky" and haunted, and demands an all-gold Oval Office inspired by King Midas and the dragon Smaug. The piece humorously critiques the president's aesthetic and political ambitions, depicting the Rose Garden being paved over for an Au Bon Pain-style patio and a new ballroom being built to avoid using tents. The satire frames the renovations as turning a public institution into a "forever home."</p>
