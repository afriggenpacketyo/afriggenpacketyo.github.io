It cautions against relationships involving significant power imbalances, such as those between adults and minors, or those where one partner consistently dates individuals much younger. The author suggests that repeated patterns of dating only younger individuals may indicate immaturity or other personal issues. </p>

          <p>Curvy couches are making a comeback in interior design, offering a departure from traditional angular furniture. Initially popular in the Art Deco era and revived in the 1950s, these sofas can transform a room by softening harsh angles and adding visual interest. They can also be practical, particularly in open-plan spaces where they can act as both seating and room dividers. When selecting a curvy couch, it's important to consider size, comfort, and material, and to pair it with more angular tables and chairs for a balanced aesthetic. </p>

The move comes after pressure from employee unions, who criticized the proposed increase in trust contributions.
