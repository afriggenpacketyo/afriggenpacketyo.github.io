          <p>Mary Earps, the England goalkeeper, has announced her retirement from international football, effective immediately, after 53 senior appearances over eight years. Earps played a key role in England's Euro 2022 victory and their journey to the 2023 Women's World Cup final. However, having recently lost her place to Hannah Hampton, the 32-year-old will not participate in England's Euro 2025 campaign. Her retirement marks the end of an era for the Lionesses, as they prepare for future tournaments without their experienced goalkeeper.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ministers in the UK government are considering abolishing the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that while the policy has pushed people into poverty, reversing it would be expensive. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of its child poverty strategy. Phillipson emphasized that a Labour government would never have introduced the cap and that the "cost of inaction" on child poverty is incredibly high.</p>

          <p>King Charles III arrived in Canada for his first visit since his coronation, where he is scheduled to deliver the Speech from the Throne to open the 45th session of Canada's Parliament.

Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the King to underscore Canada's sovereignty amid strained relations with the U.S., as King Charles's visit included meetings with indigenous leaders and a tree-planting ceremony.</p>

          <p>Following an incident in Liverpool where a car rammed into a crowd, injuring dozens, police promptly released details about the driver being a 53-year-old white British man. This swift disclosure aimed to counteract the spread of false rumors that had previously occurred after other violent episodes in Britain. In a prior incident in Southport, false reports about the assailant being an undocumented Muslim migrant led to riots, prompting criticism of restrictions on police communication. The Merseyside Police, responding to both incidents, seemed aware of the need to balance legal responsibilities with preventing public disorder, as unsubstantiated theories circulated online.</p>

          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron and WorldCom, are speaking out against a proposal by Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (P.C.A.O.B.). They argue that dismantling this watchdog, created after the Enron and WorldCom scandals, would increase the risk of corporate disasters by removing a crucial layer of independent oversight. The P.C.A.O.B. was established to ensure high-quality audits and protect investors by independently overseeing public company audits, and its removal would shift responsibilities to the S.E.C., potentially compromising its effectiveness. The authors argue that the P.C.A.O.B.'s independence from the S.E.C. is its greatest strength.</p>

          <p>Zachary Levi, the actor known for his role in "Shazam!", says that his support for President Donald Trump has made him a Hollywood outsider, with some people reportedly unwilling to work with him due to his political beliefs. Levi stated that he is aware of the potential risks and consequences of his decision to publicly endorse Trump, but he also believes that he has allies in the industry who appreciate his courage. He suggested that many people in Hollywood secretly voted for Trump but are afraid to express their views publicly due to fear of backlash, encouraging closeted conservatives to speak out.</p>

Garber finds these measures perplexing, arguing that cutting research funding harms the country, and that Harvard is committed to serving the nation.

Twenty companies have applied to purchase a combined 110,000 tons of rice, equivalent to over 30 percent of the planned release. This move aims to address the doubling of average rice prices at supermarkets despite previous government efforts to lower prices. The government is also considering revising eligibility criteria to include smaller supermarkets and rice shops, with supermarket giant Aeon Co. planning to sell the rice at around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. In a study published in Cell, rice plants subjected to cold stress passed on cold tolerance across five generations through DNA methylation changes. This research revives Lamarck's theory that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The team, led by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, showed that rice varieties from China‚Äôs frosty northeast exhibited these stable, non-genetic adaptations, highlighting Lamarckism as a significant factor in evolution.</p>
