          <p>According to PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer report, employer demand for formal degrees is declining, particularly in jobs exposed to artificial intelligence. The report suggests that AI's ability to rapidly build expert knowledge may diminish the relevance of formal qualifications. Skills are changing 66% faster in AI-exposed occupations compared to those less exposed, emphasizing the need for continuous upskilling. PwC's Global Chief AI Officer Joe Atkinson recommends upskilling on AI to adapt to the evolving work landscape, noting that AI tools and large language models offer new avenues for learning outside traditional institutions.</p>
