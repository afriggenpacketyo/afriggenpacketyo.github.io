          <p>The Japanese government is planning to explore new overseas markets and support more efficient production to increase rice exports, addressing an anticipated long-term decline in domestic consumption. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recommends boosting rice exports, identifying China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan as target markets. The government aims to increase rice exports nearly eightfold by 2030 and reduce production costs to compete with foreign-grown rice. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba supports prioritizing exports from the beginning, rather than only exporting surplus rice.</p>

          <p>A Harris's hawk that terrorized the village of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has found a permanent home with a local falconer, Wayne Housden. The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was responsible for dive-bombing attacks on about 50 people. After being captured, the hawk has been trained by Housden, who reports that the bird has calmed down significantly. Housden plans to keep the hawk full-time and hopes to release it in the autumn, believing it was a captive-bred bird that had lost its falconer.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, after nearly 130 days as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has left his role within Donald Trump's administration. At the age of 12, Musk created the video game Blastar, and in 1995, he co-founded Zip2, which sold for around $300 million in 1999. In 2022, he launched a perfume called Burnt Hair, and long before Twitter became X, Musk created X.com, which later merged with Confinity to become PayPal. Musk's personality and accomplishments were partly used as inspiration for Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Iron Man.</p>

WWF is advocating for these muddy, tidal habitats to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. This recognition could incentivize the restoration and protection of these sites, as saltmarshes capture carbon in their soils, making them as important as trees for climate mitigation.</p>
