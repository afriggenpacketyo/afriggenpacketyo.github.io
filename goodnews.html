The move is framed as a disciplined investment strategy to take profits after a period of strong gains, even while maintaining a positive outlook on the company's ongoing turnaround under CEO Bob Iger.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has published research identifying a potential pathway to enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue. The study, published in the journal Science, found that mice lack the ability to produce sufficient retinoic acid, a key compound for tissue repair, due to a disabled genetic switch. By reactivating this specific switch, the researchers were successfully able to trigger ear tissue regeneration in a mouse. This discovery could have significant implications for advancing regenerative medicine in vertebrates, including humans, by potentially unlocking latent healing capabilities.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that his team is in discussions with reigning world champion Max Verstappen about a potential move for the 2026 season. Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but break clauses could reportedly allow for an early exit. This news fuels speculation amid Red Bull's recent performance dip and major personnel changes, including the departure of designer Adrian Newey. A move to Mercedes could be attractive for Verstappen, as the team is believed to be making strong progress on its engine for the new 2026 regulations.</p>

The author posits that Mamdani's victory proves the party's left flank can be a major asset, energizing voters with a clear moral vision, rather than a liability to be managed.

The strategy, extending through 2026, includes resurrecting Hemi V-8 engines, introducing a new industry-leading warranty, and returning to NASCAR racing. Kuniskis aims to reclaim significant market share from competitors like GM and Toyota, which have gained ground as Ram's sales fell 38% from their 2019 peak.

While some participants and analysts praised the service for its smoothness, other reported incidents included a vehicle driving on the wrong side of the road and another stopping in traffic. The launch highlights Tesla's unique vision-only approach, which forgoes lidar and radar used by competitors like Waymo. By launching in a limited area, Tesla is adopting a strategy similar to its rivals, a departure from its long-held promise of a universally applicable self-driving solution.</p>

          <p>The hotel minibar, once a symbol of traveler convenience and luxury in the 1990s, has largely fallen out of favor in many American hotels. For hotel operators, the amenity proved to be a logistical and financial burden due to high operational costs, food spoilage, and theft, often costing more to run than it earned. In its place, hotels have shifted to more modern and profitable alternatives. These include 24/7 lobby marketplaces and strategic partnerships with food delivery apps like DoorDash and Grubhub, offering guests greater choice and convenience without the operational headache.</p>

In a new study published in Science, researchers used two different dating methods on a new sample, which both yielded the same age, strengthening their claim.
