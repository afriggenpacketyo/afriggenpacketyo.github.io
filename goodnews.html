          <p>Following his high-stakes meeting with Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared ten key takeaways in an interview with Sean Hannity. He emphasized that while no final deal was reached to end the war in Ukraine, significant progress was made, and he believes Putin is open to peace. Trump rated the meeting a "10 out of 10" for rapport, suggested a future trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and stated his advice to Zelenskyy would be to "make a deal." He declined to specify the remaining sticking points but indicated the next steps are up to Ukraine and European nations.</p>

          <p>Following a lawsuit filed by Washington D.C., the Trump administration has agreed to scale back its takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). An emergency court hearing led to a revised directive where MPD Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, rather than the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The DEA administrator will now act as an intermediary, and the agreement still allows the federal government to direct the MPD for certain purposes, including assisting with immigration enforcement. The city's attorney general expressed that the key issue of command and control has been resolved for now.</p>

          <p>Global K-pop sensation Blackpink performed a sold-out show at London's Wembley Stadium, becoming the first female K-pop group to headline the iconic venue. The two-and-a-half-hour concert was part of their Deadline world tour and featured a high-energy set of their greatest hits, solo performances from each member, and intricate choreography. The quartet—Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa—expressed their gratitude to the 70,000 fans in attendance, calling the experience an "epic dream." The successful show reinforces their status as the world's biggest girl group and is part of a tour expected to break their own record for highest-grossing by a female group.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) condominium in California, a new type of housing that can be sold separately from the main property it shares a lot with. This development comes a year after the city passed a landmark law to allow such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. Officials hope this ADU, located near the city's downtown, will serve as a model for other cities and become a new form of starter home amid the state's housing crisis. ADUs, or "granny flats," now account for approximately one-fifth of California's new housing growth.</p>

In the early 2000s, he promised Bruce Moss, conductor of the Wheaton Municipal Band in Illinois, that he would guest-conduct the band on his 100th birthday. Although his declining health prevented him from traveling, Gabriel was determined to honor his word. Last month, he conducted the band remotely from his home in Virginia, leading them through a performance and proving that "your word is your bond."</p>

          <p>Contrary to common belief, two new clinical trials in India suggest that moderate consumption of mangoes may be beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes. The studies found that replacing carbohydrates like white bread with mangoes resulted in a lower or similar glycemic response. In one eight-week trial, participants who ate 250g of mango for breakfast saw improvements in key metabolic health markers, including fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation and that the fruit should be consumed as part of a calorie-controlled diet, not in addition to it.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, has sparked conversation by altering an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant. The artwork, part of a larger tribute to the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win, depicts Bryant in his famous celebratory pose but swaps his gold Lakers jersey for a white and blue Dodgers one. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that while other locations of the restaurant feature Kobe murals, they wanted this one to fit the Dodgers theme while retaining the "Mamba mentality" feel. The piece has generated mixed reactions, but the artist and restaurant owner see it as a way to spark conversation and keep Bryant's legacy alive.</p>

          <p>At a VJ Day commemoration, 104-year-old World War II veteran Captain Yavar Abbas moved King Charles III and Queen Camilla to tears with an impromptu tribute. Instead of sticking to his prepared speech, Abbas saluted the King for attending despite his ongoing cancer treatment, also sharing that he himself has been cancer-free for 25 years. Abbas, who served as a combat cameraman for the British Indian Army in the Burma campaign, shared his extraordinary story of fighting against both British imperialism and fascism. Despite his service, he now reflects on war as futile, expressing sorrow that the world has not learned from the past.</p>

          <p>The iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, with standalone stores set to return to the UK High Street for the first time since its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020. Now owned by online retailer Asos, the brand is aiming to recapture both its nostalgic millennial followers and a new generation of Gen-Z shoppers. Industry experts note the challenge will be regaining its trendsetting "cool" in a competitive market dominated by fast-fashion giants like Shein. The brand's leadership is confident there is a gap in the market for its signature "London girl" aesthetic and plans to focus on product quality and value.</p>

          <p>Liverpool opened their Premier League season with a dramatic 4-2 victory over Bournemouth, with new £70m striker Hugo Ekitike making an immediate impact. Ekitike scored the opening goal and assisted another, delivering a superb individual performance that instantly won over the Anfield crowd. However, the win was not without concerns, as Liverpool's defense appeared vulnerable, allowing Bournemouth to equalize and keep the game tense until late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah. The match highlighted both the promise of Liverpool's new attacking talent and the defensive frailties that need to be addressed.</p>

          <p>The global bubble tea market is booming, with projected growth to nearly $4.8 billion by 2032, leading three major Chinese chains to list publicly in Hong Kong this year. Companies like Mixue Group, which now has more stores than McDonald's, are expanding rapidly through a franchise-heavy model that relies on selling ingredients and equipment to store owners. While this strategy fuels fast growth and attracts investors looking for consumer-focused sectors, it also raises challenges. Market saturation, intense price wars, and the difficulty of maintaining quality control are testing whether the industry can sustain its growth or if it is just a passing fad.

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a strong revival after a multi-year slowdown, with recent debuts like Bullish, Figma, and Circle seeing their stock prices soar on their first day of trading. This renewed investor enthusiasm is clearing a backlog of high-value private companies, and market leaders expect a healthy list of IPOs in the second half of the year. While the performance is welcome news for startups and venture capitalists, some analysts caution that the large first-day "pops" are creating a gap between institutional and retail valuations reminiscent of the dot-com bubble, questioning the sustainability of the trend.

          <p>Slate Automotive, an EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is pitching a simple, barebones electric pickup truck it claims can be sold for about half the average vehicle price in the U.S. The company's strategy is to minimize manufacturing costs on the base model and allow owners to customize it with over 100 planned accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. With over 100,000 reservations, Slate is targeting the price-conscious consumer, a key demographic in the EV market. However, the recent rollback of federal EV tax credits may challenge its sub-$20,000 price point, pitting it against more feature-rich competitors.</p>

Lee was so interested that he flew to Edinburgh to watch McCreadie perform live before hiring him. McCreadie's track "Stony Gate" is featured prominently in the film's score, marking a surreal and career-changing opportunity for the musician.</p>
