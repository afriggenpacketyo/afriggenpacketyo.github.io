          <p>The White House is set to host an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event on its grounds next year to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the nation's founding. The plan was announced by UFC President Dana White, a longtime friend of President Trump, who confirmed the event will happen and that he is coordinating the details with the administration. This marks the first time a professional fighting competition will be held at the White House, with discussions suggesting a cage could be built on the lawn to accommodate up to 25,000 spectators. The event is part of a broader series of celebrations planned across the country for the anniversary.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Viability of Debt Forgiveness Amid Steady Inflation and High Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 16:32:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a steady inflation rate providing some relief to consumers, financial analysis suggests that pursuing debt forgiveness remains a critical strategy for many Americans. The core issue is that while inflation is around 2.7%, average credit card interest rates are near a punishing 22%, creating a massive gap that quickly erodes personal finances. The article argues that the current stable economic environment, before potential headwinds like new tariffs take full effect, presents an opportune moment to aggressively tackle high-interest debt. Waiting for external conditions to improve is a gamble, as the opportunity cost of paying high interest rates prevents building crucial savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets surged on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 moving toward a record high, following the release of better-than-expected inflation data. The July consumer price index showed a 2.7% annual increase, the same as June and slightly below economists' forecasts, which bolstered investor optimism. The steady data increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will proceed with an interest rate cut at its September meeting. Traders on Wall Street are now pricing in a 94% chance of a cut, believing the central bank has more leeway to ease monetary policy without fueling runaway inflation.</p>

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to new estimates from policy experts. This projected increase would be slightly higher than the 2.5% COLA received in 2025, offering a modest boost to benefits to help offset rising prices. The official COLA is calculated by the Social Security Administration based on inflation data from July, August, and September and is typically announced in October. The current projection is based on the July Consumer Price Index, with two more months of data still needed for the final calculation.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Interest Earnings on a $50,000 Deposit in a CD Versus a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers with a significant deposit, weighing the benefits of a $50,000 certificate of deposit (CD) against a high-yield savings account. While high-yield savings accounts may currently offer slightly higher variable interest rates, CDs provide the security of a fixed rate for a set term. This can be more advantageous in the long run, especially if the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates, which would cause savings account yields to fall. The choice depends on a saver's risk tolerance and their outlook on future interest rate movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been rescued after surviving for nine days alone in the remote Canadian wilderness of British Columbia. Andrew Barber, who was reported missing on July 31, used his survival skills to build a shelter from moss and sticks and stayed hydrated by drinking pond water. To signal for help, he carved the word "HELP" on a large rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud. A helicopter search team eventually spotted his truck and then found him near his shelter, severely dehydrated but alive. Rescuers noted he was lucky to have been found when he was.</p>

          <p>Shares of Circle Internet Group rose after the company, in its first quarterly report since going public, announced a 53% jump in revenue to $658.1 million. The strong performance was driven by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin. Despite this growth, the company posted a net loss of $482.1 million, which was primarily due to non-cash charges related to its IPO, including stock-based compensation. The results reflect growing institutional interest in stablecoins, especially following the passage of new crypto legislation supportive of the technology.</p>
