          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 09:43:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia is investing $1.1 billion to develop and deploy a fleet of underwater attack drones, known as "Ghost Sharks," with the first delivery expected in January. Defense Minister Richard Marles emphasized Australia's leading role in autonomous underwater military capabilities, noting that these drones will enhance undersea warfare capabilities and complement the country's future fleet of U.S. nuclear-powered submarines. The Ghost Sharks will be used for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike operations, and can be launched from both the shore and surface ships, bolstering Australia's defense strategy amid concerns over sea route security and China's growing naval presence in the region. The drones are designed to operate in increasingly congested undersea environments and are expected to provide a capability advantage for allies and partners.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to maintain its interest rates, citing ongoing economic uncertainty influenced by U.S. tariffs. The key deposit facility rate remains at 2%, consistent with the previous decision, as the ECB adopts a data-dependent approach without pre-committing to future rate adjustments. ECB President Christine Lagarde acknowledged that while recent trade agreements have reduced some uncertainty, the trade policy environment remains volatile, potentially impacting exports, investment, and consumption. Economists are divided on whether further rate cuts are likely, with some suggesting that tariffs and a stronger euro could warrant additional easing later in the year, while others believe the easing cycle has concluded due to the eurozone's resilient economy.

The national average savings account interest rate is 0.39%, while top high-yield savings account rates range from 4.15% to 4.35%. It suggests choosing a high-yield savings account, looking at online banks, and comparing different accounts to secure the best rate. Online banks often offer higher rates due to lower overhead costs, and setting up an account is quick and easy. Optimism score for this article is 75. (not investment advice)</p>

It highlights the differences between national average rates and the best rates available, advising readers to look at online banks for competitive rates. Short-term CDs are currently offering higher rates than longer-term ones due to the inverted yield curve, and laddering CDs is suggested as a practical approach to long-term savings.

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a decades-long ban on working rights for long-term refugees from Myanmar living in camps near the border, a move prompted by cuts in foreign aid, particularly from the U.S. This policy shift will allow approximately 80,000 refugees to support themselves and their families, and is viewed as a potential regional benchmark for refugee solutions. The UNHCR welcomed the move, and aid groups praised the decision, noting that it will stimulate the local economy. The Thai government may also have been influenced by a decline in its migrant labor force. Optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs survey, family offices are increasing their investments in public equities while reducing their allocations to private equity.
