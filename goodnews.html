          <h2>US Economy Exceeds Expectations with 3% Q2 Growth Despite Tariff Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 11:10:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a robust 3% annual rate in the second quarter, significantly surpassing analyst predictions and reversing a prior decline. This stronger-than-expected growth was primarily fueled by a substantial turnaround in the trade balance and renewed consumer spending, occurring even amidst President Trump's tariff policies. Despite this positive GDP report, the Federal Reserve is widely anticipated to maintain current interest rates, resisting presidential pressure to lower them due to persistent inflation risks and concerns about tariff impacts. The article highlights that while the headline number is strong, underlying measures like final sales to private domestic purchasers showed a slowdown, indicating a complex economic landscape that requires careful monitoring of demand.

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has unveiled his vision for "personal superintelligence," emphasizing individual empowerment over automation, a stance he contrasts with other industry approaches. This strategic direction follows Meta's substantial investment of billions in acquiring top AI researchers and engineers in recent weeks, leading to the establishment of Meta Superintelligence Labs under Alexandr Wang. The company aims to develop foundational AI models like the open-source Llama family, signaling that the rest of this decade will be decisive for AI's trajectory and its societal impact. This article highlights Meta's commitment to prioritizing superintelligence as a tool for personal empowerment, rather than a force for widespread job automation, despite past expensive ventures like the metaverse.</p>

          <h2>Experts Caution Against Viral Watermelon-Only Weight Loss Diet</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 11:00:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "watermelon diet," a viral TikTok trend promoting rapid weight loss and detox through exclusive watermelon consumption for several days, is drawing criticism from health experts. While watermelon offers hydration and some benefits, physicians like Dr. Mark Hyman warn that this restrictive diet severely lacks essential nutrients like protein, healthy fats, and fiber, potentially leading to temporary water and muscle loss rather than sustainable fat reduction. Nutritionists agree a strict watermelon diet is unsustainable and can cause electrolyte imbalances, blood sugar spikes, and negative impacts on mood and sleep. The article stresses that true, long-term health improvement comes from diverse, nutrient-dense foods, quality sleep, stress management, and movement, not internet fads.</p>

          <p>Marking its tenth anniversary, Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), is experiencing renewed optimism and a brighter future despite past struggles and increasing competition from rivals like Solana. Recent positive developments, including the signing of the first-ever U.S. crypto law on stablecoins (most of which are issued on Ethereum), Circle's successful IPO, and new leadership at the Ethereum foundation, are significantly attracting institutional investors. While ETH's price currently trades near $4,000, below its 2021 peak, experts like Avichal Garg foresee an "institutional arc" for the cryptocurrency in the next four to five years, driven by the tokenization of traditional assets. This article emphasizes Ethereum's foundational commitment to a maximally decentralized network as its key advantage for managing vast sums of assets. (not investment advice)</p>
