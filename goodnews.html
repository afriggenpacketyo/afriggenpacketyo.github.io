          <p>Dustin May's inconsistent performance with his sweeper pitch proved costly as the Dodgers lost to the Atlanta Braves 4-3. May gave up two home runs to Austin Riley, both resulting from poorly executed sweepers, which ultimately determined the outcome of the game. While May was effective outside of those pitches, his recent struggles highlight the challenges he faces in maintaining consistency after returning from elbow surgeries. The Dodgers' offense struggled against Braves starter Bryce Elder, failing to provide May with adequate run support despite a late home run by Miguel Rojas. The article emphasizes the importance of May's sweeper pitch to his success and his recent frustrations with its inconsistency.</p>
