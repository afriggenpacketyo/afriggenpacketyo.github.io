          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has agreed to disband after 41 years of armed insurgency against the Turkish state, a decision greeted with both celebration and questions. Experts suggest the move could fundamentally alter Turkey's political landscape, impacting parties like the pro-Kurdish DEM. Key uncertainties remain, including the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential for a new organization to emerge. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan emphasized that merely laying down arms is insufficient; the PKK must dismantle its illegal structures and adopt an accountable organizational model.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom driven by pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications, Wegovy and Ozempic. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Denmark's growth to moderate in the coming years but believes potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry will have limited impact. Danish drugmakers rely on a 'merchanting and processing' system, with most value attributed to intellectual property and manufacturing contracted to other countries. The IMF notes that direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are expected to be limited, but heightened trade tensions pose risks.</p>

Trump lauded al-Sharaa, a former insurgent, contrasting with past U.S. policy. The Qatari base houses approximately 8,000 U.S. troops, and Qatar has invested significantly in its development. Trump and the emir of Qatar signed agreements, including a deal for Qatar to purchase American-made MQ-9B drones.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of stockpiled rice to address near-record high prices, potentially releasing 100,000 tons per month for three months. This supplements the 321,000 tons auctioned between March and April. The decision comes after average rice prices rose to record highs before recently declining. The shortage is attributed to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 274,000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs in the U.S. due to a potential brake issue. The front brake lines may contact the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, leading to brake fluid leaks and loss of brake function. The recall affects models from 2022 to 2024, with Ford estimating that 1% of these vehicles have the defect. Dealers will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe if necessary, free of charge. Impacted drivers may experience increased pedal travel or a red brake warning light.</p>

          <p>Winning the Eurovision Song Contest requires a combination of spectacle, inspiration, and uniqueness, according to a New York Times analysis of winning acts since 2000. The key is to sing about personal liberation, preferably in English, and allude to folk music without sending a full folk song. Forget dramatic key changes, and go all-out on staging, using fire if possible. The article warns against sending a novelty act but encourages being just weird enough to stand out. The article includes examples of past winners and losers.</p>

          <p>A Communist Party journal in China suggests the nation has the financial capacity to establish a market stabilization fund, citing a robust economy and substantial foreign exchange reserves. The journal emphasizes the importance of stabilizing the market amidst economic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions. It highlights that China's enhanced regulatory capabilities can ensure the effective operation of such a fund. The article notes that similar mechanisms have been successfully employed by major economies during stock market downturns, including Hong Kong's interventions during the 1997 Asian financial crisis.</p>

          <p>Japan's antitrust watchdog unveiled draft guidelines to regulate smartphone software services of Google and Apple, aiming to promote competition. The law, effective in December, prevents the tech giants from excluding competitors from their app stores. It also prohibits using data from their app stores or operating systems for their own products. The law seeks to prevent unfair treatment of software suppliers, such as product screening outside normal assessments. The commission hopes to reduce prices and improve access to convenient apps for consumers.</p>
