          <p>At a security forum, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pledged to reinforce America's alliances in Asia, amidst global uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs and strained relations with Western allies. Hegseth emphasized the importance of maintaining strong security partnerships, signaling a rare instance of continuity in security policy. This commitment aims to reassure allies in the region and counter potential threats, particularly in light of growing tensions and shifting geopolitical dynamics. The defense secretary's remarks highlight the U.S.'s ongoing focus on maintaining stability and influence in the Asian region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faith Salie examines the pervasive use of corporate buzzwords and their impact on workplace communication, noting that while intended to foster inclusion, jargon often undermines trust. Studies reveal that employees who feel lower in status tend to use more jargon, possibly as a coping mechanism. The article suggests that these buzzwords are often metaphors used to distract from the primary goal of making money. Salie advocates for clear, human language over corporate jargon, recommending poetry as a more authentic outlet for metaphorical expression.</p>

          <p>Laura Kuenssberg previews the UK's upcoming strategic defence review, which seeks to address the challenges posed by a "new, dangerous era" marked by a resurgent Russia and an increasingly assertive China. The review will emphasize the importance of nuclear weapons, NATO commitments, and modernizing the armed forces with technologies like drones. It also stresses the need for greater public involvement in national resilience, potentially including expanding cadet forces and bolstering military reserves. The review aims to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and potentially 3% by 2034, though some critics question whether this is sufficient to meet current defence plans and growing ambitions.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House next week, marking the first in-person meeting between the two leaders. Discussions will focus on bilateral relations and pressing international issues, including Russia's war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, and trade policy. Merz, who assumed office on May 6, has been actively involved in diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire and maintain Western support for Ukraine. The meeting also aims to address and potentially defuse trade tensions between the European Union and the United States, as Trump had threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from the EU.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist specializing in youth development, suggests five straightforward rules for parents: trust your instincts, embrace your culture, follow your child's interests, prioritize enjoyment over strict development, and be authentic. She emphasizes that parenting doesn't need to be overly complicated or driven by external pressures from influencers or clickbait. Instead, she advises parents to focus on creating a joyful and supportive environment where children can thrive by exploring their passions and developing emotional intelligence. Ross encourages parents to trust their inherent abilities and cultural traditions while adapting to their child's unique needs.</p>

          <p>Sophie and Rocky Goldie purchased a 37.5-acre homestead in rural Kentucky for $390,000 and have since invested $13,000 in DIY renovations, transforming the property with a vision of self-sustainability. The couple, who secured a 30-year mortgage, plan to pay it off in under five years by doing most of the renovation work themselves, including clearing land, gardening, and caring for over 30 animals. Sophie, inspired by the homestead, also founded a skincare company, while Rocky discovered a new identity outside of his previous career. Their biggest takeaway is recognizing the significant impact individuals can have on the planet by stewarding a piece of land.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, outperforming his McLaren teammate Lando Norris, suggesting that a recent rule change aimed at limiting front wing flexing had minimal impact on McLaren's performance. The FIA introduced the rule after lobbying from Red Bull and Ferrari, hoping to reduce McLaren's aerodynamic advantage. Piastri noted the team's strong weekend performance, while Norris attributed his second-place finish to minor errors during his final run.
