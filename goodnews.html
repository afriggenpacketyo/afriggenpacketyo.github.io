          <p>Manchester United has made a formal offer for RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, with the total package potentially reaching 85 million euros (£73.8 million). The bid includes a guaranteed payment of 75 million euros, which the club believes is an appropriate valuation for the Slovenian forward. United is reportedly confident that the player is interested in a move to Old Trafford and is considering letting Rasmus Hojlund leave to accommodate the new signing. Newcastle has also shown interest, submitting a rival bid for the player.</p>

          <p>As Japan marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the focus is shifting towards preserving the first-person accounts of the aging survivors, known as "hibakusha." With the number of survivors dwindling, individuals and organizations are working to ensure their stories of the horrific event are not lost to time. The article highlights the efforts of a 12-year-old "successor" in Hiroshima who guides tourists and shares the history of the attack. The goal is to use the truth of the past to advocate for a future free of nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Contrary to common assumptions about their digital fluency, Gen Z employees are the least likely to prefer fully remote work, according to a new Gallup report. Only 23% of Gen Z workers favor an exclusively remote setup, compared to 35% of older generations. The report suggests this preference stems from a desire for in-person mentorship, clearer integration into the company's mission, and a need to combat loneliness. A significant 71% of Gen Z employees favor a hybrid model, indicating a strong craving for face-to-face connection in the workplace.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) present a secure savings option with returns that can outpace inflation, allowing savers to lock in high rates for a fixed term. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top online banks are offering significantly more competitive rates, with some 1-year CDs yielding around 4.40% APY. The article notes an inverted yield curve phenomenon, where short-term CDs currently offer higher rates than long-term ones. To maximize returns, savers are advised to compare offers from online banks and consider a CD laddering strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A perinatal psychiatrist expresses deep concern over recent public discussions by an FDA advisory panel that shared significant misinformation about the use of SSRIs during pregnancy. The author argues that overstating risks and denouncing the medications deters necessary treatment for the one in five pregnant women who struggle with conditions like depression and anxiety. Citing robust data, the article asserts that untreated perinatal mental health issues pose real harms, while large studies show SSRIs do not cause a rise in major birth defects. The author calls for evidence-based care.</p>
