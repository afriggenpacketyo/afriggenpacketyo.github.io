          <p>The UK and the US have finalized a tariff agreement that reduces or eliminates tariffs on specific UK exports, including cars, steel, and aluminum, although blanket tariffs imposed by President Trump remain in place for most goods. For cars, import taxes have been cut to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, while steel and aluminum tariffs have been scrapped, which is significant news for firms like British Steel. Pharmaceuticals remain a big unknown in the deal, and there was no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms; instead, the countries agreed to work on a digital trade deal. The UK government said work will continue on remaining sectors and reciprocal tariffs.</p>
