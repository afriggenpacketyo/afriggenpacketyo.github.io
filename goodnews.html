          <p>Oracle's stock rose after the company confirmed a significant cloud-computing deal with Meta, the parent company of Facebook. During its AI World conference, Oracle announced it had secured $65 billion in new cloud infrastructure commitments from four customers in just 30 days, with Meta being one of them. This partnership is part of a broader trend of major tech companies investing heavily in the infrastructure required for their artificial intelligence initiatives. Oracle also projected substantial growth in its AI-powered database revenue, signaling strong demand beyond its well-known customer, OpenAI.</p>

          <p>EssilorLuxottica, the parent company of Ray-Ban, announced that its partnership with Meta on smart glasses significantly contributed to its third-quarter revenue growth. The eyewear giant's sales grew by 11.7%, with over a third of that increase attributed to the wearables category, which includes the Ray-Ban Meta products. The company's CFO expressed strong optimism about the future of smart glasses, suggesting they will eventually replace many smartphone functions. This success comes as Meta continues to invest heavily in the technology, with new models and brands like Oakley and Prada joining the collaboration.</p>

          <p>While debt settlement can offer relief for unsecured debts like credit card balances, many types of financial obligations do not qualify for such programs. This article explains that secured debts, such as mortgages and auto loans, are typically excluded because lenders can repossess the collateral. Other ineligible categories include federal student loans, which have their own specific repayment and forgiveness programs, as well as tax debts, child support, alimony, and court-ordered fines. For these types of debts, individuals may need to consider alternative solutions like bankruptcy or specialized government repayment plans instead of traditional debt settlement.</p>

          <h2>With Mortgage Rates Dropping, Experts Advise Homebuyers on Strategic Next Steps</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates for a 30-year loan have fallen to their lowest level in a month, creating a new opportunity for prospective homebuyers. Experts advise that buyers should act strategically by first getting pre-approved for a loan to strengthen their position with sellers. However, they also caution against assuming rates will continue to fall, as market conditions can change quickly, and recommend starting the home search now rather than waiting for the traditional spring season. Increased buyer competition is expected due to the lower rates, so being prepared for a more aggressive market is crucial for success.</p>

          <p>The J. M. Smucker Company has filed a lawsuit against Trader Joe's, accusing the grocery chain of trademark infringement over its crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

          <p>The UCLA football team's offense has seen a dramatic turnaround since tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel was promoted to playcaller and brought in his former mentor, Noel Mazzone, as an advisor. After a winless start to the season, the Bruins' offense has nearly tripled its scoring average in its last two victories. Neuheisel, a former backup quarterback at UCLA under then-offensive coordinator Mazzone, has implemented a similar offensive philosophy focused on creating space and matchups. The reunion has injected new energy into the team, reviving its season and highlighting the strong bond between the two coaches.</p>
