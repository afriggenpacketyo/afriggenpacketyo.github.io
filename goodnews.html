          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, has lost her appeal against a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred through a social media post targeting migrants. Connolly's tweet, which called for "mass deportation now" and urged followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers, was viewed over 310,000 times before it was deleted. The Court of Appeal upheld the original sentence, stating that there was no arguable basis to deem it manifestly excessive. Connolly had pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred at Birmingham Crown Court.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, strong supplier partnerships, and ongoing productivity improvements. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's announcement that it would need to increase prices to offset tariff costs. Home Depot's full-year sales forecast remains unchanged, with expectations of 2.8% total sales growth and a 1% increase in comparable sales, assuming current tariff agreements remain in place. The company missed Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations, but beat sales estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahmed Ebid, a UK-based people smuggler, has been sentenced to 25 years in jail for organizing the illegal transport of nearly 3,800 migrants from North Africa to Italy, some of whom eventually reached Britain. Ebid's operation, which generated approximately ¬£12 million, involved using fishing boats for the crossings between October 2022 and June 2023. This marks the first conviction of someone organizing Mediterranean boat crossings from the UK. Ebid himself arrived in the UK on a small boat in 2022 after serving a five-year sentence in Italy for attempted drug smuggling and had applied for asylum.</p>

          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a supplier to major UK supermarkets like Tesco, Sainsbury's, and Aldi, has been targeted in a ransomware attack, disrupting its operations. The attack has led to concerns about potential food waste and supply chain disruptions, with one customer reporting that thousands of products could be lost if deliveries are not made promptly. While larger retailers have faced cyber attacks recently, this incident highlights the vulnerability of smaller logistics firms.

          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora, Mexico, is working to conserve jaguars by transforming them from threats to valuable assets for ranchers. The Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of wild cats taken on their land, incentivizing them to protect jaguars and their prey. The program has expanded the protected area for jaguars and has shifted local attitudes towards the animals. However, the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico poses a significant threat to the jaguars' ability to return to their historic range in the American Southwest.</p>
