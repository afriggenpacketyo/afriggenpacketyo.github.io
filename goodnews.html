          <p>Temu and Shein face new trade challenges in the U.S. due to the closure of a tariff loophole and increased duties on Chinese imports. Despite these hurdles, experts believe they will remain competitive by accelerating localization strategies, onboarding American sellers, and utilizing local warehouses. Temu has already shifted to exclusively offering goods shipped from U.S. warehouses, while Shein is expanding its supply chain to countries like Turkey and Mexico. While prices have risen, experts are confident that both companies will continue to offer competitive prices due to their agile supply chains and ability to operate on thin margins.</p>

The company cited weaker sales in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, due to subdued consumer demand. Despite these challenges, Hugo Boss confirmed its 2025 outlook, projecting full-year sales between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros, while closely monitoring economic developments and trade tensions.</p>
