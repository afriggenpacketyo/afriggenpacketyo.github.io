This announcement comes as the administration pressures Apple to move its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Despite this, key tech products like smartphones have so far remained exempt from the administration's recent tariff hikes.

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com reveals that median home prices are declining in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West, compared to their 2022 peak. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops, attributed to a boom in housing construction and increased inventory as homes remain on the market longer. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and limited supply due to stricter building regulations and high demand. This regional divergence creates a split housing market, offering some relief to buyers in certain areas. (not investment advice)</p>

The luxury vessel, featuring a helipad and a pool, will be sold via a sealed-bid auction requiring potential buyers to have a net worth of at least $500 million. A holding company disputes the ownership, claiming the yacht belongs to a non-sanctioned individual and warning that the sale will be legally challenged.

          <p>An unexploded 250-kilogram British bomb from World War II was discovered in Dresden, Germany, leading to the evacuation of approximately 17,000 people from the city's Old Town. The evacuation area included famous landmarks like the rebuilt Frauenkirche church. The ordnance was found during clearance work for a bridge that collapsed in 2024. Such discoveries remain common in Germany, highlighting the lingering dangers of the war even 80 years later. This event follows a similar large-scale evacuation in Cologne, where three unexploded bombs were found in June.</p>

          <h2>Experts Weigh Pros and Cons of Reverse Mortgages Versus Selling a Home for Retirees</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising living costs pressuring retirees on fixed incomes, homeowners are increasingly considering tapping into their home equity. Experts advise that a reverse mortgage can be a valuable tool for those who wish to remain in their homes and need supplemental income, as it provides funds without a monthly repayment obligation. However, it reduces the inheritance left to heirs and comes with fees and interest. Selling the home is often better for those looking to relocate, downsize, or cash out in a strong market, but it can have tax implications. (not investment advice)</p>

Both nations face challenges from militant groups operating near their shared border and are seeking coordinated engagement, including intelligence sharing. The partnership is notable as Pakistan also cultivates a closer relationship with the United States, a source of tension for Iran. Analysts believe Pakistan is unlikely to act as a platform for hostile action against Iran, and may even serve as a diplomatic conduit.</p>
