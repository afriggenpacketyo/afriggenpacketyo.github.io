          <p>Junior Alvarado, the jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory at the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days for violating Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority rules. The Kentucky Board of Stewards determined that Alvarado struck Sovereignty eight times with his riding crop, exceeding the permitted six times during the race. This marked Alvarado's second violation in 180 days, leading to a doubled fine. Sovereignty, owned by Godolphin, will not run in the Preakness Stakes but is expected to participate in the Belmont Stakes.</p>

The discussions, involving Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland, aim to de-escalate trade tensions. President Trump has suggested the U.S. could lower tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first. High tariffs have disrupted trade between the two countries, which exceeded $660 billion last year.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million. Cohen-Roth gained the victim's trust while preparing her taxes and offered fake "investment opportunities" with promised high interest rates. The scheme, which ran from 2013 to 2019, involved Cohen-Roth using the victim's savings and a reverse mortgage to fund a lavish lifestyle and pay off earlier investors in a Ponzi scheme.
