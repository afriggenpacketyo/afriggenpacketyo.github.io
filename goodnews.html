        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of American state fairs, tracing their origins from 19th-century agricultural competitions to the large-scale entertainment events they are today. The first state fair, held in Syracuse, New York, in 1841, focused on livestock and farming showcases, which remain a core element. Over time, fairs evolved to include arts and crafts, elaborate food offerings like deep-fried treats, and major musical performances. Despite their transformation into pop-up theme parks, fairs continue to celebrate their agricultural roots and contribute significantly to the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Moravia Park Elementary School in East Baltimore hosted its third annual Million Fathers March, drawing a large crowd of fathers and male role models to support their children's education. The event, which saw double the number of male participants compared to last year, aims to foster community and highlight the importance of paternal engagement. Fathers and their children participated in activities before walking into the school to cheers, reinforcing the partnership between families and educators. The national initiative emphasizes that actively engaged fathers contribute to better academic outcomes and stronger self-esteem in children.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand All Blacks have secured the Bledisloe Cup for the 23rd consecutive year after a 33-24 victory over Australia in Auckland. Despite a strong comeback from the Wallabies, who narrowed a significant deficit to just three points, a late try from Cam Roigard sealed the win for the home side. The victory not only extends New Zealand's unbeaten streak at Eden Park to 52 matches but also places the All Blacks at the top of the Rugby Championship standings ahead of their final match next weekend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The urban planning principles long championed by King Charles are set to inspire a new wave of government-planned towns in England. His vision, which favors traditional architecture, walkable communities, and environmental harmony, was once criticized but is now entering the mainstream. A housing ministry official outlined plans for 12 new towns that will feature "gentle density," such as terraced housing, over high-rises, echoing the design of the King's projects like Poundbury. This approach marks a shift away from car-centric post-war designs towards creating more sustainable and community-focused living spaces.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to host a global summit focused on women's rights, expected to take place in October. The foreign ministry stated that the nation is not just an advocate but an "active actor" in promoting gender equality and has made significant advancements in recent decades. The event is anticipated to draw international officials and organizations, though domestic grassroots NGOs may not be invited unless sponsored by overseas entities. The announcement comes shortly after the publication of books by President Xi Jinping covering topics from gender equality to traditional family values.</p>

          <p>After the remains of over 100 soldiers were discovered at a construction site in France, a specialized UK Ministry of Defence unit has identified two Scottish soldiers killed in the Battle of Loos during World War One. The "war detectives" used artifacts, including regimental badges and unusual tramway buttons, to narrow down the identities. DNA testing with living relatives confirmed the remains belonged to Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan. The soldiers were finally laid to rest with full military honors, bringing closure to their families after more than 100 years.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and landslides in western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their crucial role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communications down, pilots from commercial companies and private networks were among the first to witness the destruction and conduct rescues. They flew hundreds of missions, airlifting stranded residents and dropping essential supplies like medicine and food. Their efforts, coordinated with groups like the United Cajun Navy, were vital in the first days before larger-scale relief operations could be established.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada puts a spotlight on the significant financial gap in the sport. England, the world's best-funded team with full-time professional players, faces a Canadian side whose athletes earn a fraction of their English counterparts and rely on fundraising to cover costs. Despite the resource disparity, Canada has proven to be a formidable opponent, with many of its players gaining experience in England's professional league. The match is seen not just as a contest for the title, but as a test case for the impact of professional investment in women's rugby.</p>

The piece contrasts this with the 2014 winning team, whose members, like plumber Marlie Packer, had to take unpaid leave to compete. The diverse backgrounds of the players, from teachers to painters, underscore the dedication required before full-time contracts became available and the transformative impact of professionalism.</p>

          <p>A new peace movement appears to be gaining traction in Germany, with large-scale demonstrations planned against ongoing global conflicts. A recent rally in Berlin, organized in part by politician Sahra Wagenknecht, drew over 10,000 people calling for the German government to support peace negotiations and halt all arms deliveries to war zones. The movement unites a diverse group of artists, activists, and citizens concerned with the wars in both Gaza and Ukraine. While currently fragmented, observers note the potential for these initiatives to grow into a more powerful, unified movement.</p>

Reeves argues that an exchange scheme for workers aged 18 to 30 would be beneficial for economic growth and businesses. She has urged the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential positive economic impact of such a deal into its forecasts ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposal, which critics have likened to a partial return to freedom of movement, aims to create a time-limited visa without a right to remain.</p>
