          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, returned to Massachusetts after spending six weeks in ICE detention in Louisiana. Ozturk was arrested in Somerville, Massachusetts, and her visa was revoked allegedly due to an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. During a press conference, Ozturk expressed her faith in the American justice system and gratitude for the support she received. She also highlighted the plight of other women in immigration detention, urging people not to forget them, and plans to continue her legal fight to restore her visa and exonerate herself.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously suggests expanding Father's Day into a month-long celebration, following Mother's Day. He proposes a system where fathers receive presents on even days and are left alone on odd days, creating a "Ramadad" of sorts. While acknowledging the concept is new and may not be implemented this year, Gaffigan playfully argues that fathers deserve extended recognition. He emphasizes the importance of honoring mothers on Mother's Day but envisions a future where fathers are celebrated for 35 days leading up to Father's Day.</p>

          <p>Argentine boxer Fernando Martinez retained his WBA super flyweight title against Japan's Kazuto Ioka by unanimous decision in a 12-round match. This rematch followed Martinez's previous victory over Ioka in July 2024. Ioka, a four-time world champion, briefly gained momentum by flooring Martinez in the 10th round but was unable to secure the win. With the loss, Ioka's record falls to 31 wins, 4 losses, and 1 draw, while Martinez remains undefeated with 18 wins.</p>
