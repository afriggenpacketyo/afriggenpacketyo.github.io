          <p>Frank Bisignano, the newly appointed head of the Social Security Administration (SSA), told agency staff that he had to Google the job to understand it after being offered the position by the Trump administration.

He assured staff that Social Security is "not going away" and that President Trump supports the agency. Bisignano also addressed concerns about potential cuts from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and emphasized the need for a "digital-first" mindset, comparing the agency's services to those of Amazon.</p>

          <p>House Oversight Chairman James Comer has requested transcribed interviews with former President Joe Biden's White House physician, Kevin O'Connor, and several former aides to assess Biden's mental fitness and use of an autopen. Comer cited Biden's recent cancer diagnosis and new allegations of mental impairments as reasons for the investigation. The committee seeks to determine whether administration officials were performing presidential duties for Biden, and is exploring potential legislation to oversee presidents' fitness to serve. The requests come amid concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities and his administration's alleged attempts to cover them up.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from firing half of the Department of Education's workforce and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration. Judge Myong Joun ruled that the administration's actions were unlawful and would effectively make it impossible for the Department to carry out its mandated functions. The ruling is in response to a challenge from state attorneys general, schools, and nonprofits who argued that the president cannot unilaterally shut down a federal department created by Congress. The Trump administration plans to challenge the ruling.</p>

The agreement follows a lengthy dispute over the islands and questions over Britain's colonial legacy.

He contends that the era of supposed market worship was actually one of progressive government policy, and that wage stagnation occurred primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, not during the neoliberal era. Brooks also points out that American manufacturing jobs have declined due to increased productivity, not just foreign competition, and that the American economy has significantly outperformed other rich economies in recent decades.</p>
