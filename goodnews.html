        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to eliminate 201 NHS-related organizations, including patient advocacy group Healthwatch England and the whistleblower support office. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the goal is to simplify a complex system and focus resources on frontline care, moving toward "more doers and fewer checkers." The reforms are part of Labour's new 10-year health strategy, which will also trial a system linking hospital funding directly to patient satisfaction ratings. Critics caution that the vital functions of these abolished bodies must be preserved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement without requiring open-skull surgery, a method notably used by Elon Musk's Neuralink. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature via a neck vein, which reportedly reduces surgical risk and recovery time. The development could represent a significant advancement in neurotechnology, offering a safer alternative for treating paralysis.</p>

          <p>Despite not playing their best baseball, the Los Angeles Dodgers managed a 5-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals, taking sole possession of the best record in the majors. The game was marked by a short outing from pitcher Dustin May, several defensive errors, and inconsistent offense. However, a two-run homer from Max Muncy and key hits from Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts provided enough of a lead. The bullpen, anchored by Tanner Scott, secured the win by inducing a game-ending double play with the bases loaded, highlighting the team's ability to grind out wins even during sloppy performances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet may be associated with a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security, assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. Researchers found that among nearly 12,500 employees, those who adhered to a Japanese diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. The study suggests that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, prevalent in the diet, may contribute to improved mental well-being.</p>

Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The escape, which Governor Jeff Landry called the worst in recent state history, has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. With Massey's capture, only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>Sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the creators and stars of the BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," discuss the dark and topical themes of their show. The series, which follows two sisters and their mother navigating financial and romantic struggles, draws inspiration from their own all-woman household upbringing and what they call a "bleak" modern dating scene. Sadler, the writer, explains that the show satirizes the idea of being single as a "worst nightmare" while also tackling taboo subjects like mental health and abortion with a uniquely dark sense of humor, which she says has been fully endorsed by their mother.</p>

Rich in minerals and dietary fiber, the plant, known as Opuntia, is being hailed as a "superfood." Research from Chubu University suggests it may have immune-boosting properties. As climate change and population growth strain global food supplies, experts at the UN and elsewhere see the resilient, drought-tolerant cactus as a potential staple food for the future, capable of thriving in harsh conditions while providing nutrition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As antibiotic resistance becomes a growing global health crisis, scientists are revisiting a century-old idea: using bacteriophages, or phages, to treat infections. Phages are viruses that specifically target and kill bacteria, offering a potential alternative to conventional drugs. A BBC correspondent participated in a project, successfully finding a phage in his toilet that could kill a patient's recurring infection in a lab setting. While the path to widespread clinical use is still being charted, phage therapy is available on compassionate grounds in the UK, and regulators are creating frameworks to support its development.</p>
