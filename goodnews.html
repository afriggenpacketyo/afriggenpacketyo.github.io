          <h2>China Addresses Property Sector Concerns with Policy Support</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 01:43:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier Li Qiang's recent statements and escalated policy support signal Beijing's ongoing concerns about the property sector, which has been a drag on China's economic growth and consumption. Analysts believe that while there is no immediate solution, Beijing is increasingly aware of the impact on overall sentiment and domestic demand, especially given the external economic turmoil. A State Council meeting emphasized the need to optimize existing policies, enhance implementation synergy, stabilize expectations, stimulate demand, and mitigate risks. Specific measures include a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, with urban-renewal projects receiving more land supply and financing aid, ultimately aiming to halt the decline and stabilize the sector. Optimism hinges on the effectiveness of these measures in revitalizing the property market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to return to pitching, starting against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB game as a pitcher since August 2023, after recovering from right elbow surgery. Ohtani's return was expedited due to injuries in the Dodgers' bullpen, and he is expected to pitch short innings. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts noted Ohtani's eagerness to return to the mound, and Ohtani demonstrated his strong batting form, going 3-for-3 with two runs in a recent game. Meanwhile, rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki's return is uncertain due to a right shoulder impingement, leading the team to plan for the possibility of continuing without him this year.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has firmly stated his determination to proceed with plans to cut the benefits bill, despite potential opposition within the Labour Party. MPs are set to vote on measures aimed at reducing benefits spending by ¬£5 billion by 2030, including proposals that would make it more difficult for disabled individuals with less severe conditions to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP). Starmer emphasized that the current system is not functioning effectively for those who need support or for taxpayers, and he believes that reform is necessary and achievable. The government aims to address the system's shortcomings through these changes.</p>

          <p>Angel Gomes, once considered one of English football's brightest prospects, discusses his experiences at Manchester United and his decision to leave for Lille. Gomes acknowledges the pressure of playing for United and suggests it may have impacted some players, but does not see it as the sole reason for his departure. He is now moving to Marseille and reflects on his upbringing at United, his thoughts on why he and others have thrived away from Old Trafford, and his views on overcoming size and 'favouritism' jibes. The midfielder aims to carve out a successful career path distinct from the expectations placed upon him early on.</p>

          <p>Japanese sportswear company ASICS plans to increase its manufacturing in India to 40% in the coming years to ensure a steady supply, due to new government regulations that have temporarily halted imports of footwear. The Indian government's mandate for quality certifications has prompted ASICS to strategically develop local production capabilities. ASICS India aims to open its first brand-owned store this year and plans to open three new franchise stores per month, projecting revenue growth of 35%-37% in India for 2024‚Äì25. The move is aimed at capitalizing on the growing fitness culture and rising interest in sports among Indian consumers.</p>

          <p>Hospice staff are at the center of the debate over the assisted dying bill, which would allow terminally ill adults to medically end their lives. Staff at Rowcroft Hospice express uncertainty about how the bill would affect their services and concern about funding shortages for palliative care. Some staff members are unsure about administering medication to end someone's life, while others emphasize the importance of respecting patient choice.

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, experienced a significant surge following a non-binding takeover offer by an Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company-led group. The consortium, which includes ADNOC's investment arm XRG, Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co, and Carlyle Group, offered a cash price of $5.76 per share. Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend the offer to shareholders, pending a superior proposal. This move comes as XRG seeks deals in natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions, and would grant the consortium control of multiple Australian LNG operations.</p>

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense posture, enacting legislation that allows the government to track online communications and take early action against harmful servers. This move comes as threats from state-backed hackers grow, urging the private sector to take proactive steps to protect key systems and sensitive data. The government plans to introduce a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027 and is working to increase the number of trained cybersecurity workers. The goal is to enhance Japan's online safety and strengthen cross-sector security measures through cooperation between firms.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 00:17:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales grew at their fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies and a surge in online shopping. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year on year in May, beating analysts' estimates, as the consumer goods trade-in program and increased foreign tourism contributed to the growth. However, industrial output slowed slightly, and fixed-asset investment underperformed expectations, with a deepening contraction in property investment. While the rise in retail sales is a welcome sign, falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment, requiring stronger policy support to sustain the recovery.</p>
