          <h2>UK to End Overseas Recruitment for Care Workers Amid Immigration System Overhaul</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 08:27:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration to the UK. The government aims to shift towards hiring British nationals or extending visas for overseas workers already in the country. This initiative includes raising the threshold for skilled visas to graduate level and implementing stricter training requirements for domestic workers. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticized the measures as insufficient, advocating for an annual migration cap exceeding 50,000. The government has already tightened rules around care sector worker after coming to power last July.</p>

The article explores the challenges parents face in maintaining friendships and the benefits of creating a "village" with chosen family. Examples include couples moving near friends to share childcare responsibilities and families living in co-housing communities. While challenges such as differing parenting styles and shared living spaces exist, the parents interviewed highlighted the invaluable support and deeper friendships gained through these arrangements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of a trade agreement with the Trump administration. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that this exemption would be part of the economic prosperity deal. The UK's Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated that the wider aerospace industry would have a specific guarantee of zero tariffs. This deal would provide certainty to a ¬£40 billion sector, supporting 450,000 jobs in the UK. The agreement follows relief for the car and steel industries, with car tariffs potentially reduced to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles a year and steel tariffs eliminated.</p>

          <h2>The Influence of Siblings and Genetics on Personality Development</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article explores the impact of sibling relationships and genetic factors on personality development. Research suggests that siblings often mold each other, sometimes more than parents do, and that the "sibling spillover effect" is more powerful in disadvantaged families. While birth order psychology is often debated, studies show that first-born children have a cognitive edge. The article also touches on the role of genetics, noting that genetic inclinations elicit responses from the world that shape personalities and outcomes. Parents are often poor judges of their own children and the article highlights the importance of not making assessments about which of their children is the ‚Äúacademic‚Äù one.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly poised to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar for use as Air Force One. The gift, expected to be announced during Trump's visit to Qatar, would transfer ownership to the Trump presidential library foundation shortly before he leaves office. The highly unusual arrangement raises legal questions about accepting such a valuable gift from a foreign power. The aircraft will initially be modified by the United States Air Force to meet military specifications before being transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation.</p>
