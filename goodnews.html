          <p>F1 star Oscar Piastri has dismissed the possibility of a future in IndyCar, stating that his focus remains on Formula One and competing for the world drivers' championship. Piastri cited the high speeds and close proximity of walls in IndyCar as reasons for his lack of interest, emphasizing that F1 has always been his dream. He acknowledged the skill and bravery of IndyCar drivers but expressed a preference for the challenges and environment of F1 racing. Piastri currently leads his McLaren teammate Lando Norris by nine points, with Max Verstappen trailing in third as he aims to continue his success in the F1 circuit.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich has secured its 33rd Bundesliga title, marking a return to dominance after Bayer Leverkusen's historic unbeaten season. Despite initial doubts about Vincent Kompany's appointment as coach, Bayern's strong start and key signings like Harry Kane and Michael Olise proved pivotal. Leverkusen's inability to maintain their previous season's form and Bayern's strength in depth, even amidst injuries, contributed to their success. Kompany's management of player issues and media relations also played a crucial role, setting the stage for continued success and the potential addition of Florian Wirtz to further strengthen the squad.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old investment icon, is planning to step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, marking the end of an era for the $1.1 trillion conglomerate. Buffett's success lies in value investing, focusing on wonderful businesses at fair prices, and turning a failing textile manufacturer into a diverse economic powerhouse. His approach includes acquiring insurers like National Indemnity and Geico, using their float to invest in a vast array of successful businesses and stocks like American Express, Coca-Cola, and Apple. Buffett's influence extends beyond finance, advising corporate executives and government officials, and his departure raises questions about Berkshire's future without its chief architect.</p>

          <p>Active management is experiencing a resurgence in a market long dominated by index funds, as evidenced by recent ETF flows and a record number of active ETF launches. Investors are increasingly seeking unique approaches and strategies beyond benchmark tracking, with active ETFs taking over one-third of the flows this year. The rise of active ETFs is driven by the desire for income, downside protection, and innovative strategies that cater to specific market conditions. This trend is also influenced by the younger retail investor who embraces leverage and inverse ETF strategies.</p>
