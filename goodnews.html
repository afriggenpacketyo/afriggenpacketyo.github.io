        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups to uncover insights into population history, migration, and adaptation. The study suggests that languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The findings also reveal genetic traits that may have evolved through adapting to extreme environments and long-term isolation, impacting modern South Americans' health.</p>
