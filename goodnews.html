          <p>Epic Games announced that Fortnite is now offline on iOS devices globally after Apple blocked its attempt to reinstate the game on the App Store in the U.S. The move follows a legal battle that began in 2020 when Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission fees by linking to its own website for in-app purchases, violating Apple's policies, which led to Fortnite's removal from the App Store. Epic Games submitted Fortnite to Apple's U.S. App Store last week, a month after a judge ruled the iPhone maker was not allowed to charge a commission on purchases that consumers make outside of an iOS app.</p>

          <p>Two Republican lawmakers are calling for Duke University to end its joint campus program with Wuhan University in China, citing concerns about technology transfers and student manipulation. The congressmen, John Moolenaar and Tim Walberg, argue that the partnership creates a direct pipeline between U.S. innovation and China's military-industrial complex. Duke Kunshan University (DKU), founded in 2013, is a liberal arts-focused joint venture that offers students degrees from both Duke University and DKU, with opportunities to study at Duke's campus in North Carolina. The lawmakers fear that exchange opportunities provide Chinese students access to federally funded U.S. research, which could be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

It also examines Prime Minister Starmer's declining approval ratings and the potential number of seats Reform could win in a future election.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as part of their tax bill, which they call a "bonus." The change is intended to help retirees retain more income and serves as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. This deduction would be available to adults ages 65 and over from 2025 through 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes over $150,000. A median income retiree could see their taxes reduced by approximately $500 per year as a result of this change.</p>

          <p>Shares of Cartier owner Richemont experienced a significant jump after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, indicating that wealthy consumers are still spending on luxury items despite global economic uncertainties. The luxury group's revenues increased by 7% year-on-year, driven by double-digit growth in the Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. Despite overall growth, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China. Richemont faces headwinds such as rising gold prices and foreign exchange fluctuations, but analysts believe its pricing power could provide a buffer.</p>

The BCCI is the richest cricket board in the world, earning a significant portion of the ICC's revenue.

Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. The shift was driven by institutional investors seeking safe-haven assets amid concerns about the U.S. economy. With the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which may impact Japanese assets.</p>

          <p>China's decision to hold trade discussions with the US in Geneva sends a clear message that resolving concerns about the world trading system requires a multilateral approach. The presence of Li Chenggang, an expert on WTO rules, alongside the negotiating team reinforces this message. While headline tariffs were slashed, the cuts primarily addressed measures that were non-compliant with WTO rules, suggesting that no true bilateral deal was struck.</p>

          <p>MPs in Westminster are considering a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, while Scotland is reviewing a separate bill on the same topic. The proposed law in England and Wales, introduced by Kim Leadbeater, would allow terminally ill adults to end their lives under specific conditions. Supporters argue that it provides dignity and choice for those facing harrowing deaths, while opponents express concerns about vulnerable individuals being pressured. The Isle of Man and Jersey are also considering similar legislation.</p>
