          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift has officially announced her 12th studio album, titled "The Life of a Showgirl," following intense fan speculation. The announcement was made on her website after a countdown timer expired, with various formats like vinyl, cassette, and CD available for pre-order. This new album follows her record-breaking "The Tortured Poets Department" and marks her first release since regaining full control over her music catalog. The announcement was coordinated with a teaser for her upcoming appearance on the "New Heights" podcast, hosted by her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, its lowest level in over two years, while also downgrading the country's annual economic growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%. The central bank cited a substantial drop in inflation, which is now near the lower end of its target range, as a key factor in its decision to ease monetary policy. Officials noted that while the risk of a major trade war has diminished, the lower growth outlook is primarily due to reduced productivity growth expectations rather than trade disruptions.

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce, pausing the implementation of significant tariff hikes for another 90 days until November 10. The agreement, confirmed just hours before the previous deadline, keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports at 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 10%. This extension provides more time for negotiators to address ongoing issues such as trade imbalances, market access for U.S. exporters, and other national security and economic concerns between the world's two largest economies, temporarily averting a major escalation.

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub, is leaving the company to pursue a new startup venture, with his departure coming at a time of increasing competition in the AI-powered coding tool market. Dohmke has led GitHub since 2021, overseeing the launch of its popular AI coding assistant, Copilot. While GitHub has seen significant growth, it now faces a wave of fast-growing competitors like Cursor and Replit, which are gaining traction among developers and challenging its market dominance. The company has not immediately named a successor to lead the crucial division.</p>

          <p>Wang Yiming, an adviser to China's central bank, has called on the government to guide the rapidly growing "quick commerce" sector rather than simply curbing competition. As e-commerce platforms engage in fierce cash-burning battles for the instant retail market, Wang argues that this sector creates new consumption opportunities vital for long-term growth. He recommends targeted policies that foster high-quality development and innovation, moving the industry away from a zero-sum game towards a more sustainable, win-win ecosystem that can serve as a new economic driver.

          <p>In an effort to promote tourism in its more remote regions, Nepal has made 97 of its Himalayan mountains free to climb for the next two years. This initiative is designed to draw attention to unexplored destinations in the country's poorer western provinces. The move contrasts with a recent decision to increase the permit fee for climbing Mount Everest to $15,000 during peak season, the first such hike in nearly a decade. Authorities hope the fee waiver will create jobs and strengthen local economies in underserved areas, highlighting lesser-known but beautiful peaks.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a request from the U.S. Attorney's office to dismiss all charges against Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was previously convicted of using excessive force. The judge called the government's attempt to overturn the jury's verdict "contrary to the public interest" and ordered the deputy to begin his four-month prison sentence. The unusual post-trial move by prosecutors to reduce Kirk's felony to a misdemeanor had already triggered the resignation of several prosecutors and drawn significant criticism for its perceived leniency.</p>
