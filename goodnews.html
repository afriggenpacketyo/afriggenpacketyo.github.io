          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is expected to strengthen again. While its maximum wind speeds have decreased, the storm's overall size has grown, prompting tropical storm warnings for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas. The hurricane is not projected to make a direct impact on the U.S. East Coast, but its increased size could generate dangerous rip currents along the Southeast coast. Forecasters are closely monitoring its path as it undergoes an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that could lead to re-intensification.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who won New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, has officially kicked off his general election campaign with a message aimed at attracting voters beyond his party. Speaking in Brooklyn, Mamdani focused on affordability and the government's role in meeting citizens' "material needs," referencing his proposals for government-run grocery stores and rent freezes. He shared anecdotes about registered Republicans and non-Democrats who expressed interest in his campaign, framing his primary victory as the start of a broader movement. Mamdani is running against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who are both running as independents.</p>

          <p>An American family has found a transformative improvement in their well-being since moving from Montecito, California, to San Sebastián, Spain, three years ago. Psychologist Dr. Colleen Crowley and her family sought a different cultural experience and a deeper connection with nature, which they felt was limited in their affluent California community. The move, facilitated by the shift to remote work, has allowed them to embrace an outdoor lifestyle with hiking, surfing, and skiing. Despite bureaucratic challenges, the family reports a significant increase in their quality of life and happiness, citing a better work-life balance and a more profound worldview for their children.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel has denied that his recent comments about "entertainers and competitors" in the NFL were aimed at his rookie teammate, Shedeur Sanders. The remark, made during a preseason game, fueled social media speculation of a jab at the high-profile Sanders, who has garnered significant media attention. Gabriel later clarified his statement, explaining that he considers the media to be the "entertainers" while he and his teammates are the "competitors," each with a job to do. Both Gabriel and Sanders are competing for the starting quarterback position for the Browns this season.</p>

          <p>Cricketer Sonny Baker celebrated his first call-up to the England national team by securing a hat-trick for the Manchester Originals in their decisive 57-run victory over the Northern Superchargers in The Hundred. Baker's key wickets helped dismiss the Superchargers for 114, well short of the 172-run target set by the Originals. The Originals' total was anchored by a strong unbeaten 64 from Jos Buttler and a late surge from Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 50 not out. The win significantly improves the Manchester Originals' position in the tournament standings, tying them with two other teams on eight points.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the United States and European nations to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. This concession, made during the summit with President Trump, is being described as a "game-changing" development in negotiations to end the war. Such a guarantee has been a key demand from Ukraine and could provide a path to peace without formal NATO membership, which Russia has long opposed. European leaders have welcomed the development but are seeking more details on its implementation.</p>

          <p>A newly drilled geothermal well in Kenya's Silali field is producing enough steam to generate 22 megawatts of electricity, more than four times the typical output. This discovery is a significant advancement for Kenya's goal of expanding its renewable energy capacity and ensuring a reliable power supply. Unlike solar and wind, geothermal energy provides a constant and clean power source, which is crucial as the country faces growing electricity demand and drought-related challenges to its hydropower. The state-owned Geothermal Development Company (GDC) plans to extract 300 megawatts from the region by 2028.</p>

          <p>Dr. Alieu Kamara, the sole neurosurgeon in Sierra Leone, has successfully performed the nation's first-ever spine surgery, offering new hope in a country of eight million people. The patient, Morie Abibu, was paralyzed and slowly suffocating from a mass pressing on his spinal cord. Before Dr. Kamara's arrival this year, such a condition would have been a death sentence for those unable to afford treatment abroad. The landmark operation was made possible through a grassroots network of support, including the nonprofit Mission Brain, which facilitated Dr. Kamara's training and supplied crucial equipment.</p>

          <p>Key European leaders are set to accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington for talks with President Trump, following the recent U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff expressed optimism, stating that Russia made "concessions," including an agreement to allow NATO-style security protections for Ukraine. However, Zelenskyy remains cautious, noting there is no sign yet that Russia will agree to a trilateral summit. The involvement of leaders from Germany, France, the UK, and the EU is intended to present a united front and ensure European security interests are represented in the negotiations.</p>
