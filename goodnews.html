          <p>India and Canada are taking steps to mend their strained bilateral relations, beginning with a call between India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Canada's new Foreign Minister Anita Anand. The conversation marks the highest diplomatic contact between Ottawa and New Delhi since Mark Carney became Canadian prime minister in March. Relations between the two countries deteriorated following accusations from Canada that India orchestrated the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and Khalistan supporter, allegations India denies. Both countries are reportedly considering restoring their High Commissioners by June, signaling a move toward normalizing diplomatic ties. There is potential for improved diplomatic relations.</p>

Corsie, who began her career with Glasgow City in 2008, has won 13 major honors and played in the NWSL in the United States before joining Aston Villa in 2022. She recently returned to playing after undergoing her sixth operation, with her fifth on her left knee. Corsie stated that getting back to playing was a tough ambition but worth the pain, despite facing chronic pain due to the condition of her knee. She persevered through physical challenges to end her career on her own terms.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's education bureau has urged the city's universities to attract international students affected by the Trump administration‚Äôs previous attempt to ban Harvard from enrolling international students. Several universities, including the Hong Kong Science and Technology University, have extended offers to students forced to leave Harvard, providing streamlined admission procedures and academic support. The move comes as experts suggest the U.S. ban could benefit foreign institutions looking to attract talent, with Hong Kong being home to five of the world‚Äôs top 100 universities. The city aims to safeguard the rights of students and scholars while enhancing its academic reputation. This could affect the international academic landscape.</p>

          <p>Octopus Energy has apologized to a Hartlebury man after relentlessly pursuing him for nearly four years over another person's gas bill amounting to more than ¬£6,000. Despite Peter Holden repeatedly alerting the firm to the error, he continued to receive monthly energy bills and was chased by debt collectors. The firm acknowledged that the issue stemmed from an error in industry data, causing Mr. Holden to be charged for a meter with the same serial number. Octopus Energy's commercial director personally apologized to Mr. Holden and committed to implementing further staff training to prevent similar errors. This is a step in the right direction.</p>

Despite initial controversy and a ban from French airwaves, ‚ÄúThe Sorrow and the Pity‚Äù became a critically acclaimed masterpiece, influencing subsequent historical accounts of wartime France.

          <p>Japan has initiated sales of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices, with the newly appointed farm minister pledging to bring prices down to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice via these contracts, bypassing the auction system to exert greater influence over prices. The agriculture ministry has established a special response team to address the high rice price issue and prevent public disaffection with rice products. The move follows criticism of the previous auction system for pushing up rice costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study published in Cell Metabolism has discovered that sleep facilitates the brain's removal of harmful oxygen-derived free radicals. The research shows that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a metabolic by-product, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and initiate brain repair. Scientists found that when H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," promoting restorative sleep. This discovery offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative conditions, potentially paving the way for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders. This is a promising development.</p>
