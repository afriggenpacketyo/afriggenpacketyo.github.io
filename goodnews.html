          <p>Shein's United Kingdom operations saw a substantial 32.3% increase in sales, reaching £2.05 billion in 2024, with pre-tax profits also rising to £38.25 million. The fast-fashion giant expanded its UK presence with new offices and promotional events, demonstrating strong market performance. Despite this growth, the company's filing acknowledges risks from supply chain issues, inflation, and regulatory changes as it pursues a highly anticipated initial public offering in Hong Kong after facing delays with its London listing plans.

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding economists' expectations despite trade pressures from U.S. tariffs. The growth was primarily driven by resilient exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP after contracting in the previous quarter. However, analysts remain cautious, warning of a potential future slowdown as investment spending may soften and the full impact of tariffs on key sectors like automobile exports could exert downward pressure on corporate profits and capital investment.

          <p>The series finale of 'And Just Like That' concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw finding herself single again, an ending that this article argues is more true to the character and the original show's spirit. After the death of her husband and a failed rekindled romance, Carrie embraces a future that may not include a man, a departure from the traditional fairytale endings of 'Sex and the City'. The analysis suggests this conclusion better honors the original show's core theme: that enduring female friendships are the most powerful and fulfilling relationships of all.</p>

This successful launch is attributed to high demand for metabolic and anti-obesity drugs, as well as a broader rally that has seen major biotech firms in Hong Kong achieve significant gains throughout the year.

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed jet drone capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), a breakthrough that could effectively turn any warship into an aircraft carrier. The uncrewed aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of vessels like destroyers and frigates, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. According to the project team, this runway-independent drone is technologically superior in speed compared to other mainstream VTOL drones, significantly expanding the operational range and versatility of China's naval fleet.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, a city once devastated by the collapse of the steel industry, is experiencing a quiet economic resurgence.

The city's population has stabilized, the unemployment rate has improved to just above the national average, and the number of working residents has returned to pre-pandemic levels, signaling a slow but steady comeback for the former industrial heartland.</p>

This initiative is part of a broader effort to protect patients from botched procedures that can result in life-altering injuries and place a burden on the NHS for corrective care.</p>

The former president emphasized that their actions are a crucial part of a longer struggle against partisan gerrymandering and have already prompted a response from states like California. The meeting, which also included former Attorney General Eric Holder, signals high-level Democratic support for the Texas legislators' standoff against what they term a "systematic assault on democracy."</p>

          <p>A new artificial intelligence tool called DeepEditor is changing how foreign language films are dubbed for international audiences by digitally altering actors' lip movements to match the new dialogue. Developed by the company Flawless, the technology aims to create a more seamless and authentic viewing experience, potentially opening up markets like the U.S. to more global cinema. The system was recently used on the Swedish sci-fi film 'Watch the Skies' for its U.S. theatrical release, a distribution that producers say would have been impossible with traditional dubbing methods.</p>
