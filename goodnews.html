          <p>China's industrial profits saw a 3% increase in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. Cumulative profits for major industrial firms also rose 1.4% year-on-year in the first four months of the year.

Distillers are experimenting with local ingredients like juniper berries, bitter gourd, and camellia flowers. The ability to convert existing whiskey and shochu distillation equipment for gin production, along with the quick monetization from production to sales, is driving this trend.</p>

          <p>President Trump has agreed to postpone the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union until July 9, providing more time for trade negotiations. This decision came after a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious negotiations. The threatened tariffs, along with similar measures on Apple products, had previously caused market instability. The delay is seen as a positive step towards resolving trade tensions between the U.S. and the EU.</p>
