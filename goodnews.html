        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dalai Lama has confirmed that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending prior speculation about his succession. He stated that his next reincarnation should be identified according to traditional Buddhist practices, with the Gaden Phodrang Trust holding sole authority over the process. This declaration is highly significant for Tibetans who oppose China's tight control over their homeland and seek to preserve their cultural identity. The decision is likely to provoke strong reactions from Beijing, which insists on its prerogative to approve the next religious leader, potentially leading to the emergence of rival Dalai Lamas in the future.</p>

          <p>China's top leadership, under President Xi Jinping, has publicly targeted "disorderly low-price competition" among enterprises, a significant shift from previous, more general terminology. This explicit characterization at a Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission meeting underscores Beijing's growing concern over market behavior that stifles innovation and lowers efficiency. The directive calls for regulating companies that suppress prices to gain market share, guiding them toward quality improvement, and facilitating the exit of outdated production capacity. This policy aims to foster a healthier economic environment and promote industrial upgrading, addressing a critical issue for the world's second-largest economy.</p>

This move comes as the Bucks lost Brook Lopez and the Pacers face Tyrese Haliburton's season-long absence due to injury.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill," which recently passed the Senate, proposes a significant increase in tax credits for semiconductor manufacturers, raising them to 35% from the current 25%. This measure is designed to further encourage major chipmakers like Intel, TSMC, and Micron Technology to expand their advanced manufacturing operations within the United States by a 2026 deadline. The new provisions build upon the existing tax incentives from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, reinforcing Washington's commitment to bolstering its domestic chip supply chain and mitigating reliance on foreign production. Experts suggest these enhanced credits will accelerate onshoring efforts, especially in light of potential future tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has issued a ruling preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and work permits for hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants this year. This decision blocks Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's plan to revoke TPS on September 3, effectively maintaining the Biden-era extension until February 2026. The judge's ruling supported Haitian migrants who argued they had made life decisions, including schooling, employment, and medical treatment, based on the expectation of continued protected status. While the White House intends to appeal, asserting executive authority over such programs, advocates continue to highlight the severe gang violence and instability in Haiti as reasons for continued protection.</p>
