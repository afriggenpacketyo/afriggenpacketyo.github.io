          <p>The New College of Florida has announced it will commission a privately funded statue to honor the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The college stated the tribute will serve as a symbol of its commitment to protecting free speech and encouraging civil discourse on campus. A rendering depicts Kirk sitting at a table with open chairs, reminiscent of his Turning Point USA events where he invited students to engage in political discussions. The statue is expected to be unveiled by the end of the year, with the college affirming that any action taken against the memorial will result in punishment.</p>

          <p>Powerful winds in Washington state have stirred up volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, causing hazy conditions and diminished air quality. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs when strong gusts lift the dry, loose ash back into the atmosphere. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Weather Service have both confirmed that this event is not due to any new volcanic activity. The volcano's alert level remains at "Normal," but the resuspended ash is considered hazardous, particularly for aircraft.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur opened their Champions League campaign with a 1-0 victory over Villarreal, showcasing a significant shift in strategy under manager Thomas Frank. The team has now kept four clean sheets in five games this season, a stark contrast to their more attack-focused approach last year. Players and the manager highlighted a new "clean sheet mentality," emphasizing strong defensive structure and pragmatism. While the cautious style resulted in only one shot on target for Spurs, it proved effective in securing the win, as Villarreal was prevented from registering any shots on goal.</p>

In his announcement, the Democrat acknowledged recent tragedies but emphasized a message of unity and progress, highlighting policy achievements like universal school meals and codified abortion rights. After his unsuccessful run for Vice President in 2024, Walz faces political headwinds, including a recent poll showing half of Minnesotans do not want him to run again and ongoing scrutiny over his administration's handling of fraud cases.</p>

The surge in popularity follows recent updates to Gemini, including a new image editing feature called Nano Banana that has attracted millions of new users. In just four days, the app gained 13 million new users, who have since uploaded 500 million images, indicating strong consumer engagement. This success has also bolstered investor confidence, contributing to parent company Alphabet's entry into the $3 trillion market capitalization club.</p>

          <p>The NHL is set to return to the Winter Olympics in 2026 for the first time in 12 years, a move Commissioner Gary Bettman believes will be highly beneficial for the league. Speaking at a conference, Bettman stated that despite the logistical challenges of a mid-season shutdown, the decision was driven by the immense global visibility of the Olympics and a strong desire from players to compete at a best-on-best international level. The league's new agreement with the IOC includes improved commercial arrangements and better conditions for players, addressing previous concerns that had led to the hiatus after the 2014 Sochi Games.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced it is implementing enhanced safeguards for teenage users of its ChatGPT technology amid growing scrutiny over AI's impact on young people. Users identified as under 18 will now be directed to a version of the chatbot with more restrictive content policies, such as blocking sexual material. The company is also introducing parental controls, allowing parents to link accounts, manage chat history, and set usage limits. This move follows an FTC probe into AI's effects on teens and a lawsuit from the parents of a teenager who died by suicide after allegedly being encouraged by the chatbot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to its lowest level since late 2022, dropping sharply in anticipation of an expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This decline reflects investor activity in mortgage-backed bonds, a pattern seen before previous Fed rate adjustments. However, financial experts caution that the trend may be short-lived, as rates have historically risen paradoxically after such cuts are announced. Analysts suggest that while the Fed's actions will lower short-term rates, it may not significantly impact long-term rates like mortgages in the current economic environment.

          <p>A growing number of high-income consumers are turning to discount stores like Aldi, Dollar General, and Walmart to combat the rising cost of living. Since 2021, the percentage of high-income households shopping at budget retailers has increased from about 20% to nearly 28%, according to data from GlobalData Retail. Analysts attribute this shift to persistent inflation, which has eroded the financial cushions of even wealthier shoppers, prompting them to seek better value on groceries and household essentials. In response, retailers like Walmart are refurbishing stores and expanding brand selections to appeal to this more upscale clientele.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has once again extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, pushing it to December 16th. This extension comes as a framework deal has been reached, which would see an investor consortium including Oracle and Silver Lake own approximately 80% of the U.S. business. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the commercial terms had been finalized for months but were delayed by trade tensions with China. The deal, which may require U.S. users to switch to a new app, is expected to be discussed by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this week. (not investment advice)</p>

While the statewide test positivity rate reached a seasonal high, the rate of new hospital admissions has seen a slight decline. In key areas like Los Angeles and Santa Clara counties, new hospitalizations have also decreased, leading some infectious disease experts to believe the wave is cresting. Health officials note that while community transmission may be slowing, those being hospitalized are typically older individuals who have not received a recent immunization.</p>
