          <p>Data from the UK Home Office indicates a record number of Americans applied for British citizenship or indefinite residency in the year leading up to March, with a surge following Donald Trump's second presidential win. Immigration lawyers report increased inquiries, attributing the trend to the polarized political climate in the US. While overall UK net migration has decreased, the rise in US applications is largely driven by spousal or family links, though some politicians suggest expedited qualifications for certain applicants. The UK government is also considering higher language requirements for immigrants, aligning with aspects of Trump's immigration policies. </p>

          <p>The US Air Force is developing next-generation fighter jets and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) to offset China's numerical advantage in military fleet size.

These drones are intended to augment crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions and potentially widen the operational range in the Indo-Pacific region.

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, marking a significant advancement in underwater communication. The team, led by Professor He Chengbing, developed a self-tuning system that maps signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This breakthrough could pave the way for the real-life use of long-range undersea messaging with profound civilian and military applications. </p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced rapid weight gain and swelling, eventually diagnosed as pericardial constriction after open-heart surgery. Doctors discovered his heart was trapped by a thick layer of scarring, preventing proper function. The surgery, a pericardiectomy, successfully removed the scarring and relieved the pressure on his heart. Mauceri has since recovered and returned to conducting, expressing gratitude for the medical intervention that improved his health. </p>
