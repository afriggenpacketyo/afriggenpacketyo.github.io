          <p>This article fact-checks several claims made by President Trump regarding autism, vaccines, and Tylenol use during pregnancy. It refutes assertions that Amish children don't get autism due to lack of vaccination, clarifies the number of childhood vaccine doses, and states that no studies show Tylenol directly causes autism. Medical experts and scientific organizations contradict Trump's statements, emphasizing the known risks of fever during pregnancy and the genetic and environmental factors influencing autism likelihood.</p>

It suggests the parade serves as a powerful declaration of deep national cohesion and institutional resilience for the Chinese people.

          <p>President Trump has significantly shifted his stance on the war in Ukraine, now stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with NATO and European support. This comes after talks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the UN General Assembly, where Trump labeled Russia a "paper tiger" facing economic trouble. Zelenskyy welcomed the "big shift" as a positive signal, indicating improved relations. Trump also suggested NATO nations should shoot down Russian planes violating their airspace.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has dismantled a vast telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area, which posed a significant threat to NYC's telecom systems and the UN General Assembly. Investigators found active SIM farms with over 100,000 SIM cards, capable of sending millions of texts per minute and potentially disabling cell phone towers. The network, linked to foreign governments and organized crime, was seized after telephonic threats to U.S. officials. While no arrests have been made, the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>This article explores how China's successive five-year plans have fundamentally shaped its economic trajectory over seven decades. Since 1953, these plans have transformed a limited industrial capacity into the "world's factory" and are now guiding the nation towards becoming a global innovation hub. The 14 plans implemented provide a comprehensive survey of China's complex economic history, illustrating its policy shifts from initial industrialization efforts to its current high-value chain ambitions.</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, who was nearly transferred from Chelsea, secured a first-team lifeline with a starring role in the Carabao Cup. Playing out of position as a lone striker, the 19-year-old scored a crucial equalizer and assisted the winner against Lincoln City, helping Chelsea avoid an upset. This performance comes after a summer where he was deemed surplus to requirements, and his dedication, including extra training with a personal coach, is now paying off.

          <p>Dismembered body parts found in April 1946 along the Willamette River are now believed to be those of Oak Grove Jane Doe, Oregon’s oldest unidentified person case. The remains, found under a headstone reading "Unknown Woman 1946," will undergo advanced forensic testing. The case, which went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence went missing, involved a petite white woman killed by blunt force trauma to the head. Authorities are hopeful that after nearly 80 years, her identity can finally be restored.</p>

          <p>California is moving to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services, with a bill awaiting the governor's signature. Inspired by a new mother whose baby was disturbed by loud ads, Senate Bill 576 would prohibit streaming platforms from playing commercials louder than their programming. While federal law already regulates broadcast and cable TV ads, streaming services were exempt. The industry initially opposed the bill, citing technical challenges, but changed its stance after an amendment removed the ability for private lawsuits.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are adopting a more aggressive political strategy, using Reform UK and its leader Nigel Farage as a central focus to energize their base. Leader Sir Ed Davey's speech at the party conference heavily referenced Farage, aiming to motivate activists and attract former Conservative voters. The party views Reform's rise as both a challenge for media attention and an opportunity to position themselves as a clear alternative. They are buoyed by internal polling suggesting openness to voting Lib Dem, despite facing a noisy new rival.</p>
