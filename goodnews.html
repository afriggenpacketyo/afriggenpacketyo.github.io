          <p>Nvidia's stock continued its upward trajectory, marking a fifth consecutive day of gains and reaching new record highs. This surge has re-established the company as the world's most valuable, with its market capitalization approaching $3.8 trillion. Despite earlier concerns regarding U.S. export controls on chip sales to China, investor confidence remains strong, buoyed by the company's dominance in the AI sector and future prospects in robotics. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted robotics as a major future opportunity for the company during the annual shareholder meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Universal Service Fund, a multi-billion-dollar program designed to expand telephone and internet access. In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled that Congress did not unlawfully delegate its legislative powers to the FCC when creating the fund. This program, which collects nearly $10 billion annually from telecom carriers, subsidizes services for low-income households, rural areas, schools, and healthcare providers. The ruling rejects a challenge that sought to revive the nondelegation doctrine, preserving a key mechanism for improving national telecommunications infrastructure.</p>

          <p>South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds has formally invited President Donald Trump to attend the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, one of the nation's largest gatherings of its kind. In a letter obtained by Fox News, Rounds suggested Trump could headline the event this year for its 85th anniversary or next year for the nation's 250th anniversary. The senator described South Dakota as "Trump Country," noting the president's significant victory margins in the state in previous elections.

          <p>In a significant decision for healthcare policy, the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of a key provision within the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The 6-3 ruling affirms the authority of a government task force responsible for determining which preventive health services, such as cancer screenings and certain medications, must be covered by insurers at no cost to patients. This decision ensures that millions of Americans will continue to receive free access to a wide range of preventive care. The ruling rejects a challenge that argued the task force's structure was unconstitutional, thereby preserving a foundational element of the ACA.</p>

          <p>A trend dubbed "revenge saving" is emerging as Americans increase their savings in response to economic uncertainties like inflation and potential tariffs. The U.S. personal saving rate rose to 4.5% in May, a significant increase from 3.5% in December, signaling a shift away from the post-pandemic "revenge spending" splurge. Financial experts observe that consumers are prioritizing emergency funds and building cash reserves for stability. This cautious behavior is also reflected in retirement savings, with 401(k) contribution rates hitting a record high as workers focus on long-term financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

His campaign has focused on affordability, with proposals for free buses and a rent freeze funded by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Mamdani, a former housing counselor, has followed a principled path into public service, evolving from an unsuccessful run for high school vice president.

A DW Fact Check found these claims to be false. The article notes that while Mamdani's criticism of Israeli government policies is controversial for some, it does not conclusively meet definitions of antisemitism, and he has been endorsed by Jewish politicians. Furthermore, there is no evidence he has ever advocated for a theocracy; his platform focuses on affordability and progressive policies like LGBTQIA+ rights, which often conflict with conservative religious laws.</p>

The potential move is significant due to Red Bull's recent performance dip and speculation that Mercedes may have an advantage with the new engine regulations coming in 2026.</p>
