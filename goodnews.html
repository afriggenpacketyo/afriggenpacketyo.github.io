          <p>In the Washington Open semi-final, Anna Kalinskaya defeated Emma Raducanu in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3, ending Raducanu's run in the tournament. Kalinskaya broke Raducanu's serve at key moments in both sets to secure the victory and advance to the final. She will face Leylah Fernandez, who won a marathon three-set match against Elena Rybakina. The result prevents a highly anticipated rematch of the 2021 US Open final between Raducanu and Fernandez.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport following a landing gear incident during takeoff. The Boeing 737 MAX 8, carrying 173 passengers and six crew, experienced a fire related to a tire maintenance issue. All occupants were safely evacuated via emergency slides, with only one person transported for a minor injury. The incident caused a temporary ground stop at the airport, but operations later returned to normal.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists in China is attempting to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, an ancient seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat considered legendary. Despite its historical significance, the invention was removed from Chinese school curricula in 2017 amid scholarly debate over its authenticity. The research team hopes to restore the reputation of this ancient technological wonder.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna, Austria, to Hamburg, Germany, were trapped inside a tunnel for over six hours following a power failure. The incident left passengers in the dark and without air conditioning. The evacuation was reportedly delayed when some passengers attempted to walk out of the tunnel on their own, forcing a secondary power shutdown for safety reasons. Eventually, all passengers were safely evacuated with the help of rescue workers, with only two requiring on-site medical treatment.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. The diagnosis came as a relief, as a more serious injury could have ended his season. Judge, who leads the major leagues in several offensive categories, received a PRP injection and is expected to miss 10 days to two weeks. He first felt the pain after making a strong throw from the outfield earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>Over two decades after its debut, the MTV show "The Osbournes" is remembered for pioneering the "reality sitcom" genre and transforming heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne into a lovable TV dad. The show, which ran from 2002 to 2005, blended the family's spectacular fame with mundane domestic life, creating a new format that paved the way for future celebrity-driven reality TV. Producers recall it as an experiment that captured a surprisingly normal, albeit chaotic, family dynamic. The article reflects on how the show created a new kind of celebrity access before the age of social media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With England in the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain why watching high-stakes football matches can cause such intense physical and emotional reactions. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, elevates heart rates and can feel overwhelming, but it's a natural sign of being deeply invested. Experts advise fans to manage these feelings by getting enough rest, having a clear plan for match day, and engaging in physical movement to release energy. They also emphasize reframing the nerves as part of an enjoyable, communal experience.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average temperatures in July running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, it stands in stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California. Forecasters do not expect a significant warm-up soon but warn that the hottest months are often still to come.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to better protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, and processes for opening new businesses in disused shops would be streamlined. The government hopes these reforms will help revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry. The changes aim to promote outdoor dining and live performances while preventing established venues from being threatened by new neighbors.</p>
