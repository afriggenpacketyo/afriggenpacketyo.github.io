          <p>Adobe announced fiscal third-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue, causing its shares to increase in after-hours trading. The company reported adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share on $5.99 billion in revenue, reflecting an 11% year-over-year growth. Looking ahead, Adobe provided a strong forecast for the fourth quarter, with earnings and revenue guidance that also topped consensus estimates. This positive performance contrasts with the stock's 21% decline year-to-date, suggesting a potential turnaround for the software giant. (not investment advice)</p>

The potential acquisition would consolidate major assets like CNN, HBO, and the CBS network, further reshaping the media landscape amid the rise of streaming services. While no formal offer has been submitted, the move signals a major strategic play by Paramount Skydance's David Ellison, whose firm recently completed its own merger. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Striker Yoane Wissa has completed a £55 million transfer to Newcastle United from Brentford, concluding a contentious saga where the player publicly pushed for the move. Wissa's career has been marked by resilience, notably after surviving an acid attack in 2021 that could have ended his career. While his on-field performance, including scoring 19 non-penalty goals last season, made him a top target for Newcastle, his conduct in forcing the exit has soured his legacy among Brentford supporters. He is now expected to help fill the offensive void left by Alexander Isak's departure from Newcastle.</p>

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship when his ball was apparently stolen by spectators. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, witnesses reported seeing two individuals run off with a ball. Because the ball could not be found, Fitzpatrick was allowed a penalty drop, a situation he believes saved him at least one stroke and resulted in a better outcome than if he had been forced to play his provisional ball.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's goalkeeper, Andre Onana, has been loaned to Turkish club Trabzonspor for the remainder of the 2025-26 season. The move comes after Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2 million in 2023 to be the team's primary keeper, did not feature in the club's first three Premier League matches under new manager Ruben Amorim. His only appearance this season was in a surprising Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby. The deal was completed just before the closing of the Turkish transfer window.</p>

          <p>Average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen to 6.35%, their lowest point in nearly a year, creating a potential opportunity for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing. The decline is attributed to expectations of an impending Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. While the lower rates are enticing, the article advises consumers to weigh the risks of waiting for a further drop against the possibility of rates rising again. For homeowners, it suggests evaluating if current rates are at least a percentage point below their existing mortgage to justify a refinance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick detailed the financial structure of the new U.S.-Japan trade deal, where Japan has committed $550 billion for investment in American projects. Under the agreement, the U.S. and Japan will split profits 50/50 from these projects until Japan's initial investment is fully recouped. After that point, the profit-sharing arrangement will shift dramatically to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. The deal aims to bolster domestic manufacturing in key sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics, funded by Japanese capital in exchange for lower tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in Germany over whether classic literature by authors like Goethe should continue to dominate school curricula at the expense of contemporary and diverse voices. Critics argue that the current reading lists, which are overwhelmingly composed of works by white male authors, fail to reflect the country's multicultural student population. While some educators and students are calling for reforms to include more female authors and writers with immigrant backgrounds, others stress the importance of studying classic texts to foster critical thinking and understand historical perspectives.</p>

The incident occurred after the fan reached out from the stands and slapped the helmets of both Jackson and a teammate while they were celebrating a touchdown.
