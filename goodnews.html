        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced a visa ban on owners, executives, and senior officials of India-based travel agencies accused of facilitating illegal immigration to the United States. The State Department's Consular Affairs and Diplomatic Security Service mission in India identified those engaged in facilitating illegal immigration and human smuggling and trafficking operations. The visa restriction would apply even to individuals who would otherwise qualify for a Visa Waiver Program. The State Department vows to continue imposing visa restrictions on representatives of travel agencies in order to cut off alien smuggling networks, reinforcing the Trump administration's crackdown on migration.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and gutting of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful. The decision declared the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, at USIP "null and void." The ruling came after DOGE team members took over USIP's headquarters, replaced its acting president, and terminated nearly all of its staff. Judge Beryl Howell ordered the reinstatement of George Moose, calling the officials who replaced him "illegitimately installed," and emphasized that Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional.</p>

This comes despite a rocky week for the company, which revealed it was hit with a cyberattack potentially costing $180 million to $400 million, and is facing an SEC investigation over misstated user figures. The company is also dealing with a lawsuit in Illinois over biometric data collection. Despite these challenges, Wall Street remains largely unfazed, with Coinbase's stock surging upon the announcement of its inclusion in the S&P 500.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase will now allow its clients to buy bitcoin, despite CEO Jamie Dimon's long-standing criticism of the digital currency. Dimon clarified that the bank will not custody the bitcoin but will include it in client statements. This decision marks a significant step for the largest U.S. bank, given Dimon's past concerns about money laundering, lack of clarity surrounding ownership, and illicit activities associated with bitcoin. Dimon likened his stance to defending the right to smoke, even though he doesn't believe people should do it, defending the right to buy bitcoin despite his personal reservations.</p>

Grealish has seen limited playing time this season, and Given believes he is not being treated fairly. Given argues that Grealish is a generational talent who should be built around, but is instead being underutilized and may benefit from a fresh start at a club where he can play regularly. Given's comments raise questions about Grealish's future with Manchester City heading into the summer transfer window.</p>

          <p>Richard Garwin, the physicist who designed the world's first hydrogen bomb, has died at the age of 97. Garwin's role was long obscured, even from his family, as he advised presidents and devoted his life to undoing the danger he created. Inspired by Enrico Fermi, Garwin became a key figure in nuclear arms control, advising 13 presidents. Despite his pivotal role in creating the H-bomb, Garwin did not take personal or moral responsibility, arguing its birth was inevitable, and spent his life working to mitigate its potential for destruction.

This follows condemnation from figures like Sir Elton John, who accused the government of "committing theft" if AI firms use artists' content without payment. The amendment would force AI companies to disclose what material they were using and demand permission from copyright holders. Supporters argue this is necessary to protect the UK's creative output and ensure fair compensation for artists.</p>
