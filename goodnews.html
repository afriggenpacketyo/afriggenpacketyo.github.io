          <p>A series of articles explores the complex landscape of China's efforts to expand its global soft power and cultural influence. Topics range from the waning interest in learning Mandarin in the West to the surprising success of Chinese-made "ugly-cute" dolls like Labubu in the American market. The analysis also covers how popular streaming shows and state-backed think tanks are being utilized to shape China's narrative abroad, even as observers urge for a more relaxed approach to cultural exchange to counteract decoupling with the West.</p>

          <p>A U.S. special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its allies to offer Ukraine security guarantees similar to NATO's Article 5. This development is described as "game-changing" as it could provide a workaround to Russia's long-standing opposition to Ukraine's formal NATO membership. The potential agreement would see the U.S. and a coalition of willing nations commit to defending Ukraine from future aggression, a key demand from Kyiv in any peace settlement.</p>

          <p>Bolivia appears set to elect a non-left-wing president for the first time in nearly two decades, with preliminary results showing a run-off between two right-leaning candidates, Senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira and former president Jorge Quiroga. The election marks a significant political shift for the nation, driven by voter frustration over a severe economic crisis under the incumbent socialist party, MAS. The outcome could lead to major changes in foreign policy, potentially fostering closer ties with the U.S. and increasing foreign investment in Bolivia's lithium reserves.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Composite Index surged to a 10-year high, driven by investors seeking better returns as bond yields and deposit rates remain low. The benchmark advanced 1.2 percent to a level not seen since August 2015, reflecting a strong risk appetite among mainland investors. This rally occurs despite recent official data indicating a weakening of economic growth momentum in July, with some analysts suggesting that hopes for more government stimulus measures are bolstering the market.

U.S. equity futures also ticked up, partly fueled by a positive week on Wall Street driven by hopes for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Australian federal court has fined Qantas Airways A$90 million ($58.64 million) for illegally dismissing 1,800 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and replacing them with contractors. The judge stated the significant penalty was intended to serve as a real deterrent and ensure such actions are not perceived as a mere cost of doing business. The ruling follows a separate A$120 million settlement agreed upon between Qantas and the Transport Workers' Union to compensate the sacked employees for their losses.</p>

          <p>Dame Helen Mirren has voiced her opinion that the iconic role of James Bond should continue to be played by a man, stating that changing the character's gender "just doesn't work." The Oscar-winning actress, who describes herself as a feminist, believes that altering such a fundamental aspect would turn the character into something else entirely. Her comments align with those of former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who also expressed his belief that a male actor should continue in the role for the franchise's upcoming 26th film.</p>

          <p>A renewed sense of "pan-Africanism" is reportedly growing across the Caribbean, strengthening cultural and economic connections with the African continent. This movement is visible through increased interest in African food, clothing, and travel, with a notable rise in Caribbean tourists visiting countries like Ghana. The trend is also being formalized at an institutional level, with leaders and organizations from both regions working to forge stronger trade links, improve transportation, and even discuss the possibility of a shared currency to deepen their shared heritage and future.</p>

          <p>The UK's Green Party is at a strategic crossroads as its leadership contest pits a radical, "eco-populist" approach against the party's more traditional, broad-appeal strategy. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bolder, anti-elite message to connect with voter anger, while current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns argue for continuing the successful formula that saw the party expand from one to four parliamentary seats. The outcome will determine the party's direction as it seeks to build on its recent electoral gains.</p>
