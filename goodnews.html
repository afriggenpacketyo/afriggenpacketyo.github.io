          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire deal following U.S.-led mediation talks aimed at ending their recent conflict, which was triggered by a deadly attack on tourists. The ceasefire, announced after weeks of clashes, involves both countries halting all firing and military action. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio noted the involvement of Saudi Arabia and Turkey in facilitating the agreement and called for further talks on various issues. This resolution comes after a period of heightened tensions, including missile strikes and accusations of attacks on civilian areas, marking a significant step towards de-escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that progressives should be concerned about the rapidly falling rates of family formation globally, as it poses significant economic and environmental challenges. An aging and shrinking population could lead to a decrease in the quality of life, with fewer people supporting a larger elderly population. The author suggests that ensuring economic and social support for people who want children is crucial, and that progressive policies such as affordable housing, universal pre-K, and better healthcare could help address this issue. The article urges against ceding the conversation on population to right-wing politics and emphasizes the need for proactive solutions to prevent a drastic population decline.</p>

          <p>Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, described the conclave to choose the new Pope Leo XIV as "immensely peaceful." He was one of 133 cardinals who were sealed off from the world in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel and later elected Pope Leo XIV. He noted the absence of rancor or politicking among the cardinals and found the experience to be "rather wonderful." Cardinal Nichols also mentioned the increased time for prayer and reflection due to the lack of external communication.</p>

          <p>A family's three children, all diagnosed with LAD-1, a rare immune disorder, received a life-changing gene therapy through a clinical trial at UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital. The experimental therapy, developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals, involved extracting the patient's stem cells, correcting the faulty gene, and reintroducing the modified cells into the body. Five years after participating in the study, the children are thriving, leading normal lives, and have not required hospitalization for severe infections. The therapy is currently under review by the FDA, with the hope of becoming a licensed treatment for others with LAD-1.</p>

          <p>A fire at an industrial estate in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, Spain, caused a toxic cloud of chlorine, leading authorities to confine approximately 160,000 people to their homes.

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after being stranded in orbit for 53 years due to a rocket booster failure. The spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War space race, splashed down in the Indian Ocean. This event serves as a reminder of the Soviet Union's ambitious space program and its focus on Venus exploration during that era. The article also highlights the challenges of building spacecraft capable of withstanding Venus's harsh conditions, and the legacy of the Venera program, which achieved several firsts in planetary exploration.</p>

Experts believe that this bill could attract bipartisan support and enable policymakers to study the effects of cannabis, while others are skeptical due to the current political climate.</p>
