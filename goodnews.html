          <p>China has inaugurated the International Organization for Mediation in Hong Kong, with over 30 developing nations as founding members. This move aims to elevate Hong Kong as a global hub for legal and dispute resolution services, bolstering China's influence in the Global South. Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that the organization will promote amicable resolutions to international disputes, moving beyond zero-sum mentalities. This initiative comes amid a perceived decline in U.S. engagement in global affairs, with China seeking to expand its role in international bodies. The initiative is viewed as a positive step towards international cooperation.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, has won the Scripps National Spelling Bee, overcoming a moment of overconfidence during the competition. After finishing as runner-up last year, Faizan approached this year's bee with enthusiasm, but nearly faltered when he rushed to spell a word without asking clarifying questions. Despite the mishap, he ultimately triumphed, correctly spelling "eclaircissement" to secure the title. Faizan's victory marks the bee's 100th anniversary, and he plans to donate a portion of his winnings to charity, adding to the $77,500 he has earned in his spelling bee career.</p>

          <p>China's power grid is now equipped with a quantum-powered "diamond ring" to prevent massive blackouts by detecting grid instability in real time. Developed by the University of Science and Technology of China in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, this toroidal device uses nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors to monitor power lines with high precision. This innovation addresses the challenges posed by the increasing reliance on unpredictable renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. The system acts as a sentinel, ensuring the stability of the grid against fluctuations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times opinion piece explores the reasons why many millennials and Gen Z individuals are choosing to remain childless. The author suggests that an increasing awareness of potential harms, abuse, neglect, and trauma, coupled with a redefined understanding of these concepts, has led to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting. This cultural shift, combined with economic factors and concerns about the state of the world, contributes to a higher rate of childlessness among these generations. The article delves into the complex motivations behind this significant life decision.</p>

          <p>After 529 days alone in the Australian bush, Valerie, a mini dachshund, has been reunited with her owners. Valerie went missing during a camping trip to Kangaroo Island in November 2023, surviving for over 17 months in the wild. Despite the island being home to predators, Valerie was eventually found and rescued by Kangala Wildlife Rescue. Her story of survival has given hope to many, demonstrating resilience and the power of community efforts in reuniting lost pets with their families.</p>

          <p>New AI tools are enabling individuals without formal training to write software, a process known as "vibe coding." These tools, including AI chatbots, are lowering the barrier to entry for software development, allowing designers and entrepreneurs to quickly create prototypes and products. While some experts predict that AI coding will radically change the software industry, others believe that human developers will continue to play a crucial role in curating and refining AI-generated code. The rise of vibe coding is opening up new possibilities for creators and transforming the landscape of software engineering.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to boost rice exports due to an anticipated long-term decline in domestic consumption. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recommends exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production. China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are identified as target markets. The government aims to increase rice exports nearly eightfold by 2030, bolstering productivity and reducing production costs to compete with foreign-grown rice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German central bank, the Bundesbank, anticipates that inflation will remain on target at approximately 2%. In April, the annual inflation rate decreased to 2.1%, marking the lowest rate since October, primarily due to cheaper energy costs compared to the previous year. With oil prices remaining low, no significant change is expected for May's annual inflation rate. The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) is scheduled to release its initial data on the May inflation rate, providing insights into the country's economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Harris's hawk that terrorized the village of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has found a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was responsible for dive-bombing attacks on approximately 50 people. After being captured, the hawk was trained by falconer Wayne Housden, who has provided a suitable aviary. The falconer plans to keep the hawk full-time and hopes to release it in the autumn, providing a positive resolution to the situation.</p>
