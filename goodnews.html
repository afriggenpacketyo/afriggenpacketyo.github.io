          <p>With college costs continuing to rise, a growing number of high school seniors are making their college decisions based on affordability, often opting for local and less expensive public schools over private universities. Financial concerns are governing decision-making for a significant majority of families, outweighing even academic considerations. Deep cuts in state funding for higher education have contributed to this trend, shifting more of the financial burden onto students and families. The trend is further exacerbated by concerns about the economy and dwindling federal loan forgiveness options. (not investment advice)</p>
