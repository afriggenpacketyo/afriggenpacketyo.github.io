        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba reported better-than-expected profits for the June quarter, primarily driven by a 26% year-on-year sales increase in its cloud computing division. This growth is largely attributed to robust demand for artificial intelligence services, with AI-related product revenue showing triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. While overall revenue slightly missed analyst forecasts, the strong performance of the cloud unit and a revival in e-commerce led to a significant surge in the company's share price in both U.S. and Hong Kong markets.

          <p>Shares in Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk rose after new trial data indicated its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, is more effective at reducing heart disease risk than rival medications. The study revealed that users of Wegovy (semaglutide) had up to a 57% greater reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death compared to those using Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro (tirzepatide). This positive clinical result reinforces Novo Nordisk's leading position in the highly competitive market for weight management drugs, directly impacting investor confidence.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever childcare support expansion has launched, offering working parents 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" to help families with costs, but the rollout faces significant challenges. Nurseries are reporting severe staff shortages and long waiting lists, making it difficult for many parents to secure a place despite their eligibility. The sector estimates it needs 35,000 more staff to meet the increased demand generated by the new policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland's national rail operator, ScotRail, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for traveling during busy weekday rush hours. The policy, first introduced as a pilot scheme, aims to make train travel more affordable and encourage commuters to switch from cars to public transport, thereby reducing carbon emissions. This change will result in significant savings for travelers, with a ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow becoming nearly 50% cheaper, simplifying the ticketing system and making it more flexible for passengers across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered brine shrimp, an ancient species dating back 400 million years, in a highly saline water source within the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang, China. These resilient crustaceans, also known as Artemia, are widely used in aquaculture as feed and also have applications in medicine and cosmetics. Researchers from Tarim University will conduct laboratory studies to determine if this is a new species. The discovery suggests that the region has the natural conditions necessary to develop a commercial aquaculture industry focused on salt-tolerant organisms.</p>

          <p>Despite current geopolitical tensions, China continues to revere the American Volunteer Group, known as the "Flying Tigers," who aided China against Japan during World War II. These American mercenaries are credited with destroying hundreds of Japanese aircraft in 1941-42, providing crucial air support when China was struggling. In a gesture of this enduring bond, the daughter and granddaughter of the group's founder, Claire Chennault, were among the few American guests invited to Beijing's military parade commemorating the war's end. The legacy of the Flying Tigers remains a symbol of historical US-China cooperation.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to display a range of advanced unmanned systems, including drones and robotic vehicles, at its upcoming military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Analysts suggest the showcase will highlight the People's Liberation Army's rapid progress in integrating autonomous and AI-assisted technologies across air, land, and sea domains. While officials have promised to unveil "new-quality combat capabilities," it is expected that these new systems will be part of a static display rather than being shown in motion due to security protocols during the parade.</p>

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly grew in August, expanding at its fastest rate in five months. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered 50.5, surpassing economists' expectations of a contraction and indicating a recovery in new orders and export business. This optimistic result contrasts with the official government survey, which showed a fifth consecutive month of contraction. The improvement in the private survey suggests some resilience in external demand, though domestic demand remains a concern for sustained economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. district court judge has issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The emergency injunction was granted after advocacy groups reported that children were being placed on planes for imminent removal, which they argued would put the minors at risk of abuse and persecution. The administration claimed the flights were for family reunification at the request of the Guatemalan government, not deportations. The judge's order will remain in place for 14 days, covering all unaccompanied children at risk of deportation.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott stated he was not surprised by the trade that sent his former teammate, All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons, to the Green Bay Packers. While Prescott didn't expect the trade itself, he noted that the contract negotiations between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones seemed to have become personal, making the outcome less shocking. Parsons received a record-breaking four-year, $188 million contract from the Packers after the trade. Prescott expressed relief that the tense situation was resolved, avoiding a potential distraction for the Cowboys.</p>
