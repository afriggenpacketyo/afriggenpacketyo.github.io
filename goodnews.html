          <p>Exxon Mobil announced first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street predictions, although profits decreased compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices driven by concerns that President Trump's tariffs would negatively impact global demand. The oil major reported that volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting initiatives, largely compensated for lower earnings resulting from weak oil prices. The company's first-quarter capital expenditures aligned with guidance, and Exxon returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, showcasing its financial strength amidst market uncertainties.

          <p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) fined TikTok 530 million euros ($601.3 million) for violating GDPR by sending European user data to China.

The regulator cited TikTok's failure to guarantee equivalent data protection for EEA users whose data was remotely accessed by staff in China. The DPC also noted potential access by Chinese authorities to EEA personal data under Chinese laws that diverge from EU standards.</p>

Conservation efforts aim to introduce new cats to increase genetic diversity in European forests, with the key challenge being the lynx's relationship with humans, given its life in captivity.

          <p>The article argues for the benefits of reindustrializing the United States, citing a poll showing that 80% of Americans believe the country would be better off with more manufacturing jobs. It suggests that a strong manufacturing sector has a positive effect on the entire economy, leading to higher wages, national self-sufficiency, and increased leverage in trade negotiations. The piece contends that reshoring manufacturing is good politics and could help the left regain working-class voters. It also suggests that America‚Äôs deindustrialization could be an advantage for its industrial rebirth, as the destruction of old factories gives the country a fresh start.</p>
