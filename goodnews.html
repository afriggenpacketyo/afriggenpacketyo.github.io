          <p>After a massive cleanup effort ahead of the 2024 Olympics, the Seine River in Paris has officially reopened for public swimming for the first time since 1923. The river, once heavily polluted, became a focal point of the Games, hosting triathlon events and the opening ceremony's parade of nations. Now, three designated swimming sites are available for public use daily, with authorities conducting regular water quality tests to ensure safety. The extensive project involved major infrastructure upgrades to the city's sewer and water treatment systems to restore the river's health.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, both competing for their first title at the tournament. The article analyzes the key factors that will decide the outcome, highlighting Swiatek's experience on the big stage versus Anisimova's potential to play freely as the underdog. While Swiatek has adapted her powerful baseline game for grass, Anisimova's aggressive style and recent form make her a dangerous opponent. The final will likely hinge on which player better manages the pressure of the occasion and imposes their game style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine centered on national sovereignty, signaling a recalibration of relationships with allies and rivals alike. In a recent speech invoking wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasized the need for Australia to "think and act for ourselves" in an era of global uncertainty. This "Australia first" approach aims to navigate the growing tensions between the U.S. and China by prioritizing the nation's own strategic realities. While maintaining key alliances like AUKUS and ANZUS, the government is asserting a more independent course to shape its future in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old with nonspeaking autism, has been accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) after a remarkable academic journey. For 14 years, Viraj was unable to communicate due to apraxia, leading many to believe he was severely mentally disabled. His father's persistence led to the discovery that Viraj could type with his right thumb, unlocking his hidden intelligence. In less than three years, he progressed from basic math to calculus, achieved a near-perfect score on his ACT, and graduated high school. Viraj hopes his story will serve as a breakthrough for the entire nonspeaking autistic community, proving that immense potential can exist behind communication barriers.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is implementing significant security upgrades. The agency is now using a fleet of military-grade drones for aerial reconnaissance and has established mobile command posts to ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement, addressing a key failure from the Butler incident. Before the 2024 shooting, the assailant flew a commercial drone over the rally site undetected. These technological and procedural changes are part of a broader effort to prevent a repeat of the security lapses that allowed the attack to occur.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the U.S. has resumed sending military supplies, after a temporary halt on some critical arms shipments last week. The renewal of aid includes a deal for NATO to purchase Patriot air defense systems from the U.S. and provide them to Ukraine to counter a recent surge in Russian drone and missile attacks. These attacks have caused record civilian casualties, prompting Zelensky to request additional defense systems. The move signals a renewed effort by the U.S. and its allies to bolster Ukraine's defenses as the conflict continues with increasing intensity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of AI-powered air combat systems, recently conducting a complex exercise involving crewed fighter jets and uncrewed "loyal wingman" drones. In the test, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15 each controlled two XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing real-time integration and semi-autonomous capabilities in a simulated combat environment. This push by the Air Force Research Laboratory is part of a broader strategic race with China to achieve air dominance through the integration of crewed and uncrewed aircraft. Chinese military observers claim their own development in this technological frontier is keeping pace with American efforts.</p>

          <p>The grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol will soon feature a statue of Robert Smalls, making it the first monument honoring a Black man at the site. Smalls was a formerly enslaved man who became a Civil War hero after commandeering a Confederate ship and delivering it to the Union, later serving as a U.S. Congressman. His statue will stand among existing monuments to five white men, most of whom have historical ties to the Confederacy or the Jim Crow era. The addition represents a significant and historic step in diversifying the figures commemorated at the state's seat of government.</p>
