          <p>Shohei Ohtani contributed an RBI single during the Los Angeles Dodgers' 6-5 victory over the Washington Nationals. Ohtani, who had been experiencing a three-game RBI drought, went 1-for-3, also drawing two walks. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts served a one-game suspension related to a previous game's incident, while Ohtani is still scheduled to pitch against the Nationals on Sunday. This article also mentions other MLB action, including a game where Tomoyuki Sugano was pulled early and another where Yusei Kikuchi pitched well in a loss; it highlights Ohtani's resilience and his continued role as a key player for the Dodgers, contributing both at bat and on the mound. The Dodgers' victory and Ohtani's performance underscore their strong position in the league, despite recent controversies and injuries. The Dodgers were able to secure a win against the Nationals despite Ohtani's struggles, showcasing their overall team strength.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to pass the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill was approved by MPs in the House of Commons but faces further scrutiny in the Lords. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the Lords should scrutinize but not oppose the bill. Critics express concerns about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals, while supporters emphasize the bill's safeguards, including multiple declarations, independent medical assessments, and a multi-disciplinary panel review.</p>

This initiative, part of a government drive towards preventative healthcare, aims to use genomics and AI to predict and prevent illnesses. Blood samples from umbilical cords will be used to sequence the complete DNA of newborns, screening for approximately 7,000 single gene disorders. Health Secretary Wes Streeting believes this technology will revolutionize the NHS, enabling personalized healthcare and reducing pressure on services.</p>

          <p>The House of Commons has backed a bill to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant step towards changing the law. The bill now moves to the House of Lords, where it faces further debate and potential amendments. The government anticipates a lengthy "commencement period" to prepare for implementation, with estimates suggesting hundreds of people may seek assisted death initially, potentially rising to 4,000 annually after a decade. This decision follows a socially liberal shift in Parliament, with MPs having a free vote on the matter, and reflects changing public opinion on end-of-life choices.</p>

          <p>A grassroots football league in Jiangsu province, China, known as the Su Super League, has sparked significant economic growth. The league has attracted millions of online viewers and thousands of fans to stadiums, boosting consumption of match tickets and local specialties. Featuring 13 city-based teams with players from diverse backgrounds, the league has become a commercial success.

          <p>President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard University regarding student visa issues, even as a judge ruled that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cannot prevent Harvard from hosting foreign students. A judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. Trump stated that his administration has been working closely with Harvard and a deal may be announced soon. The dispute arose after DHS revoked Harvard's student visa system certification, citing alleged failures to address campus antisemitism, which Harvard contested in court.</p>
