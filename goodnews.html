          <p>Taylor Swift appeared on the "New Heights" podcast with Travis and Jason Kelce to announce her upcoming 12th studio album, titled "The Life of a Showgirl," set for release on October 3. Swift revealed that the album, which she described as upbeat and joyful, was created with producers Max Martin and Shellback in Sweden during the European leg of her Eras Tour. The album will feature 12 tracks, including a collaboration with Sabrina Carpenter, and focuses on her off-stage experiences during the tour. Her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, who has heard the album, described it as a collection of "bangers" that will make people want to dance.</p>

The breaches, announced in March and July 2024, exposed personal information such as Social Security numbers and records of calls and texts for millions of current and former customers. Eligible individuals are being notified via email and must submit a claim form by November 18, 2025, providing documentation of their losses.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 11:03:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at MIT have utilized generative artificial intelligence to invent two new potential antibiotics capable of killing drug-resistant superbugs like gonorrhoea and MRSA. The AI designed the molecular structures of the drugs atom-by-atom, which then proved effective in laboratory and animal tests. This approach moves beyond simply screening existing chemicals, allowing for the creation of entirely new compounds. While these specific drugs still require years of refinement and clinical trials before human use, the researchers believe AI could usher in a new era of antibiotic discovery to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, which causes over a million deaths annually.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This year's A-level results in the UK show a slight increase in top grades, with 28.3% of entries marked A* or A, and a record number of 18-year-olds securing their first-choice university spot. The results also reveal a widening regional gap in England, with London students achieving significantly more top grades than those in the North East. For the first time since 2018, boys have slightly outperformed girls in achieving the highest grades. The cohort taking these exams is noted for being academically stronger but smaller, a lingering effect of pandemic-era grading adjustments that impacted their earlier GCSE results.</p>

          <p>Swiss pilot Raphael Domjan has broken the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane, reaching 9,521 meters (31,237 feet) in a flight over Switzerland. The SolarStratos aircraft, a lightweight carbon fiber plane with a large wingspan covered in solar panels, utilized warm air thermals to surpass the 15-year-old record. During the five-hour flight, Domjan's plane crossed paths with a commercial airliner, a moment his team called a powerful symbol for the future of decarbonized aviation. The team's ultimate goal is to pilot the solar plane into the stratosphere, demonstrating the potential of renewable energy in flight and inspiring a new generation.</p>

          <p>A years-long federal investigation that began with a minor car accident in a small Tennessee town has culminated in indictments against five leaders of the United Cartels, a major Mexican drug trafficking organization. The investigation utilized wiretaps and surveillance, uncovering a drug ring that stretched from Mexico to Atlanta and led to a shootout with police. The case highlights how drugs produced by violent cartels reach American communities and the extensive law enforcement efforts required to trace them back to their source. The U.S. government is now offering multi-million dollar rewards for information leading to the arrest of the indicted individuals, who are believed to be in Mexico.</p>

          <h2>Colorado Rabbits with Horn-Like Growths Attributed to Common Virus</h2>

          <p>Recent sightings of rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, with grotesque, horn-like growths on their faces have caused a stir, but scientists assure the public there is no cause for alarm. The cottontails are infected with Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless virus that causes wart-like tumors. The virus, which is not transmissible to humans or other animals, is believed to be the origin of the jackalope myth. The growths typically do not harm the rabbits unless they interfere with their ability to see or eat, and their immune systems can eventually fight off the virus, causing the growths to disappear.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 13-year-old student from Glasgow, has been named one of Time magazine's "girls of the year" for inventing a solar-powered blanket designed to help homeless individuals stay warm. Her concept, which uses solar panels to charge a battery pack that provides heat at night, was developed into a working prototype by the engineering firm Thales. The device won a national competition, and 35 units have been distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. Young, who was also immortalized as a Lego mini-figure for the honor, expressed shock and hopes her story inspires other young people to pursue their ideas.</p>

          <p>A New York woman, Micherre Fox, discovered a 2.30-carat colorless diamond during a month-long search at Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park, which she is now having set into her engagement ring. The park is a unique public site where visitors can search for real diamonds in their original volcanic source and keep whatever they find. Fox had decided two years ago that she wanted to find her own diamond for her ring as a symbol of hard work and problem-solving in a marriage. Her find is the third-largest diamond discovered at the park this year, where over 75,000 diamonds have been unearthed since 1906.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment for 2026 Estimated at 2.7%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 10:41:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to a new estimate from the Senior Citizens League. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, would be slightly higher than the 2.5% increase implemented in 2025. The Social Security Administration determines the annual COLA based on inflation data from the third quarter to ensure benefits keep pace with rising costs. However, some experts express concern that with inflation potentially rising later in the year due to tariffs, even a 2.7% adjustment might not be sufficient to cover the true expenses faced by seniors.

          <p>In a break from tradition, the International Olympic Committee has agreed to allow corporate sponsor names on venues for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic and Paralympic Games. This historic change will permit well-known venues like Crypto.com Arena to retain their names during the Games, providing a new revenue stream for the privately funded event. The move is expected to ease costs and logistical challenges associated with the IOC's traditional "clean venue" policy, which required temporary, generic names. LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman stated the change is about more than money, enhancing the overall experience and reflecting market realities in the United States.</p>
