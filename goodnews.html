          <p>Utility workers in Lima, Peru, discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy of a child while installing pipes, adding to the city's rich collection of pre-Hispanic tombs. The mummy, believed to be of a boy aged between 10 and 15, was found in a sitting position, wrapped in a shroud containing calabash gourds. Ceramic objects decorated with geometric figures and figures of fishermen were also found near the mummy, which belongs to the pre-Inca Chancay culture. This find underscores the common occurrence of archaeological discoveries during construction projects in Peru, where utility companies are required to hire archaeologists. </p>

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethical implications of students using AI to cheat on assignments and how to enforce institutional rules. The real value of a humanities education should be about helping students cultivate their character, not merely produce academic outputs. Practical wisdom, or phronesis, is about making good judgments in complex situations, a skill that is increasingly relevant in the age of AI. The author suggests that students should be given the choice to use AI but must reflect on how it impacts their thinking and learning process. </p>
