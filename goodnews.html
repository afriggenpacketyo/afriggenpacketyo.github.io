          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 03:27:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, following a coalition deal between her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the right-wing Japan Innovation Party. This election ends a three-month political vacuum after the LDP's election loss. Takaichi, a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is expected to pursue hawkish and nationalistic policies, including a stronger military and economy, and potentially revising Japan's pacifist constitution. Despite her historic appointment, Takaichi is not prioritizing gender equality and holds traditional views on imperial succession and marriage. Her untested alliance faces challenges in parliament, potentially leading to government instability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Declan Rice, a prominent Premier League central midfielder, has significantly adapted his role at Arsenal since his £105m transfer. Initially a holding midfielder, he transitioned to a box-to-box player, boosting his attacking contributions with nine goals and ten assists last season. The recent £60m signing of Martin Zubimendi has further refined Rice's position, allowing him to operate deeper alongside Zubimendi while still leveraging his athleticism to join attacks. This tactical shift has made him a "complete midfielder," leading Arsenal in ball carries, passes into the box, and chances created this season. Both Arsenal and England's managers are utilizing his versatile, all-action capabilities.</p>

          <p>Olympic medallist Matt Richardson, a track cyclist, explains his controversial switch from Australia to Great Britain, attributing it to the "magic" and comprehensive program of British Cycling. He describes the British setup as "Hogwarts" compared to Australia's "high school," crediting it for his record-breaking 8.857-second flying 200m time. Richardson is now preparing for the World Championships in Santiago, Chile, aiming for his first individual world gold after consistently being beaten by Dutch rival Harrie Lavreysen. His girlfriend and teammate, Emma Finucane, a triple Olympic medalist, will also compete, adapting to new team dynamics in the sprint events.

          <p>Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson announced that a comprehensive review identified over 2,700 potential non-citizens registered on the state's voter rolls, triggering eligibility investigations across all 254 counties. This initiative, made possible by direct access to the federal SAVE database, aims to bolster election integrity ahead of the 2026 election cycle. Each flagged voter will receive a notice requiring proof of U.S. citizenship within 30 days, failing which their registration will be canceled. Confirmed non-citizens who voted in previous Texas elections will be referred for potential prosecution, with Governor Greg Abbott emphasizing the removal of over one million ineligible registrations in the last three years as proof of Texas's commitment to election integrity.</p>

          <p>A collaborative research team from South China University of Technology and Flinders University in Australia has identified two protein enzymes crucial for prostate cancer cell growth, survival, and treatment resistance. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), this discovery uncovers a key mechanism regulating the androgen receptor (AR) protein, which plays a significant role in fueling prostate cancer. The findings offer a promising new therapeutic strategy to combat the disease, which affects many prominent figures globally, including former US President Joe Biden and the late Nelson Mandela. This scientific breakthrough could lead to more effective and targeted treatments, potentially improving outcomes for patients battling this widespread and challenging form of cancer.</p>

          <p>Australian scientists exploring the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia have discovered two new species: a semi-transparent, almond-sized porcelain crab and a tiny, glowing West Australian Lantern Shark. The lantern shark, found over 600m deep, grows up to 40cm and is bioluminescent. The porcelain crab, about 1.5cm long and found at 122m, is a filter feeder using hairs instead of claws. These discoveries are part of approximately 20 new species unearthed from a 2022 voyage, with an estimated 600 more awaiting description. This highlights Australia's vast unexplored waters and its status as a major biodiversity hotspot, enriching scientific understanding of marine life.</p>

          <p>Chinese exporters at the Canton Fair are observing a significant increase in requests for yuan-denominated trade settlements, particularly from countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Central Asian nations including Kazakhstan. For some companies, yuan-settled orders now account for between 10 and 20 percent of their total exports, a notable rise from single digits last year. This trend is partly driven by Chinese suppliers undertaking data center projects abroad and developing countries' ongoing need for essential power infrastructure like diesel-generator sets. The article suggests a growing international acceptance and use of the yuan in trade, reflecting evolving global economic dynamics and China's increasing influence in international commerce and financial stability.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Chicago and Illinois urged the Supreme Court to uphold a lower court's order blocking the deployment of the National Guard into Chicago, despite federalization by the Trump administration.

With the temporary restraining order nearing expiration, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul emphasized that the current arrangement safeguards the constitutional balance of power between federal and state governments. The brief asserts that Illinois would suffer irreparable harm if the deployment were permitted, and the Trump administration is unlikely to justify the takeover.</p>

          <p>A theory dubbed "winology," coined by Chinese academics, is gaining traction online, addressing what it perceives as unfair Western dismissal of China's economic and technological advancements. This viewpoint suggests a hierarchical Western thinking that categorizes nations, placing Germanic peoples as "first-class" and Chinese as "fourth-class" global citizens. The theory explores how countries can achieve global leadership and recognition. Discussions around winology have attracted academic attention, including a seminar at Wuhan University, with participants from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Tsinghua University, highlighting its role in fostering intellectual debate about international perceptions and national development.</p>
