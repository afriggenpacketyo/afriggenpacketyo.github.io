          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has lauded the relationship between Beijing and Moscow as the "most stable, mature, and strategically significant" major-country relationship globally, during discussions with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. Wang underscored the importance of Russian President Vladimir Putin's forthcoming visit to China, identifying it as a key priority for bilateral relations in the coming months. This article emphasizes the ongoing close communication between the foreign ministers, which facilitates the timely execution of agreements made by their respective heads of state. The two nations are committed to deepening comprehensive strategic coordination and collaboratively addressing the complexities of a turbulent and evolving world order.</p>

          <h2>China's New Approach to Curbing Excessive Market Competition Analyzed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 01:57:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's top leadership, including President Xi Jinping, has recently expressed significant concern over excessive competition, or "neijuan," within the domestic market, indicating a notable shift in policy priorities. This new focus aims to regulate disorderly and low-price competition among enterprises, encouraging them instead to enhance product quality and facilitate the orderly exit of outdated production capacity. Unlike the 2015 "supply-side structural reform," this current endeavor faces a vastly different economic environment, marked by weaker overall growth and constrained fiscal capacity. Analysts suggest that the increased prominence of private firms in the economy will present substantial challenges for Beijing in effectively implementing these reforms and curbing this pervasive issue.</p>

          <h2>Bitcoin Reaches Record Highs, Surpassing $120,000 Amid Strong ETF Inflows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 01:56:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has reached unprecedented all-time highs, surpassing the $120,000 mark, primarily propelled by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which recently saw a record $1.18 billion in a single day. Industry analysts and cryptocurrency exchange executives believe this surge is largely driven by long-term institutional buyers, with predictions suggesting the digital currency could climb to $140,000-$160,000 by the end of the year. The momentum is further supported by growing anticipation of more defined regulatory frameworks for digital assets in the U.S. and increasing corporate adoption of bitcoin. While institutional investment dominates this rally, retail investors appear to be less active, indicating a shift in market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) brands are swiftly capturing significant market share in Norway, a nation distinguished by its high EV adoption rates and its policy of not imposing tariffs on Chinese EV imports, unlike the U.S. and EU. With more than 20 distinct Chinese EV models now accessible, these brands collectively hold approximately 10% of the Norwegian market, intensifying competition for major Western automakers such as Tesla. This article posits that Norway functions as a crucial "laboratory" for Chinese EV manufacturers aiming to penetrate the broader European market, leveraging its open regulatory environment and the absence of a native auto industry. The success is largely attributed to the competitive pricing and advanced technological features offered by Chinese EVs.</p>

          <p>Google has made a substantial move in the competitive AI talent landscape, securing a $2.4 billion agreement to integrate Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of the artificial intelligence coding startup Windsurf, along with key senior research and development personnel. This strategic arrangement grants Google a nonexclusive license to certain Windsurf technologies, rather than a full company acquisition, allowing Windsurf to continue licensing its innovations. The deal underscores the escalating talent war among major tech firms, particularly after Windsurf had reportedly engaged in acquisition discussions with OpenAI for a larger sum. Google's objective is to significantly advance its work in "agentic coding" and further extend the capabilities of its Gemini AI models to software developers globally.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, successfully avoiding a technical recession following a contraction in the previous quarter, largely propelled by robust growth in its manufacturing and construction sectors. This article suggests the economic rebound was partly influenced by a temporary pause on "reciprocal tariffs" until August 1st and a broader de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade dispute. Despite these positive GDP figures, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious stance, issuing a warning about "significant uncertainty and downside risks" within the global economy, primarily stemming from the unresolved clarity surrounding U.S. tariff policies. This situation underscores Singapore's inherent susceptibility to fluctuating global trade tensions, despite its recent demonstration of economic resilience. (not investment advice)</p>
