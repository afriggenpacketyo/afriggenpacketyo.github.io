        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Maine Coast Fisherman‚Äôs Association has voiced its support for Jordon Hudson, who advocated for Maine's commercial fishermen during the Miss Maine USA pageant. Hudson has been a champion for the fishing community, acknowledging Senator Susan Collins and the Trump administration for their work on Maine Sea Grant funding. During the pageant, Hudson expressed her desire to advocate for these communities to prevent further decline in the fishing industry, drawing from her family's history with a fishing business that went bankrupt due to regulatory constraints. The Association highlighted that advocacy can take many forms, praising Hudson for bringing attention to Maine fishing communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with Juan Soto regarding his effort running out of the batter's box, following an incident where Soto watched a potential home run bounce off the Green Monster for a single. This comes after a similar play where Soto was slow out of the box on a ground ball during a game against the Yankees. Despite signing a significant contract with the Mets, Soto's performance has been mixed, though his OPS remains second-best among qualified Mets players. Mendoza emphasized the need for Soto to hustle, especially in a ballpark like Fenway Park.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen, a long-time critic of Donald Trump, recently denounced the current US administration as corrupt and treasonous during a concert in England. Trump responded by calling Springsteen a 'dried out prune of a rocker' and suggested investigating appearances made by Springsteen and Beyonc√© for Kamala Harris, alleging illegal campaign donations. Springsteen repeated his criticisms the following night, undeterred by Trump's remarks. This exchange highlights the ongoing political divide and the willingness of both figures to engage in public disputes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, partnerships with suppliers, and productivity. He noted that over half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and they have diversified import sources, reducing reliance on China. This contrasts with Walmart's plan to raise prices to cover tariff costs. Home Depot reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, missing earnings expectations but beating sales estimates. They maintained their full-year sales forecast, based on the assumption of continued lower tariffs.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new fossil species, Mosura fentoni, from Canada‚Äôs Burgess Shale, characterized by three eyes and a segmented abdomen, and researchers say it is 'unlike any living animal'. The creature, about the size of an index finger, possessed spiny jointed claws and a circular mouth lined with teeth. Mosura was a member of radiodonts, an extinct group including Anomalocaris canadensis. The discovery provides insights into the early evolution of arthropods, highlighting their surprising diversity and adaptation.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that the ancestor of animals and plants was a hydrogen-metabolizing cell existing before the Great Oxidation Event. The study, published in Nature, suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. Eukaryotes, characterized by a membrane-bound nucleus, are the foundation of complex life, including animals, plants, and fungi. These findings support the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotes and could provide insights into the evolution of life and the exploration of life in outer space.</p>

          <p>In Sonora, Mexico, the Northern Jaguar Project (NJP) is working to change the perception of jaguars from threats to cattle to valuable features of the ecosystem. Through the Viviendo con Felinos program, ranchers are paid for photos of wild cats taken on their land, incentivizing them to protect jaguars and their prey. This initiative has expanded the protected area for jaguars and fostered a cultural shift, with ranchers increasingly valuing the presence of these animals. The success of this program offers hope for restoring jaguars to their historic range in the US, dependent on maintaining openings in the border wall and a healthy population in Mexico.</p>

          <p>Japan is considering easing its demand for the full removal of U.S. tariffs, potentially agreeing to lower duty rates to reach a trade deal with the United States.
