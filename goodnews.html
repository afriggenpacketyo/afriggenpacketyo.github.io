          <p>Donald Trump announced on his social media platform that he has convinced Coca-Cola to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to real cane sugar for its cola sold in the United States. While Coca-Cola uses cane sugar in products sold in other countries like Mexico, its U.S. version has long used corn syrup. Trump, a known fan of Diet Coke, framed the alleged agreement as a positive development for the company and consumers. Coca-Cola has not yet publicly commented on the claim.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, although revenue fell slightly short. CEO Scott Kirby expressed confidence for the remainder of the year, stating the world is "less uncertain" and that travel demand is recovering after a weak start to 2025. The airline has issued a new full-year earnings forecast of $9 to $11 per share, reflecting a more stable outlook than its previous dual-scenario prediction. The report also noted operational challenges, particularly at its Newark hub, which impacted profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking UK study has resulted in the birth of eight healthy children using a technique known as mitochondrial donation, effectively preventing them from inheriting severe genetic disorders. The method combines the nuclear DNA from the parents with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg, creating an embryo with genetic material from three individuals. While hailed as a major scientific advance for families affected by these devastating diseases, the procedure raises ethical concerns about genetic manipulation. The children will require continued monitoring to confirm the long-term safety of the technique.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has offered a positive assessment of China's efforts to curb the flow of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that has fueled a crisis in the U.S. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump said Beijing is making "big steps" to address the issue, a notable shift in tone from his previous statements that linked the fentanyl problem directly to the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods. The comments come as high-level trade negotiations continue between the two countries. Trump made the remarks while signing the HALT Fentanyl Act into law.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill known as the Genius Act, which has passed the Senate, is now being considered by the House, potentially paving the way for the regulation of stablecoins in the U.S. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, like the U.S. dollar, to reduce volatility. The legislation aims to create clear rules and consumer protections for the $250 billion market, defining what can be legally termed a stablecoin and allowing banks to issue their own. Proponents argue this will facilitate faster, cheaper payments. (not investment advice)</p>

The positive momentum was further fueled by a social media post from President Trump indicating that the dissenting representatives had agreed to support the bills.

Comprised of 15 judges from different nations, the ICJ settles legal disputes between states, unlike the International Criminal Court which tries individuals. Its jurisdiction depends on whether states have agreed to submit to its authority, either through a general declaration, specific consent, or by being party to a treaty like the Genocide Convention. While its rulings are legally binding, the ICJ has no enforcement mechanism, relying on the cooperation of the involved states.</p>
