        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oakmont Country Club's notoriously fast greens, deep rough, and penal bunkers make it one of golf's toughest courses, as noted by legendary golfers. The course's difficulty inspired the invention of the Stimpmeter to measure green speed, and golfers have long commented on its challenging layout. Built in the early 20th century, Oakmont was designed to severely penalize poor shots. The course has been modified over time, now measuring 7,431 yards with a par of 71, and it has hosted several US Opens, with winning scores often over par. This year's tournament is expected to provide a formidable challenge for the world's best golfers.</p>

          <p>A woman shared her frustrations on Reddit about being the sole cook in her household and the criticism she receives from her husband regarding meal variety. She described a system of repeating 10 dishes to ease the mental burden of cooking for her family, which includes her husband, daughter, and younger brother. The conflict arose when her husband requested fancier meals with more meat, but then objected to the cost of the necessary ingredients. Commenters on Reddit largely supported the woman, suggesting she stop cooking for her husband and allow him to fend for himself.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is implementing a climate solution to combat rising temperatures: planting more trees, especially in urban heat islands. These areas, often lower-income neighborhoods, experience higher temperatures due to lack of shade and older homes. Research indicates that trees can significantly lower temperatures, and the city aims to plant 2,000 trees annually to reach a goal of 60,000 by 2050. The effort involves selecting drought-tolerant, shade-providing trees and educating the next generation through school garden clubs, all to mitigate the effects of climate change and improve community well-being.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) intends to divide into two independent publicly traded companies by next year, reflecting ongoing shifts in the media industry as consumers transition from cable to streaming. One entity will focus on streaming and studios, incorporating movie properties and HBO Max, while the other will manage global networks, including CNN, TNT Sports, and Discovery. David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, with Gunnar Wiedenfels heading the global networks business. This decision follows restructuring moves and aligns with industry trends, such as Comcast's spin-off of its cable networks into Versant. The split is expected to be completed by mid-2026.</p>

          <p>Aaron Judge hit a home run off Boston Red Sox rookie Hunter Dobbins after Dobbins made disparaging comments about the Yankees before the game. Dobbins, a lifelong Red Sox fan, stated he would retire if the Yankees were the last team to offer him a contract. Judge was informed of the comments and responded by hitting a two-run homer on the first pitch he faced from Dobbins. Despite Judge's performance, Dobbins earned the win as the Red Sox defeated the Yankees 11-7, securing the series victory. The incident highlights the intense rivalry between the two teams.</p>
