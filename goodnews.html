          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, India and Pakistan engaged in escalating military conflict, raising concerns among world leaders. After U.S.-led mediation talks, the countries announced a ceasefire, with President Donald Trump confirming the agreement. The rivalry between the two countries stems from a decades-old dispute over the Kashmir region, with both nations claiming the territory as their own.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that declining birth rates and family formation are becoming increasingly partisan issues, which is detrimental to addressing the looming demographic crisis. An aging and shrinking population could lead to a decrease in the expected quality of life, with a smaller working population supporting a larger elderly population. The author suggests that progressives should engage in the conversation about population decline and support policies that add to freedom and improve people's lives, such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, and affordable healthcare.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered an 80,000-year-old bone spear tip in Russia, indicating that Neanderthals, not modern humans, crafted the advanced hunting weapon. Since Homo sapiens didn't arrive in Europe until about 45,000 years ago, Neanderthals are the likely creators. The discovery joins other recent finds demonstrating Neanderthals developed bone-working techniques. The spear tip, found among animal remains and stone tools in Mezmaiskaya Cave, shows evidence of successful use shortly after its creation.</p>

The therapy involved modifying the patients' own stem cells to correct the genetic defect, and all three children have since recovered and are thriving.

          <p>Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh is using a new approach to evaluate rookie talent, focusing on individual drills rather than 11-on-11 periods during minicamp. The goal is to provide a fair way for rookies to compete and showcase their pure talent. Harbaugh is "mining for gold" by teaching two drills that directly apply to the Chargers' scheme and three drills by position. The rookies who pass the minicamp will join veterans during organized team activities, where the Chargers are experimenting with offensive line configurations.</p>

          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances. The bill aims to allow research to catch up with the US‚Äôs increasing cannabis consumption, enabling policymakers to craft effective legislation. Unlike rescheduling, the EBDPA would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that forbid federal funds from going towards research of schedule I substances. Experts believe the bill has the potential to attract bipartisan support and advance medical research on cannabis and other schedule I substances.</p>
