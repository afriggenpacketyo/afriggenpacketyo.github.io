          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 21:08:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More retailers and food brands are offering products with fewer ingredients, driven by growing consumer concern over ultra-processed foods. This trend is exemplified by M&S's "Only" range, which features products with six or fewer ingredients, catering to shoppers with allergies and those seeking simpler options. Plant-based brand THIS has also launched a "Super Superfoods" range with natural ingredients in response to consumer avoidance of processed meat replacements. However, some nutritionists argue that focusing solely on fewer ingredients can overlook the importance of fortified nutrients for public health. </p>

          <p>China has tested core components of quantum-based network technology in space, marking a step toward building an integrated space-ground system for secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were launched on a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket to assess their robustness against space travel stresses. This test is part of China's effort to establish a quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC skips the key-sharing step of quantum key distribution, sending messages directly through a quantum channel, which some experts consider the ultimate form of secure communication. </p>

          <p>San Francisco is intensifying its efforts to address its homelessness crisis through targeted sweeps of encampments and increased enforcement of illegal camping laws. Between June 2024 and June 2025, nearly 1,000 people have been arrested or cited for illegal camping, though few are ever charged. Mayor Daniel Lurie emphasizes that the city leads with services and values, focusing on getting people into shelters and treatment programs. The city's efforts have resulted in nearly half of San Francisco's homeless population being sheltered, a 35% increase since 2019, but some unhoused individuals express that shelters do not meet their needs. </p>
