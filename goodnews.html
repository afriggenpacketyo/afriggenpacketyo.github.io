          <p>Intel's stock surged over 7% following reports that the Trump administration is in discussions to take a government stake in the company. This move aims to bolster domestic manufacturing of high-tech computer chips, a key priority for the administration, and would help fund Intel's new factories in Ohio. The potential investment highlights a broader trend of increased government involvement in key industries to advance national and economic security interests. Intel has declined to comment on the speculation but affirmed its commitment to working with the administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Zervos, a Wall Street strategist and a potential candidate to lead the Federal Reserve, has strongly advocated for aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy. He argues that current monetary policy is too restrictive and that a half-percentage-point cut is needed to prevent a labor market slowdown and potentially create a million new jobs. Zervos, one of nearly a dozen names being considered to succeed Jerome Powell, believes his market-focused background would be a benefit to the central bank's decision-making process.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest point in ten months, offering a glimmer of hope for prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance. This decline comes ahead of any potential cut to the federal funds rate, which is a major driver of borrowing costs. The article suggests that future rate drops could be tied to upcoming economic data releases, such as the September employment and inflation reports. The Federal Reserve's next meeting on September 17 is also a key date, as any decision to cut its benchmark rate could further influence the mortgage market. (not investment advice)</p>

The policy, which gave the Department of Homeland Security daily access to sensitive information like home addresses and Social Security numbers, was challenged in a lawsuit by 20 states over privacy concerns. The judge ruled that using this data for immigration enforcement threatens to disrupt the Medicaid program, which serves the nation's most vulnerable residents, and could deter people from seeking emergency medical care.</p>

          <p>British chess prodigy Bodhana Sivanandan, aged 10, has made history by becoming the youngest female player to defeat a grandmaster. She achieved this record-breaking victory against 60-year-old grandmaster Peter Wells during the final round of the British Chess Championships. Sivanandan, who only began playing chess during the COVID-19 pandemic at age five, is now considered a "woman international master," the second-highest title for female players. Experts believe she is on a path to becoming a grandmaster herself and could potentially become a future world champion.</p>

          <p>At MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Professor Daniela Rus and her team are developing AI to enable humanoid robots to perform tasks in the physical world safely and effectively. By using sensors to capture how humans perform actions, they are teaching robots to replicate tasks like preparing a drink with human-like precision and force. The research aims to move beyond single-task industrial robots to create machines that can adapt to dynamic, human-centered environments like homes and hospitals. Rus emphasizes that these robots are tools designed to extend human capabilities, with safety measures like emergency stop buttons built-in.</p>

          <p>Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, are donating $2 billion to the Oregon Health and Science University's Knight Cancer Institute, marking the largest single donation ever to a U.S. health or academic institution. The gift is intended to revolutionize the scientific approach to cancer research, treatment, and patient care. This monumental pledge builds on a previous challenge where the Knights matched $500 million in fundraising for the institute, led by cancer research pioneer Dr. Brian Druker. The donation underscores the Knights' extensive philanthropic history and their commitment to advancing medical science.</p>

Diagnosed with Stargardt disease at age nine, Colton has refused to let her condition limit her, having already learned to snowboard and completed the Boston Marathon. She and her friends established the Vorden Initiative, a nonprofit that trains sighted individuals to be athletic guides for the blind. Her upcoming ascent of Africa's highest peak is part of an exhibition with ten other blind climbers, showcasing her remarkable determination and resilience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, AI software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, reaching a market valuation past $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been U.S. government contracts, particularly with the military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its massive valuation, which dwarfs that of more profitable tech giants, Palantir only recently posted its first quarter with over $1 billion in revenue. This has resulted in a sky-high forward price-to-earnings ratio, indicating that investors are paying a significant premium based on high expectations for its future AI-driven growth.

          <p>Rebecca Young, a Glasgow school pupil, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its "girls of the year" for inventing a device to help homeless people stay warm. At age 12, she designed a solar-powered blanket that stores the sun's heat during the day in a battery pack to provide warmth at night. Her idea won a national engineering competition, and the engineering firm Thales subsequently produced working prototypes that are now being used by a homeless charity in Glasgow. As part of the honor, which is in partnership with Lego, Young was also immortalized as a Lego mini-figure.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has taken federal control of Washington D.C.'s police and deployed the National Guard, legal experts suggest such a move would be far more difficult to replicate in other U.S. cities. Unlike D.C., which falls under direct federal jurisdiction, the 50 states have governors who command their own National Guard units. The Posse Comitatus Act also broadly prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. While Trump could attempt limited interventions to protect federal property, a full takeover of a city's police force outside the capital would face significant legal and constitutional challenges.</p>

Following nominations from his would-be classmates, the academy conferred upon him an Honorary Graduate Award, recognizing that he embodied West Point's core values of duty, honor, and country. His story of selfless sacrifice has become part of the class's shared identity as they begin their service as Army officers.</p>
