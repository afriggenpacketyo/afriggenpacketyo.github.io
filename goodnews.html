          <p>Derrick Groves, the final inmate from a May mass escape at the Orleans Parish Justice Center, has been captured in Atlanta following a brief standoff, concluding a months-long, multi-agency manhunt. His apprehension brings significant relief to victims and the New Orleans community, who had been rightly concerned by a convicted violent offender's prolonged evasion of justice. Groves, facing life imprisonment for past crimes and additional charges for the jailbreak, was found in a crawl space and taken into custody peacefully. This incident has highlighted severe design flaws and staffing issues at the justice center, prompting ongoing investigations into the escape's facilitation and the need for improved custodial security.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached a deal for the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces to an "agreed upon line," marking the "first Phase" of a peace agreement. This breakthrough, confirmed by regional sources and mediators, is expected to see hostages released within 72 hours of Israeli cabinet approval. The deal, which also involves the release of Palestinian prisoners, aims to end the two-year-long war that began with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack and has resulted in significant casualties. Mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey were instrumental in brokering this agreement.</p>

          <p>A Disneyland visitor in her 60s died at an Orange County hospital after requiring medical attention following a ride on the Haunted Mansion attraction. Anaheim police confirmed the woman became unresponsive after finishing the Halloween-themed ride, with preliminary indications pointing to an unfortunate medical episode rather than an attraction malfunction. Theme park experts emphasize that deaths at such venues, especially on slow-moving rides like the Haunted Mansion, are extremely rare due to rigorous daily inspections. The incident highlights the inherent, albeit minimal, risks associated with any public activity, while officials extend thoughts to the family.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed 20-point peace plan for Gaza outlines a multi-phase roadmap, endorsed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aimed at ending the two-year conflict. Key elements include an immediate ceasefire, the release of all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and a phased Israeli military withdrawal to an agreed-upon line. The plan also proposes demilitarizing Gaza under independent supervision and establishing a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" for governance, overseen by an "International Stabilization Force" and a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. While offering a "credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination," it sidesteps immediate Palestinian statehood, focusing instead on stabilization and economic redevelopment.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard a case challenging Illinois's voting regulation allowing mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days post-Election Day, even though the plaintiff, Rep. Michael Bost, won his election. Justices from both conservative and liberal wings expressed skepticism regarding Bost's claim of harm, questioning if a reduced margin of victory or staffing costs constituted sufficient standing. The court also debated whether any candidate, regardless of winning chances, should have automatic grounds to sue over election rules. This case highlights the complexities of electoral law and standing, with justices poking holes in arguments from both sides.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday, his second such visit since returning to the White House in January. This announcement follows earlier concerns and online speculation about the president's health, fueled by a previous diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency and visible bruising. The White House physician's April report declared Trump "fully fit," attributing his excellent physical and mental well-being partly to golf victories. Trump also indicated he is considering a trip to the Middle East shortly after his medical consultation.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire deal, marking the "first phase" of a peace plan intended to end the devastating two-year Gaza war, as announced by President Trump. The agreement, brokered by mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, is expected to involve the release of nearly 50 hostages in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Key elements include Hamas disarming and relinquishing governance of Gaza, with Israel maintaining a security perimeter before eventual troop withdrawal. While a major breakthrough after previous failed truces, the deal's precise details and a clear roadmap for Palestinian political rights remain to be fully resolved.</p>

          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner lauded defender Maya Le Tissier, fueling speculation about her potential inclusion in England's starting lineup for upcoming matches against Brazil and Australia. Despite being a consistent and top-performing defender in the Women's Super League, Le Tissier has limited international caps, often played out of position at right-back by England coach Sarina Wiegman. Skinner praised the 23-year-old as a "rock" for United, highlighting her composure and technique, particularly after she scored a crucial penalty in their Champions League debut. Injuries to key England players like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze could open a path for her central defensive role.</p>
