          <h2>U.S. Treasury Reports Unexpected June Surplus Driven by Surging Tariff Receipts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:12:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government unexpectedly posted a $27 billion surplus in June, a notable improvement from May's $316 billion deficit, largely propelled by a significant 301% surge in customs duties compared to the previous year. This positive development reduced the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.34 trillion, a 1% decrease from the same period last year, marking the first June surplus since 2017. However, the nation's finances still face challenges from persistently high Treasury yields, with net interest on the $36 trillion national debt reaching $84 billion in June. Furthermore, President Trump's recent spending bill is anticipated to add approximately $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, indicating complex long-term fiscal pressures.

          <p>A message in a bottle launched into the Atlantic Ocean by Canadian couple Brad and Anita Squires from Newfoundland 13 years ago has remarkably washed ashore in Ireland. Discovered by Kate and Jon Gay on Scraggane Bay, the note, a memento of the couple's day trip, asked the finder to call them. The bottle's improbable journey of 2,000 miles captured widespread attention after the Maharees Conservation Association shared the story online, quickly leading to the Squires, now married with three children, confirming their authorship. This heartwarming tale of resilience has brought joy to many, symbolizing enduring connections and positive ripple effects across continents.</p>

          <h2>Richard Simmons' Housekeeper Addresses Final Years, Denies 'Kidnapping' Claims</h2>

          <p>Teresa Reveles, Richard Simmons' longtime housekeeper and companion, has given her first broadcast interview, refuting rumors that she "kidnapped" the late fitness guru from the public eye. Reveles stated that Simmons was "incredibly happy" in his final decade, despite his seclusion, which she attributed to his discomfort with aging and desire to be remembered as vibrant. She described their unique, non-sexual but deeply close relationship, likening him to a brother, father, and friend. Simmons passed away on July 13, 2024, due to blunt traumatic injuries from a fall, with arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a contributing factor, an accident Reveles found peaceful.</p>

The aid, distributed through cash cards with "a couple hundred" dollars, will be funded by philanthropic partners and disseminated by immigrant rights organizations. This initiative aligns with a broader executive order signed by Mayor Bass, which directs city departments to strengthen sanctuary policy protocols and training, prohibiting city resources from being used for immigration enforcement except in serious crime cases. Additionally, the city will seek records from ICE regarding raid dates, locations, and detentions, underscoring L.A.'s commitment to protecting its immigrant communities.</p>

The second day of the third Test concluded with India at 145-3, trailing England's 387 all out, in a tightly contested match where Jasprit Bumrah also delivered a powerful five-wicket haul for India. Archer's impactful comeback, characterized by high-speed bowling, marks a significant moment in the series, which remains beautifully poised.</p>

          <p>The popular fitness goal of walking 10,000 steps a day, widely adopted and integrated into smart devices, originated not from scientific research but as a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the Manpo-kei. While initially arbitrary, subsequent research suggests this number is surprisingly close to a meaningful health benchmark, with benefits beginning around 2,500-3,000 steps and plateauing around 7,500 for some groups. Experts emphasize that any increase in activity is beneficial and that the intensity of walking matters more than just the count. The article concludes that while 10,000 steps can be a motivating goal, personalization and consistent movement are key for improved health.</p>
