          <p>The article examines the resurgence of "lavender marriages," which historically served as a protective cover for LGBTQ+ individuals in repressive societies. Now, the term is trending on TikTok among younger generations, who are redefining it as a platonic partnership for companionship and to navigate economic challenges like high housing costs. While this modern interpretation highlights evolving perspectives on relationships and marriage, some critics argue that it risks trivializing the oppressive history that once made such arrangements a necessity for survival.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has compelled Ticketmaster to provide clearer information on ticket prices following complaints regarding sales for the Oasis reunion tour. The company must now disclose 24 hours in advance if a tiered pricing system is used and give more details about costs during online queues. The investigation found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing" but determined that the labeling of more expensive "platinum" tickets may have been misleading, as they offered no extra benefits.</p>
