        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed that veterinary practices be required to publish their price lists to increase transparency for pet owners. An investigation found that vet prices have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation, with large corporate groups charging significantly more than independent vets. The proposed changes, which also include capping prescription fees and banning certain bonuses, aim to help owners shop around and avoid unexpectedly large bills for animal treatments. The current regulatory system, established in 1966, is seen as outdated for the modern corporate-dominated industry.</p>

          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML has affirmed its 2026 sales outlook will not fall below 2025 levels, easing investor concerns about future growth. However, the company also warned of a significant decline in sales to China next year due to geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions. Despite this, ASML reported strong third-quarter orders of 5.4 billion euros, buoyed by the global demand for AI technology. The company maintained its forecast for a 15% sales increase for the current year compared to the last. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region posted gains on Wednesday, in contrast to declines on Wall Street, even as trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated. U.S. President Donald Trump criticized China and threatened new trade actions, contributing to volatility in American markets. Despite this, Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index all saw significant rises. The positive performance in Asia occurred alongside the release of Chinese data showing consumer prices fell more than expected, indicating persistent deflationary pressures in the country's economy.

          <p>OpenAI has announced that its chatbot, ChatGPT, will soon be permitted to generate erotic content for users who have been verified as adults. CEO Sam Altman explained the change is part of a new policy to "treat adult users like adults" and will be implemented as age-gating features are fully rolled out. The company is also relaxing other restrictions to make the AI more "human-like" and creative, a move that follows earlier efforts to tighten safeguards around sensitive topics like mental health. The decision aims to restore some of the chatbot's original praised personality while maintaining protections for vulnerable users.</p>

          <p>British track cyclist Jack Carlin, a winner of four Olympic medals, has announced his retirement from the sport at the age of 28. Carlin, who won silver and bronze medals at both the Tokyo and Paris Games, explained that he struggled to find the motivation to continue after last summer's Olympics. The Scottish athlete stated that after taking time away from the high-performance environment, he realized the "fire to go" had not returned. He expressed contentment with his career achievements and is now looking forward to exploring a new identity beyond being a professional cyclist.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' potent postseason offense has been notably driven by the hitters in the bottom half of their lineup. While the team's top stars have been relatively contained, players batting sixth through ninth have been instrumental, combining for 14 RBIs and 35 hits across eight playoff games. In their Game 2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers, Teoscar Hernández, Tommy Edman, Kiké Hernández, and Andy Pages collectively produced seven hits and three runs. This lineup depth has been a key factor in wearing down opponents and underscores the team's comprehensive offensive strength.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving the $1.4 billion judgment against him for defaming Sandy Hook victims' families in place. Jones had argued that the default judgment, issued after he failed to comply with court orders, was improper. The families sued Jones after he repeatedly claimed the 2012 elementary school shooting was a hoax. A lawyer for the families stated they look forward to enforcing the verdict and holding Jones accountable, while Jones continues to face bankruptcy proceedings and efforts to liquidate his Infowars assets to pay the damages.</p>

          <p>The U.S. men's national soccer team secured a 2-1 comeback win against Australia in a friendly match in Colorado, though the victory was tempered by an early injury to captain Christian Pulisic. Australia took a surprise lead with a goal from Jordy Bos, but striker Haji Wright equalized for the U.S. before halftime. Wright scored the game-winner in the second half, curling a shot past the Australian keeper to seal the victory. The physical match saw Pulisic substituted in the 27th minute with a lower leg complaint after several heavy challenges from the opposition.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' strategy in the National League Championship Series has centered on dominant performances from their starting pitchers, effectively neutralizing their bullpen concerns. Following Blake Snell's eight-inning gem in Game 1, Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched a complete game in the 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 2. This approach has allowed manager Dave Roberts to avoid using his less reliable relievers in high-leverage situations. The article suggests that this starting pitching strength has negated the Brewers' supposed bullpen advantage and is the key reason for the Dodgers' 2-0 series lead.</p>

          <p>According to some Chinese economic researchers, escalating trade pressure from the United States could inadvertently bolster unity and motivation within China. Amid new sanctions and tariffs, scholars like Yang Jianwen of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences argue that external pressure often transforms into a driving force for the nation. This perspective suggests that rather than yielding, Beijing may double down on its long-term economic strategies. The heightened tensions come as the Communist Party prepares for its fourth plenum, where this theme of resilience in the face of external challenges is expected to be prominent.</p>

          <p>Despite a largely positive story about his role in the Gaza ceasefire, Donald Trump has publicly criticized the cover photo used by Time magazine for its November 10 issue. On his Truth Social platform, Trump called the picture "super bad," complaining that the low-angle shot made his hair "disappear" and created a strange halo effect. The former president has a long-documented fascination with appearing on the cover of Time. The photo, which some commentators noted was unflattering to his chin and neck, has generated discussion about the publication's artistic choices.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a television advertisement from Red Tractor, the country's largest farm certification scheme, for making misleading environmental claims. The ruling found that the organization provided insufficient evidence to support the ad's suggestion that its certified farms ensure a high level of environmental protection. The complaint, brought by the group River Action, cited an Environment Agency report indicating Red Tractor farms were not necessarily indicators of good environmental performance. Red Tractor called the ASA's decision "fundamentally flawed," arguing its primary focus is on food safety and animal welfare, not environmental standards.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has announced the seizure of approximately $15 billion in bitcoin connected to a massive "pig butchering" fraud operation based in Cambodia. The seizure, the largest in DOJ history, is tied to an indictment against Chen Zhi, the alleged leader of the scheme who remains at large. Prosecutors allege Zhi's Prince Holding Group operated forced-labor scam compounds where trafficked individuals were made to defraud victims worldwide out of billions of dollars through cryptocurrency investment scams. The Treasury Department also designated the Prince Group as a transnational criminal organization and sanctioned Zhi and his associates.</p>
