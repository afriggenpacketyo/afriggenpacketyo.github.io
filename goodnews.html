          <p>Elon Musk publicly stated that he regrets some of his recent social media posts directed at Donald Trump, admitting that they "went too far." This comes after a public dispute between the two figures, which had caused market concerns regarding Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict was initiated by Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill. Musk had also accused Trump of being mentioned in the "files" of the late Jeffrey Epstein, an allegation the White House disputed. The article outlines the resolution of the conflict between the two prominent figures.</p>
