          <p>Irish golfer Shane Lowry is preparing for his return to Royal Portrush, the site of his triumphant 2019 Open Championship victory. He recalls the incredible atmosphere and the "best golf of his life" that led to his six-shot win, a historic moment for Irish golf. Lowry acknowledges that the dynamic will be different this time, as he will be returning as a defending champion with higher expectations on him, unlike in 2019 when he was more under the radar. Now a more experienced and higher-ranked player, he feels equipped to handle the pressure and aims for another strong performance at the major.</p>

          <p>The third fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden showcased a more tactical and controlled boxing match, differing from the fiery brawls of their previous encounters. Taylor secured another victory by out-boxing Serrano, who had adjusted her own style to counter the Irish champion's speed. The article reflects on the significance of the event, arguing that true equality in women's boxing includes the right to fight strategically and win "ugly," not just to provide thrilling spectacles. It contrasts the sport's nobility and the athletes' dedication with the lingering contradictions, such as financial disparities and objectification.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock, known as NWA 16788, is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert. A meteorite hunter discovered it in Niger in November 2023. This unique specimen is about 70% larger than the next-largest Martian rock and represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its four-decade armed conflict with Turkey and has begun a disarmament process, creating a potential turning point for peace in the region. The move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, though the group has stipulated that full disarmament depends on concessions from Ankara, including his release. Turkey's government has cautiously welcomed the development as an opportunity for stability, but will require the PKK to dismantle all its structures. A successful peace process could significantly improve Turkey's relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria.</p>

          <p>Forty years after the historic Live Aid concerts, the event is remembered as a monumental moment of global unity and fundraising for famine relief in Ethiopia, but also viewed with a more critical lens. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the 1985 broadcast reached nearly two billion people and set a template for future benefit concerts. However, retrospective analysis highlights significant flaws, particularly the lack of African performers in a concert for Africa and a general dearth of female artists. Critics argue it reinforced a "white savior" narrative and a patronizing image of the continent, though its organizers maintain it successfully raised awareness and influenced political action.</p>

          <p>Health campaigners and a UK Member of Parliament are calling for cosmetic and skincare products to list ingredients in English rather than the current standard of Latin-based scientific names. They argue that the existing system, known as the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), puts people with severe allergies at risk because the terms are not widely understood. The article shares stories of individuals who have suffered allergic reactions, including a child who developed a rash from a body wash. While the industry association defends the Latin-based system for providing global consistency, critics insist that clear, English labeling is necessary for consumer safety.</p>
