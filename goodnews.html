          <p>A proposed deal to secure TikTok's future in the United States involves creating a new U.S.-based joint venture with investors like Oracle and Silverlake. This new entity will control the app's U.S. operations and will receive a copy of TikTok's valuable content recommendation algorithm. The algorithm will then be retrained using only U.S. user data under the security oversight of Oracle. This structure aims to resolve national security concerns that the popular app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could be compelled to share American user data with Beijing.</p>

          <p>Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has granted a pardon to Alaa Abdel Fattah, a high-profile British-Egyptian activist and blogger who has been imprisoned for six years. Abdel Fattah, one of Egypt's most well-known political prisoners, was a key figure in the 2011 uprising and was later convicted of "spreading false news." His pardon follows sustained international pressure and campaigns from human rights organizations, as well as a recent hunger strike by his mother to secure his release. Human rights groups hope this signals a broader shift in the country's approach to political dissent.</p>

          <p>Moldova is holding a general election that is widely seen as a crucial decision on the country's geopolitical direction. The contest is primarily between President Maia Sandu's pro-European party, which seeks to join the European Union by 2030, and several pro-Russian parties advocating for closer ties with Moscow. The campaign is set against the backdrop of the war in neighboring Ukraine and economic pressures like inflation. Voters are facing a stark choice that will likely determine the small nation's foreign policy and internal development for years to come.</p>

          <p>In response to reports that the Trump administration may announce a link between prenatal Tylenol use and autism, many scientists and medical experts are emphasizing that the evidence does not support such a claim. Researchers state that autism spectrum disorder is a complex condition with polygenetic risks and potential environmental influences, making a single cause highly unlikely. Experts also note that the rise in autism diagnoses over recent decades is better explained by increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria rather than a specific medication.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official has clarified that the proposed deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. will not involve the federal government taking an equity stake or a "golden share." This detail means the government will not have special veto rights over the business decisions of the new U.S.-based joint venture that will control the app. The structure is designed to address national security concerns by placing the platform's American operations under a majority-U.S. board, with tech giant Oracle overseeing security protocols and data storage.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran, in a recent speech, advocated for significant cuts to the central bank's benchmark interest rate, arguing that current monetary policy is too restrictive. He contended that policy changes related to immigration, taxes, and deregulation under the Trump administration are lowering the "neutral" rate of interest, which should allow for lower rates without fueling inflation. Miran's call for aggressive easing places him at odds with the more cautious consensus among his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate has led to a drop in mortgage rates, providing relief for borrowers. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest point in nearly three years. For a homeowner with a $1 million loan, this rate translates to a monthly payment of about $6,079 for principal and interest. This represents a savings of approximately $600 per month compared to the higher rates seen at the beginning of the year, underscoring the significant impact of the Fed's policy shift on housing affordability.
