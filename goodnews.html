          <p>The UK has secured its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet to operate in the North Atlantic. The agreement is seen as a major success for the British defense industry, chosen over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>At 39 years and 239 days old, Brighton's James Milner has become the second-oldest goalscorer in Premier League history after converting a penalty against Manchester City. This achievement adds to his record as the league's second-youngest scorer, a feat he accomplished for Leeds in 2002. Milner's longevity and versatility are widely praised, with colleagues and pundits calling him a "legend of the game" for his fitness and experience. The goal, which helped secure Brighton's first league win of the season, marked his first in six years and highlighted his continued importance to his team.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting 10 unaccompanied children to Guatemala. The order, which lasts for 14 days, came after immigration advocacy groups argued the removals would violate U.S. laws designed to protect vulnerable minors. The administration had recently finalized an agreement with Guatemala to facilitate such deportations. The legal challenge contends that returning these children, aged 10 to 17, could expose them to abuse, persecution, or torture, against their best interests and established legal protections.</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting in Copenhagen, EU foreign ministers brainstormed new measures to support Ukraine, signaling a long-term commitment amid Russia's ongoing aggression. Key ideas discussed included imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production of Ukrainian arms on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious issue of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction. Additionally, there was broad support for a plan to shift the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops into Ukraine itself, contingent on a future ceasefire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over the past 13 years, a team led by The Bay Foundation has removed nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins from an 80-acre area where they had decimated the kelp forest. This manual effort allowed the "sequoias of the sea" to rapidly regrow, restoring critical habitat for over 800 marine species and bolstering coastal resilience. The project serves as a powerful model for ecosystem restoration, demonstrating how targeted intervention can reverse environmental damage.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Arch Manning took responsibility for his performance after No. 1 ranked Texas suffered a 14-7 season-opening loss to Ohio State. Manning, in his debut as the full-time starter, completed 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception, calling his play "not good enough." Head coach Steve Sarkisian defended his young quarterback, stating that external expectations were "out of control" and urged patience.

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that building long-term cooperation is more effective than demanding immediate obedience. The key is creating emotional safety, where children feel respected, heard, and connected. The article outlines six "magic phrases," such as "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together," which help calm a child's nervous system and shift the dynamic from conflict to collaboration. Using this approach validates a child's feelings and makes them more receptive to listening, fostering genuine accountability rather than fear-based compliance.</p>

Although the dog was not expected to go into labor for another week, she delivered a massive litter of 14 puppies over 15 hours while the owner was on holiday. The pet sitter, Rhian Boxall, described the event as a "rollercoaster of emotions," which included having to save one newborn pup that was born outside in the garden. Despite the unexpected drama, 12 of the puppies survived and are healthy, providing a happy, albeit chaotic, conclusion to the family's vacation.</p>

          <p>This personal essay argues that hunting, often viewed with disdain by those on the political left, can be a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat than relying on factory-farmed products. The author, a self-described liberal, recounts her journey into hunting and the profound connection she feels to the animals and ecosystems involved. She contends that responsible hunting is a vital conservation tool, funded by taxes on firearms and licenses, which helps manage wildlife populations and preserve habitats. The article challenges preconceived notions by aligning the values of conservation-minded hunters with those who care deeply about ethical food systems and animal welfare.</p>
