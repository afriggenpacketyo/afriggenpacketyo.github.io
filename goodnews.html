          <p>The article discusses the increasing acceptance and safety of self-managed medication abortion, a method where individuals obtain and use abortion pills without direct doctor supervision. Studies and medical organizations, including the World Health Organization and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have recognized its safety and effectiveness. The COVID-19 pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade have accelerated the shift towards telehealth and self-managed options. Despite political challenges and restrictions, the trend towards demedicalized abortion is growing, potentially increasing access to abortion services amidst legal constraints.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the murder of her husband, Bob, was overturned after she spent nearly two decades in prison, with new evidence and re-examination of the case playing a pivotal role. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, new testing revealed inconsistencies and issues with the original evidence, including DNA findings and blood spatter analysis. The San Diego County District Attorney's Office eventually recommended her conviction be overturned, citing the changed DNA evidence. While Dorotik's case was dismissed, unanswered questions remain, and she now advocates for systemic change within the justice system.</p>
