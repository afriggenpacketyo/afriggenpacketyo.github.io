          <h2>Trump to Host Crypto Fundraisers Amidst Regulatory Shifts</h2>

          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-focused dinners this month, one aimed at high-dollar political donors and another targeting meme coin millionaires, with the goal of raising millions. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser, highlights Trump's increasing engagement with the crypto community, while the second offers access to Trump's inner circle based on holdings of the $TRUMP token. This approach has drawn criticism from watchdog groups concerned about potential corruption and foreign influence, given the pseudonymous nature of crypto wallets and the possibility of wealthy donors buying access to the president. The events reflect a broader policy shift favorable to the crypto industry under Trump-aligned appointees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence, while accepting the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, committed to being a vocal critic of President Trump if the president strays from the conservative agenda. Pence praised Trump for his victory and certain policies but expressed concern over steps away from traditional conservative values. He emphasized the importance of sticking to principles like a strong defense, American leadership, limited government, and traditional moral values. Pence also opposed raising taxes on the wealthy and affirmed his commitment to upholding the Constitution, addressing concerns about Trump's potential pursuit of a third term.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares have seen an extraordinary increase of 5,502,284% since Warren Buffett took over in 1965, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, which rose 39,054% during the same period. This translates to a compounded annual return of 19.9% for Berkshire, nearly double the 10.4% recorded by the S&P 500. Buffett's long-term investment strategy and business acumen have been pivotal in transforming Berkshire from a failing textile company into a diversified conglomerate worth nearly $1.2 trillion. This impressive performance underscores Buffett's legacy as one of the most successful investors of all time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is convening this week to assess monetary policy and interest rates, potentially impacting borrowing costs for Americans. While a rate cut is unlikely for May, signals from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference could influence mortgage rates. Hints of a June rate cut might prompt lenders to preemptively lower rates, especially given cooling inflation and steady unemployment. Prospective buyers and homeowners considering refinancing should closely monitor rate fluctuations for potential opportunities, although rates are unlikely to return to the historic lows of 2020 and 2021.</p>

The Federal Open Market Committee's upcoming meeting is expected to influence CD rates, with analysts closely monitoring economic indicators such as inflation and employment levels.
