          <p>Warby Parker's stock experienced a significant increase after announcing a partnership with Google to develop smart glasses. Google is investing up to $150 million in the collaboration, with $75 million allocated for product development and an additional $75 million contingent on Warby Parker meeting specific milestones. The smart glasses will utilize Google's Android XR operating system and incorporate the Gemini AI assistant. This partnership positions Warby Parker as a competitor to Meta's collaboration with EssilorLuxottica, marking Google's return to the eyewear market after its earlier Google Glass venture. </p>

          <p>Google is integrating artificial intelligence into its search engine with a new feature called A.I. Mode, aiming to disrupt its traditional search business before competitors can. This feature will function as a chatbot, providing comprehensive answers and allowing users to ask follow-up questions. Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, emphasized that this represents a total reimagining of search, although the company has been hesitant to fully embrace AI due to concerns about accuracy and monetization. The move comes amid increasing antitrust pressures and concerns from web publishers about potential traffic disruption. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has outlined stricter regulatory guidance for future COVID-19 vaccine boosters, requiring new clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for healthy adults and children. This contrasts with the previous approach of approving updated shots based on antibody response. The FDA will accept immunogenicity data for high-risk individuals, such as those 65 and older or with underlying health conditions. The agency aims to balance regulatory flexibility with rigorous scientific standards, potentially reducing the frequency of annual booster updates. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily restored the right to vote for Maine state lawmaker Laurel Libby, who was censured for a Facebook post criticizing the state's policy on transgender athletes. Libby's post identified a transgender athlete, leading to her censure and suspension of voting rights by the Maine House. The Supreme Court's decision was met with dissent from Justices Sotomayor and Jackson, who criticized the court's increasing intervention in such matters. The case raises questions about legislative immunity and the balance between free speech and protecting vulnerable individuals. </p>

          <p>Seniors should consider their long-term care insurance needs by evaluating changes in retirement savings and plans. Market volatility and altered retirement plans may necessitate long-term care insurance to cover costs like assisted living or in-home care.

Delaying insurance may not be cost-effective, so it's important to research plans, prices, and companies to determine the best option for individual circumstances.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of neurology experts is proposing a new method of evaluating patients with traumatic brain injuries to improve assessments and treatment. The new system, published in Lancet Neurology, builds upon the Glasgow Coma Scale but incorporates additional factors such as blood biomarkers, scans, and the patient's social environment. The aim is to move beyond simplistic categories like "mild, moderate, severe" and provide more accurate prognoses and research data. The hope is that this will lead to better drug treatments and procedures for patients with traumatic brain injuries. </p>

Mulaney's opening monologues and the show's overall taste and ambition remain highlights, and the show has also cultivated unique comedic elements, such as videos by writers Jeremy Levick and Rajat Suresh. As the late-night landscape shifts, Mulaney is making a case for risk-taking comedy. </p>
