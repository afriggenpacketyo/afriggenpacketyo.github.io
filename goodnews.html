          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, are preparing for a crucial match against France as a key step toward the World Cup final. Wing Abby Dow described the team's journey using the metaphor of climbing Mount Everest, emphasizing the need for precise timing and focus. The team is drawing lessons from their narrow Six Nations victory over France, where they nearly let a significant lead slip. Head coach John Mitchell is prioritizing a strong performance over simply extending their winning streak, viewing the tough match as essential preparation for future challenges.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated matchup between two of baseball's most decorated pitchers, Clayton Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer's Toronto Blue Jays. Both veteran aces delivered strong performances, with Kershaw allowing just one run over six innings. The key moment came when Mookie Betts hit a go-ahead two-run homer off Scherzer in the fifth inning. The game was celebrated as a showcase of two future Hall of Famers who continue to compete at a high level for first-place teams.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude oil is unlikely to disrupt progress on a long-delayed EU-India free trade agreement, according to experts. The sanctions, part of the EU's effort to cut off funding for Russia's war in Ukraine, are seen as largely symbolic with minimal economic impact. Analysts suggest that the greater pressure on India comes from potential U.S. tariffs, which may paradoxically increase India's motivation to finalize a trade deal with the EU as a way to diversify its economic partnerships.</p>

          <p>The UK government has reformed its civil service summer internship program, restricting applications to candidates from lower socio-economic backgrounds to improve representation. The move has generated a mixed reaction among students aspiring to public service careers. Some students from working-class families who were previously hesitant now feel encouraged to apply, seeing it as a genuine opportunity. However, others who consider themselves working class but do not meet the strict parental occupation criteria feel unfairly excluded and deflated by the changes.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created a high-purity hexagonal diamond in a laboratory, a breakthrough that confirms the macroscopic existence of this rare material. This type of diamond, first discovered in a meteorite in 1967, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds. It was believed to form under the extreme pressure and heat of a meteorite impact. The research, published in the journal Nature, details the synthesis of hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometres in size, a significant achievement after years of global efforts.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a standout performance in his NFL preseason debut, drawing praise from figures like LeBron James. Sanders, a fifth-round draft pick, threw for 138 yards and two touchdowns, leading three scoring drives against the Carolina Panthers. Despite starting as fourth on the depth chart, his poise and effectiveness may alter his standing in the team's open quarterback competition. Sanders remained focused on his performance, stating that he doesn't worry about factors outside of his control.</p>

The crew, consisting of two American astronauts, one Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, undocked in a SpaceX Dragon capsule for an 18-hour trip culminating in a splashdown off the California coast. During their 146-day mission, the astronauts conducted over 200 scientific experiments, including research on plant growth and cellular behavior in microgravity. Their departure concludes NASA's 10th successful commercial crew rotation mission.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a genetically higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease as a "gear shift" in his life's motivations. The discovery, made during a genetic test for a TV show, revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of the disease by eight to ten times. Hemsworth explained that the news prompted a deeper self-reflection on his purpose and what he contributes, rather than just what he collects. This change in mindset influenced the second season of his show, where he took a more active and educated role in exploring personal health challenges.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is flourishing as people seek mood boosts during periods of economic uncertainty. This behavior includes both small, affordable pick-me-ups like makeup, a phenomenon known as the "lipstick effect," and saving up for larger, life-affirming experiences like concert tickets. Analysts note that this trend has been amplified by a post-pandemic re-evaluation of well-being and the perception that traditional life milestones are less attainable. Consumers are cutting back on daily essentials to afford these moments of guilt-free joy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the settlement between Disney and actress Gina Carano, who was fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts. The author argues that while Carano's posts were ill-conceived, Disney's decision to fire her was an overreaction driven by fear of a hashtag campaign. The settlement, which was financed by Elon Musk and includes a statement from Lucasfilm hoping for future collaboration, is framed not as corporate capitulation, but as the "right thing to do." It is presented as a correction to an extreme initial response in a fraught cultural and political environment.</p>
