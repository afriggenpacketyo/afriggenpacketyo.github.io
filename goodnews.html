          <h2>'Emotionally Safe Parenting' Highlighted as Effective Parenting Style</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert suggests a new approach called "emotionally safe parenting," emphasizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This style focuses on creating a safe environment where children feel comfortable expressing emotions without judgment. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, avoid shaming, view misbehavior as stress signals, and take responsibility after conflicts. The framework involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame.</p>

          <p>Daniella Pierson, who built a $40 million business from her newsletter The Newsette, is launching CHASM to help women secure venture capital funding. Pierson faced rejection from VCs when pitching her newsletter and aims to address the gender gap in VC funding. She wants to support women who, like her, might be deemed "uninvestable" due to various barriers. In 2023, all-women teams received only 1.8% of VC funding, highlighting the need for initiatives like CHASM.</p>

          <p>Tennis player Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open and shared the story of how his truck was repossessed due to missed payments. Paul explained that he changed banks and forgot to update the automatic payments for his Ford F-150. After missing three payments, the truck was repossessed, leading Paul to humorously recount the experience and his newfound interest in "repo" shows. He later confirmed that he successfully regained possession of the truck.</p>

          <p>The story of Julie Moore, an Army wife who revolutionized military casualty notifications, is remembered. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams delivered during the Vietnam War, Moore successfully lobbied for in-person notifications and support for grieving families. Her efforts led to the current military protocol of sending uniformed service members to personally inform families of a soldier's death and offer assistance. In 2023, Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore in her honor, marking the first time an American military base had been named for a civilian.</p>
