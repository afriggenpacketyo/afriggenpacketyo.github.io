          <p>Chinese government scientists have announced the results of a weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where cloud seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4% across 8,000 sq km in a single day. The project, led by Li Bin, generated over 70,000 cubic meters of additional precipitation using just 1kg of silver iodide. This test, detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, demonstrates China's growing capabilities in weather modification technology and its potential to alleviate drought conditions in arid regions.

          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the original November vote was annulled due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The initial election saw a pro-Russian candidate surprisingly win the first round, prompting investigations into campaign financing and social media manipulation. While that candidate is now banned, his ally is expected to advance to a second-round run-off. The election is being closely watched as it reflects a broader struggle between pro-Western and populist forces in the country, with implications for Romania's relationship with the EU, NATO, and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, effectively banning the sale of EU citizenship. The court found that Malta's policy made nationality a "mere commercial transaction" and undermined solidarity between EU member states. While purchased passports are now ruled out, "golden visas" offering residence permits for real estate investments remain. This article discusses the implications of the ECJ ruling and the ongoing debate over residence-by-investment schemes. Optimism score reflects the effort to eliminate corruption.</p>

          <p>A South Texas community, largely composed of SpaceX employees, voted to establish a new city called Starbase. The vote, approved by a lopsided margin, fulfills Elon Musk's long-held dream. Starbase will serve as the facility and launch site for SpaceX's rocket program. While SpaceX has drawn support for its jobs and investment, the creation of a company town has raised concerns about Musk's control over the area and potential restrictions on public access. Optimism score reflects the mixed reactions to the new city.</p>

          <h2>SNL Opens With Trump's Executive Orders</h2>

          <p>Saturday Night Live opened with a skit featuring Donald Trump signing executive orders, including one to make it socially acceptable for older men to date younger women, which they called the "Belichick law". The skit touched on other topics, such as reducing the number of interracial couples in commercials and shortening the word "recession" to "recess." The cold open returned to familiar territory, given Trump's dominance in the news during his first months in office. The score is a commentary on the humorous nature of the events.</p>
