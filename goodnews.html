          <p>The 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks even if the federal government shuts down, as the program is funded through mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget requires congressional approval, meaning a shutdown could disrupt key customer services. According to the agency and experts, services like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacing Medicare cards could be temporarily halted until a funding agreement is reached by lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Following their 15-13 victory over the United States in the Ryder Cup, Europe's players celebrated by playfully trolling former U.S. President Donald Trump. The team was heard singing "Are you watching Donald Trump?" on their bus, reportedly after Rory McIlroy received a text message from the avid golf fan. Trump, who had made an appearance at the Bethpage Black course, responded good-naturedly on social media, congratulating the team. The celebration echoed their previous win in Rome, with Shane Lowry leading chants in a video that circulated online.</p>

          <h2>Financial Expert Dave Ramsey Advises Against Concentrated Stock Holdings, Citing Risk</h2>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey offered blunt advice to a caller who had earned $1.1 million by investing in just a few stocks, calling her strategy "unsustainable" and risky. He warned that concentrating a large fortune in a small number of companies ties one's financial fate directly to their performance, creating vulnerability to significant losses. Ramsey strongly recommended that the investor sell the stock, pay the capital gains taxes, and reinvest the proceeds into a diversified portfolio of mutual funds to spread risk and ensure long-term stability.

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that migrants will need to demonstrate their contribution to society to gain indefinite leave to remain under new Labour government proposals.

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane on Tuesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm was bringing heavy rain and tropical storm conditions to the northwestern Bahamas on Monday. However, its projected path shows it moving away from the southeastern U.S. coast and turning toward Bermuda later in the week. Swells generated by the storm are still expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. For a $300,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,824. This represents a significant saving compared to earlier this year when rates were above 7%, and a saving of over $330 per month compared to the peak rates of October 2024, potentially saving homeowners tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.

          <p>A new partnership between Hertz and Amazon Autos will allow the rental car company to sell its used fleet directly to consumers through the e-commerce platform, a move that could threaten a key revenue source for traditional car dealerships. While Amazon will not hold inventory, it will provide the online infrastructure for sales, expanding Hertz's direct-to-consumer channel. Industry analysts note that rental companies can purchase vehicles in bulk at a discount, potentially allowing them to undercut dealership prices and creating significant competitive pressure.</p>

          <p>President Trump is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, where he is expected to strongly urge acceptance of a U.S.-led plan to end the war in Gaza. The proposal reportedly includes ending the conflict, boosting humanitarian aid, and requiring Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages within 48 hours. The high-stakes meeting comes as Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with the prolonged conflict and as international pressure on Israel mounts, evidenced by more nations recognizing Palestinian statehood at the UN.</p>
