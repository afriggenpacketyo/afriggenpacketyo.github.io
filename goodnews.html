        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs outfielder Ian Happ made a significant baserunning mistake that resulted in an inning-ending double play. After hitting a single in the first inning, Happ ran from first base on a fly ball hit by a teammate. When the ball was caught, Happ, who had already reached second base, failed to retouch the base on his way back to first. The Cardinals successfully appealed the play, and Happ was called out, nullifying what could have been a scoring opportunity, though the Cubs ultimately won the game 3-0.</p>

          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The research assessed a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed, surveying nearly 12,500 employees. While acknowledging the need for further research, the institute noted that certain foods in the diet, such as those containing folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, may support mental well-being by aiding neurotransmitter release and reducing inflammation. The findings suggest a potential link between traditional dietary patterns and mental health outcomes.</p>

Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state facility. The escape, which involved the inmates exploiting a faulty cell door, went unnoticed for hours and was described by the Louisiana governor as the worst in recent state history.

          <p>The British retailer M&S has launched a limited-edition strawberries and cream sandwich, drawing inspiration from the 'furutsu sando,' a popular Japanese fruit sandwich that recently went viral on social media. The sandwich, made with strawberries, whipped cream cheese, and sweetened bread, became the chain's top-selling sandwich shortly after its release. While unusual to some, fruit sandwiches are a common snack in Japan, typically featuring soft white bread and whipped cream with various fruits. The launch highlights a growing trend of cross-cultural culinary exchange, bringing a beloved Japanese convenience store staple to UK high streets.</p>

Sadler says the new season will be 'more depressing, but maybe more funny,' and is influenced by their own upbringing in an all-woman household.

          <p>A BBC science correspondent has highlighted the potential of phage therapy, a century-old medical concept that uses viruses to treat bacterial infections. By collecting samples from dirty water, including his own toilet, he successfully isolated a bacteriophage capable of killing a patient's persistent urinary tract infection in a lab setting. This process demonstrates the accessibility of these bacteria-eating viruses and their potential as an alternative to antibiotics, especially in an era of growing antimicrobial resistance. While the science is being revisited, regulatory and clinical pathways are still being developed to make phage therapy a mainstream treatment.</p>

These pioneering images are revealing previously hidden features like wetlands and concealed deforestation, allowing for more accurate monitoring. Over the coming years, the data will be used to create a global 3D map of forests, enabling precise measurement of the carbon they store and their role in mitigating climate change.</p>

While musically tight, the set largely avoided the band's usual political commentary, with Healy stating they want their legacy to be about 'love and friendship' rather than politics.

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million from the current $330 million. The move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, is designed to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries that offer more generous financial incentives. Industry unions and professionals have warned that California has been losing thousands of jobs and is at risk of decline. The expanded tax credit aims to make shooting in California more financially viable, keeping productions and industry jobs within the state. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Market Analyst Affirms Confidence in Apple Despite Current Challenges</h2>

          <p>Despite Apple's stock currently lagging, one market analyst argues for sticking with the company, citing its strong fundamentals and historical resilience. Current headwinds for the tech giant include steep tariffs on Chinese-made goods, a lack of groundbreaking AI announcements, and ongoing App Store litigation. However, the analyst points to Apple's projected 14% earnings growth, which outpaces the S&P 500 average, and CEO Tim Cook's strong leadership. Past downturns for Apple have historically proven to be excellent buying opportunities, suggesting that the stock could become too cheap to ignore if it continues to fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria used his Paris Fashion Week show to make a powerful statement about the treatment of immigrants in the United States. The show opened with models dressed in all-white, their hands tied, kneeling in a formation reminiscent of images from a high-security prison in El Salvador used to detain some migrants. Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the runway performance was intended to address the 'dehumanization' of immigrants. The show received largely positive reactions online, with many praising it as a bold and revolutionary use of fashion to highlight social injustice.</p>
