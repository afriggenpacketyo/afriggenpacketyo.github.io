          <p>Tech giants including Apple, Google, and Meta are advancing generative AI to create real-time language translation devices, moving science fiction concepts closer to reality. Apple is integrating a "Live Translation" feature into its new AirPods, which can translate several languages instantly, positioning it as a key AI-driven upgrade. This development places Apple in direct competition with Google's Voice Translate, which preserves a speaker's vocal inflections, and Meta's smart glasses translation capabilities. The rise of this technology signals a new competitive frontier in AI and could significantly impact industries that rely on human interpreters, whose roles are increasingly threatened by these advancements.</p>

          <p>Forty-eight years after his death, South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority is reopening the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko. Biko died at age 30 in police custody in 1977 from a brain hemorrhage, which his family and supporters assert was the result of torture, contrary to the police's claim of a hunger strike. Despite previous inquiries clearing officers, new pressure and a presidential order to investigate apartheid-era crimes have prompted this landmark decision. Biko's son, Nkosinathi Biko, has emphasized the need to correct the historical record and achieve justice, viewing the prosecution as essential for national healing and upholding human dignity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With inflation putting pressure on fixed incomes, many retirees are looking for ways to tap into their substantial home equity without taking on new monthly debt. Options like reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62 and older to borrow against their home's value, with the loan repaid only when the home is sold or the owner moves out. Another method is a home equity sharing agreement, where a company provides upfront cash in exchange for a share of the home's future appreciation, avoiding interest or monthly payments. While these solutions offer financial flexibility, they come with significant trade-offs, such as reduced inheritance and forfeiture of future gains, requiring careful consideration.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical rivals Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are set to launch daily oral obesity drugs in the U.S. next year, shifting the market focus from weekly injections. While pills offer greater convenience, questions remain about their adoption, as they currently offer less weight loss than leading injectables like Lilly's Zepbound. Eli Lilly's Chief Scientific Officer, Dan Skovronsky, expressed confidence in their pill, orforglipron, citing its easier manufacturing process and lack of food restrictions compared to Novo's offering. A forthcoming head-to-head trial will provide clearer data, but analysts predict oral medications could capture a significant share of the burgeoning multi-billion dollar weight-loss drug market.</p>

          <p>Following a significant run-up in Broadcom's stock price, the CNBC Investing Club has indicated its intention to trim its position to manage risk and lock in gains. The custom AI chipmaker's shares have surged, causing its weighting in the club's portfolio to exceed a 5% threshold, which typically triggers a rebalancing. Analysts remain bullish on the stock, with Mizuho recently raising its price target to $410, citing strong growth in AI-related revenue from current clients and expansion to new ones like OpenAI. The club's strategy reflects a disciplined approach to portfolio management by taking profits after a stock experiences substantial appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tether, the company behind the world's largest stablecoin (USDT), is expanding its U.S. presence by launching a new, regulated stablecoin called USAT and appointing Bo Hines as CEO of Tether U.S. Hines previously headed the Presidential Council of Advisors for Digital Assets under the Trump administration. Unlike the globally focused USDT, USAT is designed specifically for U.S. institutions and will operate under the GENIUS Act framework, with Anchorage Digital as its issuer and Cantor Fitzgerald as its reserve custodian. This move signals Tether's strategy to engage more closely with U.S. regulators and strengthen the U.S. dollar's dominance in the digital economy.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is launching a new pilot program to accelerate the safe rollout of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, often called air taxis. Key industry players Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are participating in the initiative, which will establish public-private partnerships to facilitate supervised trials as early as next year. This program, spurred by a recent presidential executive order, aims to solidify U.S. leadership in advanced aviation technology. Both companies praised the announcement as a critical step toward making commercial air taxi services a reality, enabling them to work with partners like United Airlines to test their innovative aircraft.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lee Lai's new graphic novel, "Cannon," explores the visceral experience of anxiety and panic attacks through its protagonist, a line cook named Lucy. The story visualizes her internal turmoil as a menacing flock of magpies that only she can see, which grows as she navigates the stresses of her job, friendships, and caregiving for her grandfather. Unlike traditional narratives that focus on internal monologue, the book uses body language and the symbolic birds to convey her state of mind. The novel culminates in a cathartic explosion of rage, offering a unique and unexpectedly gleeful perspective on confronting and releasing bottled-up fear, even if the underlying stressors remain.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is capitalizing on a drop in Boeing's stock price to increase its position in the aerospace company. Shares fell after CEO Kelly Ortberg announced that the certification for the 777X aircraft is falling behind schedule. The investment club views this as a short-term dip and a buying opportunity, arguing that such delays are not uncommon and do not alter the company's long-term cash flow trajectory. The club maintains that Boeing's turnaround is on track, supported by an improved balance sheet and better leadership, making the current lower share price an attractive entry point to build up their new holding.

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has overwhelmingly passed a resolution backing the "New York Declaration," which calls for irreversible steps toward a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine that explicitly excludes Hamas. The declaration demands Hamas release all hostages, end its rule in Gaza, and surrender its weapons to the Palestinian Authority. The resolution, which passed 142-10, was championed by France and Saudi Arabia and comes ahead of a summit where French President Emmanuel Macron plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The move aims to increase pressure on Israel to end the conflict and revive a path toward a lasting peace settlement.</p>

          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is having a noticeable impact on the apparel industry, particularly in the resale market. Consignment store owners report a significant increase in donations of larger-sized clothing, as people using the medications downsize their wardrobes. This "Ozempic effect" has inverted traditional inventory patterns, making previously scarce larger sizes abundant while demand for smaller sizes grows. While major retailers have not officially announced changes, some clothing line founders note a trend toward offering extended sizes as "online-only" options. The shift reflects a broader societal change in body size that could reshape clothing production and retail strategies.</p>
