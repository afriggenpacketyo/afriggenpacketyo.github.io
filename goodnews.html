        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British athlete Jonathan Edwards expressed mixed feelings as his triple jump world record of 18.29 meters reached its 30th anniversary. He suggested the record's longevity might not be a positive sign for the health of track and field, questioning if the sport has kept pace with professionalization and can attract top talent compared to more lucrative sports. Set at the 1995 World Championships, the record has remained untouched, with the closest attempt being 18.21 meters a decade ago. Edwards also speculated that modern shoe technology, while beneficial for runners, may not provide the same advantage in jumping events due to the extreme forces involved.</p>

          <p>Following discussions between a U.S. special envoy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Trump administration has indicated there is a "good prospect" of a meeting between the two leaders soon. The talks reportedly yielded "great progress" towards establishing conditions for a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine, though officials remain cautious about the outcome. This development marks a potential step forward in President Trump's long-stated goal of ending the conflict. However, the substance of the progress remains unclear, as does whether Russia is genuinely prepared to engage in meaningful negotiations to end the war.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 01:04:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Environment Agency will introduce enhanced checks on waste tyre exports starting in October, following a BBC investigation. The report revealed that millions of used tyres from the UK were being sent to makeshift furnaces in India for a hazardous extraction process called pyrolysis, rather than being properly recycled. This illegal practice poses serious health and environmental risks, and the agency acknowledged it is "highly likely" a portion of UK exports were diverted this way. While campaigners welcomed the new measures, some criticized the plan for not going far enough, such as banning the export of whole tyres altogether.</p>

          <p>This weekend, Jen Pawol is set to become the first woman to umpire a regular-season Major League Baseball game, officiating the series between the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves. The 48-year-old has been working in minor league baseball since 2016 and has participated in MLB spring training games for the past two years. Her debut marks a significant milestone, following in the footsteps of other female officials who broke barriers in major men's professional sports. These pioneers include Shannon Eastin and Sarah Thomas in the NFL, and Violet Palmer and Dee Kantner in the NBA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed surprising strength in July, with trade data significantly beating market expectations. Exports grew by 7.2% year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms, while imports saw their largest increase in a year, rising by 4.1%. This performance provides a strong support for the Chinese economy, although some economists caution that the export surge may be partly due to businesses front-loading shipments ahead of a potential escalation in trade tensions with the U.S. The robust data suggests China is on track to meet its annual growth target, even as its factory activity showed signs of slowing.

          <p>Veteran NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring, less than five months after returning from the first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. That mission experienced serious technical issues, including thruster outages and gas leaks, which extended his and fellow astronaut Suni Williams' stay on the International Space Station from one week to over nine months. NASA ultimately deemed a return on the Starliner too risky, and the astronauts came home aboard a SpaceX capsule instead. Wilmore, who served 25 years in the astronaut corps, maintained he was prepared for the extended mission and its associated risks.</p>

Born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, he became an elder statesman of the genre, winning multiple Grammy awards, including the first-ever Grammy for a Latin recording in 1975.

          <p>In a joint announcement with President Trump, Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in the United States over the next four years, bringing its total domestic investment to $600 billion. The investment is expected to create 20,000 new jobs and includes plans for a smart glass manufacturing line in Kentucky and a server facility in Houston. The move is seen as a step toward the administration's goal of having more products, including iPhones, made in America. This announcement comes amid the administration's broader push to reshore manufacturing, including the recent threat of tariffs on foreign-made computer chips. (not investment advice)</p>
