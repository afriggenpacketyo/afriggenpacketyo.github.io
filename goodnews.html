          <p>Walmart has cautioned that even with the reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, the company may still need to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon noted that tariffs are creating cost pressures, particularly in categories like electronics and toys, though the retailer aims to minimize passing these costs onto consumers. Despite a slight drop in grocery prices last month, many household costs remain elevated, and Walmart has pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty. CFO John David Rainey indicated that a return to dramatically higher tariff levels could significantly impact the company's financials and jeopardize earnings growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reports that new federal requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall. These requirements, announced by the Department of Health and Human Services, could classify substantial updates to existing vaccines as 'new products,' necessitating additional clinical evaluation. The Food and Drug Administration has already requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine. Some experts fear that these new limits could undermine the use of all vaccines, including those in the childhood immunization schedule, by raising doubts about their safety.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates and the United States have entered an agreement allowing the UAE to construct the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the United States, potentially granting expanded access to advanced AI chips. The agreement reflects the Trump administration's confidence in secure management of the technology, partly by mandating US companies to manage data centers. The agreement includes the UAE committing to invest in, build, or finance US data centers that are at least as large and as powerful as those in the UAE, and contains historic commitments by the UAE to further align their national security regulations with the United States, including strong protections to prevent the diversion of US-origin technology. The AI campus will be built by Abu Dhabi state-backed firm G42, but American companies will operate the data centers and offer American-managed cloud services throughout the region.</p>

          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., to commemorate the Army's 250th anniversary on June 14, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is projected to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade is expected to feature over 100 vehicles and thousands of soldiers, as well as potentially involving 50 helicopters. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly stated the cost will be shared by the Department of the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. While Mr. Trump has confirmed the plans and deemed the cost "peanuts," some Democrats have criticized the event as wasteful, with Rep. Steve Cohen calling it a self-aggrandizing display.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in Baltimore discovered over 200 pounds of marijuana concealed inside 155 vacuum-sealed packages disguised as men's overalls, valued at $875,000. The shipment, intended for Belgium, highlights a trend of transnational criminal organizations attempting to export U.S.-based marijuana to Europe and Africa for significant profits. CBP's acting area port director, Jason Kropiewnicki, noted that smugglers are seeking revenue by illegally exporting bulk shipments to markets across the globe due to oversaturated marijuana markets in the U.S. The incident is under investigation by Homeland Security Investigation's Border Enforcement Security Task Force.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior Treasury Department officials by surprise, creating confusion about the specifics and timeline of the rollback. The Syrian transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief, citing its inability to pay civil service salaries and rebuild infrastructure. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that relief may come in the form of waivers that give permission to do business in Syria without facing penalties for evading sanctions. The move comes as Turkey and Saudi Arabia have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. The contraction was more significant than economists' expectations, with exports falling by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, impacting the GDP. The Bank of Japan had warned of a likely moderation in the country's economy due to global trade policies. Despite these concerns, the central bank seems poised to continue raising its policy rate, considering the country's inflation rate has surpassed its 2% target for three consecutive years.</p>

          <p>Small businesses are struggling with the fluctuating tariffs on Chinese goods, causing financial instability and forcing them to adapt quickly.

The situation creates a dilemma for businesses, as they must decide whether to pay more to ship at the current rate or wait in hopes that tariffs will be lowered further. The financial instability means that many businesses cannot count on making a profit this year, and will just try to stay afloat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carl F. Alameda, former assistant city manager of La Ca√±ada Flintridge, faces embezzlement and insurance fraud charges for allegedly stealing nearly $200,000 in insurance claim proceeds paid to the city. Prosecutors allege that Alameda falsified invoices and had payments sent to his personal bank account between 2016 and 2022. The city has since modified its internal controls, and Alameda has been placed on leave from his current position as assistant city manager in Ojai. If convicted of all charges, he faces a maximum sentence of 33 years in state prison.</p>

          <h2>MPs Call for Delay to Farm Inheritance Tax Proposals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A committee of MPs has called for a year-long delay to farm inheritance tax changes, urging proper consideration of alternative schemes that will not harm small family businesses. The government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than ¬£1m at a rate of 20% from April 2026, prompting protests across the UK. The Efra Committee said the changes were made without "adequate consultation, impact assessment or affordability assessment" and threaten to affect the most vulnerable. The committee also warned that the government's sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme "affected trust in the government" and left many farmers "at risk of becoming unviable".</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a $25-million lawsuit by former Sheriff Alex Villanueva against Los Angeles County, alleging defamation and violation of rights due to a "do not rehire" label. The lawsuit claimed that Villanueva lost potential employment opportunities because of the designation, which stemmed from a county panel's determination that he harassed two officials. The judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove Villanueva had been harmed or that the designation had caused him to lose out on a desired position. Villanueva's attorney, however, stated that the consequential complaints of defamation and emotional distress will move forward, and that they‚Äôll have the opportunity to hold the County of Los Angeles accountable in state court.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy opened with a three-over 74 at the US PGA Championship, struggling with his driver and hitting just four of 14 fairways. Ryan Gerard surged to the top of the leaderboard at seven under par. Luke Donald produced a 67 that rolled back the years. Beyond celebration of the completion of a career grand slam it may well be that McIlroy has a psychological adjustment to make in this fresh chapter of his extraordinary career.</p>
