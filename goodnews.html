          <p>During the Dallas Cowboys' preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, star receiver CeeDee Lamb was involved in a peculiar incident despite not playing. While standing on the sideline in street clothes, Lamb was accidentally knocked over by a sprinting official who did not see him. The collision resulted in a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the Cowboys for making contact with an official. Lamb was unharmed and laughed off the incident with teammates on the sideline.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Dallas Cowboys 31-21 in their preseason opener, showcasing the potential of their rookie running backs. Blake Corum, a former Michigan star, demonstrated his readiness for a larger role by rushing for 32 yards and two touchdowns. Other rookies, including Jarquez Hunter and Cody Schrader, also delivered strong performances, suggesting the Rams have depth to support lead back Kyren Williams.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The luxury fashion industry is reportedly shifting away from the subtle "quiet luxury" trend and embracing more visible, statement-making designs, a style dubbed "loud luxury." This change is driven by new creative directors at major brands like Gucci and Burberry and an effort to reignite consumer interest amid slowing sales. Analysts suggest that after several years of minimalist aesthetics, the market is ready for novelty, which could mean a return to prominent logos and distinctive patterns. This strategic pivot aims to broaden appeal and revive brand desirability in a challenging economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last newspaper hawker in Paris, is set to receive the Order of Merit, one of France's highest honors, for his cultural contributions. For over 50 years, he has sold newspapers on the streets of the city's Left Bank, becoming a beloved local figure. Akbar reflects on how the industry has changed, with digital media replacing a once-thriving street-sale culture where dozens of hawkers worked. Despite the decline in sales, the 72-year-old continues his rounds for the joy and independence the job provides.</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds," starring Ice Cube, has been widely panned by critics, earning a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes upon its debut before inching slightly higher. The film's poor reception has sparked discussion about the appeal of "bad movies," with some viewers expressing a desire to watch it precisely because of the terrible reviews. Film enthusiasts argue that earnestly made but flawed films can be more entertaining and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. The article places the new movie in the context of other cult classics celebrated for being "so bad they're good."</p>

          <p>Apple experienced its most successful week in over five years, with its stock rising by 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization.
