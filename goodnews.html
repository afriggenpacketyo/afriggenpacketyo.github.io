        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Allen Frances, who played a key role in shaping the diagnostic criteria for autism, recently discussed his part in the significant increase in diagnosis rates over the past few decades. In a conversation with NPR, he reflected on a New York Times piece he authored titled, "Autism Rates have Increased 60-Fold. I Played a Role in That." Dr. Frances explained how changes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) broadened the definition of autism, leading to more individuals being diagnosed. His commentary provides critical context on the evolution of psychiatric diagnostics and its societal impact.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old from Norfolk, Mary Catchpole, has become the first patient in Europe to receive leniolisib, a newly licensed drug that could potentially cure her rare and life-threatening inherited immune disorder. The condition, Activated PI3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS), was identified in 2013 partly through research involving her family, who have lost multiple members to the disease. The drug works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function correctly. This breakthrough represents a remarkable journey from disease discovery to an approved NHS treatment in just 12 years, offering new hope to the small number of affected patients.</p>

          <p>Manchester City secured a commanding 5-2 win against Juventus in the Club World Cup, finishing at the top of their group with a perfect record. Manager Pep Guardiola praised the performance as a sign that the team is regaining its form after a disappointing previous season where they failed to win a major trophy. The decisive victory, characterized by aggressive play and overwhelming possession, serves as a strong statement to other contenders in the tournament. The return of midfielder Rodri from a long-term injury was a significant boost, as his presence was crucial to controlling the game's tempo.</p>

In an interview, he explained that while 90% of products sold in the U.S. are made domestically, the company relies heavily on globally sourced ingredients like black pepper, which cannot be grown in the U.S. Foley expressed confidence in the company's ability to manage the tariff effects for the remainder of the year, noting strong consumer demand for flavor. The company's stock rose over 5% following an earnings report that surpassed estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after being impaled through the arm by a beach umbrella pole. The lifeguard, identified only as Alex, was attempting to secure the umbrella to her stand when a gust of wind pulled it, and her, off the stand, causing her to land on the pole. Remarkably, the pole missed all major arteries, nerves, and tendons, and she remained calm throughout the ordeal as first responders used a bandsaw to cut the pole for transport. She expressed gratitude to her rescuers and plans to return to her job after a six-week recovery.</p>

          <p>Nike announced that new tariffs could cost it approximately $1 billion in the current fiscal year, a significant challenge as it navigates a difficult turnaround. The company's fourth-quarter profits fell by 86% due to efforts to clear old inventory and reset its business strategy, though it still beat Wall Street's lowered expectations. CEO Elliott Hill stated the worst financial impacts are now behind them and expects business results to improve. As part of its mitigation strategy, Nike plans to reduce its manufacturing presence in China and has announced a renewed partnership to sell select products on Amazon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images providing strong evidence of a previously unknown exoplanet. The planet, named TWA 7b, is estimated to be the mass of Saturn and orbits a young, nearby star. Scientists utilized a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph to suppress the star's bright glare, revealing the faint object nearby. While a small possibility remains that it could be a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a planet, potentially shaping the debris disk of its host star.</p>

Speaking from City Hall, Adams framed the election as a choice between his practical progress and the "empty promises" of his chief rival, Democratic primary winner Zohran Mamdani. Adams, who is now running as an independent, criticized Mamdani's socialist platform and privileged background. The announcement sets the stage for a competitive general election, with Adams focusing on his accomplishments while navigating criticism from his tumultuous first term.</p>

          <p>A large meteor streaked across the sky over metro Atlanta, creating a bright "fireball" and a loud boom that was seen and felt by hundreds of residents. NASA confirmed the event was caused by a three-foot-diameter asteroidal fragment weighing over a ton, which entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. The fragment disintegrated about 27 miles above the ground, releasing energy equivalent to 20 tons of TNT. Emergency officials are investigating a report from a Henry County homeowner who claimed a piece of the meteorite crashed through his roof.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans have agreed to remove a controversial "revenge tax" provision from President Trump's major legislative package at the request of the Treasury Department. The provision, Section 899, would have allowed the U.S. to tax companies with foreign owners from countries deemed to have unfair tax policies, a measure critics warned would deter foreign investment and cost U.S. jobs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent requested its removal after reaching a joint understanding with G7 countries on a global tax deal. This change complicates Republican efforts to offset the cost of the bill as they race to meet a July Fourth deadline.</p>
