          <h2>Breakthrough Gene Therapy Injection Shows Promise in Reversing Congenital Hearing Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:49:43 EDT</div>

          <p>A new gene therapy, administered through a single injection, has successfully reversed hearing loss in a clinical trial involving both children and adults with a specific genetic form of deafness. The study, published in Nature Medicine, detailed how delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear led to significant hearing improvement in all 10 participants. The effects were evident within a month, with one seven-year-old girl regaining nearly all of her hearing. Researchers report the treatment is safe and are optimistic about applying similar methods to treat other genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine, reversing a recent pause in some shipments. The president stated the weapons are necessary for Ukraine to defend itself against intense Russian attacks, highlighting the high death toll in the conflict. This decision follows a temporary halt on some arms transfers, which the White House attributed to a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. The announcement came after President Trump held calls with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, expressing disappointment with the lack of progress in his conversation with Putin.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Gains Popularity Among Chinese Students as a Study Destination Over the U.S.</h2>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing Singapore over the United States for their overseas education, citing cultural familiarity and safety concerns. For students like Miya Zheng, who initially planned to pursue a master's degree in the U.S., Singapore offers a more comfortable long-term environment with its climate and cuisine. While the U.S. has traditionally been the top choice, industry insiders note that increasing instability and cultural adjustment difficulties in America are driving this shift. Singapore, already a popular destination, may see a significant increase in applications from Chinese students seeking a high-quality international education.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screening at several U.S. airports. The change, which is being phased in, has already been observed at airports in cities like Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia. Previously, only travelers enrolled in the TSA PreCheck program could keep their shoes on. The no-shoes rule was implemented nationwide in 2006, years after Richard Reid, the "shoe bomber," attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his footwear on a flight to Miami in 2001.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Moves to Restrict "Renovictions" to Protect Tenants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:29:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has taken steps to permanently limit the ability of landlords to evict tenants for the purpose of extensive property renovations, a practice known as a "renoviction." The approved amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance will prevent such evictions unless a government agency has issued an order to vacate the property to address code violations. This move makes a temporary protection permanent and aims to stop landlords from using renovations as a pretext to remove tenants and subsequently charge higher rents. The city is also developing rules for tenant relocation and penalties for landlords who violate the ordinance.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a provision in a new bill that would block its clinics from receiving Medicaid funding for one year. The organization argues the rule unconstitutionally targets them for providing legal abortion services, which are not funded by federal dollars. A federal judge in Massachusetts swiftly granted a temporary restraining order, ensuring Medicaid funds continue to flow to Planned Parenthood for now. The lawsuit contends that losing this funding would be devastating for the more than one million Medicaid patients the organization serves annually across the country.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost its economy and tourism sector, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This change is a dramatic increase from previous regulations and has already led to a rise in foreign visitors, with over 20 million entering visa-free in 2024. The policy, which began with several European nations and has since expanded to include countries in Asia and Latin America, is making travel to China much less cumbersome. Travel companies are reporting a surge in bookings and are preparing for a larger influx of international tourists.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has announced it will sever ties with the e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleged that the university and the firm misrepresented a cybersecurity "boot camp," misleading students into believing it had close ties to Caltech faculty when the connection was minimal. As part of a settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to new transparency measures and to provide tuition refunds totaling over $2.4 million to hundreds of students. The decision is a notable development in the growing scrutiny of partnerships between universities and third-party online course providers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The VA is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, which has eliminated the need for the planned cuts. The initial proposal, which could have cut over 80,000 jobs to return to 2019 staffing levels, had drawn criticism. While the department framed the reversal as a result of successful improvements, critics argue it reflects an unsustainable loss of employees due to a "toxic work environment."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was named to the National League All-Star team as a "Legend Pick," an honor that he said came as a complete surprise. The 11-time All-Star acknowledged that he didn't "deserve" the selection based on his limited number of starts this season after returning from surgery. However, he expressed gratitude for the recognition of his career accomplishments and said he would enjoy the experience. The "Legend Pick" has previously been used to honor other veteran players like Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera toward the end of their celebrated careers.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a $2.2 billion plan to purchase 36 additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, a decision influenced by the demonstrated vulnerability of such aircraft in the war in Ukraine. A member of South Korea's National Assembly stated that the funds would be better invested in more modern capabilities like drones and smart systems that reflect the future of warfare. The decision highlights a growing global reassessment of the attack helicopter's role on a battlefield saturated with advanced air defenses and cheap loitering munitions. The existing fleet of 36 Apaches will be augmented by domestically produced attack helicopters.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against the thousands of people who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, even though the event had been officially banned. The decision comes after organizers, including Budapest's liberal mayor, Gergely Karacsony, declared the march an official municipal event, creating public belief in its legality. Hungary's right-wing government, led by Viktor Orban, has enacted several anti-LGBTQ+ laws and described the march as "repulsive." Despite the ban and the threat of fines, this year's parade drew a record crowd of over 200,000 people.</p>
