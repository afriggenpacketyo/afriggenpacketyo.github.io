          <p>One of Big Bear's bald eaglets, Sunny, successfully took its first flight from the nest, marking a significant milestone for the famed eagle parents, Jackie and Shadow. The eaglet practiced for days, flapping and jumping on the nest's outer rails before finally taking off. While Sunny has left the nest, its sibling, Gizmo, remains behind, developing at a slower pace. Both eaglets, determined to be female, will stay in the habitat for one to three months before venturing off on their own in the fall, reaching maturity around five years old.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision marks a policy shift, providing relief to older borrowers who are in default and rely on Social Security as a fixed income. The administration's spokesperson emphasized the commitment to protecting Social Security recipients. This pause allows borrowers an opportunity to become current on their loans and avoid reduced benefits, addressing concerns about retirees potentially lacking funds for basic necessities.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has issued pardons to Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., two south Florida divers who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's longline. The divers believed the line was illegal and reported it to state officials after freeing the marine animals. Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, arguing the line belonged to a licensed fisherman. The pardons erase the felony convictions, allowing the men to vote, own firearms, and travel freely outside the US.</p>

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. The ruling applies to migrants in custody in the Central District of California. The judge found that the government has not provided sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation under the 1798 law. This decision adds to the legal complexities surrounding the administration's use of the Act to deport alleged gang members.</p>

          <p>Analysts are comparing Pop Mart, the company behind the collectible character Labubu, to Sanrio and its Hello Kitty property, suggesting it could be a new model for cultural exports. Labubu's popularity, evidenced by high-profile fans and record-breaking sales, has driven Pop Mart's stock to new heights. Unlike previous attempts by Chinese companies to "go global" by exporting heritage, Labubu focuses on universal appeal through design and marketing. JPMorgan Chase initiated coverage of Pop Mart with an overweight rating, noting similarities to Hello Kitty in merchandising, licensing, and search interest.</p>

The study emphasizes that any song is beneficial for a baby, regardless of whether it is a classic lullaby.</p>
