          <p>With artists like Kendrick Lamar and Beyonc√© embarking on stadium tours, questions arise about the concert experience for attendees. Social media amplifies the pressure to attend, with fans spending significant amounts on tickets and outfits. While stadium concerts offer a communal experience, they also present challenges like poor acoustics and obstructed views. Some attendees have reported negative experiences, including chaotic VIP sections and obstructed views, while others emphasize the unique energy of large gatherings. The economics favor artists, who can maximize revenue, but the fan experience can be compromised.</p>

          <p>Ramaco Resources, a small coal miner in Kentucky, could help the U.S. reduce its reliance on China for rare earth elements.

This discovery could help the U.S. wean itself off imports from China, which currently supplies 70% of the country's rare earths. The Brook Mine could be the first new rare earth facility in the U.S. in over seven decades, potentially producing an estimated 1,400 metric tons annually.</p>

          <p>The New World Screwworm (NWS) fly, eradicated from the U.S. since 1966, is a potential danger following an outbreak in Mexico, leading to a shutdown of cattle, horse, and bison imports along the southern border. The NWS fly lays eggs in wounds or orifices of warm-blooded animals, with larvae burrowing into the flesh, causing deadly damage. In rare cases, the larvae can feed on people, potentially causing parasitic infections.

          <p>Following Donald Trump's 2024 victory, a debate has reignited among economists and policymakers regarding the role of 'neoliberal' economic policies. Some argue that Biden's 'post-neoliberalism' approach, with increased government intervention, failed to win back the working class. Critics contend that Biden's economic policies caused inflation and failed to deliver tangible benefits. Defenders argue that external factors, such as the pandemic, were more influential.

          <p>Inflation retreated again in April on the back of lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline, but economists warn that tariffs levied by President Donald Trump may re-ignite inflation. The consumer price index rose 2.3% in April from 12 months earlier, down from 2.4% in March. The average tariff rate of 10% is expected to add as much as 1 percentage point to the consumer price index. Economists remain uncertain about the long-term impact of tariffs on inflation.</p>
