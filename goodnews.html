          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its policy interest rate steady at 2.5%, prioritizing financial stability amid concerns over Seoul's rapidly rising housing prices and household debt. This move comes after a rate cut in May and despite a first-quarter economic contraction, signaling the bank's focus on mitigating risks from the housing market. The decision is influenced by South Korea's unique "jeonse" rental system, where large deposits funded by loans contribute to high household debt levels. Authorities are now assessing the impact of recent measures intended to cool the overheated property market. (not investment advice)</p>

The phone, discovered at her former base, contained photos and videos from her final days, including moments with a friend who also died in the attack. Her parents, Oneida Oliver-Sanders and Shawn Sanders, described the phone's return as a profound gift that allows them to see the world as their daughter did.

          <p>Philadelphia's blue-collar city workers have reached a tentative three-year contract agreement with the city, ending an eight-day strike that disrupted services like trash collection. The union, which represents 9,000 workers including sanitation staff and 911 dispatchers, settled for a 3% annual raise and a one-time bonus, significantly less than their initial demands. Mayor Cherelle Parker stood firm on the city's budget constraints throughout the negotiations. Workers have returned to their jobs, and sanitation services are expected to be back to normal by the weekend.</p>

          <p>The new Pixar film “Elio,” about a boy who feels like an alien on Earth, has arrived in a charged political climate marked by harsh immigration enforcement. This article suggests the movie's themes of alienation and searching for a home resonate deeply with the experiences of Latino children and immigrant communities facing fear and uncertainty. The film's production was also marked by controversy over the alleged removal of a queer storyline. Despite its box office struggles, the film is seen as a relevant story about a Latino hero who ultimately redefines home on his own terms.</p>
