          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking second-quarter profit, surging nearly 61% year-over-year due to the relentless demand for artificial intelligence chips. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer beat revenue and net income estimates, with high-performance computing, which includes AI and 5G, accounting for 60% of its sales. As a key supplier for companies like Nvidia and Apple, TSMC's success highlights the sustained boom in the AI sector. The company projects continued strong growth but acknowledges potential headwinds from U.S. tariff policies and global macroeconomic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has appointed state Senator Blaise Ingoglia to the position of Chief Financial Officer for the state. Describing Ingoglia as "the most conservative senator in the state," DeSantis made the appointment to fill the vacancy left by Jimmy Patronis, who was elected to U.S. Congress. Upon his appointment, Ingoglia pledged to prioritize property tax relief and to act as a fiscal watchdog for taxpayers. He vowed to combat waste and fraud, hold insurance companies accountable, and ensure Florida does not adopt policies similar to those in New York or California.</p>

          <h2>Deployed to Los Angeles for Unrest, National Guard and Marine Troops Reportedly Face Boredom</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Marines and National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles by the Trump administration to handle potential unrest are now reportedly experiencing widespread tedium as their mission has dwindled. Initially mobilized against the will of California's governor and L.A.'s mayor to counter protests, the troops have seen little action, with most stationed at local bases or guarding federal buildings. This has led to calls from state leaders for a complete withdrawal, arguing the continued presence serves no purpose and uses troops as "political pawns." The situation highlights the controversy and questionable necessity of the military deployment in a domestic setting.</p>

          <p>Despite longstanding complaints from U.S. political leaders about unfair trade practices, an analysis suggests the primary reason American cars sell poorly in Asian markets is a poor product fit. Consumers in countries like Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam tend to prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles suitable for congested cities and tight budgets, a stark contrast to the larger, more expensive SUVs that dominate the U.S. market. While tariffs and regulations have been a focal point of trade disputes, experts argue that American automakers have failed to adapt their offerings to local tastes and infrastructure, unlike European and domestic competitors.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that California must take the lead in supporting the electric vehicle industry following the Trump administration's decision to end most federal support. The author contends that this is a critical moment in the global automotive race, as China currently dominates EV manufacturing. To remain competitive, the article proposes three key actions for California: replacing the expiring federal tax credit with a state-level one, funding the installation of chargers in apartment buildings to solve a key adoption barrier, and streamlining the permitting process for public fast-charging stations to attract private investment.</p>

          <p>Bridget McCarthy, whose transgender son Riley Chart died by suicide, is championing a California bill to save other queer youth. The proposed law, AB 727, would require public school and college student ID cards to include the contact information for The Trevor Project's LGBTQ+ crisis line. This initiative comes as the federal government has cut funding for LGBTQ-specific counselors on the national 9-8-8 lifeline, prompting state and local officials to find alternative ways to provide support. Proponents argue that having a specialized, easily accessible resource is critical for a demographic that faces a disproportionately high risk of suicide.</p>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars saw its shares rise after reporting a second-quarter operating profit that exceeded analyst expectations, despite a significant year-on-year decline. The company, which is owned by China's Geely, is grappling with the impact of U.S. tariffs on European and Chinese vehicles. In response, Volvo is strategically shifting its U.S. operations, adding its popular XC60 SUV to its South Carolina production line while pulling some sedan and wagon models. This move aims to better utilize its U.S. factory and mitigate the financial impact of the challenging trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang has stated that the application of artificial intelligence to scientific discovery will ultimately have a more profound impact than its use for human-centric tasks. Speaking at an expo in Beijing, Huang explained that while AI can easily learn human language, understanding the language of nature, such as biology, is a greater challenge with a larger payoff. He emphasized that AI can help decipher the complexities of proteins, cells, and life itself, which will revolutionize fields like drug discovery. This advancement could lead to designing novel medicines and helping people live longer, healthier lives.</p>

          <p>A growing number of residents in Virginia, which has the world's highest concentration of data centers, are organizing to oppose the construction of new facilities. Activists cite concerns over the massive consumption of power and water, constant noise from cooling systems, and the industrial scale of the buildings in or near residential areas. The demand for data centers has surged with the rise of AI, but this has galvanized a "not in my backyard" movement across the state. In one recent case, hundreds of residents in Chesapeake successfully lobbied their city council to unanimously block a proposed data center project near their homes.</p>

          <p>Maryland has become the first state to utilize a provision of the Affordable Care Act to help fund abortion care for patients traveling from states with restrictions. A new law allows the state to tap into a multimillion-dollar fund, built from fees paid by insurers on the ACA marketplace, to support abortion funds. These nonprofits have been strained by a surge in demand since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, as they assist patients with costs for procedures, travel, and lodging. This innovative funding mechanism could serve as a model for other states where abortion remains legal.</p>
