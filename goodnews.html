        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mike Novogratz described the arduous four-year journey and $25 million spent to list Galaxy Digital on the Nasdaq, calling the process "unfair, infuriating." Novogratz noted the excessive regulatory scrutiny and high auditing costs faced by crypto companies, which he expects to decrease by 40% after the listing. Despite the difficulties, Novogratz stated that the experience hardened Galaxy Digital, which primarily funded itself through investment gains and trading. The article highlights the return of investor appetite for crypto-adjacent firms, exemplified by eToro's recent Nasdaq listing. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reports a 13% increase in Social Security claims this fiscal year, driven by retirees' anxieties about the Trump administration's changes to the Social Security Administration and broader economic uncertainty. This trend is concerning, as claiming early generally results in lower lifetime payments. Agency officials acknowledged that fear-mongering has influenced retirees' decisions, with higher earners also claiming earlier than in the past. The article advises viewing Social Security as longevity insurance and considering the benefits of delaying claims for a higher payout later in life. </p>

The unemployment rate for art history majors was 3%, while computer science and engineering had rates of 6.1% and 7.5%, respectively. BlackRock's COO stated the firm is adjusting its hiring strategy to include more humanities majors due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which requires creative thinking and soft skills.
