          <p>A weeklong manhunt for Austin Robert Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect in a quadruple homicide and infant kidnapping in Tennessee, has concluded with his arrest. Drummond was captured in Jackson, Tennessee, following multiple tips from community members who spotted him near a vacant building. He is the prime suspect in the July 29 killings of four individuals, and the related infant was found safely on the same day. Authorities credited the successful capture to strong cooperation between law enforcement and the public, stating it brought a measure of peace to the community. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following comments from President Donald Trump, prediction markets have identified Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh as the front-runners to become the next Federal Reserve chair. In a CNBC interview, Trump praised both individuals, referring to them as the "two Kevins," which caused their odds on the Kalshi prediction market to rise to 35% each. The speculation comes as Trump expresses dissatisfaction with current Chair Jerome Powell's handling of interest rates. The recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler provides Trump an opportunity to appoint a new board member who could later be elevated to the chair position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 16:15:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of the interest earned from a $10,000 deposit in either a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. While a CD offers a guaranteed fixed rate, a high-yield savings account provides flexibility with a variable rate that could change with market conditions. Based on current top rates, a high-yield savings account would narrowly earn more over three months, though the difference is negligible and the CD's return is guaranteed. The analysis suggests savers should consider their financial goals and the potential for future interest rate cuts when choosing between the two options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a commanding performance in The Hundred cricket tournament, the Oval Invincibles defeated the London Spirit by six wickets at Lord's. The Spirit were bowled out for just 80 runs, the second-lowest score for a men's team in the competition's history. Afghanistan's Rashid Khan was the star for the Invincibles, taking three wickets for only 11 runs in his debut for the team. England's Sam Curran also contributed significantly with three wickets, including a historically slow 47.1mph delivery. The Invincibles easily chased the low target, reaching the required score with 31 balls to spare. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines critical questions for homeowners thinking about borrowing a $100,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in the current economic climate. With high home equity levels, a HELOC can be an attractive, lower-interest financing option, but it carries risks like potential foreclosure. Homeowners are advised to consider the imminence and impact of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on their variable-rate payments. The piece also suggests evaluating whether a fixed-rate home equity loan might be a more stable alternative, given the uncertainty surrounding future interest rate movements and the immediate need for a lump-sum payment.

Eaton, a key supplier for AI data centers, posted an 8% rise in adjusted earnings per share and a 10% increase in revenue, narrowly beating analyst estimates. However, the market reacted negatively because the results and forward guidance were not as robust as the sky-high expectations Wall Street had set.

This efficiency will not only make advisory firms leaner but also democratize access to high-quality, personalized financial advice for middle-income families and younger generations.
