          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an unprecedented decline in global fertility rates, with many people unable to have their desired number of children.

          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have significantly decreased, particularly among Gen Z, with a 47% reduction in risk, according to data from the CDC. While over 31,000 people under 35 died from drug overdoses in 2021, that number fell to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider Narcan distribution, less potent fentanyl, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use, including cannabis and psychedelics, among young people. Despite this progress, challenges remain, especially for individuals struggling with severe addiction.</p>

          <p>A report by a group of cross-party MPs has criticized the UK's statutory paternity leave system as one of the worst in the developed world, highlighting its fundamental flaws and outdated gender stereotypes. The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks. It also found that shared parental leave is considered unnecessarily complex and burdensome by many families. The report has been released on the eve of the world's first dad strike, with hundreds of fathers expected to protest for an overhaul of parental leave policies.</p>
