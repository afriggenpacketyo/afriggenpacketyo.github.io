          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to begin using real cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup in its products sold in the United States. While Coca-Cola did not explicitly confirm the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and stated that details on new offerings would be shared soon. The potential switch has been praised by health advocates like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. but has drawn criticism from the Corn Refiners Association, which warned of potential job losses and negative impacts on farm income.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has introduced a new "everything app" called the Base App, aiming to integrate crypto into daily life beyond just trading. The application combines a digital wallet, payments, and social media functions, all running on Coinbase's own Base blockchain network. This move is designed to attract a broader consumer base, including content creators, by offering a new economic model with direct monetization options. The app will be powered by a new identity system, Base Account, and a streamlined USDC stablecoin payment feature called Base Pay, signaling a strategic push toward mainstream crypto utility.</p>

          <h2>Fox News Media Signs Licensing Deal with Conservative Podcast 'Ruthless' to Expand Digital Reach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 18:45:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a move to attract online audiences, Fox News Media has secured a licensing deal with the popular conservative podcast "Ruthless." The deal reflects a broader trend of legacy media outlets partnering with digital-native creators to engage consumers who are shifting away from traditional television. The podcast, which targets a key demographic of men aged 18 to 45, will operate under Fox News Digital, and its hosts will also appear as contributors on the Fox News Channel. This strategy follows similar moves by other media giants, like ESPN's partnership with Pat McAfee, to tap into established online communities.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have made their first joint public comments to dismiss the divorce rumors that have circulated over the past year. Appearing together on a podcast, the couple humorously addressed the speculation, which began after the former president attended several high-profile events alone. Michelle Obama reiterated that she has never considered leaving her husband and that she feels free to make her own choices now that their daughters are grown. The Obamas, who married in 1992, affirmed the strength of their relationship, laughing off the unfounded gossip.</p>

          <p>Continuing the advocacy work of his late mother, Prince Harry walked through a minefield in Angola to raise awareness about the ongoing threat of landmines. The event was organized with the HALO Trust, the same charity Princess Diana worked with during her historic visit in 1997. Harry visited a de-mining site near Cuito Cuanavale, highlighting that remnants of the country's 27-year civil war still endanger lives, particularly children. This walk echoes his mother's efforts, which were instrumental in mobilizing global support for the 1997 land mine ban treaty.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Vanguard provides insights into average 401(k) balances and highlights a key strategy for enhancing retirement savings.

          <p>Germany is set to strengthen its laws to combat gangs smuggling migrants to the UK, with changes expected by the end of the year, according to Downing Street. The new legislation will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to a non-EU country like the UK, closing a current legal loophole. This commitment is part of a broader new UK-Germany agreement covering migration, business, and defense. The move aims to disrupt the supply chain for small boats used in dangerous Channel crossings, a significant portion of which has been traced back to Germany.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed the very beginning of planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using NASA's Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory, scientists detected the formation of silicon monoxide, a mineral that only forms at extremely high temperatures near a young star. This discovery provides a direct look at a process similar to the dawn of our own solar system. Researchers believe this finding will help them identify other budding planetary systems and better understand how planets are constructed.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that beat estimates and issued a restored full-year forecast for 2025, signaling growing confidence in the travel market. CEO Scott Kirby stated that the world is "less uncertain" than it was at the start of the year, anticipating a strong finish. While second-quarter revenue was slightly below expectations, the airline projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the year. This optimistic outlook comes after a rocky start to 2025, when weaker domestic demand from price-sensitive customers had softened airfares across the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark British study has confirmed that creating babies with DNA from three people can successfully prevent devastating inherited disorders. Researchers used the technique, known as mitochondrial donation, to help families have eight healthy children who are now free from the rare and often fatal mitochondrial diseases that plagued their families. The procedure involves transferring the nuclear DNA from a mother's egg into a healthy donor egg, which contains healthy mitochondria. While hailed as a major breakthrough, the technique remains controversial, with critics raising ethical concerns about genetic manipulation and potential long-term risks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that China is making significant progress in its efforts to control the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United States. In remarks at the White House, Trump stated that Beijing has been helpful and is taking "big steps" to address the crisis. This positive assessment marks a sharp departure from his previous rhetoric, where he has often used the fentanyl issue to justify imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. The comments come as high-level trade negotiations continue between the two countries to resolve their ongoing tariff disputes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the GENIUS Act, a bill that would establish the first federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to provide clear rules and consumer protections for the $250 billion market, potentially allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. Proponents argue this will enable faster, cheaper payments, while critics note risks such as the potential for stablecoins to lose their peg to the underlying asset, as seen during the 2023 bank failures.
