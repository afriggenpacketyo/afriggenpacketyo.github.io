          <p>Israel has obtained approximately 2,500 documents and personal effects from Syria belonging to Eli Cohen, a renowned Israeli spy executed in 1965. The collection includes handwritten letters, photographs, and information about his undercover work and final moments. The Mossad, in collaboration with an allied foreign government, retrieved the archives, though details about the assisting country and recovery timeline remain undisclosed. Cohen's intelligence gathering in Syria during the early 1960s is credited with significantly aiding Israel's victory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, and this announcement has been received in Israel as a moment of unity.</p>

          <p>McLaren's F1 car has demonstrated superior performance over Red Bull's in various race conditions this season, securing four pole positions compared to Red Bull's three. McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris have collectively won five races, while Max Verstappen of Red Bull has won two. McLaren excels when rear-tyre degradation is a factor and in slower corners, while Red Bull is strong in high-speed corners, as evidenced by their performance at Suzuka, Jeddah, and Imola. Red Bull has introduced upgrades in recent races, closing the gap, but McLaren's overall package appears stronger in a wider range of circumstances.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea. This initiative aims to accelerate decarbonization efforts, leveraging the ability of marine vegetation like mangroves and kelp to absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with organizations like the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar's visit to China is expected to focus on deepening defense and security cooperation between the two nations. This move, perceived by New Delhi as a show of support for Islamabad, follows recent military tensions with India. Analysts suggest that the success of Pakistan's Chinese-made fighter jets and missiles during the skirmishes has heightened both nations' enthusiasm for closer military collaboration. Bilateral talks between Dar and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi are anticipated to address these crucial issues.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, an acclaimed Russian ballet choreographer and artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, has died at the age of 98. Known for revitalizing male dance and staging productions like "Ivan the Terrible" and "Romeo and Juliet," Grigorovich left a lasting impact on Soviet ballet. His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 amid contract disputes led to the theatre's first-ever dancers' strike. Grigorovich's work was steeped in the traditions of classical ballet, and he is considered one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century.</p>
