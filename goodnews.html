          <p>President Donald Trump enthusiastically endorsed the government's recent acquisition of a 10% stake in chipmaking giant Intel, valued at approximately $8.9 billion, and vowed to pursue similar deals regularly to benefit the nation. He contended that these strategic investments, partly funded by the CHIPS Act, would generate substantial wealth and jobs across the United States, dismissing critics as "stupid people." White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett confirmed this move is part of an ongoing plan to build a U.S. sovereign wealth fund, potentially expanding federal involvement into other private sectors. This approach aims to bolster domestic production and enhance economic resilience.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is officially launching its new fall menu on Tuesday, August 26, prominently featuring the highly anticipated return of its iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL). Since its introduction in 2003, the PSL has become the company's most popular seasonal beverage, selling hundreds of millions of units. This year's menu also introduces new items like Pecan Cold Foam, aiming to build on the success of similar cold foam offerings. The coffee chain is strategically relying on these autumnal treats to boost sales and improve in-store traffic, especially after reporting a 2% decline in U.S. sales for the third quarter. CEO Brian Niccol expressed confidence that the PSL will attract many customers.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper has announced an $18 billion acquisition of JDE Peet's, a Dutch coffee and tea company, aiming to revitalize its struggling U.S. coffee business. Despite the strategic intent, Keurig Dr Pepper's stock declined by approximately 8% following the news. The deal, valued at 15.7 billion euros, is projected to yield $400 million in cost synergies within three years. Crucially, Keurig Dr Pepper intends to split its beverage and coffee operations into two separate, publicly traded companies after the acquisition. This restructuring would effectively reverse the 2018 merger of Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple, creating two distinct entities each with billions in annual sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An unpiloted SpaceX Cargo Dragon spacecraft successfully docked with the International Space Station early Monday, delivering over 5,000 pounds of essential equipment and supplies. The cargo included 1,500 tortillas, a crumb-free bread substitute crucial for astronauts dining in weightlessness. Additionally, the Dragon carried an add-on thruster kit in its trunk section, designed to help boost the space station's altitude and counteract atmospheric drag. This kit will supplement existing re-boost operations, primarily handled by Russian Progress cargo ships, ensuring the orbiting lab maintains its optimal altitude starting in September.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump was observed with a new bruise on his left hand, following an earlier persistent bruise on his right hand this year. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt attributed the marks to Trump's frequent hand-shaking with numerous Americans, similar to her previous explanation. However, a prior White House statement had offered a more medical reason for the right-hand bruise, citing soft-tissue irritation from hand-shaking combined with aspirin use. The latest bruise appeared in a video of Trump playing golf, prompting further public discussion.</p>

          <p>A U.S. trade advocacy group, the US-China Business Council, stated that recent exit bans on two American businesspeople in China do not elevate the overall travel risk for U.S.-based executives. The council concluded that neither case appeared "geopolitical or retaliatory," suggesting they align with existing enforcement patterns. While acknowledging that these high-profile incidents have prompted companies to review their travel protocols, the report asserts that the risk of exit bans, detentions, or other complications for most travelers remains consistent. This assessment aims to provide clarity amid concerns about doing business in China.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement rangers have removed an extensive illegal marijuana cultivation site spanning approximately 13 acres within California's Sequoia National Park. The operation eradicated 2,377 full-grown marijuana plants and approximately 2,000 pounds of trash and infrastructure. The site, initially detected in 2024, also contained a semi-automatic pistol and highly toxic chemicals, including Methamidophos, banned since 2009. Significant environmental damage was noted, including water diversion, vegetation clearing, and digging of terraces.

          <p>Danielle Friedman's book, "Let’s Get Physical," explores America's transformation into a nation of exercise obsessives, tracing the evolution from post-WWII discouragement to today's fitness golden age. In the 1950s, strenuous exercise, especially for women, was widely deemed dangerous. Influencers like Bonnie Prudden and President JFK's "The Soft American" piece helped shift perceptions. The 1970s marked a turning point with the women's movement, Title IX, and the rise of exercise science, popularizing activities like running, aerobic dancing (Jazzercise), and yoga. Celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jane Fonda further normalized and aspirationalized fitness, shaping a uniquely American commercialized exercise culture.</p>

          <p>The Northern Lights consortium, led by Equinor, Shell, and TotalEnergies, has initiated operations at the world's first commercial carbon storage facility in the North Sea. The project involves capturing liquified CO2 from European industrial smokestacks, transporting it by ship, and injecting it 1.6 miles deep into the seabed for permanent storage. This Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology is endorsed by the UN and IEA as a climate tool, particularly for hard-to-decarbonize industries. However, CCS remains complex, controversial, and costly, with critics like Stanford professor Mark Jacobson questioning its efficacy and motivations, advocating instead for a shift to clean energy sources.</p>
