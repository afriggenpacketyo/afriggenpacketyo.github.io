          <h2>UK to Impose Stricter Affordability Checks on 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 05:32:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New regulations in the UK will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers starting next July. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority, aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and facing unexpected late fees on what is currently an unregulated form of credit. While the new rules will provide consumers with more rights, such as access to the Financial Ombudsman, they will also likely result in some shoppers being denied credit. This is a significant step toward regulating a rapidly growing sector popular among young adults.</p>

          <h2>Estonia Sets Global Benchmark as a Fully Digitized Nation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 05:03:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Estonia has become what is considered the world's first fully digitized country, with nearly all public administration services, including initiating a divorce, available online. A recent report highlights the nation's success, where over 90% of citizens use digital services compared to much lower rates in other European countries like Germany. Key to this adoption is a user-friendly national e-ID system and the "once-only principle," where citizens provide data to the government just once. This comprehensive digital transformation, which began with the "Tiger Leap" education program after 1991, has significantly increased efficiency and reduced administrative costs for taxpayers.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows New US Tax Law Provides Savings Across All Incomes, with Greater Benefits for the Wealthy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 05:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Policy Center indicates that the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" signed by President Trump will provide an average tax cut of $2,900 per household in 2026. The legislation extends the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on tips and overtime. However, the benefits are disproportionately skewed towards higher earners, with the top 20% of households receiving about 60% of the total savings. For example, the highest-income households will save an average of $12,540, while the lowest-income households will save around $150 on average. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of younger candidates are running for office, often on a platform of generational change, but their success has been inconsistent. The recent primary loss of 25-year-old Deja Foxx in Arizona highlights the challenges, even as others like New York's Zohran Mamdani achieve upset victories. While a compelling narrative of being a "disrupter" can gain traction, younger candidates frequently struggle to build the necessary institutional support, fundraising networks, and policy differentiation to win. Observers note that victories for Gen Z and younger millennial candidates remain rare exceptions, often requiring a "perfect storm" of factors to overcome established political structures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has for the first time used generative artificial intelligence to create visual effects in one of its original shows, the Argentine sci-fi series "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated that AI was used for a scene depicting a building collapse, allowing the sequence to be completed ten times faster and at a much lower cost than with traditional methods. The move comes amid ongoing controversy in the entertainment industry over AI's potential to replace human workers and its use of existing work for training. Sarandos argued the technology enables productions with smaller budgets to achieve advanced visual effects that would otherwise be unfeasible.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to introduce a bill that would lower the voting age to 16 for all UK elections, potentially adding 1.5 million new voters to the electorate. This change, a key Labour manifesto promise, would align national election rules with those already in place in Scotland and Wales. The move presents a new challenge for political parties, who must now engage a generation that primarily consumes news through social media platforms like TikTok. Analysts suggest that authenticity will be crucial, as simply adopting youth-oriented slang will not be enough to win over this new, politically aware demographic.</p>

          <p>Shares of Swedish defense company Saab soared over 12% after it reported second-quarter profits and sales that significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The company's strong performance is part of a broader trend benefiting European defense stocks, as nations across the continent increase their security budgets. This "era of rearmament" is driven by NATO's push for members to boost defense spending and Europe's own initiatives to strengthen its industrial base. Saab's CEO noted that market activity is extremely high, and the company is ramping up production to meet the surging demand for its defense portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Shanghai government has announced a major expansion of its shipyards on Changxing Island, a move designed to solidify China's position as the world's top shipbuilder. The plan aims to create a world-class manufacturing hub for high-end marine equipment, with a goal of reaching an industrial scale of over 120 billion yuan within three years. A key focus will be on hi-tech vessels, such as LNG carriers and dual-fuel container ships, which are expected to comprise 80% of the base's output. The government also intends for the cluster to become a global center for technological breakthroughs in the maritime industry.</p>

          <p>Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft, demonstrated both his immense potential and his winner's mentality during his Las Vegas Summer League debut with the Dallas Mavericks. After a self-described poor first game, the 18-year-old phenom bounced back with a 31-point performance, displaying the versatile, two-way skillset that has drawn comparisons to NBA legends. Despite the hype, Flagg remains publicly reserved and intensely focused on improvement, a trait that has defined his rapid ascent through high school and college. His performance has reinforced why he is considered one of the most complete and promising teenage prospects in decades.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF), the group behind the deadly April Pahalgam attack in India, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described TRF as a proxy for the Pakistan-based, UN-designated terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. The designation, which follows the attack that killed 26 mostly Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, has been welcomed by India as a strong affirmation of U.S.-India counterterrorism cooperation. This move reflects Washington's commitment to pursuing justice for the victims and is seen as a sign of deepening support for India's security concerns.</p>

The growth comes as space becomes increasingly integral to national security, spurred by initiatives like Europe's "ReArm" program and new NATO spending targets. Venture capital firms have been the most active investors in 2025, with strong momentum noted for emerging areas like in-orbit habitats, on-orbit servicing, and space-based energy generation.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new infrared sensing technology that is 20,000 times faster than conventional detectors, drawing inspiration from the heat-seeking fire beetle. This insect possesses a unique pit organ that allows it to detect faint infrared radiation from distant forest fires with incredible accuracy, even while in flight. The new technology mimics this biological system's ability to perceive motion in complex environments with minimal processing. Such high-speed infrared sensing is vital for military and industrial applications where clear imaging and detection are required in obscured conditions like smoke or fog.</p>

Investor confidence has been bolstered by the perceived degradation of its adversaries' capabilities and a resilient economy that continues to attract foreign capital.
