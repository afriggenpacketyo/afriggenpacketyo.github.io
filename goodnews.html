          <h2>New Bill Aims to Ease Research Restrictions on Cannabis and Other Schedule I Substances</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances, potentially enabling policymakers to craft more effective legislation and allowing for further clinical research on medical cannabis. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the bill, which would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that restrict federal funds from being used for research on Schedule I substances. Experts suggest the bill has the potential to attract bipartisan support, prioritizing evidence over ideology and facilitating a more informed approach to cannabis policy. Despite some skepticism, proponents believe the bill is a vital step toward shaping smart cannabis policy.</p>
