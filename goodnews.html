          <h2>New Legislation Aims to Ban Toxic Chemicals from Beauty and Personal Care Products in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced the "Safer Beauty Bill Package," a set of four bills designed to enhance federal oversight of the cosmetics industry. The legislation seeks to ban hazardous ingredients like formaldehyde and phthalates, mandate full ingredient transparency on labels, and provide protections for women of color and salon workers who are disproportionately exposed to harmful chemicals. This move follows the 2022 MoCRA law, which advocates argue did not sufficiently address ingredient safety. The proposed bills aim to align U.S. standards more closely with stricter regulations in the European Union and several states.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has arrived in Spain to complete a season-long loan move to Barcelona after receiving permission from his club. The deal, which includes an option to buy, follows Rashford's declaration that he was ready for a new challenge after being dropped by United's head coach. This will be the 27-year-old's second consecutive loan spell, following a six-month stint at Aston Villa last season. Rashford is expected to undergo a medical this week and could join Barcelona's pre-season tour, potentially facing former teammate Jesse Lingard's K League side, FC Seoul.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, known as "Fito," the leader of the violent "Los Choneros" drug gang, to the United States. Macías, who escaped from an Ecuadorian prison last year, faces U.S. charges for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine. His organization is accused of smuggling weapons from the U.S. into Ecuador and controlling key trafficking routes with the help of Mexican cartels. The extradition marks a significant moment in international cooperation against organized crime, as Macías is set to appear in a Brooklyn federal court to face the charges against him.</p>

          <p>A collaborative research team from China and Singapore has developed an innovative nanovaccine that has shown success in suppressing cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal trials. The bioinspired approach targets cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for tumor growth and spread, offering potential for personalized cancer treatments. Published in *Nature Nanotechnology*, the findings detail a method that could overcome the limitations of current cancer therapies. This breakthrough represents a significant step forward in the fight against cancer, potentially leading to more effective, long-term treatments for patients.</p>

          <h2>Venture Capitalists Utilize 'Power Law' to Identify High-Potential Startup Investments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:48:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists increasingly rely on the "power law" principle to guide their investment decisions, focusing on startups with the potential for massive, outlier returns. This strategy acknowledges that a small number of highly successful investments, like Spotify or Klarna, will generate the vast majority of a fund's profits, outweighing all other losses or smaller exits combined. For founders, this means they must pitch a compelling vision of how their company can become a category-defining leader. VCs look for ambitious founders and evidence that a product is filling a significant market gap with potential for outsized growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:44:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, following a preliminary trade deal that eased some of Beijing's export controls. These magnets are critical components for technologies like electric vehicles, wind turbines, and military hardware, and China dominates over 90% of the global market. The spike in exports suggests a partial normalization of a critical supply chain that was disrupted by geopolitical tensions and retaliatory restrictions. However, the situation has prompted the U.S. to accelerate efforts to develop domestic supply chains, including recycling initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has recommended the most significant reforms since privatization over 30 years ago. Authored by Sir Jon Cunliffe, the report includes 88 proposals, such as abolishing the current regulator Ofwat and implementing stronger environmental regulations. The reforms aim to address systemic issues like underinvestment, leaking infrastructure, and sewage spills, which have led to widespread public criticism. While the changes are intended to ensure long-term resilience and prevent future crises, they will be funded by over £100 billion in investment, leading to sharply higher water bills for consumers.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the 1984 clash between striking miners and police outside a coking plant in Rotherham, as well as its aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what is now considered discredited evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had unanswered questions for 40 years. Campaigners, who have long called for the inquiry, expressed cautious elation at the news, hoping it will finally uncover the truth.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly turning to bond-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pushing the total assets under management in this category past US$50 billion. This surge, up from just $10 billion at the start of last year, is driven by a search for low-risk, fixed-income assets in an economic environment marked by persistent deflation and weak consumption. These ETFs offer diversification, lower costs, and better liquidity compared to direct bond investments. The fastest-growing segment targets corporate notes, as investors seek higher yields than those offered by government debt, which are near record lows. (not investment advice)</p>
