          <p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth assured Congress that lawmakers would be involved in a 30-day assessment of the Aukus alliance, following reports of a Pentagon review. Concerns were raised about the timeframe for analyzing the pact between Australia, Britain, and the US, particularly given China's opposition to the alliance. Hegseth's remarks came in response to questions from US Congressman Joe Courtney, who emphasized the importance of the alliance as a counter to China's regional influence and ambitions. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson stated China's opposition to actions that amplify nuclear proliferation risks and exacerbate arms races.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his support for Chinese students in America and pledged to help them remain in the country after graduation, distancing himself from initiatives to limit or block international students due to national security concerns. Trump stated that it is a "great thing" to have Chinese nationals studying in the US and that it benefits both the schools and the country. He also expressed his support for allowing these graduates to stay and be hired by American companies, emphasizing that if they are not allowed to remain, they will return to their countries and start businesses there.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate is considering changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," with senators meeting to discuss proposed modifications to the House-approved package. Changes are expected in areas such as SNAP, SALT, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. The Senate aims to rein in government costs and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path, but disagreements remain on key provisions. The changes to SNAP would lessen the burden on states, while the Senate plans to lower the cap on state and local tax deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

He acknowledged that the season has been a whirlwind, with everything outside the race track going well, but they need to bring more performance to the car. Despite the challenges, Hamilton is enjoying the challenge of driving a car that Charles Leclerc has been part of developing.</p>
