          <h2>DNA Analysis of Skeletons Reveals Matrilineal Society in 9,000-Year-Old Turkish Settlement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 04:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study of 9,000-year-old skeletons from the Neolithic settlement of Çatalhöyük in Turkey has provided strong evidence of a society centered around women. DNA analysis of remains buried under houses showed that individuals were often related through their mother's side, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with their female partners' families. This finding is supported by archaeological evidence showing female graves contained significantly more burial goods than male ones. Researchers suggest this structure, which also included the practice of raising neighbors' children, may have fostered a more egalitarian distribution of resources within the community.</p>

          <p>The announcement of a U.S.-Japan trade deal, which lowers tariffs on Japanese vehicles to 15%, has sparked a significant rally in the shares of major European carmakers. German auto giants like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz saw their stock prices climb over 4%, with Porsche jumping 7.4%. Investors are optimistic that this agreement sets a favorable precedent for the European Union, which has been seeking a similar breakthrough in its own trade negotiations with the United States. The EU faces a looming deadline with the threat of 30% tariffs on its U.S.-bound exports if a deal is not reached soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu has started her US Open preparations with a solid victory over seventh seed Marta Kostyuk at the DC Open, winning in straight sets. The match marked her first singles competition since Wimbledon and demonstrated her resilience in a tough, hard-fought contest. The tournament also featured a historic moment as 45-year-old Venus Williams defeated Peyton Stearns, becoming the oldest player to win a WTA tour-level match in over two decades. The event showcased both a promising return to form for Raducanu and a remarkable display of longevity from the seven-time Grand Slam champion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, with core inflation also unchanged at 0.6%. These soft figures came in below economists' expectations and provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with room to potentially ease its monetary policy. The central bank has expressed concerns about a "subdued" domestic growth outlook for the second half of the year, citing an uncertain global environment and the lagging impact of trade tariffs. This suggests a policy shift could be imminent to support the nation's export-dependent economy amid softening global demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Meanwhile, the passports of the United States and the United Kingdom have continued their downward trend, with the US slipping to 10th place and the UK to 6th. This highlights a shifting landscape of global mobility, where Asian passports currently dominate the top positions while formerly leading Western countries see their relative travel freedom diminish.</p>
