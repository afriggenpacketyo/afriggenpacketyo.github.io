          <p>Following President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and subsequent ceasefire, Congressman Ro Khanna is advocating for the Democratic party to re-establish itself as the anti-war party. Khanna believes this stance is both morally sound and politically advantageous, especially with young voters disillusioned by recent foreign policy decisions. He has partnered with Republican congressman Thomas Massie on a war powers resolution requiring congressional approval for military action against Iran. Khanna argues that the Washington establishment is disconnected from the American public's desire for peace and domestic investment.</p>

The YU7 SUV will start at 253,500 yuan ($35,322), undercutting Tesla's Model Y, which starts at 263,500 yuan in China. Xiaomi claims the YU7 surpasses Tesla's Model Y in several metrics, except for driver assist capabilities, and it is equipped with Nvidia's Thor chip for its advanced driver-assist software. Pre-sales began on Thursday, with deliveries expected within one to five weeks, and the company reported over 200,000 orders within three minutes of the launch.</p>

          <p>A CNBC CFO Council Survey indicates that a majority of CFOs believe President Trump's tax cut bill will pass despite concerns about the deficit. The survey found that 86% of CFOs expect significant changes to the bill but anticipate it will become law, with corporate tax breaks extended. While CFOs acknowledge the potential negative impact of tariffs on the economy, they remain optimistic about the stock market and expect bond yields to remain elevated. A slight majority still anticipate a recession either in the second half of the year or in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent research is challenging the notion that AI reasoning models are truly "smarter," with concerns raised about their generalizability and ability to solve complex problems. An Apple research paper titled "The Illusion of Thinking" found that these models fail to develop general problem-solving capabilities beyond certain complexities. Researchers at Salesforce and Anthropic have also highlighted the issue of "jagged intelligence," indicating a gap between current AI capabilities and real-world enterprise demand. Some experts argue that these warnings may be a strategic move by Apple, which is seen as playing catch up in the AI race.</p>

The unconventional staging has drawn comparisons to Eva Per√≥n's appeal to the masses.

          <p>Experts say that supplemental life insurance can provide critical financial protection that you may otherwise miss out on. As the cost of living rises, most workplace life insurance policies fail to keep pace, with the median basic workplace coverage being just $20,000 or one times a worker's salary. Experts recommend considering supplemental life insurance if your basic workplace policy has a low death benefit, especially if your family financially depends on you and your income. Major life events should trigger a reevaluation of your coverage. (not investment advice)</p>
