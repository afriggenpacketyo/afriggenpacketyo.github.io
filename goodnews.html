          <h2>CyberArk Stock Surges on Reports of Potential Acquisition by Palo Alto Networks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 13:22:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of identity management software company CyberArk jumped significantly following a report that Palo Alto Networks is in discussions to acquire it for over $20 billion. This potential deal highlights the growing importance of cloud security, especially with the rise of AI-related threats and ransomware attacks. If completed, this would be the largest acquisition for Palo Alto Networks, a major consolidator in the cybersecurity industry. The move reflects a broader trend of large-scale acquisitions in the sector, including Google's purchase of Wiz and Cisco's acquisition of Splunk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During President Donald Trump's visit to Scotland, First Minister John Swinney urged him to exempt scotch whisky from 10% U.S. tariffs. Swinney raised the issue, which costs the industry an estimated £4 million per week, during both a formal meeting and a dinner at Trump's Aberdeenshire resort. President Trump, who appeared unaware of the issue initially, indicated a new willingness to review the matter. Swinney also used the meeting to implore the president to use his influence to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, describing the discussions as convivial and productive.</p>

          <h2>United Kingdom Pledges to Recognize Palestinian State if Peace Conditions Are Not Met</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will formally recognize a Palestinian state in September unless the Israeli government takes significant steps toward a sustainable peace. The conditions include ending the 'appalling situation in Gaza,' agreeing to a ceasefire, and committing to no annexations in the West Bank. This move follows a similar announcement by France and comes after a meeting between British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.S. President Donald Trump, who reportedly signaled he would not object. The decision reflects growing international pressure on Israel regarding the conflict and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A new tax law, championed by President Trump, is set to deliver a significant financial windfall to major technology firms like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. The legislation restores several tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including immediate expensing for R&D and 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures. These permanent changes are expected to unlock billions in free cash flow, providing these companies with more flexibility for AI investments and shareholder returns. Analysts note this will accelerate deductions and could drive cash tax rates toward historic lows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched a new feature called 'study mode' within ChatGPT, designed to help students learn by guiding them through problems rather than providing direct answers. The tool aims to address educators' concerns that AI chatbots can be used for cheating and hinder critical thinking. When activated, study mode will prompt students with guiding questions to help them work through homework and test preparation step-by-step. The feature is being rolled out to all ChatGPT users and will be available in the university-focused ChatGPT Edu in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs, a move that would solidify JPMorgan's position as the largest U.S. credit card issuer. For Goldman Sachs, offloading the high-growth but financially challenging card business would mark the end of a difficult venture into consumer finance. The deal would provide Apple with a more experienced and stable partner for its credit card after its time with Goldman was marked by high costs and regulatory scrutiny. Other contenders, including American Express and Barclays, are reportedly no longer in the running. (not investment advice)</p>

The arrivals at Manor House Wildlife Park provide new hope for the global breeding program, which aims to preserve the genetic diversity of a species with fewer than 400 individuals left in the wild. The four cubs, born to an 11-year-old mother named Terima, will eventually join the wider breeding program to help ensure the species' survival. The birth is considered a significant event for conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Real estate developers are finding that affordable housing projects could soon become more profitable, thanks to an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) in a recent bill. The legislation increases the amount of credits available to developers, who sell them to investors to finance construction, and is expected to help produce over a million additional affordable rental homes by 2035. Despite challenges like high interest rates and local opposition, investors are showing strong demand for the sector. This article notes that these incentives help make higher-quality, well-designed affordable projects more financially viable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While Turnberry's infrastructure limitations make it unsuitable for The Open Championship, Donald Trump's golf resorts in Scotland are quietly deepening their ties with professional golf. The European Tour Group is already hosting two events at Trump Aberdeen, and reports suggest Trump's Irish course, Doonbeg, is being considered for the Irish Open. This growing relationship indicates that Turnberry could soon host the Scottish Open, a major event on the DP World Tour. The developments show Trump is successfully increasing his golf footprint and influence in a country central to the sport's heritage.</p>

          <p>A painting by Surrealist artist Salvador Dali, which was purchased for just £150 at a house clearance in Cambridge, is now expected to sell for up to £30,000 at auction. The piece, titled 'Vecchio Sultano,' has been authenticated as a genuine work from a series of illustrations Dali created for 'The Arabian Nights.' An art dealer who bought the piece discovered it had previously been attributed to Dali at a Sotheby's sale in the 1990s before its attribution was lost. The rediscovery is considered significant for Dali scholars and highlights the potential for finding hidden treasures.</p>
