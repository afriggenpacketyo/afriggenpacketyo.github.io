          <p>Australia's central bank has reduced its benchmark lending rates by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest since April 2023, aligning with economist expectations. This move accompanies a downgrade of the annual economic growth forecast to 1.7% from 2.1%, attributed partly to weaker public demand. The Reserve Bank of Australia noted a "substantial" drop in inflation since 2022, bringing demand and supply closer to balance. Despite the rate cut, the Australian dollar weakened, while the S&P/ASX 200 equity index saw a slight rise. Analysts anticipate further rate cuts into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' National League West lead has shrunk to just one game following a 7-4 defeat to the Angels, marked by a difficult outing for pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who yielded six runs. This loss reflects a recent period of inconsistency for the Dodgers, reminiscent of their previous championship season's challenges with injuries and offensive slumps. Despite their current struggles, the team remains in contention, but the narrowing division lead against the San Diego Padres underscores a growing urgency to improve their performance.</p>

          <p>Lee Shi Ruh, CEO of Resorts World Sentosa, affirmed the integrated resort's readiness for its 2026 casino license renewal, despite Singapore's gambling agency issuing a shorter two-year renewal due to "unsatisfactory" tourism performance. The company remains committed to its S$6.8 billion ($5.3 billion) expansion and investment plans, aiming to transform the resort into a "premium lifestyle destination" focused on unique experiences rather than just shopping. Recent openings include Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium, with future developments like Super Nintendo World and new luxury hotels planned through 2030.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to extend their trade truce for another 90 days, pushing the deadline for higher tariffs to November 10. This extension, announced just hours before the previous agreement was set to expire, aims to provide more time for negotiations on "remedying trade imbalances" and "unfair trade practices." Both Washington and Beijing expressed a desire for positive outcomes based on equality and mutual benefit. Despite the truce, trade flows have been significantly impacted this year, and discussions continue on various economic issues. (not investment advice)</p>

The goal, he stated, is to elevate competition beyond a "zero-sum mindset" towards a "win-win approach" through quality upgrades and an improved industrial ecosystem, which he deems crucial for China's long-term economic growth.

          <p>Nepal is introducing a policy to make 97 of its Himalayan mountains free to climb for the next two years, aiming to boost tourism in its more remote and underdeveloped Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. This initiative contrasts with a significant increase in permit fees for Mount Everest, which will rise to $15,000 from September. Despite the potential for job creation and income generation in local economies, it remains unclear how infrastructure will be improved or how communities will cope with a potential influx of climbers to these historically less-visited peaks.</p>

          <p>Four individuals have been arrested in connection with a series of burglaries across Los Angeles, which targeted several residences, including the Los Feliz home of actor Brad Pitt.

The arrests were made in South L.A., and law enforcement sources indicate ongoing investigations into the broader pattern of these high-profile burglaries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has firmly rejected U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli’s request to dismiss charges against Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was convicted of excessive force in a 2023 arrest. The ruling mandates Kirk to begin his prison sentence this month, despite a controversial post-trial plea agreement that reduced the felony to a misdemeanor and prompted several prosecutor resignations. The judge asserted that the government’s motion lacked new evidence and was an attempt to override his prior sentencing decision, thereby upholding the jury's verdict and judicial integrity.</p>
