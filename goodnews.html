        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's annual developer conference (WWDC) focused on significant software updates, including a new design language called Liquid Glass, but underwhelmed Wall Street due to a lack of splashy AI announcements. The Liquid Glass design will change the look of Apple's major devices, representing the first significant redesign of the iPhone operating system since 2013. Investors are pressuring Apple to make big changes to its artificial intelligence strategy, but the company delayed its Apple Intelligence feature, citing the need for more time to meet quality standards. Despite the software updates, the conference failed to meet expectations for groundbreaking AI innovations.</p>

          <p>The government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, creating 10,000 direct jobs and powering six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a landmark decision that will kickstart economic growth. However, critics condemn the move, fearing it will add to consumer bills and questioning its value for money. The project is expected to take at least a decade to complete, and the final investment decision on the funding model is due later this summer.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric cars are becoming slicker and cheaper, raising concerns about security risks and the future of European manufacturers. The expansion of Chinese companies and brands could change the face of the global motor industry, with brands like BYD, Nio, and Xpeng becoming household names. While consumers may benefit from more affordable electric cars, some experts worry about security risks from hackers and third parties. The US and EU have taken action to protect their industries, but the UK has not, raising questions about the future of the global motor industry.</p>

          <p>This article examines the historical context of President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 decision to federalize the Alabama National Guard, highlighting the rare instance of a president acting without a governor's cooperation. Johnson's action was aimed at protecting civil rights advocates marching from Selma to Montgomery after Alabama Governor George Wallace refused to ensure their safety. The article also references Eisenhower's 1957 federalization of the Arkansas National Guard during the Little Rock desegregation crisis. The article provides historical context to Trump's recent controversial decision to federalize the California National Guard.</p>
