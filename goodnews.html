          <p>In the current interest rate environment, both short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and money market accounts offer attractive returns for savers. An analysis of a $10,000 deposit shows that short-term CDs with 3-month and 6-month terms currently yield slightly more interest than a comparable money market account. However, for a 9-month term, the money market account proves more lucrative. Savers must weigh the fixed, guaranteed rate of a CD against the variable rate of a money market account, especially with potential Fed rate cuts anticipated later in the year.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has unveiled its largest-ever healthcare fraud enforcement action, involving nearly 200 cases with intended losses of $14.6 billion. A central case involves a Pakistani national who allegedly orchestrated a $650 million scheme targeting an Arizona Medicaid program for Native Americans by billing for unprovided or unnecessary addiction treatments. The nationwide operation targeted a wide range of fraudulent activities, from complex billing schemes to kickbacks, reclaiming an actual loss of $2.9 billion for taxpayers.

          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow money, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) presents a timely and attractive option this July. With average home equity at a high, HELOCs can offer a quicker approval process for large sums compared to unsecured loans. Furthermore, their variable interest rates are advantageous in the current climate, as borrowers can benefit from anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts without needing to refinance. The flexibility of only paying interest on the amount drawn provides a significant advantage during a period of economic transition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, Wimbledon is using electronic line-calling on all courts, replacing the traditional human line judges and altering a long-standing tradition. While some players appreciate the accuracy and impartiality of the AI system, others have criticized it for being too quiet and removing the fan-engaging drama of player challenges. Players like Frances Tiafoe feel the change "kills" some of the fanfare, while others have noted difficulty hearing the automated calls over crowd noise.
