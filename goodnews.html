          <p>President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, signaling potential support for the Japanese company's $14 billion investment. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain under American control, despite Nippon Steel's desire to make it a wholly owned subsidiary. He also announced plans to increase tariffs on steel imports to 50% to bolster the domestic steel industry. The deal, which was previously blocked by the Biden administration due to national security concerns, is now under review, with Trump having until Thursday to decide on its approval.

          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a surge in inbound travel to Japan, exceeding pre-pandemic levels, but their travel habits are evolving. The Japan National Tourism Organization notes a shift from large group tours and shopping sprees to immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. Chinese travelers in their 30s and 40s are increasingly choosing family trips over group tours. The JNTO is targeting this market by opening an account on a popular Chinese social media platform. This positive trend indicates a strengthening of tourism ties between the two countries.</p>
