          <p>Australians are voting in a general election against a backdrop of economic challenges, including a cost-of-living crisis and housing affordability issues. Voters are concerned about rising prices and the impact on their household budgets, despite pledges from both major parties to alleviate economic pressures. The article notes a shift away from the major parties towards independent candidates, reflecting dissatisfaction with the existing political landscape. It also touches on the cultural divide, particularly regarding Indigenous recognition, and the influence of Trump-like rhetoric in Australian politics. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an 'unparalleled' antivenom using antibodies from a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from various deadly snakes. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's efforts could lead to a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. The research team identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target neurotoxins, creating a cocktail that protected mice from 13 of 19 deadly elapid snake species. Optimism score: 80</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has intervened in the financial market to manage the local currency's strength against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative 'revolution' aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and consolidating political power. The reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating around 100,000 public sector jobs. These changes are intended to address dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign and prepare for potential US tariffs. Some analysts suggest the restructuring also benefits the ruling party by centralizing control and narrowing the path to power for rising officials. Optimism score: 60</p>
