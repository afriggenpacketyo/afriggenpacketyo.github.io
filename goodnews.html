          <p>The Bank of England has decided to keep UK interest rates at 4%, signaling that the country is "not out of the woods yet" regarding persistent inflation. While the move was widely expected, two of the nine monetary policy committee members voted for a rate cut, indicating some division on the path forward. The Bank also announced it would slow the pace of selling its government debt holdings to minimize market impact, as it continues to balance controlling inflation with promoting economic stability.

          <p>This article provides an overview of the current price of gold and the various economic factors that influence its value as an investment commodity. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset during times of market uncertainty, with its price being affected by supply and demand, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events. As of September 17, 2025, the price was noted at $3,678.26 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant fluctuation based on global market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to 231,000 for the week ending September 13, a significant decrease from the previous week's near four-year high.

The discussions at the Chequers country residence are expected to cover trade deals, including U.S. tariffs on British steel, as well as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Despite their political differences, the two leaders have displayed a surprisingly amicable relationship, which observers note could be key to the visit's diplomatic success.</p>

          <p>The White House appears to support the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut, with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett calling it a "prudent call." While some within the administration, including new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, had advocated for a larger half-point reduction, Hassett described the move as a good first step. This signals a potential de-escalation of President Trump's previous harsh criticisms of the central bank and its chair, Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle's Larry Ellison has amassed a $365 billion fortune largely by holding onto his company shares while borrowing heavily against them to fund his lavish lifestyle and numerous investments. This high-risk, high-leverage strategy contrasts with the typical wealth management advice of diversification and selling shares over time. Ellison has pledged over $82 billion worth of his Oracle stock as collateral for personal loans, a practice that allows him to raise cash without relinquishing his significant ownership stake in the company.
