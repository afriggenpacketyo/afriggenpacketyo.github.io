          <h2>US Focuses on European Union Trade Negotiations Following Agreement with Japan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 04:10:19 EDT</div>

          <p>After securing a trade framework with Japan, the Trump administration is now turning its attention to negotiations with the European Union. The U.S. has set an August 1 deadline for a deal, threatening to impose 30% tariffs on EU imports if an agreement is not reached. The recent U.S.-Japan deal, which reduced auto tariffs without imposing export caps, has raised hopes among some analysts that a similar breakthrough could be possible for the EU. European auto stocks surged following the news, as the sector is a key component of EU exports to the United States and has been a major point of contention in trade discussions.</p>

          <h2>DNA Analysis of Skeletons in Turkey Reveals 9,000-Year-Old Matrilineal Society</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of 9,000-year-old skeletons from the Neolithic settlement of Çatalhöyük in Turkey has confirmed that the society was organized around women. DNA analysis revealed that individuals buried under the same house were often related through their mother's side, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with their female partner's family. This genetic evidence supports earlier archaeological theories based on female figurines and the discovery of more grave goods with female remains. The research also suggests a society that valued equality, as evidence points to the practice of children being raised in neighboring households to ensure a fair distribution of resources.</p>

          <h2>German Automotive Stocks Surge on Hopes of Tariff Relief Following US-Japan Trade Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 03:57:16 EDT</div>

          <p>Major German automakers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, saw their shares rise significantly following the announcement of a trade agreement between the United States and Japan. The deal, which lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles, has sparked optimism that the European Union may secure a similar breakthrough in its own trade negotiations with Washington. The EU has been under pressure from the threat of increased U.S. tariffs, and the automotive sector is a critical component of its export market. The positive market reaction reflects hopes that the U.S.-Japan agreement could set a favorable precedent for European car manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate remained at 0.8% in June, maintaining its lowest level in over four years and coming in slightly below economists' expectations. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also held steady at 0.6%. This sustained soft inflation provides the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with flexibility to potentially ease its monetary policy to support economic growth amid global trade uncertainties. The MAS has noted that core inflation has been below expectations and projects it to average between 0.5% and 1.5% for the year, anticipating subdued domestic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

While facing pressures from inflation and rising costs, the co-founder remains optimistic, citing the iconic status of the rubber duck and the high-profit margins on such novelty items. Retail analysts suggest that the business benefits from "treatonomics," a trend where consumers purchase small, affordable luxuries, but caution that its long-term success may depend on its ability to endure beyond being a fad.</p>
