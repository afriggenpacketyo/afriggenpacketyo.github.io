          <p>A widespread technology outage impacted numerous platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Google, OpenAI, and Spotify, causing disruptions for tens of thousands of users. Cloudflare reported intermittent failures and investigated the issue, later attributing the source of the outage to Google Cloud. Google Cloud experienced disruptions with its Google Cloud Platform products, while Spotify reported widespread problems with login, playback, and its support site. Most services began recovering by late afternoon, with OpenAI confirming that all impacted services were restored.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has announced that the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes a significant expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). The proposed reauthorization would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders," to be compensated for nuclear waste exposure. The proposal also allows for claims related to increased atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers from 1971-1990 to the list of those eligible for benefits. The Senate will need to maneuver these provisions through procedural rules, but Hawley expressed optimism about the bill's passage.</p>

          <h2>Consumer Sentiment Rebounds as Tariff Concerns Ease</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment has rebounded in early June, driven by reduced pessimism about the economy and potential inflation surges. The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers showed broad improvements in sentiment indices and a decline in near-term inflation outlook. The moves coincide with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs, although concerns about the impact of tariffs and geopolitical issues remain. The one-year inflation outlook has decreased, reflecting a belief that trade policy may still contribute to inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 10:21:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is reportedly close to finalizing a return to Saracens after a challenging season with French side Racing 92. While a deal is not yet signed, an agreement is expected to be reached between Saracens and Racing to facilitate Farrell's move this summer. Farrell spent 16 seasons with Saracens, winning multiple Premiership titles and European Cups, and took a break from international rugby after the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The return would provide cover for the injured Alex Lozowski and potentially lead to a coaching role at Saracens in the future.</p>

          <p>The Swiss cabinet has approved agreements with the European Union aimed at regulating their relationship and has initiated a domestic consultation process. The government cited the uncertain global geopolitical situation as a "strategic necessity" for maintaining stable relations with the EU, Switzerland's largest trading partner. The consultation will last until October 31, 2025, with Parliament debating the package before a referendum, likely in 2028. The cabinet aims for customized sectoral participation in the EU single market and cooperation in selected areas.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has halted additional provisions of President Trump's executive order related to voting. The ruling paused a requirement for people to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote using the national form. The judge also blocked a provision aimed at barring states from counting mail ballots postmarked by Election Day but received after, citing the Constitution. The decision follows a previous ruling that paused another part of the order, and numerous voting officials have expressed alarm at what they see as federal overreach.</p>
