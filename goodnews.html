          <p>PayPal reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading the company to raise its full-year guidance for profitability and earnings per share. Despite the positive results, the company's stock experienced a decline in after-hours trading. Key metrics like total payment volume and active accounts showed healthy growth, with Venmo revenue increasing by over 20%. CEO Alex Chriss's strategy has focused on improving profitability by monetizing key assets like Venmo and Braintree, which appears to be yielding positive results for the payment giant.

          <p>Procter & Gamble exceeded Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations but issued cautious guidance for its 2026 fiscal year, anticipating a $1 billion negative impact from tariffs. The consumer goods giant, which owns brands like Tide and Charmin, plans to offset some of these costs through productivity and sourcing changes but will also implement price increases on about a quarter of its products. The company described the current consumer as value-seeking and selective amid a volatile economic environment. The report came a day before a planned leadership transition, with COO Shailesh Jejurikar set to become CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starbucks is implementing a new strategy called "Green Apron Service" to improve customer experience and boost its sluggish sales. The initiative focuses on enhancing hospitality through friendlier and more engaging interactions with baristas, aiming to make store visits a regular habit for customers. This plan is supported by operational changes, including improved staffing models and technology to ensure faster service times, particularly as digital orders now constitute over 30% of sales. The move represents a return to basics for the coffee giant as it navigates a competitive consumer market under CEO Brian Niccol's leadership.</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has made an $85 billion offer to acquire Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first coast-to-coast railroad in the United States. The proposed merger aims to streamline freight deliveries across the country by combining Union Pacific's western network with Norfolk Southern's eastern routes. However, the deal faces significant scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have set a high bar for railroad consolidation following service disruptions from past mergers. If approved, the move could pressure the remaining major U.S. railroads, BNSF and CSX, to pursue their own merger to remain competitive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 74-year-old man, was unexpectedly diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and fatal lung disease, during a routine pre-surgery X-ray. Despite having no symptoms, his condition deteriorated rapidly, leaving him with less than a year to live. Initially hesitant, he agreed to a double-lung transplant, which he successfully underwent at the Cleveland Clinic. Now recovering, Kennedy has regained 98% of his lung capacity and is returning to his passion of training hospital therapy dogs, naming his new puppy "Encore" to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread warnings, significant price hikes from President Trump's tariffs have not yet fully materialized for U.S. consumers. This is due to several factors, including repeated delays in implementing the steepest tariffs and proactive stockpiling by companies to build inventory before the taxes took effect. Additionally, many importers have either absorbed the initial tariff costs as a hit to their profits or held shipments abroad to await clarity on the new trade policies. While some targeted price increases have occurred, the full impact on shoppers has been blunted, though experts warn this may be a temporary reprieve.</p>

          <p>Boeing reported a significant improvement in its second-quarter financial results, narrowing its losses and increasing revenue as it delivered the most aircraft in a quarter since 2018. The aerospace giant's revenue rose 35% to $22.75 billion, beating analyst expectations and signaling progress in its ongoing turnaround efforts. CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed cautious optimism, stating that 2025 could be the company's "turnaround year" if it maintains its focus on safety, quality, and stability. The positive delivery numbers suggest Boeing is stabilizing production after years of crises, including recent scrutiny following a mid-flight door plug incident. (not investment advice)</p>

These 17 critical minerals are essential for manufacturing everything from electric vehicles and wind turbines to advanced defense systems. China's recent export controls have highlighted the strategic vulnerability, prompting the U.S. Department of Defense to invest $400 million in American producer MP Materials.

This strategic shift aims to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, but it also raises questions about rising expenses.

          <p>Contrary to widespread pessimism, recent data suggests that the institution of marriage in the United States may be stabilizing and even strengthening. Divorce rates have fallen by nearly 40% since the 1980s, and the share of children living in two-parent married families has slightly increased since 2012. After decades of decline, the marriage rate among prime-age adults has also shown a modest uptick since 2020. The author argues that marriage is adapting, with husbands contributing more to childcare, and continues to offer significant benefits in happiness, health, and financial security for both men and women.</p>

About 60% of adults under 30 use AI for brainstorming ideas, compared to just 20% of those 60 or older. Younger adults are also more likely to use AI for work-related tasks and drafting emails. The findings highlight a generational divide in AI adoption, suggesting that while the technology is becoming ubiquitous for search, its role as a productivity assistant is still emerging.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia, brokered by Malaysia, has been met with cautious optimism after days of deadly border clashes. The truce aims to de-escalate tensions over disputed territory that killed dozens and displaced around 200,000 people. Analysts suggest the ceasefire may hold as both sides have achieved political objectives, with the conflict weakening the Thaksin dynasty in Thailand while strengthening the Hun family's rule in Cambodia. However, concerns remain about the lack of a third-party monitoring mechanism to enforce the agreement, though pressure from the U.S. involving potential trade tariffs may have helped facilitate the deal.</p>
