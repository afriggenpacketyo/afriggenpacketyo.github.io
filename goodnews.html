          <p>The Trump administration, through Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, has announced the release of 230,000 previously classified files concerning the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. These documents, now available to the public via the National Archives, cover nearly 60 years of investigation into the 1968 assassination. The files reportedly contain details about the FBI's investigation, internal memos on the case's progress, and information regarding potential leads, including discussions with an informant who was a former cellmate of the convicted assassin, James Earl Ray. The release aims to provide greater transparency on one of the most significant events in American history.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has announced the upcoming launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, a new beverage containing three grams of prebiotic fiber and sweetened with cane sugar. This move comes just months after the company acquired the popular functional soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion, signaling a strategic pivot towards health-conscious consumers. As traditional soda consumption declines, PepsiCo is aiming to capture a share of the growing market for drinks that claim to offer gut-health benefits. The new product will be available online this fall and will expand to retail stores next year, representing a key effort to innovate amid shifting consumer preferences.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United Completes Signing of Winger Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 16:07:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United has successfully signed Cameroon international winger Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal reportedly worth an initial £65 million. The 25-year-old has agreed to a five-year contract, becoming the third major signing for manager Ruben Amorim this summer. Mbeumo, who described the move as joining his 'dream club,' was highly productive for Brentford, scoring 20 goals in the Premier League last season. The transfer marks Brentford's largest-ever sale and concludes a lengthy negotiation process, with United ultimately securing one of their primary targets for the upcoming season ahead of several rival clubs.</p>

          <p>Shares of the financial technology company Block Inc. saw a significant 7% increase following the announcement of its inclusion in the S&P 500 index. The stock surge is attributed to the anticipated buying pressure from passive index funds, which must now acquire Block shares to accurately track the benchmark. The company, with a market capitalization of $48 billion, will replace Hess in the index after its acquisition by Chevron. Despite its inclusion, Block's stock remains down 8% for the year as it works to improve performance in its Cash App division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During the isolation of the pandemic, musician Jonathan Singletary created 'Piano & Prayer,' a weekly gathering on Instagram Live that has since cultivated a dedicated online community. From his home, Singletary plays improvised piano music, creating a spiritual but not explicitly religious space for people to connect, meditate, and share prayer requests in the chat. The sessions began as a personal outlet but have grown to attract thousands of viewers, resonating with a growing number of people who identify as spiritual rather than religious.

This fundraising disparity is wider than at the same point before the 2018 midterms. The RNC credits its success to a close partnership with President Trump's team, while the DNC, under new leadership, works to recover from 2024 election losses and build momentum for upcoming elections.

Joel, who recently completed a decade-long residency at Madison Square Garden, had been experiencing issues with his balance, vision, and hearing.

The deployment in early June by the Trump administration was highly contentious and drew fierce condemnation from local officials. A Pentagon spokesperson stated that the withdrawal was directed due to 'stability returning to Los Angeles,' crediting the Marines' presence with restoring order. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who had decried the military presence as inappropriate, called the withdrawal 'another win for Los Angeles,' emphasizing that troops should be performing the duties for which they enlisted.</p>

          <p>Paul de Gelder, an Australian Navy diver who lost a hand and a leg in a 2009 shark attack, is sharing safety advice for swimmers amid recent shark sightings. His top three tips for a shark encounter are to remain calm and avoid splashing, maintain eye contact with the animal, and, as a last resort, push firmly on its nose rather than punching it. De Gelder emphasizes that sharks are not malicious and that panicking can escalate a situation. He is demonstrating these survival techniques in a new Discovery Channel special, aiming to educate the public on how to react safely during a potential encounter.</p>

Manager Sarina Wiegman stated the players decided the impact of the gesture is 'not good enough' and that a different approach is needed to tackle racism. The decision follows racist abuse targeted at defender Jess Carter on social media during the current Euro 2025 tournament. The team plans to stand together at kick-off instead, aiming to spark a new conversation and signal that current anti-racism efforts are insufficient. The move has drawn both support and questions from anti-discrimination bodies.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share by appealing to value-conscious consumers amid industry-wide economic pressures. The company reported a 3.4% rise in U.S. same-store sales, crediting its success to popular deals and new products that attracted customers across all income levels, including the low-income cohort. CEO Russell Weiner stated that he sees industry headwinds as 'tailwinds' for Domino's, as the chain can offer value on items customers genuinely want. This strategy contrasts with other fast-food chains struggling with sluggish traffic as diners increasingly opt to eat at home to save money.</p>
