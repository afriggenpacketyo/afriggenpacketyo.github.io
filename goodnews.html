          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggests the artificial intelligence market is forming a bubble, drawing parallels to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. He acknowledges widespread investor overexcitement while simultaneously asserting AI's profound long-term importance. Other prominent figures, including Alibaba's Joe Tsai and Bridgewater's Ray Dalio, share similar concerns about the rapid pace of investment. Despite OpenAI's projected $20 billion in annual recurring revenue this year, the company remains unprofitable, underscoring the massive capital requirements for AI development and infrastructure buildout. Altman's comments also touch on the evolving relevance of "artificial general intelligence" (AGI) and OpenAI's future expansion plans into consumer hardware and brain-computer interfaces.</p>

          <p>Chinese semiconductor firm Cambricon Technologies, positioned as a potential competitor to Nvidia, plans to raise nearly 4 billion yuan (US$560 million) to fund its artificial intelligence chip development. This significant investment aims to bolster China's drive for technological self-sufficiency in the crucial semiconductor sector. The fundraising plan has received initial approval from the Shanghai Stock Exchange and is pending final regulatory clearance, following a year where Cambricon's stock price nearly tripled. This surge reflects strong investor confidence in its AI prospects, especially as public computing hubs are mandated to source over 50% of their chips domestically.</p>

          <p>Helsinki, Finland, a city of nearly 690,000 people, reported zero traffic fatalities in the last year, showcasing the effectiveness of its smart city planning. This achievement aligns with the European Union's "Vision Zero" program, which aims for as close to zero road fatalities as possible by 2050. Key measures contributing to this success include reducing speed limits to 30 kmph on over half of the city's streets and around schools, along with increasing public transport use. Helsinki also utilizes crash and driving speed data, resident feedback, and improved infrastructure like bike paths and street lighting to enhance overall road safety.</p>

Raducanu, partnering with five-time Grand Slam winner Carlos Alcaraz, will compete against Draper, who is paired with American Jessica Pegula. This standalone two-day tournament, offering a $1 million prize, has drawn criticism for its scheduling before the singles competition. Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion, received a wildcard entry, while Draper and Pegula are the top seeds. The first two rounds will take place on Tuesday, with semi-finals and the final on Wednesday, utilizing shorter match formats.</p>

Hui, who faces criminal charges and a bounty from Hong Kong authorities, stated the asylum grant validates the persecution of individuals involved in the protests. China's foreign ministry condemned the decision, urging Australia to cease interference in Hong Kong affairs. This development highlights ongoing international scrutiny of Hong Kong's autonomy and human rights situation, particularly concerning the trial of pro-democracy businessman Jimmy Lai, whom Hui urged support for.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully developed a method to convert human stem cells into dopamine-producing brain cells, which they then transplanted into mice. This innovative research demonstrated that the engineered neuron-like cells helped reduce depressive behaviors and increase feelings of enjoyment in depression-model mice. Published in the peer-reviewed journal "Cell Stem Cell," this study offers proof-of-concept for cell therapy as a potential treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. The development could lead to direct targeting and repair of brain regions involved in mood regulation, offering new hope for conditions like treatment-resistant depression and anhedonia, which affects millions globally.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing to evacuate between 30 and 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza to the UK for urgent medical treatment in the coming weeks. This marks the first government-coordinated operation of its kind, involving the Foreign Office, Home Office, and Department of Health. The children, selected by the World Health Organization, will travel with family via a third country for biometric data collection. This initiative follows appeals from MPs and aims to address the dire healthcare situation in Gaza, where over 50,000 children have been killed or injured since October 2023.</p>

          <h2>Bolivia's Presidential Election Heads to Runoff, Ending Two Decades of Leftist Dominance</h2>

          <p>Bolivia's presidential election will proceed to an unprecedented runoff between centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz and right-wing former President Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga, marking the end of over two decades of left-wing dominance. Paz surprisingly led the first round with 32.8% of the vote, against Quiroga's 26.4%, with neither securing an outright victory. The ruling Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party suffered a major blow, with its candidates performing poorly amidst Bolivia's severe economic crisis, characterized by soaring inflation and fuel shortages. This outcome reflects voters' desire for change and their ambivalence about a dramatic shift to the right.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called for increased pressure on Russia and robust security guarantees for Ukraine, advocating for a "just and lasting peace" ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. Key European leaders, including Germany's Friedrich Merz, France's Emmanuel Macron, and UK's Keir Starmer, met beforehand to underscore that any territorial negotiations must directly involve Kyiv. This united front aims to counter Trump's recent suggestion that Zelenskyy could end the war "almost immediately" by ceding Crimea and abandoning NATO aspirations, emphasizing the importance of Ukraine's sovereignty and security.</p>

          <p>Terence Stamp, the acclaimed British actor known for his roles in "Billy Budd" and as General Zod in early "Superman" films, has died at 87. Associated with the Swinging '60s, Stamp was celebrated for his distinctive looks and versatile performances, portraying everything from a humble sailor to shadow-haunted super-villains. His career spanned over 60 films, including a critically praised portrayal of a transgender woman in "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert." Stamp overcame a working-class background and a career lull, famously returning to acting after receiving a telegram for the "Superman" role, leaving behind an extraordinary body of work.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate. This concession, described as "game-changing," emerged from Trump's summit with Putin and could serve as a workaround to Russia's longstanding objection to Ukraine's NATO membership. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the willingness for support, he noted a lack of details on how such an agreement would function or what roles America and Europe would play. The potential deal also reportedly includes Russia agreeing not to violate other European countries' sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Bolivia is on the cusp of electing its first non-left-wing president in nearly two decades, as preliminary results indicate a runoff between centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira and right-wing former president Jorge Quiroga. Paz Pereira, a surprise frontrunner, campaigned on redistributing funds to regional entities and fighting corruption, proposing accessible credit and tax breaks. This political shift comes amidst Bolivia's worst economic crisis in years, marked by fuel and foreign reserve shortages and high inflation. A change in government could also signify closer ties with the U.S., moving away from two decades of strengthened relations with China, Russia, and Iran, and potentially opening up Bolivia's vast lithium reserves to foreign investment.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Composite Index has surged to a 10-year high, reflecting a prevailing "risk-on" mood in mainland Chinese markets as investors seek higher returns. The index advanced 0.9%, reaching a level not seen since August 2015, while the CSI 300 Index also climbed to its highest close in almost a year. This turnaround follows years of underperformance, driven by the fading appeal of fixed-income products like low-yielding government bonds and deposits. Telecoms and IT stocks are leading the gains, with companies on the CSI 300 offering an attractive average dividend yield compared to traditional investments, signaling a rotation of capital into equities.</p>
