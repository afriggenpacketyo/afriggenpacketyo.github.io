While demand for these defined outcome strategies is growing, investors are advised to seek out ETFs managed by institutional professionals and be cautious of unsustainable yields.

          <p>A United Airlines aircraft clipped the tail of another stationary United plane while taxiing toward its gate at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who were able to deplane normally after a delay. The incident involved one plane's wing striking the horizontal stabilizer of the other. This event adds to recent concerns about aviation safety following several other runway collisions and near-misses at U.S. airports over the past year.</p>

          <p>Repair work has commenced to restore the main power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has relied on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The International Atomic Energy Agency announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs. The plant, Europe's largest, requires a reliable power source to cool its shutdown reactors and prevent a potential nuclear incident. Ukrainian officials confirmed their specialists are involved and stressed the importance of reconnecting the plant to the national grid for safety.</p>

          <p>At 99 years old, Sir David Attenborough has set a new record as the oldest person to win a Daytime Emmy award. He was honored in the outstanding daytime personality category for his work on the Netflix documentary "Secret Lives of Orangutans." The film, which explores the lives of apes in Sumatra, also secured awards for music direction and directing. Attenborough, whose career as a naturalist and broadcaster spans over seven decades, surpassed the previous record held by actor Dick Van Dyke. The esteemed narrator was not present to accept the award in person.</p>

          <p>The Grand Sumo Tournament is being held in London, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that the prestigious competition has taken place outside of Japan. The Royal Albert Hall, which also hosted the event in 1991, has been specially prepared with an 11-ton clay ring, or dohyo, shipped from Japan. The five-day tournament features over 44 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, including two grand champions, or yokozuna. The event aims to authentically present the deeply traditional and religious aspects of sumo to a Western audience.</p>

          <p>Amid rising suicide rates among Black men, community-led mental health groups are emerging to provide safe spaces for vulnerability and healing. Organizations like Mental Health Is Real Wealth in Los Angeles host bi-monthly gatherings where Black men can discuss their struggles without judgment. These initiatives address a critical gap, as Black men are less likely to seek mental health support and often face culturally incompetent care when they do. The groups aim to help participants navigate societal pressures, systemic racism, and personal identity crises, fostering emotional expression and breaking generational cycles of silence.</p>

          <p>The German-English phrase "Das crazy" has been selected as Germany's Youth Word of the Year for 2025, reflecting the growing influence of English and internet culture on youth slang. The term, a grammatically unconventional mix of a German article and an English adjective, is used to express surprise, speechlessness, or irony. Chosen through an online vote organized by the PONS Langenscheidt publishing house, the phrase narrowly beat out competitors like "goonen."

He expresses skepticism towards the first two, particularly gold, which he describes as an inert asset whose value depends solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it later. Buffett strongly favors the third category—productive assets like farms and businesses—because their value is based on what they can generate over time. This approach, he explains, means focusing on an asset's long-term output rather than its short-term price fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>
