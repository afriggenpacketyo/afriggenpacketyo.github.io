          <p>Financial experts advise college graduates to start saving for retirement immediately to capitalize on compound interest and long-term market benefits. Despite market volatility, focusing on time in the market rather than timing the market is crucial for building wealth. Investing in low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track broad market indexes is recommended for diversification. Experts suggest allocating a higher percentage to stocks when younger, gradually shifting to bonds as retirement nears, and emphasize the importance of understanding individual risk tolerance when making investment decisions.

          <p>President Donald Trump defended his tariff strategy, rejecting the "TACO trade" critique, which suggests he announces tariffs only to later soften them. Trump argued his tariff threats have spurred trade negotiations, citing the European Union's willingness to meet after a 50% tariff was proposed. He dismissed the idea that delaying the tariff deadline was "chickening out," instead framing it as a negotiation tactic. Stocks initially fell after Trump's tariff announcement but rallied after the deadline was delayed, highlighting the market's sensitivity to trade policy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's executive orders on nuclear power could lead to the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the U.S. by late 2030, according to GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik. Trump's order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to expedite the approval process for new nuclear plants, potentially leading to SMR construction approvals by 2027. GE Vernova recently received approval to deploy its BWRX-300 reactor in Ontario, Canada, marking the first SMR deployment in the West. The company anticipates further applications for SMR construction, driven by growing customer interest in carbon-free nuclear energy.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume to roughly 20% by 2030, contingent on regulations, customer acceptance, and affordability. Toyota's strategy reflects a shift towards PHEVs as a stepping stone to all-electric vehicles, while also improving fuel economy and meeting emissions regulations. The company continues to invest billions in all-electric vehicles, but is also expanding its PHEV lineup.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has stated she would grant bail to Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist employed by Harvard University, finding that a customs officer acted improperly in stripping her of her visa for failing to declare scientific samples. The judge noted that Petrova's life would be in danger if deported to Russia. Petrova was detained after customs officials found frog embryos in her luggage, leading to felony smuggling charges. The judge's decision challenges President Trump's immigration policy, highlighting concerns about the violation of Petrova's constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's rebuilding is gathering speed, with veteran back-up goalkeeper Tom Heaton, 39, set to sign a one-year contract extension. The club expects to discover next week whether they have been successful in their attempts to bring Ipswich striker Liam Delap to the club, who is available for ¬£30m following Ipswich's relegation to the Championship. There is still no word on whether skipper Bruno Fernandes might be tempted by a big-money offer from Saudi Arabia, but he is travelling to Hong Kong with the rest of the squad for the final leg of United's Asia trip on Friday. Speaking to United's own media before the defeat, chief executive Omar Berrada said the club had a vision for what they wanted to achieve.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Cats Recognize Their Owner's Scent</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Tokyo University of Agriculture suggests that domestic cats can distinguish between the scent of their owner and that of a stranger. The study found that cats spent significantly longer sniffing tubes containing the odors of unknown people compared to tubes containing their owner's smell. This indicates that cats can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans based on their odor, though it remains unclear whether they can identify specific people. The researchers emphasized that further experiments are needed to determine if cats can specifically recognize their owner's scent among multiple known individuals.</p>
