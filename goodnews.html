          <p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have signed a landmark peace agreement at the White House, officially ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Karabakh region. The U.S.-brokered deal includes the creation of a major transit corridor, named the "Trump Route," linking Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave, with the U.S. holding development rights. Both nations' leaders credited President Trump's administration for the breakthrough, which has been hailed by international figures but met with warnings from Iran. The agreement signifies a major geopolitical shift, diminishing Russia's historical influence in the South Caucasus region.</p>

          <p>The launch of OpenAI's GPT-5 has generated mixed reactions within China's competitive artificial intelligence landscape. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the new model as a "PhD-level expert in anything," some Chinese tech commentators found it lacking in revolutionary breakthroughs. One expert noted that GPT-5 did not present memorable characteristics, suggesting it was more of an incremental improvement than a major leap forward. This reception comes as China's own tech firms are rapidly developing their own advanced AI models, heightening global competition.</p>

          <p>China is advancing its plans to construct the Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a strategic 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) artery connecting its northwestern and southwestern regions. The project, part of a larger plan to create a 5,000-kilometer plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035, will link the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line with a new line from Hotan. A new company has been established to oversee the project, which also includes business scopes for real estate development and tourism. This railway is one of four major lines designed to integrate Tibet more closely with the rest of China.</p>

          <p>This article offers practical advice for travelers on how to avoid expensive international roaming fees, prompted by a reporter's personal experience of incurring nearly $50 in extra charges over five days in Paris. Experts suggest several strategies depending on usage needs, such as switching to a carrier like T-Mobile for basic international coverage or purchasing a cheaper, data-focused eSIM from providers like Airalo. For minimal data use, leveraging free Wi-Fi and pre-downloading maps and documents can eliminate extra costs entirely, though public Wi-Fi poses security risks for sensitive transactions.</p>

          <p>Stargazers hoping to catch the peak of the annual Perseid meteor shower next week may be disappointed, as a full moon is expected to diminish its visibility. NASA advises that the bright moonlight will likely wash out all but the brightest meteors during the peak on the night of August 12-13. The Perseids, known for their bright fireballs, originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet. Despite the suboptimal conditions this year, patient observers in the Northern Hemisphere might still see some activity in the predawn hours.</p>

          <p>This opinion article strongly endorses President Trump's nomination of Eric Tung to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The author, Mike Davis, praises Tung's exceptional credentials, including his education at Yale and the University of Chicago and clerkships for Justice Scalia and then-Judge Gorsuch. The piece argues that Tung is a brilliant, fair-minded constitutionalist with broad bipartisan respect, despite what it calls partisan attacks during his Senate confirmation hearing. Davis concludes that confirming Tung is a crucial step in fortifying the judiciary with principled judges.</p>

          <p>A diverse group of activists, including teachers, retirees, and first-time protesters, are maintaining a daily vigil outside a Home Depot in Pasadena to protect day laborers from potential immigration raids. Organized under the "Community Defense Corner" banner, they patrol the parking lot, distribute literature, and alert workers to the presence of federal agents. The movement is fueled by what participants describe as the inhumane and un-Christian nature of the Trump administration's immigration policies. They aim to show solidarity with immigrant workers, whom they see as vital members of their community.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 05:47:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant de-escalation measure, North Korea has started dismantling some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border with South Korea. This action is seen as a reciprocal move following South Korea's decision to halt its own broadcasts, which included playing K-pop and news reports into the North. The shift in policy comes under South Korea's new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, who is actively seeking to reopen dialogue and ease tensions with Pyongyang. This marks a reversal of the hard-line approach of the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of 22-year-old Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million. Sesko, who has signed a five-year contract, is the club's third major attacking acquisition under manager Ruben Amorim. Known for his pace and physical presence, Sesko was a top scorer among under-23 players in Europe's major leagues and chose United over other interested clubs like Newcastle. His arrival raises questions about the future of current striker Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has revived a decades-old project to construct the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland and become the world's longest single-span suspension bridge. The estimated $15.7 billion project is slated to begin construction in 2026 and finish by 2032. Proponents tout its potential for economic prosperity and job creation, while critics and local opponents raise concerns about the cost, environmental impact, and feasibility in a seismically active area. The construction consortium insists the design can withstand powerful winds and earthquakes, citing other successful bridges in similar regions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This lifestyle article offers etiquette advice for being a good houseguest, emphasizing that respecting the host's space is paramount, no matter the relationship. Expert Elaine Swann suggests that while a host's invitation to "make yourself at home" allows for self-sufficiency, guests should remain mindful, tidy, and proactive in offering help. Key tips include giving ample notice, keeping visits to a reasonable length (ideally four days), communicating plans, and not relying on the host for transportation. The goal is to ensure the visit is a gift, not a burden, and to secure a future invitation.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from China, with a 13 percent year-on-year rise recorded in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), this trend is expected to continue, as a recent survey found that 72 percent of Chinese tourists are willing to travel long-haul to the continent. This figure is notably higher than for other key markets like the U.S. and Japan. The article suggests this shift may be partly influenced by geopolitical factors, including relations with the United States under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the American astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and famously guided its crew safely back to Earth, has died at the age of 97. Lovell became a global hero in 1970 when he and his crew overcame a catastrophic explosion onboard their spacecraft, turning a near-tragedy into what NASA called its "finest hour." He was also a member of the Apollo 8 crew, the first humans to orbit the Moon, making him the first person to travel to the Moon twice. His life was famously depicted by Tom Hanks in the 1995 film "Apollo 13."</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has unexpectedly ended his attempt to forge a career in the NFL, leaving the Jacksonville Jaguars to return to rugby union. While an injury and coaching changes at the Jaguars were factors, his decision is also linked to increasing opportunities back in rugby, including a potential spot on the Wales national team and interest from a proposed rebel league. Experts are divided on his NFL prospects, but many believe his experience will make him a better, more mature player upon his return. His comeback is being hailed as a significant boost for Welsh rugby.</p>
