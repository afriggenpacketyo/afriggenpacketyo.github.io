          <h2>Singapore's July Inflation Rate Falls to 0.6%, Reaching Lowest Point Since Early 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:39:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's July inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest point since January 2021, as the city-state braces for slower economic growth later this year. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also dipped to 0.5%, below forecasts. This moderation is primarily attributed to falling prices in retail, other goods, and electricity and gas, with private transport costs still rising due to higher car prices. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipates inflation will remain modest in the near term, influenced by easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. The central bank has already adjusted its monetary policy twice this year, signaling proactive measures to manage the economic outlook amid a downshift in the global trade environment and rising trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Shares of China's Dongfeng Motor Group surged to their highest level since 2017 after its parent company announced plans to take the automaker private in a deal valued at approximately $7 billion. This strategic move aligns with China's State Council efforts to consolidate the automotive sector and enhance competitiveness. The company is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. This article highlights significant restructuring within China's state-owned automotive industry, which comes despite Dongfeng acknowledging a "severe and complex landscape" and slowing domestic demand, though EV sales within the company are climbing.
