          <p>The San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California have settled a 15-year legal dispute over water costs. The agreement establishes a fixed price for delivering water supplies, starting at $671 per acre-foot in 2026, adjusted annually for inflation. The settlement enables greater collaboration among the agencies to improve finances and move water where it's needed. The resolution is expected to stabilize water rates for people in San Diego County. This situation is positive due to the settlement.</p>
