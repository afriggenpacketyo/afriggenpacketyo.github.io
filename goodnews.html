        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese authorities have introduced comprehensive new "Guidelines for Regulating Medical Science Self-Media Behaviour" to combat the spread of false and misleading health information across social media and other unofficial online channels. These regulations impose stricter requirements on healthcare practitioners and related personnel for disseminating medical science content, while also increasing platforms' responsibility to verify credentials and ensure content authenticity. The initiative aims to clearly distinguish between genuine public health education and disguised commercial advertising, reflecting a significant government effort to safeguard public health and maintain informational integrity in the rapidly expanding digital landscape. This decisive crackdown addresses growing concerns over unverified medical advice potentially impacting citizens and underscores a broader regulatory trend in China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pet dogs are increasingly playing starring roles in weddings, reflecting their status as cherished family members for many couples. Stories like Newton, a sheepadoodle who served as a ring bearer and greeter, exemplify this trend, bringing immense joy to the ceremonies. A Dog's Trust survey highlights this bond, with most owners considering their dog a best friend and emotional support. Specialized dog chaperone services, such as Precious Pets Weddings, are emerging to plan and manage pets' involvement, offering services from mini-grooms to coordinating "flower girl" duties. This phenomenon underscores the deep connection between humans and their canine companions, making them an indispensable part of special occasions.</p>

          <p>OnlyFans' owner, Leonid Radvinsky, received a substantial $701 million in dividends last year, as the popular subscription-based content platform, primarily known for adult content, positions itself for a potential multibillion-dollar sale. The UK-headquartered company reported a robust 9% increase in revenue, reaching $1.4 billion, and a 4% rise in pre-tax profit to $683.6 million during its 2024 financial year. This significant growth was fueled by a 13% increase in creator accounts, now totaling 4.6 million, and a 24% surge in fan accounts to 377.5 million, collectively generating $7.2 billion from subscribers. The impressive financial performance highlights the platform's considerable profitability and its expanding influence across a diverse range of content verticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has agreed to significantly reduce previously threatened high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, capping them at 15% as part of a newly detailed trade agreement. This decision eases earlier concerns that these sectors could face tariffs as high as 250%. A key condition of the deal stipulates that the EU must first enact legislation to eliminate its tariffs on all US industrial goods before the 27.5% tariff on European motor vehicle exports is lowered to 15%. While the agreement provides greater predictability for businesses and aims to stabilize the world's largest trading partnership, both sides expressed disappointment that wine and spirits were not granted tariff exemptions.

          <p>India's Supreme Court has temporarily halted its earlier directive for the widespread removal of stray dogs from New Delhi's streets, instead issuing a modified order. The new directive instructs civic bodies to capture stray animals for sterilization and immunization, releasing them afterward, with exceptions only for cases of rabies infection or aggressive behavior. Furthermore, the court has prohibited public feeding of stray dogs, mandating the establishment of designated feeding zones in municipal wards and warning of legal repercussions for non-compliance. This revised verdict follows significant protests from animal rights activists against the initial August 11 order, which was prompted by a surge in dog bite incidents, and aims to balance public safety with animal welfare while working towards a comprehensive national policy.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate for July registered 3.1%, marking its lowest level since March, yet still slightly exceeding economists' forecasts of 3%. This moderation was largely attributed to an easing in rice inflation, which declined to 90.7% after two consecutive months where prices had more than doubled. The "core-core" inflation rate, closely monitored by the Bank of Japan and excluding fresh food and energy, remained stable at 3.4%. Despite the overall cooling, this figure represents the 40th straight month that headline inflation has surpassed the Bank of Japan's 2% target, leading some analysts to criticize the central bank for being "behind the curve" in its approach to interest rate adjustments.

The new owners intend to infuse the club with core Sikh principles such as discipline, trustworthiness, and compassion, aiming to redefine the narrative of football ownership and cultivate broader community engagement. This event is celebrated as a highly visible example that promotes diversity and actively challenges existing barriers within the professional sports arena.</p>

          <p>A Bangkok court has acquitted former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of the charge of insulting the monarchy, a serious accusation related to a 2015 interview that carried a potential 15-year prison sentence. This verdict offers considerable relief to the influential Shinawatra family, especially as Thaksin's daughter, the suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn, faces her own Constitutional Court decision regarding her tenure. The court's decision hinged on a strict interpretation of Thailand's lese majeste law, concluding that Thaksin's remarks, which avoided naming specific members of the royal family, did not meet the criteria for an offense. This outcome is particularly noteworthy given the law's historically broad application, often criticized by human rights groups as a political instrument, and occurs two years after Thaksin's dramatic return from 15 years of self-imposed exile.</p>

          <p>The UK government is initiating a substantial crackdown on individuals who continue to claim child benefit while residing abroad, with an ambitious target of saving £350 million over the next five years. Under the new regulations, claimants will generally lose eligibility if they remain outside the UK for over eight weeks, except in specific exceptional circumstances. A specialized team, now significantly expanded to more than 200 investigators, will leverage international travel data to identify and halt payments to those no longer entitled. This effort builds upon a successful pilot program that already recovered £17 million by stopping incorrect payments to 2,600 people, forming part of a wider governmental strategy to combat rising benefit fraud observed since the pandemic.</p>

In response, Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif articulated a desire for expanded cooperation into aerospace, information technology, and infrastructure, while also pledging full efforts to safeguard Chinese nationals and projects from potential terrorist threats.

The judge concurred with environmental groups and a Native American Tribe, asserting violations of the National Environmental Policy Act and the risk of irreparable harm to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem.

This study also strengthens the 2018 research suggesting cattle were used as "beasts of burden" to help haul the enormous stones from Wales to Salisbury Plain, a journey estimated to take months.

Toyota clarified that its July price adjustments were part of regular, annual increases reflecting various operational costs, not a specific reaction to tariffs, despite estimating a substantial financial impact from them. Similarly, Honda asserted its ability to avoid passing tariff costs directly to its customers, attributing this to its high ranking on Cars.com's American-Made Index.
