          <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering supporting the use of weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound to address the global obesity epidemic, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where 70% of the over one billion obese individuals reside. The agency plans to issue new recommendations by August or September 2025, detailing how these medications can integrate into chronic care models that include lifestyle interventions. WHO experts are also evaluating whether to include GLP-1 drugs on the list of essential medications for obesity and type 2 diabetes, while advocating for cost-effectiveness studies across different income levels. This move reflects a shift towards incorporating pharmacological interventions alongside traditional methods for managing obesity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An increasing number of couples are choosing not to have children, influenced by factors such as high costs, career priorities, and concerns about climate change, leading to a decline in the U.S. fertility rate. Amy Blackstone, a sociology professor, notes that these couples prioritize their relationships and personal freedom, contrasting with the traditional expectation of parenthood. While some remain confident in their decision, others express occasional concerns about future family dynamics during holidays.

          <p>Apple plans to shift a significant portion of its iPhone production to India to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, according to CEO Tim Cook. He stated that a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will originate from India, while most iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods will be produced in Vietnam. Despite this shift, China will remain the primary manufacturing location for Apple products sold outside the United States. This strategic move aims to reduce the financial burden of tariffs, which could add $900 million to the company's costs in the upcoming quarter.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz has implemented a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban on such taxes. The tax, which applies to nonalcoholic drinks with added sweeteners and a high calorie count, aims to combat the consumption of sugary drinks. Proponents framed the initiative as a battle against the American Beverage Association, while opponents argue it unfairly burdens working families. The American Heart Association supports the tax, while the American Beverage Association warns of potential price increases for consumers. This move reignites the debate over soda taxes and their impact on public health and consumer costs.</p>

          <p>Governor Kathy Hochul of New York has proposed increasing the film tax credit to maintain competitiveness with states like New Jersey. New York households have collectively contributed billions in taxes towards entertainment productions since 2017, including popular series like "Billions" and "Saturday Night Live." As a new state budget agreement approaches, the potential increase in tax credits aims to attract more film and television productions to the state, boosting the local economy and creating jobs.

If successful, the lynx will be released to increase genetic diversity in the European lynx population, which has been fragmented by human development.</p>
