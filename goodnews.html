          <h2>China's Exports Grew Faster Than Expected in June Amid US Trade Truce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:09:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports saw a significant 5.8% year-over-year increase in June, surpassing market predictions and accelerating from May's growth. This surge is attributed to exporters rushing shipments during a 90-day tariff truce with the United States. Imports also unexpectedly rose by 1.1%, contrasting with forecasts of a decline and marking a sharp reversal from the previous month's contraction. The combined data resulted in a substantial trade surplus of nearly $114.8 billion for the month, indicating some short-term resilience in China's trade sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a powerful symbol for women's rights in France, has been named a knight of the Legion of Honor, the country's highest civilian award. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband, who drugged her and invited dozens of men to sexually assault her over a decade. Her case, which resulted in the conviction of her ex-husband and 50 accomplices, shocked the nation and sparked a national debate on sexual violence. Pelicot's advocacy was instrumental in the French Senate passing a bill to include lack of consent in the legal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 22:18:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, a significant reversal from the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, thereby avoiding a technical recession. The growth, which beat economists' forecasts, was largely driven by a strong 5.5% year-over-year expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of "significant uncertainty and downside risks" for the rest of the year, primarily due to unclear U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank has recently loosened monetary policy amid these global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market shows signs of slowing. In an interview, Bailey stated he believes the path for interest rates is "downward," citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases. This stance comes as the UK economy contracted slightly in May and after the government raised national insurance contributions for employers. The Monetary Policy Committee's next decision on the current 4.25% interest rate is scheduled for August 7. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels selected UC Santa Barbara right-handed pitcher Tyler Bremner with the second overall pick in the MLB draft, prioritizing immediate pitching needs. The choice was notable as Bremner has endured a difficult year, having lost his mother to breast cancer in June. He spoke about pitching for her and channeling his emotions into his on-field performance, which included a dominant second half of the college season. The Angels hope Bremner, known for his fastball and changeup, can develop quickly and contribute to their major league roster soon, continuing their strategy of fast-tracking top college talent.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in the academic priorities of Chinese students, who are increasingly choosing technology-focused university majors like information technology and vehicle engineering. This trend reflects a departure from popular fields of two decades ago, such as international trade and urban planning. The change is heavily influenced by China's state-driven push to bolster its technological capabilities amid intense competition with the United States. This strategic funneling of talent into engineering and tech disciplines is reshaping the landscape of higher education in the country to align with national industrial development goals.</p>
