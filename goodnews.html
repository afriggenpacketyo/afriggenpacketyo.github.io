          <p>Morgan Stanley has removed previous restrictions on cryptocurrency investments for its wealth management clients, now allowing all customers to access crypto funds regardless of their risk tolerance or asset level. This policy change, effective October 15, also permits these investments in retirement accounts. The firm will use an automated system to monitor client concentration in this volatile asset class, aligning with its global investment committee's recommendation of a maximum initial allocation of up to 4%. This move reflects a broader shift in the financial industry's approach to digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old man, Fayaz Khan, has been found guilty of threatening to kill Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. The conviction stems from a video Khan posted on TikTok in October of the previous year, in which he named Farage and made a threatening gun gesture with his hand. The verdict was delivered by a jury at Southwark Crown Court following deliberations. The case highlights the legal consequences of online threats directed at public figures.</p>

          <p>Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli is focusing on voter enthusiasm in South Jersey as a key strategy to overcome his Democratic opponent's lead in the polls. The opinion article suggests that if current polling is as inaccurate as in recent election cycles, Ciattarelli may already be ahead. A planned rally in Wildwood aims to energize his base, which is seen as crucial for driving turnout in the region's rural and exurban areas. The piece argues that Ciattarelli's positive, issue-focused campaign contrasts with his rival's negative tactics, potentially boosting his support.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reduced its list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair to five individuals following an extensive interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder. The administration is reportedly seeking a candidate who is open to new ideas about monetary policy and has broad experience in economics and management. A final decision is expected after Thanksgiving, with the nominee likely being appointed as a Fed governor first. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS has released its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year, a move designed to prevent "bracket creep." For 2026, the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly will increase to $32,200, while single filers will have a deduction of $16,100. These adjustments mean taxpayers will need to earn more income before being pushed into a higher tax bracket. The changes are influenced by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which made many 2017 tax cuts permanent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisor Identifies Over-Caution as a Major Pitfall for Young Investors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 08:05:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the biggest mistake young investors make is being overly cautious and prioritizing downside protection over potential upside. He argues that since young people have a long time horizon, they should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding significant amounts in cash or bonds. Historically, stocks have outperformed other asset classes over the long term, making them essential for building wealth and outpacing inflation. Brown recommends that new investors start with low-cost, broad-market index funds to achieve diversified exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Costco has quietly grown into a multibillion-dollar clothing retailer, with its annual apparel sales increasing by nearly 40% to $9.7 billion between 2019 and 2024. This sales volume surpasses that of established apparel retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch and Old Navy. The company's success is driven by offering popular brands such as Columbia and Gap alongside its private Kirkland Signature label. A key part of its appeal is the "treasure hunt" shopping experience, where customers may find opportunistic purchases of excess inventory, creating excitement and driving sales.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is now in effect in Gaza, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repositioning troops along newly established deployment lines.

The U.S. Central Command is setting up a coordination center in Israel with 200 personnel to monitor the agreement and facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, though no U.S. troops will enter the territory.</p>
