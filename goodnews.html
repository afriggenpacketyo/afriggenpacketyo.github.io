        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the origins of the seven-day week, tracing it back to the Bible and the commandment to work for six days and rest on the seventh. It contrasts this with historical attempts to alter the work week and modern cultural extremes of either escaping work or glorifying busyness. The article cites research showing the importance of both meaningful work and regular rest for productivity and overall well-being, referencing the concept of "job crafting" and studies on the productivity ceiling. Ultimately, the article argues that the biblical model of balancing work and rest offers a path to a fulfilling life.</p>
