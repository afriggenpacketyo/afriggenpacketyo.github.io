          <p>Shares for General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis saw a significant increase following a report that the Trump administration is considering tariff relief for vehicles produced in the United States. The potential policy change could eliminate many of the tariff costs currently paid by major car companies, rewarding those with final assembly operations in the U.S. According to the report, the changes might include extending a tariff offset and adding U.S. engine production to the relief measures, boosting investor confidence in the domestic auto industry.

          <p>Residents of Portland, Oregon, are actively pushing back against President Trump's characterization of their city as being "like living in hell." Using social media, they are showcasing Portland's tranquil side, including its lush hiking trails, vibrant food scene, and iconic bookstores, to counter the narrative of widespread chaos. This response comes as the president has ordered National Guard troops to the city based on his perception of unrest. Locals argue that the portrayal is a gross exaggeration and that the primary disturbance is from federal helicopters, not from protesters.</p>

In a public statement, the estate expressed that they had "no hesitation in agreeing to this association between two great artists" upon hearing the track. Swift's song, from her new album "The Life of a Showgirl," incorporates an interpolation of Michael's iconic melody.

The CEO of the PGA of America, Derek Sprague, personally apologized to McIlroy and his wife, Erica Stoll, who was hit by a beer cup. Comedian Heather McMahan, who served as an emcee, also apologized for participating in a profane chant directed at McIlroy. The incidents marred the event and prompted McIlroy to state that such behavior is unacceptable and that golf should be held to a higher standard.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actress Rose Byrne delved into her emotionally demanding role in the new film "If I Had Legs I’d Kick You." Byrne portrays a therapist and mother caring for a daughter with a severe eating disorder, a character she describes as walking a performance "tightrope" between tragedy and dark humor. The role required her to explore radical themes of maternal shame and failure, which has earned her critical acclaim, including a Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. The film focuses almost entirely on Byrne's character as she navigates a profound personal crisis.</p>

          <p>Wall Street saw the S&P 500 approach a new record close, though momentum slowed in afternoon trading as major tech stocks like Nvidia gave up earlier gains. Amid the broader market activity, Goldman Sachs raised its price target for Amazon, expressing strong confidence in the growth potential of Amazon Web Services (AWS) despite increasing competition. Analysts also highlighted Amazon's advertising business as another significant, and perhaps overlooked, profit driver, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's diverse revenue streams heading into the holiday season.

          <p>Two men have been charged with conspiracy after allegedly rigging poker games at two Southern California casinos and winning over $30,000. Authorities claim Vaagn Galustyan and Armin Martirosyan marked cards by bending the corners of high-value cards to give themselves an unfair advantage. The alleged cheating occurred at Pala Casino and Harrah's Casino, where security footage reportedly captured their method. The San Diego County District Attorney's office noted that while card marking is an old cheating technique, modern technology allows for its detection and prosecution.</p>

          <h2>Vinyl Records Exempt from New Tariffs Amid Taylor Swift Album Release</h2>

          <p>As Taylor Swift releases her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," a report highlights that physical music formats like vinyl records are protected from recent U.S. tariff rollbacks. A Cold War-era law known as the Berman Amendment exempts "informational materials" from such trade regulations, which is a significant benefit to the rapidly growing vinyl industry. While some American manufacturers argue that tariffs would support domestic production, the exemption helps keep consumer prices down for a market largely driven by younger buyers and high-profile releases from artists like Swift.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. For a $15,000 loan, current rates result in monthly payments that are marginally lower than they were earlier in the year. The article breaks down the costs for 10- and 15-year loan terms, comparing them to alternatives like personal loans and credit cards, which currently have significantly higher interest rates. It also advises borrowers to compare these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A controversial statue depicting President Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein holding hands has been reinstalled on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The statue was abruptly removed by U.S. Park Police less than 24 hours after its initial appearance, despite the artist group having a valid permit. The group, known as The Secret Handshake, recovered the damaged statue and successfully obtained a new permit for its display. The satirical piece, titled "Why Can't We Be Friends?", aims to highlight the past association between the two men.</p>

          <p>A video that circulated on social media showing former President Donald Trump announcing a new healthcare initiative involving "MedBeds" has been identified as a fake created using artificial intelligence. The video is part of a broader conspiracy myth claiming the existence of magical beds that can cure any disease, a theory popular in far-right online communities. Fact-checkers pointed to several signs of AI generation, including mismatched mouth movements and distorted features on figures in the video. The piece of disinformation was quickly debunked by journalists and media experts.</p>
