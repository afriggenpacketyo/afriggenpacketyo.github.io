          <p>Aryna Sabalenka, the world number one, began her French Open campaign with a decisive victory over Kamilla Rakhimova, winning 6-1, 6-0 in just one hour. Sabalenka demonstrated her dominance by winning nine consecutive games, showcasing her strong serving and powerful hitting. The three-time Grand Slam singles champion aims to improve upon her previous best performance at the French Open, a semi-final appearance in 2023. Sabalenka's performance justifies her position as one of the favorites to win the tournament and she is set to face either Jil Teichmann or Lucrezia Stefanini in the next round.

          <p>The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is under scrutiny, with the Trump administration seeking to narrow its definition of harm, potentially weakening habitat protection. This has prompted a debate among conservationists about shifting focus from individual species to protecting entire ecosystems directly. Proponents argue that ecosystem protection would be more efficient and could save a greater number of species. They suggest using existing classification systems to ensure sufficient protection for each type of American ecosystem. The article concludes that love for American landscapes is bipartisan, and protecting ecosystems would not necessarily mean outlawing all human use inside them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" is presented as an alternative to authoritative, authoritarian, and gentle parenting. This approach focuses on attuning to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without judgment, avoid shaming, and view misbehavior as a signal for support. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame. The goal is to create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves.</p>

The original draft referred to maintaining security in Northeast Asia and welcomed Chinese investment in disputed islands claimed by Japan, but these were removed from the final document. The released document urged Japan to "draw lessons from the atrocious crimes it committed" and be "cautious in its words and deeds" on historical issues, and distance itself from militarism.</p>
