          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:13:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are increasingly hard to qualify for due to higher interest rates and stricter lender requirements. Experts suggest that if denied, homeowners should first understand the specific reasons from the lender, which often relate to credit scores or high debt-to-income ratios. Improving one's financial profile by reducing debt and boosting credit scores can significantly increase approval odds. Alternative financing options include fixed-rate home equity loans, cash-out refinances, personal loans, or, for smaller projects, credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former city traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interbank interest rates. The court ruled that their trials were unfair due to misdirections to the jury, rendering the convictions unsafe after a decade-long legal battle. The men had maintained they were scapegoated for normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. This ruling could pave the way for other traders convicted in the UK to appeal their cases.</p>

          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, largely due to the strong performance of its digital gaming division. Revenue from its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming unit, featuring popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!, grew by 16%. This growth helped offset a 16% decline in its traditional consumer products segment, which has been negatively impacted by U.S. tariffs and changes in retailer ordering. Despite reporting a net loss attributed to a goodwill impairment, the company raised its full-year guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wide receiver George Pickens, recently traded to the Dallas Cowboys, expressed optimism about his new team, subtly criticizing his former team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. In comments from training camp, Pickens stated he was "definitely excited to run better plays," suggesting dissatisfaction with his previous offensive scheme. He also voiced enthusiasm about partnering with star receiver CeeDee Lamb, comparing their potential dynamic to the "Mario Bros." Pickens' arrival is expected to provide a significant new target for the Cowboys' offense and open up the passing game, offering a fresh start for the receiver.</p>

          <h2>New AI Tool 'Aeneas' Aims to Fill Gaps in Ancient Roman Inscriptions</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence system named Aeneas that can help historians analyze ancient Roman inscriptions by filling in missing text, dating them, and identifying their geographical origins. The tool works by drawing on a vast database of 176,000 inscriptions to find relevant parallels, automating a painstaking process that could take scholars years. While AI can introduce errors, tests showed that historians working in conjunction with Aeneas produced more accurate results than either could alone. This technology is seen as a potentially transformative assistant for historical research.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new feature in select U.S. cities that will allow women drivers and riders to request a preference for being matched with one another. The pilot program, starting next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, aims to enhance safety and comfort on the ride-hailing platform. While a match is not guaranteed, the tool is designed to increase the likelihood of women-to-women pairings. This initiative expands on a similar feature first introduced in Saudi Arabia in 2019 and addresses long-standing safety concerns surrounding sexual assault and harassment on ride-hailing apps.</p>

Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive cash management tool for large investors.

The ruling, prompted by a request from Pacific Island nations, emphasizes that states must cooperate to prevent climate harm and ensure their national targets reflect the highest possible ambition.

          <p>A concert at an Italian palace featuring renowned Russian conductor Valery Gergiev was abruptly canceled following a public outcry over his vocal support for President Vladimir Putin. Gergiev, who has faced similar cancellations at other prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall, has been criticized for not denouncing Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Opponents, including Yulia Navalnaya, widow of the late Russian opposition leader, argued that allowing him to perform helps legitimize the Kremlin's actions. The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the cancellation as "cultural censorship," while Italian officials have not commented publicly.</p>

          <p>Lenin's Mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square is experiencing a surge in visitors ahead of its scheduled closure for repairs, which will last until 2027. The tomb, which has housed the embalmed body of the Soviet Union's founder Vladimir Lenin since his death in 1924, has been a unique and controversial landmark. The renewed interest appears to be driven less by Soviet nostalgia and more by a "last chance" curiosity, as there has been ongoing debate for years about whether Lenin should finally be buried. It offers a final opportunity to witness a peculiar relic of a bygone era.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Barbados have rediscovered the Barbados threadsnake, the world's smallest-known snake, after it had not been seen for nearly two decades, raising fears it was extinct. The tiny snake, which can fit on a coin and grows to only four inches, was found under a rock in a small forest patch. This species is blind, burrows for termites and ants, and was first formally identified in 2008. The rediscovery is considered significant for local conservation efforts, as it highlights that important endemic species still exist on an island that has lost many others to extinction.</p>

Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, fought for years to clear her name, and her retrial began with prosecutors apologizing and asking the court to overturn the conviction.

The ranking, which weighted factors like affordability, health care, and safety based on retiree priorities, placed three other New England states in the top 10 as well. Traditional retirement destinations like Florida and Arizona did not make the top 10, as the study found that preferable weather often comes with high costs or lower safety ratings.
