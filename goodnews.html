          <p>This opinion article asserts that Beijing's decennial parade carries deep significance for Hong Kong and Macau, going beyond a simple display of power. It contends that the event functions as a potent declaration of profound national cohesion among the Chinese people, providing individuals with an emotional connection and a sense of alignment with the nation's destiny. The article urges a perspective shift from a Western-centric view to appreciate the parade's role in affirming national destiny, institutional resilience, and its relevance to the unique histories and contemporary situations of Hong Kong and Macau. It ultimately highlights the parade's function in fostering a collective identity and projecting strength in an increasingly complex global environment.</p>

          <p>Chicago Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw defended his decision to miss a crucial game with playoff implications to attend the funeral of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona. Shaw, who cited his strong faith and a personal connection with Kirk, stated he had no regrets despite the Cubs losing the game 1-0 and impacting their wildcard standing. The article notes that Shaw received support from his teammates and manager, but also drew criticism from some, including a Mets announcer, who found his absence unusual for reasons other than a family emergency during a competitive race. This event highlights the intersection of personal conviction and professional obligations in sports.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has successfully disrupted a vast telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area, which posed a serious threat to the city's telecom systems and the ongoing United Nations General Assembly meetings. Investigators discovered active SIM farms across multiple abandoned apartment buildings, containing over 100,000 SIM cards capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute and potentially disabling cell phone towers. Early analysis suggests the well-funded network was used by foreign governments, organized crime gangs, drug cartels, and human trafficking rings for encrypted communication. The disruption has eliminated an immediate threat to New York, though the investigation remains ongoing with potential arrests in the future.</p>

          <p>This article explores how China's successive five-year plans have profoundly influenced its economic trajectory since 1953, even as the nation transitioned away from a command economy. These foundational documents are credited with transforming China's nascent industrial capacity into the formidable "world's factory" and are now steering its strategic ambition to become a global innovation leader in advanced sectors. The article positions the 14 plans implemented over more than seven decades as a comprehensive historical record of China's complex economic evolution. The forthcoming 15th five-year plan is expected to be instrumental in advancing Beijing's high-level policy priorities and elevating the country's position in the global value chain.</p>

Playing out of his usual position as a lone striker, the 19-year-old academy graduate demonstrated significant value, particularly after Chelsea's recent defeats. The article highlights George's dedication, including extensive extra training with a personal coach since childhood, as a key factor in his unexpected rise. His impressive display offers manager Enzo Maresca a welcome attacking option and disrupts the typical "loan or sale" narrative for Chelsea academy prospects.</p>

          <p>Oregon state police believe they have identified the remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," a woman whose dismembered body parts were found along the Willamette River in 1946, making it the state's oldest unidentified victim case. The case, which went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence went missing, resurfaced thanks to the medical examiner's Human Identification Program. The remains were discovered under a headstone marked "Unknown Woman 1946" in a cemetery. Advanced forensic testing is now underway, offering hope to finally restore the victim's name and bring closure to a nearly 80-year-old mystery, which had garnered national attention for its grisly nature.</p>

The article emphasizes his unique dual reputation as both a staunch advocate for Chinese dissidents and a consistent proponent of continued engagement with Beijing.

          <p>California is moving to regulate the volume of streaming service commercials with Senate Bill 576, which prohibits ads from being louder than the programming they accompany. The legislation, awaiting the governor's signature, was spurred by consumer complaints, including a new mother whose baby was startled by blaring ads. While federal law (CALM Act) already regulates broadcast and cable TV ad volume, it doesn't cover streaming. The article notes that streaming industry groups initially opposed the bill due to control challenges, but changed their stance after an amendment removed individuals' ability to sue.

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are adopting an aggressive strategy, using Reform UK and its leader Nigel Farage as a central "call to action" to motivate activists and attract funding. Sir Ed Davey's speech at the party conference heavily referenced Farage, significantly more than other political figures, aiming to position the Lib Dems as the primary alternative to Reform. The article suggests this approach seeks to capitalize on a perceived opportunity to challenge Reform and Donald Trump, potentially drawing in disillusioned Conservative voters. Despite accusations of scaremongering and disputes over policy interpretations, the Lib Dems are buoyed by internal polling indicating a growing openness to their party.</p>
