        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with a vote on a tax bill containing President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts, border security, and defense spending, but internal disagreements persist, casting doubt on its passage. Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledges the need for further negotiations to address concerns over state and local tax deductions (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements. Conservative hardliners and moderates remain divided on these issues, while President Trump pressures Republicans to unite behind the bill. The legislation faces potential resistance in the Senate, adding urgency to address the debt limit by mid-July to avoid potential inability to pay bills.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reports that associates of President Trump and cryptocurrency entrepreneurs are re-entering the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) market. SPACs, which allow companies to go public quickly without a business plan, experienced a boom during the pandemic but faced scrutiny and investor losses. Key executives from Trump Media & Technology Group are involved in new SPAC deals, targeting cryptocurrency and blockchain companies. Brandon Lutnick, son of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is also active in the market, with Cantor Fitzgerald taking multiple SPACs public. These deals are attracting investors seeking quick gains in the crypto space, but they remain speculative and risky investments (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Spanish government has ordered Airbnb to remove nearly 66,000 listings from its platform due to violations of housing regulations, as reported in this New York Times article. The government aims to alleviate a severe housing crisis where rising prices outpace wages, pushing families from their homes. Consumer Affairs Minister Pablo Bustinduy emphasizes that the right to housing takes precedence over economic interests. Airbnb argues that the crisis stems from a lack of housing supply, while the government pursues measures to build affordable housing and curb foreign real estate investors. The move reflects broader European efforts to address housing affordability amid rising tourism and investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This CBS News article discusses borrowing options for homeowners with 100% home equity, noting that alternatives like home equity loans and HELOCs are attractive due to high interest rates on personal loans and credit cards. While lenders typically limit borrowing to 80-90% of a home's value, having 100% equity positions homeowners for better rates and terms. The choice between a HELOC and a home equity loan depends on individual preferences and the interest rate environment, with HELOCs offering variable rates and interest-only payments during the draw period, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed rates (not investment advice).</p>
