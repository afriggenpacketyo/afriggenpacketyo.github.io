Palantir reported adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues, with revenues rising 39% from the previous year.</p>

          <p>Amazon's Zoox robotaxi unit has issued a software recall for 270 vehicles following a crash in Las Vegas last month.

Research suggests that children who believe they have lived before often begin speaking at an early age and mention very specific memories.</p>
