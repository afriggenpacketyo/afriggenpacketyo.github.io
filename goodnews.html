          <p>Following the announcement that "Andor" received 14 Emmy nominations, creator Tony Gilroy reflected on the show's development and its unexpected parallels to current global events. The acclaimed "Star Wars" series, a political spy thriller, was nominated for outstanding drama series, writing, directing, and numerous technical categories. Gilroy described the experience of making the show as the "seminal creative experience" of his life and noted how real-world political events have been "spooky" in their resemblance to the show's narrative. He expressed pride in the cast and crew for creating a show that has resonated deeply with audiences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has signaled a significant policy shift by increasing military aid to Ukraine, with the Pentagon and NATO allies working to ship additional Patriot missile systems and other critical munitions. NATO is preparing "substantial military equipment packages," and sources indicate this will include 17 Patriot systems to bolster Ukraine's air defenses against Russian attacks. This move follows President Trump's meeting with NATO's Secretary General, where he confirmed the U.S. would facilitate the transfer of these systems. The renewed support comes as Russia continues its drone and missile bombardments of Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>An investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards has found that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves inadvertently breached rules by failing to declare gifts within the required 28-day period. Reeves had referred herself for the inquiry after realizing she had not registered tickets from the National Theatre on the register for Members of Parliament, having only listed them on the ministerial register. The commissioner accepted her apology and noted the failure was inadvertent, closing the inquiry. Reeves stated she has since implemented new procedures to ensure better communication and timely reporting between her teams.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced it will invest another $100 million into its AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, reinforcing its commitment to the rapidly advancing technology. The article also touches upon the strategic use of AI in other Amazon ventures, such as live sports on Prime Video. An executive shared an example of a failed AI experiment, the "Quarterback Quality Index," which was technically impressive but confusing to customers. This highlights the company's focus on developing customer-centric AI applications rather than pursuing technology for its own sake.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 11,700 people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan has improved, but opponents contend the country remains unsafe. The court's ruling provides a brief reprieve, pausing the termination for one week while it considers the case further. Advocacy groups praised the decision as a critical, though temporary, lifeline for Afghan families who would otherwise face deportation.</p>

Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, created when asteroid impacts eject rock from the planet's surface into space.
