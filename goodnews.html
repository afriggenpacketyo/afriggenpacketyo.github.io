          <p>The winning design for the Queen Elizabeth II memorial in London, created by Foster + Partners, includes a bridge with a translucent balustrade resembling the Queen's wedding tiara. The memorial, located in St. James Park near Buckingham Palace, will also feature statues of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, along with gardens dedicated to the Commonwealth and UK communities. Norman Foster emphasized the bridge's symbolism as a unifying force. The project, publicly funded and expected to cost approximately $62 million, has faced criticism regarding taxpayer expenses, especially given the substantial inheritance left to King Charles; the final design will be announced in April 2026, coinciding with what would have been Queen Elizabeth's 100th birthday month.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, announcing it achieved its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aims to cut an additional $1 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. CEO Raj Subramaniam highlighted the company's transformation initiatives focused on integrating networks and reducing costs. Despite the positive results, FedEx stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance that was slightly below Wall Street expectations. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, and U.S. ground home delivery volume rose by 10% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company, won a legal victory as a judge ruled that using legally purchased copyrighted books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law. The judge deemed this use "quintessentially transformative" and protected under fair use doctrine. However, Anthropic still faces a trial in December regarding the separate issue of downloading millions of pirated books, with internal documents showing employee concerns about the legality of using pirate sites. The lawsuit was filed by authors who claimed Anthropic's practices amounted to large-scale theft, although Anthropic has expressed satisfaction with the ruling.</p>

          <p>A heat dome is causing oppressive heat across the eastern half of the contiguous U.S., with heat warnings and advisories affecting nearly 160 million people. The phenomenon occurs when high pressure traps warm air near the surface, suppressing clouds and precipitation. Boston hit 100 degrees early Tuesday afternoon, and many parts of Pennsylvania experienced temperatures above 95 degrees. Experts warn that the extreme heat poses a particular risk to children and people with existing health issues, advising everyone to take precautions to stay cool and hydrated.</p>

          <p>China is closely monitoring the war between Israel and Iran due to its significant oil imports from Iran, which constitute approximately 90% of Iran's crude oil exports. Despite U.S. sanctions, China buys Iranian oil at a discounted rate, supporting the Iranian regime. This trade has fostered a close partnership between the two countries. China relies on a "dark fleet" of ships to transport Iranian oil, evading sanctions by relabeling the oil and using small, private refineries.</p>
