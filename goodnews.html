          <p>Meta is pursuing legal action against Joy Timeline HK Ltd., the developer of the CrushAI app, which uses AI to create nonconsensual, sexualized images of individuals. The lawsuit, filed in Hong Kong, aims to prevent Joy Timeline from advertising CrushAI on Facebook and Instagram, as the company repeatedly attempted to circumvent Meta's ad review process after initial removals. Meta is also updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify and remove similar ads, while sharing signals with other tech companies to address these apps across platforms. Senator Dick Durbin previously urged Mark Zuckerberg to address Meta's role in allowing ads that violate its standards. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that following a low-calorie diet may lead to negative mental health effects, including increased depressive symptoms, even among overweight individuals. The research, which analyzed nearly 29,000 adults, found that those on calorie-restrictive diets experienced a greater severity of depressive symptoms compared to those who did not follow a specific diet. Nutritionists caution against fad diets, emphasizing the importance of nutrient-rich whole foods for both physical and mental well-being. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also help people make long-term changes in their eating and improve their overall health. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a resurgence in the United States due to increasing electricity demand driven by AI models and the global push for cleaner energy. The U.S., once a leader in uranium production, now imports over 95% of its uranium feedstock. The Biden administration has banned Russian uranium imports and unlocked $2.7 billion in federal funding to expand domestic capacity. Experts note that even with increased domestic production, the U.S. will still rely on other countries for uranium, as its reserves are limited. </p>

As his daughter grows, their activities and conversations evolve, encompassing music, small businesses, and deeper discussions about the world.
