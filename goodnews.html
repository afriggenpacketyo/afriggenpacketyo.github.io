          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 07:38:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article debunks several false claims made by Donald Trump and amplified on social media regarding wind energy, such as the assertion that windmills are driving whales crazy. It presents scientific evidence showing no link between offshore wind activities and whale deaths, attributing whale strandings to boat strikes, entanglement in fishnets, and climate change. The article also addresses claims about windmills killing birds, clarifying that cats and building collisions are far greater threats to bird populations. Finally, the article clarifies that while wind turbine blades are sometimes buried in landfills, efforts are underway to improve recycling and repurposing of these materials. The article's neutral tone and reliance on factual evidence suggest a moderate optimism score.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is adopting a more aggressive stance in addressing antisemitism, initiating investigations, penalizing universities, and enhancing immigration enforcement. Harmeet Dhillon, the DOJ's assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, asserts that antisemitic behavior often outweighs First Amendment rights, citing violent rhetoric and actions against Jewish students. The administration's actions include freezing federal funding for Harvard and Columbia due to disruptive pro-Palestinian protests and scrutinizing non-citizen students accused of supporting Palestinian causes. Civil rights groups caution against overreach, while the DOJ emphasizes its commitment to enforcing federal civil rights laws and protecting Jewish communities. The article's tone is assertive, reflecting the administration's firm stance, resulting in a moderately optimistic score.</p>

          <p>A recent poll reveals that nearly half of Gen Z members feel planning for the future is "pointless," leading to a "YOLO mindset" and potential financial instability. Experts attribute this disillusionment to a tough labor market, debt concerns, and the ease of buying things with services like buy now, pay later. However, they emphasize that starting to invest early, even with small amounts, can yield significant benefits through compound interest.
