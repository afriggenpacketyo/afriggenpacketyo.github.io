          <p>George Clooney has made his Broadway debut, starring in an adaptation of "Good Night, and Good Luck," a story about journalist Edward R. Murrow's confrontation with Senator Joseph McCarthy.

The play highlights themes of truth, intimidation, and courage in the face of corporate media, echoing contemporary issues facing journalism. Clooney sees parallels between the play's historical context and today's media landscape, where governments may attempt to undermine the freedom of the press.</p>

          <p>A group of U.S. veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a psychedelic retreat organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, seeking relief from their combat-related trauma. The retreat involved traditional healers conducting ceremonies with psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT. Participants reported revisiting traumatic memories and experiencing emotional breakthroughs, though one veteran left due to a decline in mental health. The Veterans Administration is now conducting clinical trials using psychedelics to treat PTSD, with early results showing promise, although concerns remain about the safety and regulation of such treatments outside clinical settings.</p>
