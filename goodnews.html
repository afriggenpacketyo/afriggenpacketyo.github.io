          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a resurgence after a standstill during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for luxury cruises has increased, leading to record domestic passenger numbers and a boost to local economies that rely on tourism. Japanese shipping giants, such as NYK Line and Mitsui O.S.K Lines Ltd., are investing in cruise ships to generate stable income streams amid challenges in their core cargo businesses due to import tariffs. The industry anticipates further growth, with domestic passenger numbers expected to exceed 250,000 in 2025 and potentially approach the 2019 record high next year.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured a four-shot victory at the Memorial Tournament, joining Tiger Woods as the only repeat winners of the event. Scheffler's consistent performance and ability to avoid mistakes allowed him to maintain his lead throughout the tournament. Ben Griffin's late surge was ultimately thwarted by a double bogey on the 17th hole. Scheffler has now won three of his last four starts, further solidifying his position as the world's number one golfer. His performance has drawn comparisons to Jack Nicklaus, who noted Scheffler's ability to stay in position and capitalize on opportunities.</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete, competed in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) track-and-field finals, winning first place medals in both high jump and triple jump and placing second in the long jump event. The competition took place amid national scrutiny, including criticism from President Trump, and protests. The CIF implemented a policy change allowing an additional athlete to compete and earn a medal in events where a transgender athlete also qualified. The U.S. Department of Justice launched a Title IX investigation into transgender athlete participation in California high school sports.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing and returning her pardon. Hemphill stated that the pardons contribute to a false narrative and that those involved were guilty. She sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, and the Department of Justice has acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill's decision contrasts with other Jan. 6 defendants who have embraced their pardons and used them in legal arguments.</p>
