          <p>The health impact of common seed oils, such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, has become a subject of intense debate, fueled by claims from public figures like Health Secretary RFK Jr. that they are harmful. These oils are rich in linoleic acid, an omega-6 polyunsaturated fat that the body cannot produce on its own. While some critics argue that high consumption of these oils promotes inflammation, many nutrition researchers and major health organizations maintain that the evidence does not support these claims. They point to studies suggesting that, when substituted for saturated fats, these oils can be beneficial for heart health.</p>

In a television interview, Trump mentioned that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely. This development comes as the president has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell the app, with the current deadline set for September 17.</p>
