          <p>Top European business leaders are encouraging Europe to capitalize on recent economic volatility, expressing hope that the U.S.'s economic dominance is waning. Executives from companies like Unicredit and Goldman Sachs have told CNBC that Europe has a significant opportunity to attract capital inflows, as evidenced by recent data showing increased investment in European stocks. Private equity firms like Carlyle Group and Permira also see greater potential returns in Europe due to cheaper capital and lower valuations. While trade tensions remain a concern, particularly regarding a potential EU-U.S. trade deal, European leaders express optimism about finding solutions, and the future of Europe's economic revival lies in its own hands.</p>

          <p>Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, has announced that it will impose fines starting at ‚Ç¨500 on passengers whose disruptive behavior leads to their removal from a flight. The airline hopes that the fine will serve as a deterrent to eliminate unacceptable behavior onboard aircraft, as such disruptions are caused by a tiny number of unruly passengers. In addition to the fine, Ryanair will continue to seek civil damages for compensation for the costs incurred in more serious cases. The airline has amended its terms and conditions to allow fines to be taken directly from the card used to make the booking.</p>

          <p>Despite an invitation from President Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping is unlikely to attend the UN General Assembly in September, which would have been the earliest opportunity for a meeting between the two leaders. China will instead send Premier Li Qiang to represent the country at the event in New York, according to diplomatic sources. The bilateral relationship appears to have improved following a phone call between Xi and Trump on June 5, during which Trump said he had received and reciprocated an invitation to visit China. Observers in Washington believe a visit would significantly stabilize one of the most critical bilateral relationships in the world.</p>

          <p>Music legend Nile Rodgers emphasizes the importance of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, stating that it is the most important award for composers, and he contrasts it with the Grammys. The 2025 class of inductees includes music legends George Clinton and The Doobie Brothers, among others. Rodgers, who was inducted in 2016, describes composing as a solitary process, where ideas are transformed into something consumable by strangers. The 2025 Songwriters Hall of Fame induction will be held in New York City, honoring composers who have touched the lives of millions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously sided with a teenage girl with a rare form of epilepsy in a ruling that could make it easier for families to sue over access to education. The girl's family argued that her Minnesota school district failed to provide adequate accommodations, including instruction in the evening when her seizures are less frequent. Lower courts had ruled against the family, requiring them to show "bad faith or gross misjudgment" by school officials. The Supreme Court's decision lowers the legal standard, potentially increasing the number of lawsuits against schools.</p>

          <p>This article explains the differences between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, both common ways to invest in diversified baskets of stocks or bonds. ETFs trade like individual stocks with fluctuating prices, while mutual funds are priced at the end of the market day. Both can track benchmark indices or mimic specific sectors, but ETFs generally have lower expense ratios and no minimum investment thresholds. Investors should review a fund's prospectus to understand its objectives, risks, fees, and performance history. (not investment advice)</p>
