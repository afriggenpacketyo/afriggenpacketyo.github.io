          <h2>Archaeological Evidence Suggests Pompeii Was Re-inhabited After Vesuvius Eruption</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research indicates that people returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii after the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Experts believe that some survivors, unable to relocate, resettled the area, possibly joined by others seeking shelter. This challenges the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned after the disaster. Evidence suggests an informal settlement, akin to a camp, existed among the ruins until the 5th century, with inhabitants living in the upper floors of buried homes and salvaging valuable materials from the devastated city.</p>

This diplomatic effort comes as a U.S.-imposed deadline approaches for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face significant new sanctions. As part of the economic pressure, the White House has already imposed an additional 25% tariff on India for its continued purchases of Russian oil.</p>

This brings the company's total domestic investment commitment to $600 billion over four years. The announcement was made alongside President Trump, who stated the funds would support the reshoring of the Apple supply chain, including a new smart glass facility in Kentucky. The move comes as the administration threatens a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors, which Apple could avoid through increased U.S. manufacturing and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential returns for savers placing significant funds, such as $20,000, into a high-yield savings account. It highlights that while current rates are attractive compared to traditional savings, they are variable and subject to change with market conditions, making precise long-term earning calculations impossible. Using a sample rate of 4.35%, the article demonstrates that a saver could earn over $200 in three months and nearly $900 in a year, assuming rates remain stable. The piece advises savers to act sooner rather than later to capitalize on the current elevated rate climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of the potential earnings from a $10,000 deposit in either a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account. It explains that while current interest rates are similar for both, the key difference is that a CD's rate is fixed, whereas a money market account's rate is variable. Given the potential for future interest rate cuts, the article concludes that a CD currently offers a slightly higher and, more importantly, a guaranteed return over the six-month term. This makes it a more predictable option for savers prioritizing maximum earnings. (not investment advice)</p>
