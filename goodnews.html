        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the death of wrestling icon Hulk Hogan at age 71, this article reflects on five pivotal matches that cemented his legendary status and shaped the history of professional wrestling. His 1987 WrestleMania III victory over Andre the Giant, featuring the iconic body slam, is remembered as a pinnacle moment for the industry. Other defining bouts include his title-versus-title clash with The Ultimate Warrior at WrestleMania VI and his patriotic win against Sgt. Slaughter at WrestleMania VII. The list also highlights his shocking 1996 heel turn to form the nWo and the epic "Icon vs. Icon" match against The Rock at WrestleMania X8.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a landmark free trade agreement, a move expected to increase their bilateral trade by more than $34 billion annually in the long run. The deal, finalized after three years of negotiations, will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including British whisky and Indian textiles. Under the agreement, 99% of Indian goods exported to the U.K. will become tariff-free, while 92% of U.K. exports to India will see tariffs reduced or eliminated. Leaders from both nations hailed the pact as a strategic victory that will boost economic growth, lower consumer prices, and create jobs.</p>

          <h2>Wales to Introduce Debit-Style Cards for Gluten-Free Food in UK First</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 07:01:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a pioneering move within the UK, the Welsh government will provide pre-loaded debit-style cards to individuals with coeliac disease and other gluten-related conditions to help them purchase food. This new system offers an alternative to the existing prescription model, aiming to "de-medicalise" access to essential gluten-free products and provide patients with more choice and dignity. While the prescription option will remain, the card will be accepted in supermarkets, shops, and online stores. Advocates have praised the initiative for recognizing the significant extra cost of a gluten-free diet, which is a medical necessity, not a lifestyle choice.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions are poised to secure a series victory against Australia in their upcoming match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, a feat not achieved at this stage of a tour in 28 years. A win would give the Lions an insurmountable 2-0 lead in the three-test series, a rare accomplishment in the team's modern history. While the Lions are heavily favored, they face a Wallabies team determined to rebound from their previous defeat, bolstered by the return of key players like Will Skelton. The match is set to be a high-intensity affair, with players on both sides recognizing the historic magnitude of the occasion.</p>

          <p>A movement to eliminate artificial food dyes from American products is gaining traction, with the U.S. dairy industry recently pledging to remove them from ice cream by 2028. This follows pressure from health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" initiative, which links these additives to health issues like hyperactivity in children. While most public health advocates support the move, food manufacturers face challenges in switching to natural colorings, which can be less stable and more expensive. The transition raises questions about consumer acceptance, as Americans have historically preferred the vibrant hues of artificial dyes, unlike their European counterparts.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant and rapid decline in its murder rate, which is on track to reach its lowest point since the 1960s. This positive trend follows a spike in violent crime during the pandemic, with cities like Baltimore seeing their fewest homicides in decades. Analysts suggest a combination of factors, including a massive influx of federal funding for violence reduction programs and community services, has contributed to the drop. However, this progress is now at risk as the Justice Department has canceled nearly a billion dollars in grants for these programs, leaving many to fear a potential resurgence in violence.</p>

          <p>Trey Parker, the co-creator of "South Park," issued a sarcastic apology for a recent episode that depicted President Donald Trump in a controversial scene with the character Satan. The episode, which opened the show's 27th season, drew a sharp rebuke from the White House, which called the long-running satirical show irrelevant. The episode also satirized the recent merger involving parent company Paramount Global and its legal settlement with Trump, leading to speculation about corporate pressures. Despite the controversy, Parker revealed that the creators resisted network requests to censor parts of the provocative scene.</p>

          <p>With skin cancer cases rising, understanding sunscreen is crucial for public health, yet misinformation online creates confusion. Sunscreens work by using either organic (carbon-based) molecules that absorb UV radiation or mineral (zinc or titanium oxide) particles that physically block it, with both being effective at preventing skin damage. While some concerns have been raised about certain long-used chemicals being absorbed into the bloodstream, scientists emphasize that the dose makes the poison and the benefits of using sunscreen far outweigh the potential risks. Experts also warn against DIY sunscreens, as proper formulation is a complex process essential for ensuring stable and effective protection.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8 billion merger between Skydance Media and entertainment giant Paramount Global. The decision came shortly after Paramount settled a $16 million legal dispute with President Donald Trump. The FCC's approval, led by Trump-appointed chairman Brendan Carr, was granted after Skydance committed to making significant changes at Paramount's subsidiary, CBS, including installing an ombudsman to address bias and ending diversity initiatives. The 2-1 vote was contentious, with the dissenting commissioner arguing that Paramount capitulated to political pressure and that the public will ultimately pay the price.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer club Los Angeles FC is reportedly targeting Tottenham Hotspur's captain, Son Heung-min, and has made its interest known to the Premier League club. While no formal bid has been made, one is expected, which could present a significant decision for the 33-year-old South Korean star, who has one year remaining on his contract. Son's future at Tottenham is uncertain under new manager Thomas Frank, who has not guaranteed the forward will stay or retain the captaincy. LAFC has a recent history of signing high-profile players from Spurs, having acquired goalkeeper Hugo Lloris in late 2023.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at its upcoming meeting, despite escalating pressure from President Donald Trump to implement sharp cuts. Trump argues that high rates are hurting American families and businesses, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that uncertainty from the administration's tariff policies has prevented rate reductions. Maintaining the current rate affects consumer finances, keeping borrowing costs for credit cards and loans high while offering better returns on savings accounts. Economists note that many consumer rates, like mortgages, are not directly tied to the Fed's benchmark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer is experiencing a significant decline in home-field advantage, with home teams' win percentages dropping to levels comparable with top European leagues. This shift is viewed not as a sign of decline, but as an indicator of the league's maturation and increased competitiveness. Historically, factors like vast travel distances, varied playing surfaces, and officiating bias gave MLS home teams a stark edge. Now, improved travel logistics, the implementation of VAR for more accurate refereeing, and more sophisticated away-game tactics have leveled the playing field, suggesting MLS is evolving into a more balanced and globally respected championship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago found that while people generally prefer interacting with extroverted robots, they find neurotic robots to be more human-like and relatable. In an experiment where participants interacted with a robot greeter, the extroverted version was rated as more enjoyable, but the neurotic one, which expressed anxiety and tentativeness, was often described as understanding deep emotions. This research challenges the industry's overwhelming focus on creating confident, assertive robots. The findings suggest that incorporating traits like neuroticism could make robots more relatable in certain contexts, though it may not be desirable for tasks requiring high confidence, like autonomous driving.</p>
