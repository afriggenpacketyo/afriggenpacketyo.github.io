          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, which includes a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese goods imported into the U.S. The agreement also imposes a 40% tariff on products transshipped through Vietnam to circumvent other trade barriers, a practice allegedly used by China. In exchange, the U.S. will gain tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets, a significant shift from the previous 46% blanket tariff threat. The deal's implementation details remain unclear, but it raises concerns among critics about potential price increases for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is planning a large-scale effort to combat the New World Screwworm by air-dropping millions of sterilized male flies over parts of Texas and Mexico. This biological control method involves releasing irradiated flies that mate with wild females, whose eggs then fail to hatch, causing the pest population to decline over time. The initiative follows a recent outbreak in Mexico that led the U.S. to suspend livestock imports from its southern border in May. The flesh-eating larvae of the screwworm fly pose a significant threat to livestock and can also affect humans.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's directive aimed at severely restricting access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president does not have the unilateral authority to supplant immigration laws enacted by Congress. The ruling sided with immigrants' rights groups who argued that the plan, a key part of the administration's hardline immigration agenda, was unlawful. The judge's order has been temporarily stayed for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal the decision to a higher court.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill to significantly boost the state's film and television tax credit program, increasing its annual cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is intended to make California more competitive with other states and countries that offer lucrative incentives, thereby luring back productions and jobs to Hollywood. Industry leaders and unions have praised the increase as a vital step to stimulate production, which has slowed due to strikes, studio spending cuts, and other factors. A related bill is also under consideration to further expand the program's eligibility and credit percentages.</p>

          <p>As rising home values make Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) more appealing, this article highlights several potential fees that can increase the overall cost of borrowing. Beyond the interest rate, consumers should be aware of charges such as application and processing fees, appraisal costs, and annual maintenance or inactivity fees. Additional costs can include closing costs similar to a mortgage, early termination penalties if the line of credit is closed too soon, and transaction fees for accessing funds. Borrowers are encouraged to compare offers from multiple lenders to find options with minimal or waived fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent discovery by NASA's Curiosity rover offers new insight into why Mars is uninhabitable, suggesting it was always destined to be a mostly desert world. The rover found rocks rich in carbonate minerals, which trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a key element for planetary warming. Unlike Earth, which has a balanced climate cycle involving volcanic activity, Mars's feeble volcanic outgassing was insufficient to replenish its atmospheric CO2. This imbalance meant that any periods of liquid water on Mars were likely brief, sporadic oases, followed by millions of years of barren, cold conditions inhospitable to life.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from ending the program in September, stating the agency lacks the authority to vacate a TPS designation before its previously established expiration in February 2026. The judge noted that migrants had enrolled in schools, taken jobs, and started medical treatments in reliance on the program's continuation. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, arguing that TPS was never meant to be a permanent program.</p>

          <p>Amid a severe heat wave in Europe, the European Commission has proposed a target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. The plan is a step toward achieving climate neutrality by 2050 but includes a controversial flexibility clause allowing member states to use international carbon credits to offset up to 3% of their emissions. Environmental activists have criticized this clause, arguing it allows heavy polluters to avoid making necessary domestic investments in decarbonization. The proposal faces resistance from some member states who find the target too ambitious, setting the stage for difficult negotiations.</p>
