          <p>Two tomato brands have been recalled across 14 states due to potential salmonella contamination, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Ray & Mascari Inc. recalled tomatoes sold in 11 states after being notified of potential contamination at Hanshaw & Caping Farms. Williams Farms Repack LLC also recalled tomatoes sold to wholesalers in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia. While no illnesses have been reported, the FDA advises consumers to discard or return the affected tomatoes to prevent potential health risks associated with salmonella, which can cause fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for overpayments from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, following concerns that full clawbacks would cause severe financial strain. This change applies to new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25, while the withholding rate for Supplemental Security Income benefits remains at 10%. Experts warn that even a 50% reduction in benefits can still lead to devastating consequences for beneficiaries who rely on these payments for essential needs. The Alliance for Retired Americans emphasizes that overpayments are often not the fault of the beneficiaries and they should not suffer hardship due to administrative errors.</p>

This trend suggests a shift towards more holistic mental health care, with greater accessibility and awareness of the benefits of talk therapy.

          <p>The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued a warning about criminals impersonating IT help desk personnel to breach organizations after recent cyber attacks on British retailers like Marks & Spencer and Co-op. The NCSC advises companies to review their IT help desk password reset processes and authentication methods for staff members, particularly senior employees. Cyber security experts recommend implementing code words and multiple layers of security to prevent social engineering attacks. The NCSC's advice suggests that the hackers are using tactics associated with the cyber criminal group Scattered Spider.</p>
