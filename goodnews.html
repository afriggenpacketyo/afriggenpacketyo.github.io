          <h2>CNBC Survey Predicts Fed Rate Cuts Amid Stagflationary Economic Outlook</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 11:27:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CNBC survey of fund managers, analysts, and economists indicates that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates later this year and in 2026 in response to a stagflationary economic forecast, which includes higher inflation and unemployment, along with increased recession odds. The survey respondents anticipate the fed funds rate declining to 3.71% by year-end and 3.36% by the end of 2026. Despite concerns about tariffs and their impact on prices, the majority believe the Fed will prioritize addressing economic weakness. However, some analysts suggest that these cuts could mean the Fed abandoning its 2% inflation target, while others remain optimistic about economic growth rebounding in 2026.

          <p>A new study suggests that getting a shingles vaccine may lower the risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart failure, for up to eight years. The study, which analyzed data from over 1 million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events in those who received the vaccine. The protective effect was particularly prominent in men, people under 60, and those who smoke or are inactive. Experts suggest the vaccine's impact on heart health is related to reducing inflammation caused by the infection.</p>
