          <h2>EU Considers Standardizing Airline Baggage Rules Amid Passenger Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 19:00:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EU is considering new laws to standardize carry-on baggage sizing for EU airlines, prompted by widespread passenger confusion and inconsistent baggage rules among budget airlines. Proposed rules would guarantee one free personal item of specific dimensions, including wheels and handles, that can fit under a plane seat. The move comes after numerous complaints about unexpected fees for bags deemed too large, leading to calls for fairer and more consistent regulations. While some airlines argue that baggage policies keep fares low, consumer groups believe the proposals don't go far enough and legitimize charging for reasonably sized hand luggage. The goal is to reduce disputes and provide clarity for passengers traveling to and from EU destinations. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 19:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK doctors are trialing 'poo pills,' containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, as a novel approach to eliminate antibiotic-resistant superbug infections. The pills aim to replace harmful gut bacteria with a healthy mix, potentially flushing out superbugs that resist antibiotics. Early data suggests this method can effectively clear superbugs from the bowel, reducing the risk of infections spreading elsewhere in the body. This research offers a promising alternative to traditional antibiotic treatments, addressing the growing concern of antibiotic resistance. The trial results indicate a positive shift in understanding the role of bacteria in overall health. </p>

          <p>Chinese officials are rushing to comply with President Xi Jinping‚Äôs austerity orders, ensuring their offices are modest and their spending is in order as inspectors conduct checks. The campaign, ongoing since 2012, aims to improve the Communist Party‚Äôs image, stamp out corruption, and cut wasteful spending. Analysts suggest this also ensures resources are wisely spent to compete with the United States and identifies loyal cadres for promotion. Questions remain about the campaign's effectiveness due to strict media control and the difficulty of enforcing detailed rules on a large scale. The measures reflect the government's focus on efficiency and political control. </p>

The article argues that the focus should have been on the athletes who transformed the state competition into the best in the country, such as Giselle Fernandez, Khaliq Muhammad, and the Herbst twins.

The department will reallocate staff to better meet needs in the changing landscape. The ability to pay players directly could help UCLA in ways that go beyond compensating its athletes.
