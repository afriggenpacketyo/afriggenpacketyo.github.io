          <p>Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis is spearheading a major effort to revitalize the Stellantis-owned truck brand, which has seen its sales drop significantly since 2019. The comprehensive plan includes reintroducing popular Hemi V-8 engines, launching new marketing campaigns, returning to NASCAR, and offering an industry-leading powertrain warranty. Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, aims to reclaim a substantial portion of the full-size pickup market from competitors like GM and Toyota. The strategy focuses on addressing past production issues and rebuilding trust with dealers to restore the brand's profitability and market position.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has adjusted his government's welfare reform plans following significant pressure from within his own Labour Party. The original bill aimed to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to reduce costs, but faced a rebellion from about 120 MPs. In a concession, the stricter criteria will now apply only to new claimants, not the 3.7 million existing recipients. While this has satisfied some backbenchers, a faction of MPs on the party's left still plan to vote against the bill, highlighting ongoing internal divisions over the government's approach to disability benefits and social welfare.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock has continued its strong performance, rising for a fifth consecutive day and reaching new record highs, solidifying its position as the world's most valuable company. The surge comes as investors largely dismiss concerns over U.S. export controls on advanced chips to China, focusing instead on the immense demand for Nvidia's AI processors. CEO Jensen Huang has highlighted robotics as the next major growth area for the company, aiming to power billions of robots and autonomous vehicles in the future. Analysts at Wedbush predict Nvidia's market capitalization could reach $4 trillion this summer, reflecting strong confidence in its continued dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld a critical component of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), ensuring that approximately 150 million Americans continue to receive free preventive health services. In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the body that determines which services, like cancer screenings and HIV-prevention drugs, insurers must cover at no cost. The lawsuit was brought by businesses with religious objections to covering PrEP drugs. This ruling is a major victory for public health advocates who argued that striking down the provision would have devastating health consequences for the nation.</p>

Another innovation will permit camera operators to enter the field to capture close-up footage of goal celebrations.

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has affirmed the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Universal Service Fund. This multi-billion-dollar program, supported by fees from telecom carriers, subsidizes phone and internet access for rural communities, low-income households, schools, and libraries. The challenge, brought by a conservative group, argued that Congress had unlawfully delegated its legislative power to the FCC. However, the court's majority opinion, written by Justice Elena Kagan, found the funding mechanism to be a legitimate exercise of agency authority, preserving a key tool for expanding national telecommunications infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. stock indexes surged to record highs, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite surpassing their previous peaks. The market rally is fueled by investor optimism following signs of progress in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, as well as expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. President Trump's announcement of a signed trade agreement with Beijing, though details remain sparse, has helped calm fears over tariff policies that had previously driven the market down. Despite the positive momentum, some analysts caution against complacency, warning that trade-related volatility could still pose a risk to financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. consumers are increasingly embracing a trend of "revenge saving" as concerns about inflation, tariffs, and market volatility lead them to cut back on spending. The personal saving rate has risen sharply this year, reaching 4.5% in May, a significant increase from 3.5% in December. This shift away from post-pandemic splurging is evident in social media trends like "no buy" challenges and a renewed focus on building emergency funds. Financial experts note that workers are also contributing more to their 401(k) plans, indicating a broader move towards long-term financial security in an uncertain economic climate.

His victory in the primary, where he defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo, signals a significant progressive shift in the city's politics.

The article notes that while Mamdani is a vocal critic of Israeli government policies and supports the BDS movement, his positions do not align with codified definitions of antisemitism and he has a history of working with Jewish politicians. Claims that he wants to implement Sharia law are contradicted by his progressive platform, which includes strong support for LGBTQIA+ rights and reproductive freedom.</p>

Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but his deal is believed to contain exit clauses. Russell's comments imply his own contract negotiations are being influenced by Mercedes' pursuit of the Dutch driver. A move could be attractive for Verstappen due to Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' potential advantage with the new engine regulations taking effect in 2026, creating significant speculation in the F1 paddock.</p>
