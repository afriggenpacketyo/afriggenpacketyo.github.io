          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing tremors felt across the New York metropolitan area. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake originated at a depth of about 6.2 miles. While the tremor was mild and much weaker than a 4.8-magnitude quake that struck the region in 2024, it prompted a flurry of social media activity. New York City's emergency management confirmed there were no immediate reports of significant impacts or damage from the event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's campaign promises, his administration has been reluctant to release documents from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, but several ongoing legal cases may force their disclosure. A public records lawsuit filed by Radar Online is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's refusal to release over 10,000 pages of documents. Additionally, civil litigation involving Epstein's victims and the Justice Department's own request to unseal grand jury transcripts could weaken the government's arguments for secrecy. These legal pressures offer hope for transparency regarding Epstein's crimes and his connections to powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully developed a new cryogenic steel, named CHSN01, designed to withstand the extreme conditions inside a nuclear fusion reactor. This breakthrough material addresses a critical challenge faced by the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, where existing materials proved too brittle. The new super steel can endure both the ultra-low temperatures near absolute zero and the immense magnetic forces generated during fusion. This development places China in a leading position in advanced materials science and is a significant step toward achieving viable fusion power.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old CEO of design software company Figma, has become a tech billionaire following his company's successful stock market debut. A former Brown University student and Thiel Fellow, Field co-founded Figma, which has become a leader in web-based design tools. The company's valuation soared to over $71 billion after its IPO, a significant turn of events after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory concerns. Colleagues describe Field as a humble leader, contrasting him with more famously aggressive tech personalities.</p>

          <p>The Ultra High Net Worth Institute has created the "Wealthesaurus," a crowdsourced guide aimed at defining and standardizing over 80 common terms in the wealth management industry. The initiative seeks to combat misleading marketing hype and reduce confusion for wealthy investors navigating a complex financial landscape. The guide provides clear definitions for frequently misused phrases like "multifamily office" and distinguishes between terms such as "assets under management" and "assets under advisement." This effort aims to promote transparency and empower clients to make more informed decisions about their financial advisors.</p>

          <h2>Advanced DNA Testing Offers New Hope in Solving 1991 Austin Yogurt Shop Murders</h2>

          <p>There is renewed hope for solving the brutal 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, thanks to advances in DNA technology. A male DNA profile was recovered from one of the victims, but for years it did not match any suspects, including two men who were convicted and later exonerated. A potential match found in an anonymous FBI database in 2017 was later ruled out after more advanced testing. However, investigators still possess the original DNA sample and are hopeful that future scientific improvements will finally identify the killer and bring closure to the 30-year-old cold case.</p>

          <p>Engineers at China's Zhejiang University have developed the "Darwin Monkey," the world's first brain-like computer composed of over two billion artificial neurons. This new system, built with 960 domestically produced Darwin 3 neuromorphic chips, represents a significant advancement in brain-inspired computing. The university announced that the Darwin Monkey has already been used to perform complex tasks such as logical reasoning, content generation, and mathematical problems. This achievement marks a major step toward creating more advanced, human-like artificial intelligence and solidifies China's position in the field.</p>

          <p>UCLA's new offensive coordinator, Tino Sunseri, is tasked with quickly integrating transfer quarterback Nico Iamaleava into the Bruins' system ahead of the season opener. Sunseri has a strong track record of success with new quarterbacks at his previous coaching stops, including James Madison and Indiana. He praises Iamaleava's self-driven nature and relentless work ethic, noting that his primary role is to provide information and keep the talented quarterback mentally stimulated. The offense aims to be physical, with a strong running game, while stretching the field to challenge every part of the opposing defense.</p>

          <p>Dan Ardell, who had a brief but memorable stint with the Los Angeles Angels in 1961, looks back on a life defined not by baseball but by what came after. Though he is noted for getting a walk-off loss-inducing single in his first at-bat, Ardell quickly realized professional baseball was not his passion and retired at 23. He went on to a successful career in real estate and asset management, finding purpose in philanthropy and family. Ardell's story is one of recognizing that a childhood dream isn't always the right path and finding greater satisfaction in making a positive difference in the lives of others.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler, known for his dominant but stoic on-course demeanor, is receiving praise for his comedic cameo in the new movie "Happy Gilmore 2." The article suggests that while Scheffler's consistent excellence can sometimes lack drama for viewers, his self-effacing performance in the film presents a more fun and relatable personality. In the movie, he humorously plays off his real-life arrest earlier this year. This appearance is seen as a positive step for his public image and for golf, making one of its top stars more engaging to a wider audience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As major donors like the United States and the United Kingdom cut their foreign aid budgets, a few countries, including Spain, Ireland, South Korea, and Italy, are increasing their spending. This move comes as the global development funding gap is projected to reach $56 billion, threatening progress on health and stability worldwide. Spain has committed to more than doubling its aid budget by 2030, a decision rooted in long-standing public support. This shift could lead to a new, more collaborative and less paternalistic model for foreign aid, potentially giving recipient nations a greater voice in how assistance is delivered.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study led by Chinese and Canadian researchers suggests that seismic activity may be a key energy source for microbial life in Earth's deep, dark biosphere. This vast, hidden ecosystem is estimated to contain up to one-fifth of the planet's total biomass. The research provides a potential answer to how these isolated microbes survive without sunlight or nutrients from the surface. By analyzing geological processes, the scientists propose that the energy released during earthquakes can trigger chemical reactions that sustain these deep-earth life forms, expanding our understanding of life's resilience in extreme environments.</p>
