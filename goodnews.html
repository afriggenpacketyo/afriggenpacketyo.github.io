          <p>Tesla has begun accepting orders in China for a new, longer-range version of its Model 3 electric vehicle, priced at a 14% premium over the basic edition. The new variant boasts an extended driving range of 830km, a high-performance battery from LG Energy Solution, and a more powerful single motor. This launch comes as Tesla faces intensified competition in the Chinese market, with its local deliveries having declined in July compared to the previous year. The company aims to bolster its position in the premium EV segment with this enhanced offering, with deliveries scheduled to start next month.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 06:59:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In its first quarterly earnings report as a public company, stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group announced a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million. The strong performance was primarily driven by the growth of its USD Coin (USDC), the world's second-largest stablecoin. Despite the revenue jump, the company reported a significant net loss of $482.1 million, which it attributed to non-cash IPO-related charges for stock-based compensation and debt value adjustments. Following the announcement, Circle's shares saw a notable increase of over 7% in premarket trading, reflecting investor confidence in its core business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 06:59:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer inflation rate dropped for the ninth consecutive month, reaching 1.55% in July, its lowest point since June 2017 and below analysts' expectations. The decline was largely attributed to a decrease in food price growth, providing the Reserve Bank of India with potential room for a more lenient monetary policy. This development comes as India's economy faces challenges from U.S. tariff policies. The central bank recently maintained its interest rate at 5.5% and projected a benign inflation outlook for the fiscal year, though economists note that potential U.S. tariffs could complicate future policy decisions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, according to the latest official figures, which show a 5.8% drop in job openings between May and July. This decline, observed across most industries, brings vacancies to their lowest level since early 2021, outside of the pandemic period. Despite the slowdown and a slight dip in payroll numbers, average wage growth remained steady at 5%, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%. Economists suggest the cooling is gradual, potentially indicating that the labor market is stabilizing after recent increases in business taxes and the minimum wage. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Presidents Trump and Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, the state's history as a former Russian territory provides a unique backdrop. Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million, a decision driven by financial strain following its defeat in the Crimean War and the declining profitability of the region's fur trade. The territory was seen as a liability, and the sale was a strategic move to raise funds and avoid potential conflict with Britain. Initially ridiculed in the U.S. as "Seward's Folly," the purchase later proved to be a historic bargain with the discovery of gold and oil, transforming the territory into a resource-rich state.</p>

          <p>A new report from Bankrate highlights the significant financial penalty associated with poor credit, termed a "subprime tax." Americans with credit scores of 620 or below pay an average of $3,400 more per year in higher interest rates for products like mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, as well as increased insurance premiums. Over a 30-year period, this financial burden can accumulate to over $100,000, underscoring the long-term value of maintaining a good credit score. The article suggests that improving one's score, even to the mid-700s, can lead to substantially better financial terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old springer spaniel named Maple is assisting researchers at Michigan State University by sniffing out a deadly bacterial disease in honeybee colonies. Maple, a former human remains detection dog, was trained to identify American foulbrood, a disease that kills honeybee larvae and can devastate entire hives. This work is critical as bee populations face threats from disease, pesticides, and climate change. Dressed in a custom yellow protective suit, Maple's unique skills are helping to create a new, non-invasive method for diagnosing the disease, with the goal of developing a guidebook to train other dogs for similar work.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece counters the argument that Los Angeles should withdraw from hosting the 2028 Olympics, labeling it a "bad idea." The author defends LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman's recent cordial appearance with President Trump as a necessary act of diplomacy for the good of the city and the Games. The article recalls the historical success of the 1932 and 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, which both overcame significant global challenges and produced financial profits that benefited the local community. The author urges Angelenos to rise above political divisions and support the event, emphasizing that the focus should be on the athletes and the city's proven ability to host a successful Games.</p>

          <p>The band Good Charlotte has made a comeback with a new album, "Motel Du Cap," inspired by their performance at the high-profile wedding of Sofia Richie and record executive Elliot Grainge. The event, described as a family affair as frontman Joel Madden is Richie's brother-in-law, reignited the band's creative fire. Now signed to Atlantic Records, where Grainge is CEO, the band is returning amidst a broader pop-punk revival. The Madden brothers, now 46, reflect on their changed priorities, with the new music exploring themes of family and devotion, a shift from the angst of their early-2000s hits.</p>

          <p>This article explores the methods used by several Emmy-nominated television shows to prevent major plot twists from leaking to the public. For series like 'Paradise' and 'The Diplomat,' creators employed strategies ranging from redacting the final pages of scripts for everyone except key actors to meticulous planning that built confidence in execution. In the case of 'Only Murders in the Building,' the return of a major star was kept under wraps with the enthusiastic cooperation of the actor himself. These efforts highlight the increasing difficulty and importance of preserving narrative surprises for audiences in an age of constant online chatter and spoilers.</p>

          <p>This profile explores the world of Josephine Lee, the multi-hyphenate model and artist known by her internet alias, Princess Gollum. Lee explains that the moniker was created to merge the "princess-like" and "darker, more complicated" sides of her identity, allowing for a more extreme and experimental form of self-expression online and in her creative work. She discusses how her avant-garde style, often punctuated by large, goggle-like sunglasses, functions as both a creative statement and a form of armor in public. As she has matured, Lee feels her style has become more refined and comfortable, reflecting a new, more balanced phase in her life and career.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their tariff truce for an additional 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation in their trade war. President Trump's executive order acknowledged that China was taking steps to address U.S. concerns, a sentiment echoed by Beijing. This extension keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods at 10%, providing more time for negotiations on complex issues like trade deficits, supply chains, and technology exports. Analysts suggest this move stabilizes the situation for consumers and businesses and could pave the way for a leadership summit between the two presidents later in the year.</p>

          <p>According to Swiss bank UBS, global investors are increasingly turning to China's $25 trillion domestic bond market as an alternative to U.S. dollar-denominated assets. This shift is part of a broader "de-dollarisation" trend, with institutional investors like central banks and pension funds leading the way. Foreign holdings of yuan-denominated bonds reached $587 billion by the end of May, rebounding from a low in 2023. Beijing has been actively simplifying procedures for foreign investment to attract more capital, and major global bond indices have been incorporating Chinese bonds, further integrating the market into the global financial system.

          <p>President Trump has indicated he would be open to allowing Nvidia to sell a less powerful version of its most advanced AI chip, the Blackwell system, to the Chinese market. Speaking at a press conference, Trump suggested a deal could be made if the chip's performance was reduced by 30% to 50%. This development follows a recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. The move could represent a shift in the U.S. chip export policy, which has previously blocked Nvidia's most powerful semiconductors from being sold to China.</p>

This deal secures the long-term future of the club, which has struggled financially and finished at the bottom of the league for the past three seasons.
