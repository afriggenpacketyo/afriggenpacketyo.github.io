          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to open higher this week, showing resilience despite recent volatility driven by concerns over bad loans in the U.S. banking sector. Key indices such as the U.K.'s FTSE, Germany's DAX, and France's CAC 40 are all projected to see positive gains. Analysts note that while U.S. lenders faced issues, European banks have largely reported solid results without significant negative surprises. This positive outlook comes ahead of a busy week for earnings reports in Europe and the U.S., alongside crucial inflation data, which will continue to shape market sentiment.

          <p>Centrist senator Rodrigo Paz has been elected Bolivia's new president, securing 54% of the vote against right-wing rival Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga in a runoff election. This victory signals a major political shift, ending two decades of rule by the Movement Toward Socialism party, as voters expressed frustration over the country's economic crisis. Paz, who gained traction with working-class and rural voters, plans to implement gradual free-market reforms, including ending the fixed exchange rate and phasing out fuel subsidies, while aiming to maintain social protections. He faces the daunting task of stabilizing an economy plagued by dollar shortages and high inflation.</p>

          <p>Stuart Broad, an iconic figure in Ashes cricket, reflects on his legendary career, culminating in a "fairytale finale" at The Oval where he took the final wicket to win a Test against Australia. Broad, who holds the record for most Ashes wickets by an England bowler, recounts pivotal moments, including his career-defining 8-15 spell at Trent Bridge in 2015. He also discusses his role as an antagonist to Australian players, particularly David Warner, and his decision to retire at the peak of his game.

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a remarkable feat in neuroscience, successfully capturing the intricate "kiss-shrink-run" process of neuronal communication. Utilizing a groundbreaking camera with nanometre resolution and millisecond-scale imaging speed, the team, primarily from the University of Science and Technology of China and the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, has provided crucial insights into how signals are transmitted between neurons via synaptic vesicles. This significant accomplishment, published in the academic journal Science, helps to resolve a long-standing scientific debate and enhances our understanding of the brain's efficient and precise functioning.</p>

          <p>A new study confirms that advising parents to introduce peanut products to infants early and often has successfully prevented peanut allergies in approximately 60,000 children. This significant public health impact stems from guidance issued in 2015 and expanded in 2017, which overturned previous recommendations to delay allergen introduction. Researchers, analyzing electronic health records, found a 27% to 40% decline in peanut allergies among children aged 0-3. Despite initial slow adoption, the research provides promising evidence that early allergen introduction is effective and is making a measurable difference in reducing food allergies.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have made a significant discovery, linking the extraordinary longevity and disease resistance of naked mole-rats to a specific version of a DNA repair protein, which is also found in humans. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, this research provides a molecular basis for how enhanced DNA repair contributes to these rodents' exceptional lifespan, which can extend up to 37 years. The findings hold promising implications, suggesting that insights from the naked mole-rat's biology could inspire novel therapeutic anti-aging strategies aimed at improving human health and extending lifespan.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher, with China stocks rising, despite the release of China's third-quarter GDP growth of 4.8% which, while in line with expectations, indicated underlying economic weakness. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland's CSI 300 saw gains, while Japan's Nikkei 225 surged to a new high, partly due to a new coalition government agreement. South Korea's Kospi also climbed, extending its record-breaking run. This market resilience comes as investors assess economic data and anticipate upcoming earnings reports, including major U.S. companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British military is set to receive new powers allowing troops to shoot down drones that pose a threat to military bases, a measure Defence Secretary John Healey will unveil. This initiative aims to enable faster, more decisive action against drone incursions, which have been reported at four British airbases used by U.S. forces and have disrupted airspace across Europe. While initially limited to military sites, these powers could extend to civilian locations like airports. The move comes amid increasing concerns over drone activity, with several EU states also backing plans for a "drone wall" against potential threats.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen, after winning the United States Grand Prix, acknowledged for the first time that securing a fifth world championship is a real possibility, embracing the "positive pressure." Having gained 64 points in the last four races, he has significantly closed the gap to McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. Verstappen attributes his resurgence to finding a better balance with his Red Bull car and recent upgrades, proving competitive even on a "normal" circuit like Austin. With five races remaining, his dominant form suggests he could continue closing in, despite upcoming tracks that might favor McLaren's strengths.</p>

          <p>Thirteen individuals were arrested during a late-night operation in West Hollywood's Rainbow District, initially sparking widespread concerns about a possible ICE raid due to the presence of unmarked vehicles. Social media posts, including videos showing people confronting law enforcement, fueled these fears, particularly around the popular gay bar The Abbey. However, Los Angeles County Sheriff officials later confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were not involved. The operation was conducted by local law enforcement in response to reports of pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activity in the area.</p>

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of leading Chinese LiDAR maker RoboSense, argues that Elon Musk's vision-only approach to self-driving vehicles is not safe enough, advocating instead for a multi-sensor system. Qiu asserts that Level 3 or 4 driving automation requires additional sensors like LiDAR to address "corner cases" where vision-only systems struggle, such as detecting white cars against the sky or black cars in tunnels. Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu notes its cost has significantly decreased while performance has improved. Other auto executives, like Ford CEO Jim Farley, also view LiDAR as "mission critical."</p>

The exhibit, "Monuments," displays 18 such pieces alongside contemporary art, directly confronting the "Lost Cause" ideology that romanticizes Confederate figures. Curator Hamza Walker emphasizes that these figures fought for white supremacy, not just states' rights. This initiative comes as President Trump advocates for reinstalling Confederate monuments, contrasting sharply with efforts to re-contextualize or remove symbols tied to slavery and racial injustice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest a simple language shift from "I can't" to "I don't" can effectively help individuals establish boundaries at work and prevent burnout. Career coach Helen Tupper explains that "I don't" is more definitive and less open to negotiation, allowing for clearer communication of personal limits. This advice comes as many workers experience high levels of stress and pressure, with former TV chef Lorraine Pascale sharing her own burnout experience from being unable to say no. The article emphasizes that setting boundaries and adjusting goals to current capacity are crucial for mental and emotional well-being.</p>
