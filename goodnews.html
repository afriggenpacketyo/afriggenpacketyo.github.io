          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a nearly 6% decline after Warren Buffett's surprising announcement to step down as CEO, with Greg Abel named as his successor. The transition marks the end of Buffett's legendary 60-year run, during which he transformed Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate. Despite the leadership change, Buffett will remain as chairman, providing mentorship to Abel. The company's Class A and B shares both fell after hitting record highs, reflecting investor uncertainty despite assurances of a smooth transition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has made a series of comments regarding the possibility of running for a third term, despite constitutional limitations.
