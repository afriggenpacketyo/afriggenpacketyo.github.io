          <p>Argentine prosecutors have charged Patricia Kadgien, the daughter of a fugitive Nazi officer, after a painting looted during World War II was discovered in an online real estate listing for her home. The 18th-century artwork, 'Portrait of a Lady' by Giuseppe Ghislandi, had been missing for 80 years before being spotted by Dutch journalists. The heir of the original Jewish owner has filed a claim to reclaim the painting, which is part of a larger effort to recover art stolen by the Nazis. Following a police raid, Kadgien eventually surrendered the artwork to authorities.</p>

          <p>The immediate threat to the Hawaiian islands from Hurricane Kiko has significantly decreased as the storm's path has shifted further north. Forecasters at the National Weather Service now indicate that the state will likely be spared from strong winds and widespread heavy rain. However, officials continue to warn of hazardous conditions along east-facing shores due to large swells generated by the storm, which could cause life-threatening rip currents and beach erosion. The hurricane is expected to continue weakening as it moves through the region.</p>

          <p>The successful NFL game between the Chargers and Chiefs in São Paulo is being viewed as a blueprint for the league's long-term global expansion strategy. Rather than staging one-off events, the NFL aims to build a year-round presence in international markets to cultivate a dedicated global fanbase. The sold-out game at Corinthians Arena, with nearly 50,000 attendees, and a new media deal with Brazil's largest broadcaster, Globo, signal the league's serious commitment to making American football a major international sport.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has set a new all-time speed record in Formula 1 during his qualifying lap for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, securing pole position. His average speed of 164.466 mph surpassed the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020. The new record is attributed to a combination of factors, including the lower drag of the current generation of F1 cars and a recently resurfaced, higher-grip track. This achievement marks another historic moment at Monza, a circuit renowned for its high speeds.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing for the second nationwide test of its emergency alert system, which will send a 10-second siren-like sound and a message to all compatible mobile phones. The system is designed to provide public warnings during life-threatening events such as severe weather or terrorist attacks. Officials are urging the public to remain calm, acknowledging that the first test revealed some technical issues. Domestic abuse charities have also raised concerns, advising victims with secret phones to turn them off during the test period.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is continuing a major reshuffle of his government, with significant changes being made at the Home Office. Following Yvette Cooper's move to the Foreign Office, a new team of ministers has been appointed to work under the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood. The appointments are seen as a reflection of the prime minister's focus on tackling illegal immigration. The broader reshuffle includes promotions and moves across several other key government departments as Starmer seeks to reset his top team.</p>
