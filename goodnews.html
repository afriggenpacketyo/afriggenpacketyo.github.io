          <p>The U.S. and the European Union are urgently negotiating to secure a trade deal before an August 1 deadline, aiming to prevent significant tariff hikes that could harm consumers and businesses. Without an agreement, the U.S. has threatened a 30% tax on EU imports, with the EU preparing retaliatory tariffs on over $100 billion of American goods. A recent U.S. trade pact with Japan, which set a 15% tariff rate in exchange for substantial investment commitments, is being viewed as a potential model for the EU talks. Economists warn that even a 15% tariff would create an inflationary shock and dampen economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey's central bank has cut its main interest rate by three percentage points, bringing it down to 43% in a return to a monetary easing policy. This marks the first rate reduction since April, when a hike to 46% was implemented following political turmoil that impacted the Turkish lira. The move signals the monetary policy committee's confidence in its strategy to combat inflation, which has been steadily decreasing and stood at 35.05% in June. The bank stated that its tight monetary stance is designed to support disinflation by moderating domestic demand and improving inflation expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>U.S. Fertility Rate Reaches Historic Low in 2024, CDC Confirms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 07:28:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. total fertility rate fell to an all-time low of 1.599 children per woman in 2024, according to final data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This rate is below the 2.1 replacement level needed for a generation to replace itself, a benchmark the U.S. has been under for nearly two decades. Experts attribute the decline to ongoing trends of women delaying childbirth and concerns over the financial stability required to raise children. While the Trump administration has proposed measures like backing "baby bonuses," some population researchers argue these are symbolic and fail to address larger issues like affordable childcare and parental leave.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party and current Independent MP, has announced the formation of a new political party named 'Your Party.' He launched the initiative in a joint statement with Zarah Sultana, another MP who recently left Labour, describing it as a new kind of political entity that "belongs to you." The duo is inviting supporters to an inaugural conference to participate in the founding process, aiming to build a party that challenges what they label a "rigged" political system. This move formalizes Corbyn's split from the Labour Party, from which he was suspended.</p>

          <p>Police in India have arrested a man accused of running a fake embassy near New Delhi to defraud people with promises of overseas employment. The suspect, Harshvardhan Jain, allegedly posed as an ambassador for non-existent micronations like "Seborga" and "Westarctica" to convince victims of his diplomatic influence. He operated from a rented property featuring luxury cars with fake diplomatic plates, doctored photos with world leaders, and counterfeit documents. Authorities seized cash in multiple currencies and suspect Jain of money laundering through international shell companies, charging him with forgery and impersonation.</p>

A high-level meeting between Israeli, Qatari, and American officials is reportedly scheduled in Italy to discuss the response. This development occurs as over 100 international aid organizations issued a stark warning that the Gaza Strip is on the verge of experiencing mass starvation due to the protracted conflict and aid blockades.</p>

The agreement will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, and on Indian exports such as textiles and jewelry to the UK, aiming to boost the British economy by an estimated £4.8 billion annually. The deal, which took three years to negotiate, also includes a new plan to combat illegal migration and an extended exemption on social security contributions for temporary workers, which the government states is a standard reciprocal arrangement.

          <p>In a pioneering engineering feat in China's Yunnan province, a fleet of 16 drones successfully transported 180 tonnes of steel and concrete up a mountain to build three electricity transmission towers. The drones operated autonomously along pre-programmed routes, delivering the materials to altitudes of up to 1,650 meters with high precision. This aerial swarm method completed the task in just three days, a task that would typically take a month using traditional cableways. The project demonstrated a tenfold increase in efficiency and showcased the labor-saving potential of unmanned aerial systems in challenging construction environments.</p>

The gang operated in the central State of Mexico, extorting businesses and individuals across 14 municipalities and controlling labor unions in key industries. The crackdown, involving nearly 3,000 security personnel in 52 raids, resulted in the arrest of eight alleged leaders. Authorities also seized stolen exotic animals, vehicles, and construction materials, highlighting the pervasive nature of cartel expansion into crimes beyond drug trafficking to increase their illicit income.</p>

The eased rules, which were originally implemented to prevent mad cow disease, will now allow imports of U.S. beef sourced from Canada and Mexico. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins praised the move as a victory over "non-scientific trade barriers," while Australian producers expressed confidence in the government's biosecurity assessments. However, analysts are skeptical that the policy will lead to a significant increase in U.S. beef on Australian shelves due to high American prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The survey also highlights a drop in confidence about the program's future, with only 36% feeling secure, down from 43% in 2020.

This freeze-dried product, called ErythroMer, can be stored for years and has shown promising results in animal trials, successfully resuscitating rabbits from hemorrhagic shock.
