          <p>JJ Spaun won the US Open, holing out from 65ft on the final green at Oakmont, but the tournament was defined by chaos and carnage. The course setup, with dense rough and slick greens, limited creativity and skill. The USGA's decision not to delay rollback plans for the golf ball added to the difficulty. The long grass sat too close to fairways and greens, amplifying the small margin for error. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey from the Angus Reid Institute indicates that a large majority of Canadians believe the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) should prioritize maximizing returns, even if it means investing outside of Canada. Seventy-two percent of respondents said the CPP fund should invest wherever it earns the most returns for Canadians. Support for investing more in Canada is highest among younger people aged 18 to 24. The survey also reveals that fewer retirees feel they have enough money to do everything they want compared to 10 years ago. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is undergoing a transformation initiative to cut costs and move faster on adopting new technology. The initiative includes trimming some jobs and repositioning others, shifting more defense dollars to products that can be made quickly and cheaply. The Army is expanding beyond the rigid, years-long acquisition process to infuse formations with more effective technology. This transformation is being tested with "transformation in contact" (TIC) brigades, equipped with AI, SpaceX Starlink, autonomous vehicles, and drones. </p>
