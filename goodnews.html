          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America's recent report identifies the most challenging US cities for seasonal allergy sufferers, with Wichita, Kansas, topping the list for the third consecutive year due to high tree and grass pollen counts. Dr. Purvi Parikh from NYU Langone recommends starting allergy medications early, such as 24-hour antihistamines, eye drops, and nasal sprays, and consulting a doctor for breathing issues. Additional tips include washing clothes after spending time outdoors, washing bedsheets weekly in warm water, and staying indoors during peak pollen times in the morning and late afternoon. It is also important to differentiate allergy symptoms from those of colds and viruses, as allergies tend to last longer.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 05:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While China's electric vehicle (EV) exports to the UK have decreased, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports are experiencing a significant surge, increasing nearly 600% in the first quarter of the year. In March alone, hybrid EV exports to the UK soared by 1,849% year-on-year, reaching 3,898 units. This trend is attributed to the UK's relatively low 10% import tariff on Chinese cars, making them more affordable compared to European brands. The UK has become China's second-largest export destination for EVs and fifth-largest for hybrid electric vehicles, indicating a growing acceptance of Chinese car brands among British consumers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about upcoming peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, stating his commitment to working with both sides to end the conflict, urging an end to the "bloodbath" in a social media post. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signaled a positive outlook, stating that Putin's offer for direct talks in Istanbul was "a positive sign" and that a complete and unconditional ceasefire should begin soon. Putin proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, "without preconditions," an offer that came in response to Ukraine and its allies urging Moscow to commit to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face additional sanctions. The proposed deal reportedly included provisions for Ukraine's neutral status and put limits on its armed forces, while delaying talks on the status of Russian-occupied areas.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues that mothers are constantly bombarded with messages that they are not doing enough, often stemming from historical biases within her field. She emphasizes that being a perfect mother is harmful and unrealistic, as children need to learn about flaws and the importance of give-and-take in relationships. Ross encourages mothers to stop worrying about being good enough and highlights the importance of self-care and accepting imperfections. She concludes by advocating for society to cut mothers some slack and recognize their inherent worth.</p>

Experts suggest that a call from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Pakistan's Army Chief may have been a crucial turning point.

          <p>A report indicates that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. The surge in renewable energy investment aligns with China's commitment to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas. This shift is driven by Africa's growing energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
