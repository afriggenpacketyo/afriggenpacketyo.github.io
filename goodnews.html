          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has launched a beta version of the 2026-27 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) earlier than anticipated. This early testing phase aims to identify and resolve technical issues that have impacted previous application cycles, hopefully leading to a smoother process for all students. Financial aid experts have praised the move, noting that an extended testing window provides crucial time for feedback and bug fixes before the form's full release in October. Completing the FAFSA is a critical step for students seeking federal loans, grants, and work-study programs.</p>

          <p>"Grey’s Anatomy" star Camilla Luddington has publicly shared her recent diagnosis with Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. The 41-year-old actress described experiencing alarming symptoms, including severe fatigue, facial swelling, and joint pain, which significantly impaired her ability to function. Luddington explained that while the diagnosis was overwhelming, it also brought a sense of validation for her health concerns, which she had sometimes dismissed as anxiety. She expressed relief in having a clear treatment path and hopes her story can raise awareness about the common but challenging condition.</p>

          <p>Three individuals requiring medical attention were successfully evacuated from the American-operated McMurdo Station in Antarctica in a high-risk rescue mission. The Royal New Zealand Air Force conducted the nearly 20-hour operation using a C-130J Hercules aircraft, navigating sub-zero temperatures and 24-hour winter darkness. U.S. officials praised the mission as "nothing short of heroic," highlighting the extreme challenge of landing on a manually prepared ice runway using night vision goggles. The aircraft's engines were kept running during the stop to prevent freezing before it returned safely to Christchurch, New Zealand with the patients.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter financial results. While overall revenue surpassed expectations at $2.41 billion, adjusted earnings per share fell slightly short. The company saw strong performance from its international division and at Tim Hortons, which reported a 3.4% rise in same-store sales. However, Popeyes experienced a 1.4% decline in same-store sales amidst increased competition in the fast-food chicken market. Burger King's U.S. turnaround efforts continue, with a modest 1.5% sales increase as the chain renovates its restaurants.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery's second-quarter earnings were significantly lifted by the strong performance of its film studios, which saw a 55% revenue increase to $3.8 billion. Box-office hits like "A Minecraft Movie" and "F1" contributed to a combined $2 billion in global ticket sales, helping the studio segment's adjusted EBITDA nearly quadruple to $863 million. CEO David Zaslav highlighted the studio's turnaround, crediting new leadership and a focus on major franchises like "Superman" and "Lord of the Rings." This success provides positive momentum as the company prepares to split into two separate units next year.</p>

          <p>Global semiconductor giants are underscoring their significant investments in the United States as a potential strategy to mitigate the impact of President Trump's proposed 100% tariffs on imported chips. Companies like TSMC, which has pledged $165 billion for U.S. facilities, and Samsung, which operates plants in Texas, saw their stock prices rise on investor optimism that their domestic presence could exempt them from the duties. U.S.-based GlobalFoundries also saw its shares surge after announcing a deeper collaboration with Apple to strengthen American manufacturing. The moves highlight a broader industry effort to align with the administration's "build in America" focus.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to terminate thousands of previously approved grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) was "unlawful." The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Oregon Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) abruptly cut the funding. U.S. District Judge Michael H. Simon stated that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their claim, affirming that the Constitution grants Congress, not the President, the power over federal spending. While the ruling is a victory, humanities groups note that funding remains withheld.</p>

          <p>Shares of the language-learning company Duolingo soared by more than 30% after it significantly raised its full-year revenue and bookings forecast. The company attributed the optimistic outlook to strong user growth, which was powered by the integration of new artificial intelligence tools and an expansion into new subjects like chess. Daily active users jumped 40% to nearly 48 million compared to the previous year. Duolingo also announced the acquisition of music gaming startup NextBeat, signaling its intent to further broaden its educational product offerings beyond language.</p>

          <p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have found evidence of a real-life gas giant planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, the nearest Sun-like star to Earth. This discovery is reminiscent of the fictional moon Pandora from the "Avatar" movies, which is set in the same star system. The planet candidate appears to be orbiting within the star's habitable zone, where temperatures could potentially support life. While the planet itself is a gas giant, scientists suggest it could host rocky moons, which might possess solid ground or even oceans, making the system a tantalizing target for future study.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of different financial tools available to seniors for retirement income, including Social Security, annuities, and reverse mortgages. It explains that while Social Security provides a foundational income, it is often insufficient on its own. Annuities are presented as an option for those seeking guaranteed lifetime income to bridge financial gaps, though they can come with high fees. Reverse mortgages allow homeowners to tap into their home equity but reduce their estate's value and are best for those planning to stay in their homes long-term. The article concludes that a blended approach is often best. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Australian bowling legend Glenn McGrath has continued his tradition of predicting a 5-0 whitewash victory for Australia in the upcoming 2025-26 Ashes series against England. Despite England's recent aggressive form under coach Brendon McCullum, McGrath expressed high confidence in Australia's home-ground advantage, particularly its formidable bowling attack. He acknowledged potential issues with Australia's batting lineup but argued that England's own bowling needs strengthening. McGrath highlighted the matchup between England's top-order batsmen, like Joe Root and Harry Brook, and Australia's bowlers as the key battle that will decide the series.</p>

          <p>This article explores the economic argument for tariffs, suggesting that while President Trump's current policies are widely seen as broad and chaotic, tariffs themselves are not inherently bad policy tools. Economists argue that targeted, strategic tariffs can be effective in protecting nascent domestic industries from unfair competition, such as from state-subsidized foreign companies or those with poor labor standards. They can also be used to bolster supply chain security for critical goods, a lesson learned during the pandemic. The key, the article contends, is to use them as part of a complementary industrial policy rather than as a standalone solution.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists at Pompeii have uncovered new evidence showing that some survivors of the catastrophic 79 AD Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to live amidst the ruins. Contrary to the belief that the city was completely abandoned, it appears a small, informal settlement emerged where people lived in "precarious conditions." These inhabitants repurposed the devastated structures, turning former ground floors into cellars with ovens and mills. Site director Gabriel Zuchtriegel described the reoccupied area as more of a "precarious and grey agglomeration" than a city, a finding that adds a new chapter to the famous site's story.</p>
