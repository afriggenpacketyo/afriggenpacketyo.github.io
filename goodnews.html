Pugh, a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, emphasized the need for drastic measures to protect sharks, noting that around 100 million are killed each year, disrupting the ocean's ecosystem.</p>

The recovery was made possible by the persistence of family members, particularly Scott Althaus, who spent years researching the plane's location, leading to the discovery of the wreckage and the subsequent recovery of the remains by a Navy dive team.
