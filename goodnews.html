          <p>Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac discusses the origins of UNITUS, his faith-based apparel brand, emphasizing its mission to connect people to Christ and promote unity. Isaac, who wears his own brand on the court, explains that UNITUS aims to inspire positive change through premium Christian clothing and footwear. He stresses that the company avoids imposing its beliefs on others, focusing instead on providing reminders of faith for the wearer. Isaac revealed that he started his own sneaker line after Nike chose not to re-sign him following an ACL injury, allowing him creative autonomy to express his faith through his apparel. Despite potential backlash for speaking out about his beliefs, Isaac prioritizes minimizing his time on social media and filtering out negativity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is reportedly considering renaming several naval ships, including the USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. Documents indicate that other vessels named after prominent leaders, such as the USNS Thurgood Marshall and USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, are also on the renaming list. The proposal to rename the ships aligns with the Trump administration's priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture" within the military. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi criticized the potential name changes as a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought for equality; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had previously issued a directive to cease hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell has been exonerated after serving 28 years in prison, becoming the 51st person exonerated in a case linked to disgraced former Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was sentenced to 103 years in prison after being framed for murder by Guevara, who has been accused of coercing false confessions. McDowell walked into CPD headquarters in 1997 after being shot, but when he refused to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect, he was framed for an unrelated murder. There was no evidence connecting McDowell to the crime, but Guevara manipulated witnesses into making false identifications; DNA evidence later excluded McDowell as the source, leading to the dismissal of charges.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of a new norovirus strain, GII.17, due to its potential to disrupt the seasonal pattern of outbreaks. Last year, the norovirus season started earlier than usual in October, driven by the emergence of GII.17, which displaced the previously dominant GII.4 strain. Several countries experienced unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus after GII.17 surged to dominance. Researchers are uncertain whether GII.17 will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season, as GII.4 is still being detected globally.</p>

          <p>Actor Haley Joel Osment has been ordered to attend six months of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and therapy after being arrested for alleged public intoxication and cocaine possession. Osment was granted a one-year diversion by a judge in Mono County, California, which will clear his charges if he completes the terms: at least three AA meetings per week and two therapy sessions for the next six months. The actor was arrested in April at Mammoth Mountain ski resort and made disparaging comments to the arresting officer. The district attorney's office initially objected to the diversion request, citing Osment's prior DUI conviction, but the judge ultimately decided in his favor.</p>
