          <p>A top adviser to the director of national intelligence instructed a senior analyst to revise an assessment regarding the relationship between Venezuela's government and a gang, following a disclosure that intelligence agencies disagreed with a key factual claim made by President Trump to invoke a wartime deportation law. The original assessment contradicted Trump's claim that Venezuela directed the gang to commit crimes in the U.S., leading to a criminal leak investigation. Despite the request for a redo, the council reaffirmed its initial findings after re-examining the evidence, but the incident sparked controversy and accusations of politicizing intelligence. This article highlights the tensions between political agendas and intelligence integrity within the administration.</p>

          <p>The increasing use of AI chatbots like Grok, ChatGPT, and Meta AI for fact-checking raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of their responses. Studies reveal that these AI assistants often contain significant inaccuracies, distorted content, and fabricated links, presenting incorrect answers with alarming confidence. Experts warn that AI chatbots are only as good as the data they are trained on, and that biased or untrustworthy sources can lead to misleading or false information. This article emphasizes the need for users to double-check AI-generated responses with other sources and avoid relying solely on these tools for accurate information.</p>

          <p>Three Iranian nationals have been charged in the UK with espionage for Iran's intelligence services, following arrests made earlier this month. The suspects are accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service between August 2024 and February 2025, with one also charged with planning serious violence.

While a comprehensive new deal is unlikely, the summit aims to ease administrative hassles for farmers and the food industry, and to address energy, migration, agriculture, and data sharing. Negotiations are ongoing regarding work visas for young citizens and fishing rights, with both sides signaling that agreements are still being worked out. The UK government hopes that progress on these issues will create a sense of economic stability and improve relations with the EU.</p>

DOGE, led by Elon Musk, has been conducting meetings with a small group of young staffers, some with limited federal government experience, to assess and potentially dismantle or eliminate these entities. Some organizations, like the Government Accountability Office, have rebuffed DOGE's requests, while others have faced staff reductions and program cuts.

          <p>President Trump's proposed "one big, beautiful bill" echoes Ronald Reagan's ambitious use of budget reconciliation in 1981, known as Reaganomics. Reagan's budget featured significant tax cuts alongside increased military spending and cuts to social programs, aiming to stimulate the economy and reverse government growth. The current efforts by Trump, supported by the Department of Government Efficiency, mirror Reagan's strategy of using reconciliation to enact sweeping policy changes.

          <p>A new genetic study has traced prehistoric human migration from Asia to North and South America, providing insights into the ancestry of Indigenous groups. The study found that the first people to colonize the Americas migrated from modern-day Russia 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. The findings are helping underrepresented Indigenous groups understand their ancestral origins.</p>

          <p>Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry exhibited their frustration during the US PGA Championship, with Lowry swearing at the course and Hatton swearing at his own club. Lowry slammed his club into the Quail Hollow turf and swore about "this place" after being denied relief for an embedded ball, and both players are likely to face fines for their behavior. Hatton was within a shot of the lead before a costly triple bogey.</p>
