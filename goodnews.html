        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a market decline where major indexes fell, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain confidence in the strong companies they own for long-term gains. He attributed the drop to seasonal profit-taking in September by large institutions, particularly in leading tech stocks, rather than fundamental issues with the companies themselves. Cramer also cited investor concerns over a recent court ruling on tariffs and the upcoming labor report as contributing factors to market anxiety. He recommended holding onto Big Tech growth stocks, suggesting they are resilient enough to weather such pullbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B of assault and battery in a civil trial. The lawsuit was filed by a security guard who alleged the rapper attacked her with a fingernail and spat on her outside a medical office in 2018, seeking $24 million in damages. Cardi B admitted to a heated verbal exchange but denied any physical contact, a claim supported by testimony from her doctor's receptionist. The jury deliberated for about an hour before finding in favor of the musician, concluding a trial that had generated significant public attention.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has maintained a lower court's injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter. The ruling allows the Biden-appointed commissioner to continue her work, affirming that the president's attempt to remove her without cause was inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. The case is a significant test of a president's authority to remove members of independent federal agencies. The Trump administration had argued for a stay, but the panel found the government had no likelihood of success on appeal, though further appeals are possible.</p>

          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semifinals after her quarter-final opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, withdrew before their match due to a knee injury. This sets up a highly anticipated rematch of last year's final against American fourth seed Jessica Pegula. Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets, 6-3 6-3, marking a strong performance in a tournament where she has historically struggled in the later stages. Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, expressed her disappointment, having to pull out after a pre-match practice session confirmed the injury was too severe.</p>

          <h2>Alphabet Stock Surges Over 8% After Antitrust Ruling Avoids Harshest Penalties</h2>

          <p>Shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, jumped more than 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's ruling in its landmark antitrust case. Investors reacted positively as the decision, while imposing some restrictions, avoided the most severe penalties sought by the Department of Justice, such as the forced sale of the Chrome browser. The ruling mandates that Google cannot have exclusive default search engine contracts but will not be barred from paying partners to preload its products. The company will also be required to share some search data, though not advertising data, with rivals on commercial terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, is expanding its U.S. presence by beginning test drives in Denver and Seattle this week. Initially, the vehicles will be operated manually by human safety drivers to map the areas and validate the technology before any future launch of a fully autonomous ride-hailing service. This move is part of Waymo's broader strategy to roll out its driverless robotaxi operations across the country, which are already commercially available in cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, and Austin. The test fleets in the new cities will consist of the company's all-electric Jaguar I-Pace and Geely Zeekr models.</p>

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law that would prohibit the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The ban would apply to all retail points, including shops, cafes, vending machines, and online sales, addressing concerns from parents and health experts about the drinks' impact on children's health. Popular drinks can contain more caffeine than two cups of coffee, and excessive consumption in young people is linked to headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. The proposal, which has entered a 12-week consultation period, aims to formalize a voluntary ban already adopted by most major supermarkets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a federal judge has ordered Google to implement significant changes to its business practices but stopped short of breaking up the company. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google must end its exclusive contracts that make it the default search engine on many devices and must also share some search data with competitors. However, the judge rejected the Department of Justice's more severe proposal to force Google to sell its popular Chrome web browser, deeming the measure a "poor fit for this case." The decision aims to increase competition in the search market while avoiding what the judge called a "messy and highly risky" divestiture.</p>

          <p>Air Lease, a major aircraft leasing company, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal led by an investor group including Japan's Sumitomo, SMBC Aviation Capital, Apollo, and Brookfield. The acquisition highlights ongoing consolidation within the airplane-renting industry, which has benefited from high rental rates amid a shortage of new aircraft. Lessors play a critical role in the aviation sector by owning over half the world's passenger jets and renting them to airlines. This deal will significantly increase the scale of the combined entity, making it a larger player in the global aviation finance market.</p>
