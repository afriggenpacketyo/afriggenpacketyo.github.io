        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees relying on a fixed Social Security income can find it challenging to manage and pay off debts like credit card balances or medical bills. This article outlines several strategies, emphasizing that Social Security benefits are generally protected from most creditors. Key recommendations include creating a strict budget, prioritizing high-interest debts, and proactively contacting creditors to negotiate hardship programs that could lower interest rates or payments. It also suggests considering non-profit credit counseling or, cautiously, debt settlement as potential options for relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new blue food additive for use in various beverages and candies. The color is derived from the fruit of the gardenia plant, which is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. This approval is part of a broader push to replace petroleum-based dyes with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply. While the new dye is made using soy, a potential allergen, the FDA is still reviewing a request to exempt it from allergen labeling requirements.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Weigh the Pros and Cons of Investing in a 10-Year CD</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 09:38:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 10-year certificate of deposit (CD) can be a useful tool for risk-averse savers looking to lock in current interest rates for a long-term goal. However, financial experts caution that this strategy comes with significant downsides, such as steep penalties for early withdrawal and potentially lower returns compared to other investments like stocks or bonds. In the current economic climate, shorter-term CDs sometimes offer comparable or even better rates, reducing the incentive for a decade-long commitment. The decision depends heavily on an individual's financial goals and tolerance for risk. (not investment advice)</p>

The author points to Trump's recent statements supporting continued weapons shipments to Ukraine and his threat of 100% tariffs on Russia as evidence of this evolution. The piece suggests that while Trump has expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin, his administration's actions have often been at odds with Russian interests. It concludes that the realities of the geopolitical rivalry are making a pro-Russia stance increasingly untenable.</p>
