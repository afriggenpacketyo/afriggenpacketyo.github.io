          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued after a section of a large industrial tunnel collapsed deep underground in Los Angeles. The workers were approximately six miles in from the entrance and 400 feet below the surface when the cave-in occurred. They managed to navigate over debris to reach a tunnel boring machine and were then transported to safety without any major injuries. Officials praised the workers' composure and called the outcome a victory, averting a potential tragedy during the construction of a major wastewater project.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has approved a significant reform allowing Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays. The change is intended to help the postal service manage declining letter volumes and rising operational costs, which have been driving up stamp prices. Under the new rules, Royal Mail must still deliver first-class letters six days a week and will face revised delivery targets to ensure overall service reliability. The company welcomed the decision as a necessary step toward maintaining a financially sustainable universal service for the country.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the potential to become a global safe-haven currency, citing its stability and the country's strong macroeconomic fundamentals. The assertion, made in a recent article, points to the yuan's resilience during recent periods of global stress, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and shocks from U.S. tariffs. This perspective highlights China's ongoing efforts to internationalize its currency and presents an alternative to traditional safe-havens like the U.S. dollar, especially amid growing global economic uncertainty.

          <p>The market for weight-loss drugs in China is rapidly expanding, with projections suggesting it could become a US$150 billion industry. This growth is fueled by the introduction of new, more effective medications and rising obesity rates, mirroring trends seen in Western countries. Innovent Biologics, a domestic firm, was the first to receive approval to market a weight-loss drug in the country. The article explains that dozens of other producers are now vying for a share of this nascent but lucrative market, driven by both health concerns and social trends.</p>

          <h2>Vienna's Extensive Social Housing System Praised as a Model for Affordability</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is being highlighted as a prime example of successful housing policy, often described as a "renters' utopia" due to its large and stable social housing sector. Approximately 43% of the city's housing is social housing, available to a wide range of income levels, which keeps rent significantly lower than in the private market and helps control overall housing costs. This system, originating from the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s, has been maintained through long-term political commitment and a levy on employee salaries. While challenges in accessibility remain, Vienna's model demonstrates that prioritizing housing as a basic need can lead to greater affordability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology have successfully created what they are calling the first cyborg bee by using the world's lightest insect brain controller. Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is attached to the bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain. These pulses create illusions that allow scientists to command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a high degree of accuracy. In tests, the bees reportedly obeyed the commands nine out of ten times, marking a significant step in micro-robotics and animal-machine interfaces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several top tennis players at Wimbledon, including Amanda Anisimova and Carlos Alcaraz, are speaking out about the mental health challenges of life on the professional tour. Anisimova, who took a months-long break for burnout, emphasized the importance of listening to one's body and living a normal life. The grueling 11-month season, constant travel, and immense pressure to perform can take a significant toll, leading to anxiety and a loss of joy in the sport. Players are increasingly prioritizing mental well-being, working with therapists, and making conscious efforts to find balance and enjoyment both on and off the court.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chinese government has announced a new policy to provide one-off subsidies to companies that hire unemployed young people between the ages of 16 and 24. Employers can receive up to 1,500 yuan for each new hire who is signed to a formal contract and for whom social insurance contributions are paid for at least three months. This measure is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market and support household incomes as the country grapples with sluggish economic growth and high youth unemployment. The program will be funded through China's unemployment insurance reserves and will remain in effect until the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to keep its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 2.5% as it evaluates the effectiveness of recent measures designed to cool down Seoul's overheating housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% year-on-year in June, prompting authorities to address the rapid expansion of household debt. Despite concerns about slowing economic growth, the central bank prioritized financial stability, opting to hold rates steady for now. Analysts expect that the bank may cut rates later in the year once the new mortgage restrictions take full effect and stabilize the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 13 brown pelicans that were sickened by a toxic algal bloom off the Southern California coast have been successfully treated and released back into the wild. The bloom, the deadliest since 2015, produced high levels of domoic acid, which poisoned hundreds of seabirds and marine mammals. The rescued pelicans made a full recovery at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach before being set free. The event highlights the growing threat of harmful algal blooms to marine ecosystems, while also showcasing the positive impact of wildlife rehabilitation efforts.</p>
