          <p>A rare and massive jellyfish species known as the "pink meanie" (Drymonema larsoni) has been washing up on the Texas Gulf coast. These jellyfish, which were only identified as a new species in 2011, can grow to have 70-foot-long tentacles and weigh over 50 pounds. They primarily feed on the more common moon jellyfish, and their presence is often tied to blooms of their prey. While they do sting, the sensation is reported to be mild, and their appearance has surprised beachgoers and researchers alike.</p>

          <p>During a market downturn driven by rising bond yields, financial commentator Jim Cramer identified Boeing as his "favorite stock" in his charitable trust's portfolio. This endorsement comes as U.S. lawmakers advocate for China to purchase Boeing aircraft and the company partners with Palantir for AI integration. Cramer's team noted they are taking advantage of the stock's recent 10% decline to increase their position, viewing it as a buying opportunity. The commentary also touched on concerns about Nvidia's partnership with OpenAI and the potential for vendor financing in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged over 100% after reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal is part of renegotiations for a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. An administration official stated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to reduce risk for taxpayers. This move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in supply chains for minerals critical to national interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oregon police have exhumed the partial remains of an unidentified woman known as "Oak Grove Jane Doe," marking a potential breakthrough in the state's oldest unsolved case. The woman's dismembered body was found in burlap sacks in the Willamette River in 1946, but key evidence, including her remains, went missing from police custody in the 1950s. After learning the remains were likely interred at a local cemetery, authorities recovered them for modern forensic testing. Investigators hope that advanced DNA technology can finally identify the victim nearly 80 years after her death.</p>

The album is described as "new Mariah, but still sounds like Mariah," and features collaborations with Anderson .Paak. Carey also reflects on her resilience, with one song in particular, "Nothing Is Impossible," representing her ability to overcome personal challenges.</p>

          <p>Two Republican congressmen, Reps. August Pfluger and Abe Hamadeh, have introduced legislation to direct the U.S. Treasury to mint 400,000 silver dollar coins honoring the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. This proposal is one of several Republican efforts to memorialize Kirk following his assassination earlier this month. The coin would feature Kirk's likeness and the words "well done, good and faithful servant," making him, at 31, the youngest American to be featured on U.S. currency. The move aims to cement his legacy alongside other historical figures.</p>

          <p>Kathleen Corradi, who was appointed as New York City's first-ever citywide director of rodent mitigation, or "rat czar," has resigned from her position. Appointed by Mayor Eric Adams in 2023, she was tasked with combating the city's estimated 3 million rats. During her tenure, she was allocated a $3.5 million budget and implemented strategies that included public awareness campaigns and rat birth control. While the mayor's office praised her work and noted a decrease in rat-related 311 calls, her resignation is effective October 10, though she will continue to work for the city in a different role.</p>

          <p>Sales of newly built homes in the U.S. surged by 20.5% in August compared to July, reaching their highest level in over three years and significantly exceeding expectations. This increase occurred even before the recent drop in mortgage rates, suggesting strong buyer demand despite higher borrowing costs. While some analysts express caution due to the report's small sample size and potential for revision, the data indicates a robust market. The strong sales have reduced the inventory of new homes, while median prices saw a slight year-over-year increase, even as more builders report offering price cuts and incentives.

          <p>A surge of youth-led protests against corruption and inequality is sweeping across several Asian nations, including Nepal, Indonesia, and the Philippines, largely organized and amplified by Generation Z using social media and AI tools.

This digital-savvy approach has created a sense of cross-national solidarity, with protesters sharing symbols and hashtags. While the movements have led to significant offline consequences, including violence and political resignations, questions remain about their ability to achieve long-term systemic change.</p>

          <p>Former President Peter Mutharika has won Malawi's presidential election, defeating incumbent Lazarus Chakwera in a significant political comeback. Mutharika's victory is largely attributed to widespread public frustration over five years of severe economic challenges under Chakwera's leadership, including soaring inflation and rising poverty. Mutharika campaigned on promises of fiscal discipline, institutional reform, and austerity measures to stabilize the nation's finances. The new president faces immense pressure to deliver economic relief and address the deep-seated issues of corruption and mismanagement that plagued the previous administration.</p>

          <p>A wildfire that grew to over 100 acres near the town of Paia on Maui prompted officials to issue evacuation orders and sound emergency sirens on Tuesday. Residents were urged to leave immediately due to a "dangerous threat to life and property," with some expressing terror at the prospect of a repeat of the devastating 2023 Lahaina fire. However, as firefighters worked to contain the blaze, the threat receded, and the evacuation orders were lifted later in the day. Unlike the 2023 disaster, high winds were not a major factor in this incident.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost sales of its F-150 pickup truck, Ford Motor is offering special financing rates to consumers with subprime credit scores, typically below 620. This promotion provides lower interest rates, usually reserved for buyers with high credit scores, to a riskier segment of the market. While such moves can help increase sales and reduce inventory, they also carry a higher risk of loan defaults. Ford Credit stated that it only finances customers it deems creditworthy and that this type of national program has been used in the past to make vehicles more affordable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope may have discovered a colossal primordial black hole, an object formed shortly after the Big Bang before the first stars. If confirmed, this finding would challenge the standard cosmological model, which posits that stars formed first and later collapsed into black holes. This mysterious object is located in the very early universe and appears to be surrounded mostly by primordial hydrogen and helium, not the remnants of a star. While further observation is needed to rule out other possibilities, the discovery could rewrite our understanding of how the universe's earliest structures came into being.</p>

          <p>Tom Brady has addressed criticism regarding his dual roles as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and a broadcaster for Fox. Critics argue that his media access to other teams' players and coaches creates a conflict of interest and provides an unfair advantage. In his weekly newsletter, Brady wrote that only the "paranoid and distrustful" would see a dilemma, framing his intersecting roles not as a conflict, but as the fulfillment of a "moral and ethical duty" to improve the sport. The debate intensified after he was recently seen in the Raiders' coaching booth during a game.</p>
