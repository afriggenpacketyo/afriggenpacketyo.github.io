        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales growth fell short of expectations in April, rising by 5.1% year-on-year against an anticipated 5.5%, signaling persistent concerns about consumer spending in the world's second-largest economy. Industrial output, however, showed resilience, growing by 6.1%, surpassing forecasts despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The real estate sector continues to struggle, with fixed asset investment in property falling by 10.3% year-on-year, indicating a period of adjustment and pressure in certain regions. Despite efforts to diversify exports, domestic demand, particularly in automobile sales, remains sluggish, growing by only 0.7%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reportedly reached an agreement to reset relations following Britain's departure from the bloc in 2020. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a summit in London amid a backdrop of global uncertainty. The agreement includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, as well as cooperation on energy, security, and defense. This deal signifies a major step toward stabilizing the relationship between the UK and the EU after a period of tension and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Top officials from the UK and the European Union met in London to discuss a major reset of relations, focusing on defense, trade, and geopolitical collaboration. A key expected outcome is a new defense and security partnership to enhance military cooperation amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and calls for increased European defense spending. Sticking points included fishing rights and youth mobility schemes, with disagreements over access to UK fishing waters and tuition fees for EU students. Both sides face domestic pressure to defend their interests, with the UK wary of appearing too close to the EU due to political sensitivities.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that annual domestic energy bills in the UK will decrease by ¬£129 in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This reduction translates to a nearly 7% decrease, bringing the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to ¬£1,720, down from the current ¬£1,849. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, so actual bills may vary depending on individual consumption.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles in an effort to save them from extinction. Water vole populations have declined significantly, and tracking these shy animals is challenging. By feeding them edible, biodegradable glitter, researchers hope to track their movements through their droppings. This innovative approach aims to provide crucial insights into their habitat use, enabling targeted conservation efforts such as habitat restoration and predator control.</p>

          <p>A mass grave containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus dinosaurs has been discovered in Alberta, Canada, offering insights into a catastrophic event that wiped out a migrating herd. Palaeontologists are excavating the site, nicknamed the "River of Death," to understand how these animals died. The site is one of the largest bone beds in North America, providing a unique opportunity to study the biology and community structure of this species. Research suggests that a flash flood likely caused the mass death, with the dinosaurs unable to escape the fast-moving water.</p>
