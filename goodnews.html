        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nintendo announced that its revenue more than doubled in its fiscal first quarter, significantly surpassing analyst expectations. This remarkable growth is primarily attributed to the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console, which sold 5.82 million units in its first month. The company's operating profit also beat forecasts, and its share price has climbed approximately 40% this year. Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million Switch 2 units by the end of the fiscal year, signaling strong momentum for the gaming giant.</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have issued official statements reacting to the newly announced U.S. tariff schedule, revealing a range of outcomes from recent negotiations. Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief after their high proposed tariffs were significantly reduced to 19%, which they believe will maintain their economic competitiveness. Taiwan's president called its 20% rate "temporary" pending further talks, while allies Japan and Australia welcomed their relatively lower rates. In contrast, India, which did not secure a deal, faces a 25% tariff and is pursuing a broader trade agreement with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, known as the Rhisotope Project, is using nuclear science to protect the country's dwindling rhino population. Scientists are injecting rhino horns with a small, harmless amount of a radioactive isotope, which makes the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at international borders and airports. The goal is to devalue the horns on the black market and increase the risk of arrest for poachers and traffickers. This innovative method aims to provide a new line of defense for the rhinos in South Africa.</p>

Despite a strong two-goal performance from Tijuana's young player Gilberto Mora, the Mexican club was unable to contain the MLS champions' attack.

          <p>An analysis of the space industry suggests a strategic shift in focus from the Moon towards the more ambitious goal of colonizing Mars. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar exploration, many now view the Moon as a "stepping stone" rather than the final destination. National agencies and private magnates are increasingly vocal about Mars, which offers more "Earth-like" potential for sustained human presence. This trend could see lunar projects become the domain of private companies, while state-sponsored efforts concentrate on the red planet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's increasing use of its emergency docket, which handles urgent appeals. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh argued that the rise in emergency requests is a direct result of presidents from both parties relying more on executive orders to bypass congressional gridlock. He stated that the court has implemented internal changes to handle these cases properly and suggested that as long as presidents push the limits of their power, the judiciary will inevitably be drawn in to respond.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. In her ruling, Judge Trina L. Thompson stated that the administration's decision appeared to be motivated by racial animus, citing public statements by President Trump. The judge also found that the government failed to conduct an objective review of the current unsafe conditions in the immigrants' home countries. The ruling provides a temporary reprieve for thousands.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing division, posted an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, slightly ahead of analyst estimates.

Amazon's CEO noted that the company is still facing supply shortages, particularly for power, needed to meet this rising demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis have reunited for "Freakier Friday," a sequel to their hit 2003 body-swap comedy. At the film's London premiere, Lohan discussed her return to acting and how becoming a mother has given her a new perspective on the film's family themes. The new movie updates the concept, with Lohan's character now a mother herself, leading to a "quadruple body-swapping" scenario. Curtis, who initiated the idea for the sequel, emphasized the film's timely themes of empathy and understanding in a divided world.</p>
