          <p>Pop icon Debbie Gibson is reflecting on her career in her new memoir, "Eternally Electric: The Message in My Music." At 17, she became the youngest female artist to write, produce, and perform a Billboard No. 1 hit with "Foolish Beat" in 1988, a record she still holds. Gibson credits her late mother, Diane, who acted as her manager, for fighting for her creative control in a male-dominated industry. After walking away from major labels to record independently, she feels she is thriving more than ever by connecting directly with her audience through social media.</p>

          <p>British tennis number one Emma Raducanu has withdrawn from Great Britain's team for the Billie Jean King Cup Finals. She has instead accepted a wildcard to play in the Korea Open, prioritizing the WTA Tour event to aid the long-term development of her game and her new partnership with coach Francisco Roig. The decision is a significant setback for the British team, as Raducanu was instrumental in their run to the semi-finals last year, winning all three of her singles matches. Her absence will require team captain Anne Keothavong to bring in additional players for the finals in Shenzhen.</p>

          <p>A 102-year-old Japanese man, Kokichi Akuzawa, has set a new record as the oldest person to climb to the summit of Mount Fuji, Japan's highest peak. He completed the 12,388-foot ascent accompanied by his family and friends, having previously set the record at age 96. Akuzawa undertook rigorous training for three months prior to the climb, overcoming previous health issues to achieve the feat. Despite finding the climb more challenging than before, he credited the support of his companions for his success on the iconic mountain.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has seized over 40,000 pounds of cocaine and apprehended 36 suspected smugglers in the Eastern Pacific Ocean over the last month. The seizures were part of Operation Pacific Viper, a surge of forces aimed at disrupting cartels and criminal organizations transporting illicit narcotics from South America. The operation involves coordination with international partners using cutters, aircraft, and tactical teams. This success follows a recent record haul in the Caribbean, where the Coast Guard offloaded over 38 tons of cocaine and marijuana in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot's climb to $1.8 billion is driving a massive surge in ticket sales on lottery courier apps like Jackpocket, which is owned by DraftKings. The company reported that 15 million Powerball tickets have been ordered through the platform during the current run, with daily sales increasing by 130%. For DraftKings, the 2024 acquisition of Jackpocket is a strategic move to cross-sell customers to its primary sports betting and iGaming offerings. The high-profile lottery provides a significant opportunity to acquire new users for its broader gambling ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Look at the Potential Tax Bill for the $1.8 Billion Powerball Winner</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot reaches an estimated $1.8 billion, the potential tax implications for a winner are substantial. The lump-sum cash option is approximately $826.4 million, which would immediately be subject to a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding, reducing it by nearly $198.3 million. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a significant additional tax bill would be due. State taxes could further reduce the take-home amount, varying widely depending on where the winning ticket was purchased. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a controversial law that banned the development of homeless shelters as part of a settlement with the state. Last year, California sued the Los Angeles County city, alleging the ban violated fair housing and anti-discrimination laws. As part of the agreement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 toward new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring. City leaders had previously argued the ban was a negotiating tactic to draw attention to what they felt was a disproportionate burden in addressing regional homelessness.</p>

          <h2>Data Analysis Reveals Which States Offer the Best and Worst Payouts for Powerball Winners</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot at a historic $1.8 billion, an analysis shows that a winner's location significantly impacts their after-tax prize. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing a winner to take home the most money after federal taxes are deducted. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest annuitized payout, totaling around $939 million compared to over $1.1 billion in a no-tax state. This disparity highlights the crucial role state tax policy plays in the ultimate value of a massive lottery win. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Determining a sufficient monthly retirement income is highly personal, but financial planners generally suggest aiming for 75% to 85% of one's pre-retirement annual income. For someone earning $120,000, this translates to a target of $7,500 to $8,500 per month. However, the current median retirement income in the U.S. is much lower, at around $3,900 per month. With inflation and rising healthcare costs, retirees are encouraged to create multiple income streams, such as annuities for guaranteed payments, reverse mortgages for home equity access, and optimizing Social Security by delaying claims until age 70.

Piastri finished fourth fastest in the session, behind Carlos Sainz of Williams. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton, who finished fifth for Ferrari, will face a five-place grid penalty for the main race on Sunday due to an infringement at the Dutch Grand Prix.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates in the United States have continued their downward trend, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage falling to 6.50%, its lowest point since October 2024. This decline is largely attributed to market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, as well as a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. For prospective homebuyers, the lower rates may increase competition for limited housing inventory. Experts advise buyers to act strategically by checking their credit, getting pre-approved for a loan, and calculating their budget based on current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order creating a formal designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention. This measure will allow the U.S. to impose penalties on countries that illegally detain American citizens or hold them as political leverage, similar to the existing designation for state sponsors of terrorism. The move aims to deter such practices and could include tools like travel restrictions on U.S. passports. The action follows several high-profile cases where Americans were detained in countries like Russia and Iran and later released in prisoner swaps.</p>

Made from a modified 1950s camera flash attachment, the prop was a centerpiece of a Hollywood memorabilia auction hosted by Propstore.

          <p>The Trump administration has raised the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change modifies the $10,000 cap that was implemented by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which for the first time limited a deduction that had been unlimited for over a century. The SALT deduction primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. While proponents argue it prevents double taxation, critics highlight its cost, with the higher cap projected to add over $142 billion to the national debt over ten years. (not investment advice)</p>
