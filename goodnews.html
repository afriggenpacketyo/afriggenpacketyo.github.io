          <p>Carla Hayden, former Librarian of Congress, speaks out about her unexpected dismissal by the Trump administration via email, stating she received no prior notification or explanation. Hayden believes her firing is part of a larger effort to diminish public access to information, as libraries serve as bastions of democracy. The White House press secretary claimed Hayden did not fit the needs of the American people, citing concerns over DEI initiatives and inappropriate books for children. Hayden refutes these claims, emphasizing the Library of Congress's primary function is to fulfill research requests from members of Congress, and that inclusion should not be viewed as a negative.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how President Trump's policies have lessened China's concerns about the U.S. attempting to subvert the Communist Party through peaceful means. The author reflects on how, during their upbringing, they were taught to be vigilant about American conspiracies aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party. However, the U.S. has shifted away from nation-building efforts, and China has emerged as a global power, leading to a reduced emphasis on the threat of "peaceful evolution."</p>

Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people to the field, offering competitive wages and on-the-job training. The article also notes that a shortfall of air traffic controllers has stifled airline growth and raised safety concerns.</p>

          <p>This article recounts a humorous trip to Paris, inspired by Mark Twain's *The Innocents Abroad*, where the author, Caity Weaver, found the city intimidating and struggled to find enjoyable food, save for the butter. Weaver describes the butter as having a rich, deep yellow color and a creamy texture, comparing it to "movie theater butter" and "a padded cell." She also recounts an anecdote about encountering other Americans in her hotel lobby trying to figure out how to transport butter home, and about eating a large quantity of saucisson in her hotel room.</p>

The Socorristas' rigorous data collection and training methods have made them international experts on self-managed abortion, contributing to the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>
