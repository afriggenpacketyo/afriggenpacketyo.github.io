          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has indicated a willingness to deepen dialogue with other nations regarding export controls on rare earth minerals, approving some export applications. The move comes as global demand for these minerals, particularly medium and heavy rare earths, increases in sectors like robotics and new energy vehicles. China, recognizing its role as a responsible major power, is taking into account the legitimate civilian needs of other countries. This development is significant amid ongoing trade negotiations with the United States, where rare earths are a key point of discussion. The willingness to discuss rare earth exports could ease trade tensions.</p>

The study, published in Science, demonstrates the potential for treating human blindness. Tellurium's photoelectric properties allow it to convert light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, replacing photoreceptor cells in the retina. The advance offers hope for restoring vision to those with retinal damage. The study highlights the potential of rare minerals in medical applications.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco cards are not valid forms of identification for boarding domestic flights. This announcement follows the implementation of the REAL ID Act, which requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The TSA's Facebook post humorously emphasized that while they appreciate Costco's offerings, membership cards do not meet federal ID requirements. The confusion likely stems from the presence of stars on Costco cards, similar to the markings on REAL ID-compliant cards. Travelers must ensure they have proper identification to avoid issues at airport security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research, co-authored by Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce greater long-term fertility gains than subsidizing mothers alone. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce. The study highlights the need to address traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women. The new approach could change the course of China's demographic trajectory.</p>
