        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese technology giant Baidu has announced the most significant update to its search platform in a decade, integrating advanced artificial intelligence capabilities. The new search box is designed to handle complex prompts thousands of words long, moving beyond simple keyword retrieval. The upgrade incorporates AI agents, which are programs capable of autonomously planning and executing tasks to help users achieve specific goals. This strategic shift reflects Baidu's ambition to transform its search engine from an information tool into a task-completion assistant.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama has announced that the institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that he might be the last to hold the title. He stated that his successor should be identified according to traditional Tibetan Buddhist practices, a clear signal against Chinese interference in the process. Beijing has repeatedly claimed it has the sole authority to approve the next religious leader, creating the potential for two rival Dalai Lamas. The decision is politically significant for Tibetans seeking to preserve their cultural and religious identity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As extreme weather events become more frequent, homeowners are advised to take proactive measures to weather-proof their properties, which can help lower insurance premiums. Recommendations include performing regular roof maintenance, installing storm shutters, and sealing gaps around windows and doors to prevent wind and water damage. Additionally, clearing outdoor debris and cleaning gutters can reduce the risk of fire and water backup. Taking these steps not only enhances a home's resilience but may also qualify homeowners for discounts from insurance providers amid rising rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has issued a significant ruling, determining that a 19th-century state law does not constitute a ban on abortion. This decision clarifies a legal gray area that emerged after the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, which had caused providers in the state to halt procedures. The court's 4-3 liberal majority agreed with a lower court finding that the 1849 law was intended to address feticide, not consensual abortions. As a result, abortions can continue to be legally performed in Wisconsin up to 20 weeks.</p>

          <p>During a visit to a hospital in Essex, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, spoke candidly about the difficult recovery phase following cancer treatment. She described how patients often put on a brave face during chemotherapy, only to find the period afterward challenging as they are no longer under direct clinical care but cannot function as they once did. The princess emphasized that cancer is a life-changing experience for both the patient and their families, and that finding a 'new normal' is a difficult, non-linear process that takes time and is often a rollercoaster of emotions.</p>

          <p>After nearly two decades of failed efforts, the FBI has announced it will move its headquarters to the Ronald Reagan Building in downtown Washington, D.C. The Bureau has been located in the J. Edgar Hoover building since 1975, but that facility has been plagued by structural problems. FBI Director Kash Patel stated the move is the most cost-effective way to fulfill the agency's mission. The decision reverses a previous plan to relocate to Maryland, a move that has drawn criticism from Maryland lawmakers who argue Congress had already appropriated funds for that purpose.</p>

China's share of global capacity is expected to grow from 21% in 2024 to 30% by the end of the decade, while Taiwan currently leads with a 23% share. This forecast highlights Beijing's significant progress in its national strategy to achieve chip self-sufficiency, despite ongoing technological restrictions imposed by the United States.
