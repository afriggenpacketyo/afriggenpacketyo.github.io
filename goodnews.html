          <p>German special police units conducted raids across several cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, arresting a 27-year-old Bosnian-Herzegovinian citizen suspected of planning an Islamist terrorist attack. The investigation uncovered evidence that money obtained through commercial fraud was intended to finance the plot. The raids aimed to disrupt any further planning and gather more information about the suspected attack. The arrest is part of Germany's ongoing efforts to counter extremist threats within the country.</p>

          <p>With all 23 British players eliminated from the singles draws at Wimbledon, this article analyzes the performances and future prospects of five leading names. It reflects on the pressure players face at their home Grand Slam, where public attention is at its peak. The analysis covers Jack Draper's need for more grass-court development, Emma Raducanu's impressive form against top competition, and Katie Boulter's surprising loss. The piece also looks at Sonay Kartal's breakthrough to the fourth round and Cameron Norrie's return to form, suggesting positive future trajectories despite their exits.</p>

          <p>The Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners has unanimously voted to ceremonially rename a four-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard as "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." The roadway runs from Palm Beach International Airport to the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. In a social media post, Donald Trump thanked the county and state officials for the "wonderful honor." The renaming is ceremonial, meaning official postal addresses will not change, and the new signs are expected to be installed later this year.</p>

          <p>China has completed a 1,856-kilometer (1,153-mile) green belt designed to contain three major deserts in the Alxa league of Inner Mongolia. The project is a key part of the country's "green great wall" initiative to combat desertification. Engineers used methods like laying straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by planting drought-resistant vegetation such as sacsaoul trees. This ecological barrier aims to prevent the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts from expanding further, protecting a vast region from sandstorms and land degradation.</p>

          <p>A Delta flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale was forced to make an emergency landing in Fort Myers, Florida, after a passenger's portable battery caught fire. Flight attendants successfully extinguished the blaze, but the residual smoke in the cabin prompted the diversion. This incident highlights a growing safety concern, as the Federal Aviation Administration reports that lithium battery fires on U.S. flights have increased significantly, now occurring nearly twice a week. In response to this risk, some airlines are implementing stricter rules requiring portable chargers to be used in plain sight.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that as the United States scales back its role in international development under an "America first" policy, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a new hub for global public goods. The article contrasts the dismantling of U.S. aid institutions with China's proactive initiatives, such as the new International Organisation for Mediation based in Hong Kong. The author suggests that the center of gravity for global cooperation is shifting eastward. This provides an opportunity for Hong Kong, as China's most cosmopolitan city, to harness this momentum and increase its international prominence.</p>

Her detention sparked a surge of community support, including from neighbors and local officials, who advocated on her behalf.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a scheme that uses fraudulent IT workers to fund the regime's weapons programs. The scheme involves North Korean operatives, primarily in China and Russia, using stolen American identities to get remote work at foreign companies. The wages earned are then funneled back to North Korea. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt Pyongyang's illicit revenue streams, which rely on cyber theft and other malicious online activities.</p>

These homes often feature aerodynamic shapes, reinforced roofs, and foundations anchored deep into the ground to withstand high winds and flooding. Builders like Deltec Homes specialize in these designs, which can cost more upfront but may save money long-term through lower insurance rates and reduced damage. Engineering institutes are also testing building materials and methods to make both new and existing homes stronger against the forces of nature.</p>
