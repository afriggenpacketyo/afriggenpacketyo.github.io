          <p>AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave's first earnings report since its IPO revealed revenue exceeding expectations, with a remarkable 420% year-over-year increase. The company anticipates robust growth for 2025, projecting revenues between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. CoreWeave's CEO, Mike Intrator, attributed the higher capital spending to new clients acquiring additional infrastructure. The article notes that OpenAI committed to a five-year deal worth up to $11.9 billion with CoreWeave during the first quarter. The company's future growth hinges on securing adequate power for its expanding data centers, with plans to more than double deployed power by year's end.</p>

          <p>China is initiating recruitment programs aimed at attracting Chinese-born researchers considering leaving the United States, spurred by funding cuts and perceived declining academic freedom. One program offers postdoctoral positions with salaries approaching $100,000 per year for three years, significantly higher than typical postdoctoral pay in both China and the U.S. The move comes as scientists in the U.S. experience increased scrutiny and challenges. A leading Chinese-American biologist notes that many are contemplating such moves but are unlikely to disclose their decisions prematurely.</p>

          <p>In-N-Out Burger is modifying its menu by removing artificial coloring from its Strawberry Shakes and Signature Pink Lemonade, aligning with the trend of eliminating synthetic dyes from food products. The fast-food chain is also transitioning to ketchup made with real sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup. This follows the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA announcing a ban on petroleum-based synthetic dyes due to health concerns. The FDA has recently approved three natural-source colors for use in food items.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed halting enrollment in the state's healthcare program for low-income immigrants without legal status starting in 2026, citing higher-than-expected costs and economic uncertainty. Those already enrolled will face a $100 monthly premium beginning in 2027. Newsom attributes the budget shortfall to the "Trump slump" and the impact of federal tariff policies. The changes aim to save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029. This decision marks a shift from Newsom's previous commitment to expanding healthcare access to all, regardless of immigration status.</p>

The move aims to attract audiences back to theaters after the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision comes as box-office revenue has been improving, with analysts predicting a rise in total North American box-office grosses. The initiative will test whether it cannibalizes higher-priced attendance on other days, and is a move to increase concession sales and expose audiences to trailers for new films.

He used his platform to warn against greed and excessive materialism. His austere lifestyle made him revered by many Uruguayans and gave him a platform to advocate for a more equitable society.
