          <p>Sandwich chain Subway has named Jonathan Fitzpatrick, a former Burger King and Driven Brands executive, as its new CEO, effective July 28. Fitzpatrick succeeds John Chidsey, who retired after overseeing the company's sale to Roark Capital. This leadership change occurs as fast-food restaurants face challenges like declining consumer spending and intense competition, with customers seeking more deals. Subway, despite being the largest U.S. chain by store count, has seen its market share erode over the past 15 years, reporting a 3.8% sales decrease last year.</p>

          <p>A tax extension provides taxpayers with additional time to file their returns, typically six months, but it does not delay the payment deadline for owed taxes. The IRS still expects estimated tax liability to be paid by the original April 15 deadline to avoid late payment penalties and interest charges. If unable to pay in full, taxpayers have options such as installment agreements, Offers in Compromise for financial hardship, or requesting Currently Not Collectible status. Consulting a tax relief professional can help navigate these complex IRS programs and minimize financial repercussions.</p>

          <p>As July concludes, market experts are divided on whether gold prices will hit $3,500 per ounce, following a strong rally earlier in the year and subsequent consolidation. Some analysts, like Ben Nadelstein, believe this target is unlikely without significant shifts in Federal Reserve policy or leadership. Others, such as Brett Elliott, suggest a "black swan event" or trade policy developments could provide the necessary catalyst for a sudden surge. Key factors influencing gold's near-term performance include central bank activity, geopolitical events, inflation data, and U.S. dollar movements, keeping investors watchful.

          <p>Despite the growing popularity and increased investment in women's football across Europe, Eastern European nations, with the exception of Poland's recent debut, have largely failed to qualify for major tournaments like Euro 2025. Experts attribute this lag to a combination of historical factors, including a late start in establishing women's programs and a lack of investment compared to Western Europe. Societal norms, which often discourage female participation in sports, and the lingering effects of post-communist economic struggles also contribute to the disparity. UEFA initiatives are helping, but significant cultural and infrastructural changes are still needed for the region to catch up.</p>
