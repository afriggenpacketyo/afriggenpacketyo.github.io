          <p>Senior U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed on a framework to move forward with trade talks after disputes over visas, minerals, and microchips threatened to derail progress. This agreement followed two days of talks in London and a phone call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping aimed at easing tensions. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that both sides will seek approval from their respective leaders to implement the framework, which builds upon a previous 90-day suspension of tariffs agreed to in Geneva. The disputes had eroded nearly a third of the 90-day window for resolving trade issues, including unfair trade practices and export controls, before tariffs were set to resume.

          <p>The U.S. Army is deploying SMASH 2000L smart scopes, made by Israeli company Smart Shooter Ltd., which use cameras, sensors, and AI to track and engage drones, ensuring a high probability of a hit before firing. This technology allows individual soldiers to effectively counter drone threats without needing extensive support. The Army awarded Smart Shooter a $13 million contract for these scopes under the Transformation In Contact (TIC 2.0) program, aimed at rapidly equipping soldiers with useful technology. The scopes, weighing about 2.5 pounds, are compatible with standard-issue rifles and have been tested in combat zones and used by NATO partners. The deployment comes as small, inexpensive drones are increasingly used for reconnaissance and attacks in modern warfare. The optimism score is calculated based on the fact that there is a new form of military defense that does not involve human-to-human contact, thus reducing the risk of human casualties.</p>

This move reflects Zuckerberg's desire to improve Meta's AI execution after lukewarm reception of recent Llama AI models. Meta's strategy mirrors other tech giants like Google and Microsoft, who have brought in AI leaders from startups through significant investments rather than outright acquisitions. Zuckerberg admires Wang's ambition and technical understanding, believing he can help Meta compete with rivals like OpenAI and DeepSeek.</p>
