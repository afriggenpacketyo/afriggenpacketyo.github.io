          <p>A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning and evacuations in some coastal communities like Seward. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory before being canceled entirely by the National Weather Service. The earthquake occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point at a shallow depth, but officials stated that large, widespread waves were not expected. While the quake was felt across the Alaska Peninsula, there was no danger to Anchorage, and the event concluded with no reports of significant damage or injuries.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry visited Angola to support the Halo Trust, a charity dedicated to clearing landmines, continuing the humanitarian work famously championed by his mother, Princess Diana, in 1997. During his visit, the Duke of Sussex met with children learning to avoid explosives and emphasized that they should not have to live in fear. His trip echoed his mother's iconic walk through an Angolan minefield, which brought global attention to the issue. The Halo Trust has cleared 120,000 landmines in the country, but an estimated thousand minefields remain from the nation's long civil war.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of devastating floods in Texas, a specialized search and rescue team from the Czech Republic has joined the Texas National Guard to aid in recovery efforts. The collaboration is part of the National Guard's State Partnership Program, which has paired Texas with the Czech Republic since 1993. The Czech team, including four cadaver dogs, is assisting in the search for approximately 100 people still missing. This international support follows a mission last year where the Texas Air National Guard used a drone to assist with flood assessment in the Czech Republic, highlighting the reciprocal nature of the partnership.</p>

          <p>In a novel approach to sustainable energy, used electric vehicle batteries are being given a second life powering data centers for the artificial intelligence industry. AI cloud platform Crusoe is using recycled batteries from Nevada-based Redwood Materials to store solar energy, providing reliable, renewable power for its operations. As the AI boom strains electricity grids, this innovative solution offers an alternative to building new gas-fired power plants. Experts believe this modular system is highly scalable and can help sidestep the significant energy consumption challenges associated with the rapid growth of AI.</p>

          <h2>Congress Passes Bipartisan Bill to Help Veterans Avoid Home Foreclosure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing thousands of veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The legislation provides a crucial fix after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ended a homeowner assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer options than other homeowners. The new law will allow veterans who have fallen behind on mortgage payments to move their missed payments to the end of their loan term, making their loans current. This measure was widely supported by lawmakers and industry groups as a necessary tool to help veterans facing financial hardship stay in their homes.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued from a remote California forest after she left a trail of handwritten notes for searchers to follow. The pair became lost after their vehicle's GPS led them onto remote roads where they lost signal. The Calaveras County search-and-rescue team found the notes, which pleaded for help and provided contact information, leading them directly to the stranded vehicle. Authorities praised the mother for her resourcefulness and for having notified someone of their travel plans, which was instrumental in initiating the successful search operation.</p>
