          <p>The aviation industry is projected to experience improved profitability in 2025, despite forecasts of slower global gross domestic product growth. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) anticipates increases in revenue, operating profits, and net profits for the sector. Net profits are expected to reach $36 billion in 2025, up from $32.4 billion in 2024, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are also expected to hit a record high, averaging 84% due to challenges in fleet expansion and modernization amid supply chain issues.</p>

The MLS Players Association expressed solidarity with the players, arguing they deserve a fair share of the prize money. FIFA will pay MLS teams large amounts to participate, but the league has allegedly refused to allocate a fair percentage of those funds to the players. The current collective bargaining agreement caps player earnings at 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, up to $1 million for the entire team.</p>
