        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new German government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has begun enforcing stricter border controls, turning away asylum seekers at its borders with other European countries. According to Bild am Sonntag, 19 asylum seekers were among the 286 migrants and refugees sent back out of 365 undocumented entries over two days. The move is justified by Merz as necessary because Germany is surrounded by safe EU states where migrants should initially seek refuge. The policy has drawn criticism from German politicians and neighboring EU countries, who argue it violates European law and disrupts the EU's internal market, while polls indicate that approximately two-thirds of Germans support the measure.</p>

          <p>Conservative evangelical leaders are appealing to President Trump to protect Christian Afghan refugees facing deportation to Afghanistan, where they risk persecution and martyrdom under the Taliban regime. Despite Trump's commitment to border security, these leaders argue for the legal immigration and protection of carefully vetted refugees, especially those facing religious persecution. They emphasize the moral responsibility to welcome refugees, citing the Southern Baptist Convention's stance and the support of a majority of evangelical Christians.

          <p>This article addresses concerns about capital gains taxes from selling a long-time home, especially when transitioning to assisted living. It explains that capital gains are calculated by deducting the tax basis (purchase price, construction costs, and qualifying home improvements) from the sale proceeds. Up to $500,000 in profits can be sheltered from capital gains taxes for married couples. The article clarifies that what you do with the money from the sale does not affect the capital gains taxes owed, and it suggests consulting a tax professional for personalized advice and exploring options like installment sales or renting the property.</p>
