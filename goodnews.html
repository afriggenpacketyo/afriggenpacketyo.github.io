          <p>Rachel Feintzeig reflects on her obsession with the HBO series "The Last of Us," finding that the fictional horrors of a zombie apocalypse provide a welcome distraction from the anxieties of real-world events. She explains that immersing herself in the show allows her to escape from the overwhelming issues of 2025, offering a temporary reprieve from the relentless news cycle. Feintzeig acknowledges the absurdity of her fascination but argues that sometimes, confronting a fictional nightmare is easier than facing the complexities of reality. She humorously concludes that while others work to solve real-world problems, she chooses to escape into the world of zombies.</p>

          <p>Cole Hauser, the "Yellowstone" actor, emphasizes the importance of supporting veterans every day, not just on Memorial Day. Hauser, who is involved with the Warrior Foundation and his coffee company, Free Reign, is committed to helping veterans achieve their goals, particularly given the mental and physical challenges they face. Free Reign's "Buy a Bag, Give a Cup" initiative donates coffee to veterans, active-duty military personnel, first responders, nurses, and teachers for every bag purchased. Hauser also discusses his upcoming role in a "Yellowstone" spin-off and his passion for horsemanship, which he has honed through his role on the show.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease under the leadership of the new farm minister, following the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The poll also revealed that 44.7% of respondents believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target lower than that pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The survey further showed that 42.2% felt the removal of the former farm minister should have occurred sooner, reflecting public dissatisfaction with the previous administration's handling of rice price inflation.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has committed to enhancing the treatment and working conditions of Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel, acknowledging the increasingly challenging security environment they face. This pledge follows the enactment of a revised law that includes increased allowances for SDF members, addressing a shortage of recruits. Ishiba emphasized the government's commitment to safeguarding Japan's independence and peace, citing concerns over China's maritime assertiveness, North Korea's missile launches, and Russia's actions in Ukraine. The move also aims to restore public trust in the SDF after recent scandals.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government. While the government touts this as a "new dawn for rail," promises of lower fares are absent, with focus instead on service improvements and infrastructure investment. Unions have voiced concerns regarding the potential outsourcing of staffing for security and cleaning to private companies. The opposition Conservatives have called on Labour to deliver on their promises, as the DfT takes over responsibility for SWR and integrates it into Great British Railways (GBR).</p>

          <p>The European Union is currently engaged in a trade dispute with China regarding electric vehicles, raising questions about the continent's approach to Chinese investment in the sector. While some view Chinese investment as a potential job creator, others fear it could undermine the existing European industry. French President Emmanuel Macron recently met with Wen Han, a Chinese entrepreneur whose company, Windrose Technology, plans to build an electric lorry factory in France. Han believes his company can bring a whole ecosystem to France, as Macron expressed a desire for him to do.</p>

The stock's decline doesn't reflect a broken business, just a normalization of demand after a historic boom. Revenue in the first quarter of 2025 fell 4% year over year to $1.07 billion, but sales only declined 2% when the same selling days of the year-ago quarter and the most recent quarter were compared.

          <p>Following the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, a virologist from Nottingham urges the public to remain calm while acknowledging the potential for mosquito-borne diseases to increase in range due to climate change. Fragments of the virus were found in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, prompting increased surveillance in the area. While most infected individuals show no symptoms or mild fever-like symptoms, a small percentage can develop more severe disease. The expert advises taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as covering up and using insecticide, as a general measure.</p>

Residents across the region reported a loud boom and shaking sensation, which SpaceX confirmed was due to the unpiloted spacecraft's return. The Dragon capsule had transported supplies and equipment to the International Space Station and was on its way to a splashdown off the coast of California. Sonic booms have become a point of contention for Southern Californians near Vandenberg Space Force Base due to increased rocket launches and landings.</p>
