          <p>The UK and Irish governments have unveiled a new framework to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles, replacing the controversial Legacy Act. The deal aims to provide reconciliation and justice for victims by establishing a reformed Legacy Commission with independent oversight and cross-border cooperation, including a new legacy unit within the Irish police. While acknowledging that trust is shattered, officials hope the "honest attempt" will win the confidence of victims over time and represent a final opportunity to heal deep wounds from the conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, criticizing the 85-page complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible" for its excessive length and florid detail. The judge, Steven Merryday, cited violations of federal rules requiring concise allegations, pointing to superfluous references to "The Apprentice" and the "Russia Collusion Hoax." Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file a shorter, amended complaint, limited to 40 pages, allowing the case to potentially proceed in a more focused form.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated he does not believe President Trump's tariffs will have a significant inflationary effect on the U.S. economy, placing him in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee. Miran, who was the lone dissenter in the recent vote to cut interest rates, argued that there is no evidence of macroeconomically significant inflation from tariffs, citing a lack of differential inflation in import-intensive goods. He anticipates stronger economic growth in the second half of the year and suggests that changes in immigration policy could have a disinflationary effect. (not investment advice)</p>

The situation has highlighted broader customer service issues at the cryptocurrency exchange, prompting Armstrong to state that the company is putting a "big focus on getting better" at user support.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran clarified that he was not pressured by President Donald Trump on how to vote during the recent interest-rate decision meeting. Miran stated that Trump called him only to offer congratulations on his confirmation and that they did not discuss monetary policy or his economic projections. This comes amid heightened scrutiny over the Federal Reserve's independence, as Miran's dissenting vote for a larger rate cut has raised questions about potential political influence, which he firmly denies.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with several state attorneys general, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster, accusing them of facilitating illegal ticket reselling. The complaint alleges that the companies enabled brokers to acquire large quantities of tickets, leading to inflated prices for consumers and costing them billions. The lawsuit also claims Ticketmaster engaged in deceptive "bait-and-switch pricing" tactics, further harming consumers in a market where the company controls an estimated 80% of primary ticket sales for major venues.</p>

While market-cap-weighted funds like the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) are dominated by giants like Nvidia, alternative strategies are gaining traction. Equal-weighted ETFs such as the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) offer broader exposure across the industry, reducing single-stock risk by giving smaller companies equal representation, which can be beneficial if the sector's growth extends beyond its largest players.

          <p>The recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has made home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) more affordable for homeowners looking to tap into their equity. A $50,000 HELOC with a 10-year term now costs approximately $608 per month, down from over $640 last year, reflecting the drop in the average interest rate to around 8.05%. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they can adjust downward with Fed cuts, making them cheaper than fixed-rate home equity loans, although borrowers must also account for potential volatility.

This downward trend is energizing the housing market, but the extent of the drop depends heavily on future inflation data, with sticky inflation posing a risk that could keep rates closer to 6%.
