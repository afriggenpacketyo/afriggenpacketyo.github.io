          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that a significant majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, are in favor of the United States returning to the moon and pursuing a mission to Mars. This support is particularly strong among younger generations who did not witness the original moon landing and cuts across various political and ideological lines. The survey also highlights that the 1969 moon landing is still widely regarded as a worthwhile achievement, contributing to national pride and technological advancement. The poll indicates a broad, positive public sentiment towards future space exploration endeavors.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are making significant inroads in the global AI landscape by championing open-source models. The release of powerful, freely accessible large language models is providing a strong alternative to the closed systems offered by US giants like OpenAI and Google. This open-source approach fosters global collaboration and has spurred a wave of AI applications within China. Analysts suggest that this movement poses a serious competitive challenge to the dominance of proprietary AI from Silicon Valley, potentially reshaping the future of artificial intelligence development.</p>

          <p>In the occupied West Bank, where there are no active airports for Palestinians, a unique airplane-shaped guesthouse is capturing local attention. Built by Minwer Harsha, the concrete structure serves as a novel attraction and a symbol of aspiration, allowing people to experience the idea of air travel. The project, located in Area C under full Israeli control, was designed to be apolitical to avoid potential issues. Harsha hopes his creative use of land inspires other Palestinians and plans to build a ship-themed guesthouse next, offering another experience many in the landlocked territory have never had.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly." This development comes as his administration continues to advocate for a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The proposed deal reportedly includes the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement was made during a White House dinner, where Trump praised the efforts of his Middle East envoy in the ongoing, delicate negotiations.</p>

          <p>Scott Harrison, a retired Marine, has turned a vision that helped him survive the Vietnam War into a beloved community attraction in Nederland, Colorado. During the war, Harrison would listen to a music box and imagine a peaceful carousel to cope with the trauma. After battling PTSD for years, he decided to make that vision a reality, buying and restoring a broken-down carousel over 26 years. Now a nonprofit called the "Carousel of Happiness," it has brought joy to over a million visitors and has been instrumental in Harrison's own healing journey.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bipartisan bill creating the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation establishes consumer protections and clear legal definitions, allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars. Supporters believe this will facilitate faster, lower-cost transactions and integrate digital currency into the mainstream financial system. At the signing, Trump hailed the law as a potential revolution in financial technology and a massive validation for the crypto community. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must adapt its rules to address the rise of tokenized assets, particularly stablecoins. Shin Hyun-Song, a BIS economic adviser, warned that the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of stablecoins presents significant challenges for anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer requirements. The statement comes as the market for digital currencies grows, spurred by the Trump administration's supportive stance.

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged more than 10% in extended trading after it was announced the company will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index funds and other portfolio managers must purchase the shares to rebalance their holdings. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's addition reflects the growing influence of technology companies within the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella. The condition, described as "benign and common" in people over 70, occurs when veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool in the legs. Dr. Barbabella confirmed the diagnosis with ultrasound tests and blood work, ruling out more serious issues like blood clots. He stated the president remains in "excellent health" and that the condition is manageable with lifestyle changes.</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its next phase: a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the site aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other high-tech industries, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project's CEO pitched the plan as a way to restore the "designed in California, made in California" model. While supported by tech industry figures, the project continues to face skepticism from local residents and community groups.</p>

          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists report that the UK is experiencing a significant increase in its wasp population this summer. The surge is attributed to favorable weather conditions, including a very warm and dry spring, which created an ideal environment for wasps to thrive. While most of the UK's 9,000 wasp species are solitary, the social wasps that cause nuisance are more prevalent. Experts remind the public that despite their reputation, wasps are crucial apex predators in the ecosystem, acting as natural pest controllers. They advise staying calm to avoid being stung.</p>

          <p>A new fantasy stage show in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a medieval fantasy epic. Written by Helen Serafinowicz, a co-creator of "Motherland," the comedy spoofs J.R.R. Tolkien's work and is loosely based on a tabloid myth about Coleen's engagement ring. The writer and cast insist the show is an affectionate homage to the couple, celebrating their resilience as "heroic" figures who have vanquished foes on and off the pitch. The play is presented as a fun fantasy tale rather than a direct critique.</p>

The new program will offer a single long-acting injection which provides about 80% protection against the common and highly infectious virus. Health officials state this will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness by reducing hospital admissions and pressure on emergency departments, offering vulnerable children better protection against serious illness.</p>

The girl had been abducted by men intending to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to reports from the time, the lions chased off her captors and then "stood guard" over her until she was found by police. Wildlife experts speculated that the girl's crying may have sounded like a lion cub's mewing, preventing the lions from attacking her. The event was widely considered a miracle in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in people with a certain variant of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system overreacts to a substance produced by gut bacteria, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The discovery could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway rather than broadly suppressing the immune system.</p>
