          <p>The US Men's National Team played to a 1-1 draw against Ecuador in Austin, Texas, with Folarin Balogun scoring the equalizer in the 71st minute, marking his second consecutive goal for the team. Despite controlling possession and constructing attractive offensive plays, the US players felt the outcome was less than their performance deserved against a disciplined Ecuadorian defense. Coach Mauricio Pochettino continues to emphasize long-term development for the 2026 World Cup, prioritizing strong performances over immediate results. This game, coupled with an encouraging display against Japan, highlights the team's increasing comfort with a three-man backline and overall progress in competing with formidable international opponents, suggesting a positive trajectory for the squad.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Aces secured their third WNBA championship in four seasons, defeating the Phoenix Mercury 97-86 in a four-game sweep of the Finals. A'ja Wilson delivered a stellar performance with 31 points, complemented by 18 points each from Chelsea Gray and Jackie Young. The Aces dominated offensively throughout the series, consistently scoring over 90 points per game. Although the Mercury mounted a brief comeback in the fourth quarter, the Aces maintained their lead, never trailing in the decisive game. Phoenix faced challenges, including the absence of injured forward Satou Sabally and the ejection of coach Nate Tibbetts, ultimately unable to slow down the powerful Las Vegas squad.</p>

          <p>British band Wolf Alice has received their fourth consecutive Mercury Prize nomination for their new album, "The Clearing," a unique achievement in the award's history. Despite singer Ellie Rowsell's anxiety about awards, the band takes album creation seriously, viewing a good album as one of the highest forms of art. Guitarist Joff Oddie emphasized the band's progression through their albums, culminating in "The Clearing," which embraces 1970s FM pop radio sounds, a stylistic turn from their earlier alt-rock. This evolution reflects their diverse tastes and a newfound confidence in connecting with audiences through varied musical expressions, even if it surprised some critics.</p>

          <p>Maiwand Banayee, a 45-year-old former Taliban fighter, has written a book, "Delusions of Paradise," detailing his journey from being ready to die for the Taliban to deradicalization. Radicalized at 14 in a Pakistani refugee camp during the Afghan civil war, Banayee was lured by promises of glory and an erotic afterlife. He joined the Taliban in 1996, enforcing their laws and propaganda, but began questioning his path after witnessing cruelty and disrespect. Now living in the UK, he works for the NHS and hopes his story will prevent a new generation from being exposed to extremism, especially with the rise of religious schools in Afghanistan since the Taliban's 2021 return to power.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Combating "Autumn Blues" and Seasonal Mood Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 22:19:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many people experience "autumn blues" as days shorten, leading to tiredness and lethargy, often linked to decreased serotonin and increased melatonin. The article highlights two main approaches to combat this seasonal shift. Some, like Lotts Dlandu, actively combat it by planning social events, avoiding working from home, and maximizing exposure to natural light. Others embrace the season by creating a cozy environment with baths, candles, and warm drinks, romanticizing the colder months. Experts emphasize the importance of a balanced diet, exercise, time outdoors, and consistent sleep schedules. For more severe symptoms, seasonal affective disorder (SAD) may be a factor, warranting a GP visit.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump underwent a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, just six months after his annual physical. His physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella, stated that Trump "successfully completed a scheduled follow-up evaluation," including advanced imaging and laboratory testing, which were deemed "exceptional." The report highlighted his "excellent overall health" and a "cardiac age" 14 years younger than his chronological age of 79. This visit, described by Trump as a "semiannual physical," occurred as he prepared for a trip to the Middle East, and aimed to dispel rumors about his health, which had been fueled by recent public appearances.</p>

          <p>A detailed timeline reveals the intricate monthslong negotiations that led to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, the first phase of President Trump's 20-point peace plan. The deal, which began with Hamas accepting an Egyptian-Qatari proposal in August, involves Israeli troop withdrawal, a 72-hour countdown for Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages, and Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners and aid flow into Gaza. Key moments included US envoys refining the plan with Qatari, Turkish, and Egyptian leaders, and an apology from Israeli PM Netanyahu to Qatar for a past airstrike. The negotiations, marked by "serious breakthroughs," aimed to build trust and ensure compliance, with the ultimate goal of an "almost permanent ceasefire."</p>

          <p>Maria Corina Machado, leader of Venezuela's pro-democracy movement, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which she views as a message to Venezuelans that "we are not alone." The Norwegian Nobel Committee recognized Machado for "keeping the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness" in Venezuela, where she has challenged authoritarian leaders for over two decades. Despite living in hiding due to threats from President Nicolas Maduro's regime, Machado sees the award as offering significant protection and highlighting the global importance of their struggle. She also reportedly spoke with President Trump, thanking him for his support and expressing confidence in Venezuela's commitment to freedom.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's continued prominence as a premier international financial center is contingent on its adaptation to China's evolving economic landscape, specifically Beijing's strategic shift towards tech self-sufficiency and advanced manufacturing. Wang Lei, CEO of Huatai Financial Holdings, underscored that the city's historical success has always been tied to meeting the mainland's financing demands. He advocates for Hong Kong to develop "financial frameworks focusing on specialized technology sectors" to cater to the capital needs of global companies. This proactive alignment with China's new economic priorities presents a tremendous opportunity for Hong Kong to ensure its future relevance and harness significant growth in the era of technological advancement.

          <p>The Trump administration announced a deal with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, which will offer discounted prescription drug prices to Medicaid patients and list "all primary care medications" on the upcoming "TrumpRx" website. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will charge Medicaid patients "most-favored-nation" prices, matching the lowest rates offered in other high-income countries, and guarantee this pricing for new drugs. This follows a similar deal with Pfizer, aiming to make medicines more affordable. While the administration touts potential savings, experts caution that Medicaid already receives low prices, and the direct-to-patient website's impact on insured individuals may be limited. AstraZeneca also committed to investing in US manufacturing, potentially avoiding future tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, has retired to the country after sustaining injuries during a runaway incident in central London. Quaker was one of five horses spooked by construction noise, leading to them bolting through the city, colliding with vehicles, and causing injuries to personnel and the animals themselves. Quaker suffered bleeding and a small break, necessitating surgery and ultimately preventing his return to duty, unlike the other four horses. The Horse Trust sanctuary, which provides respite and retirement for military horses, has taken Quaker in, ensuring he can enjoy a peaceful life after his service.</p>

Seven suspects were arrested in what marks the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years.

          <p>Major U.S. online retailers have removed millions of listings for prohibited Chinese electronics, including home security cameras and smartwatches from companies like Huawei and Hikvision, following a crackdown by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). FCC Chair Brendan Carr stated these items were either on a U.S. barred list or unauthorized, posing national security risks by potentially allowing China to surveil Americans or disrupt communications. The FCC plans further restrictions, including a vote this month to prohibit authorization of devices with Covered List components and potentially ban previously authorized equipment. This action is part of broader U.S. efforts against Chinese tech companies deemed national security threats.</p>

While passports have been issued in the King's name since 2023, this change finalizes the transition of royal insignia on the cover, replacing Queen Elizabeth II's coat of arms. The government advises citizens to check passport validity and renew in advance of travel, emphasizing the blend of British heritage with modern security.</p>
