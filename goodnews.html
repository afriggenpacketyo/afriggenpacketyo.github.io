          <h2>Karen Read Retrial: Juror Questions May Favor Defense on Manslaughter Charge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 12:05:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the retrial of Karen Read, jurors' questions suggest they are focusing on the lesser charge of operating under the influence (OUI) rather than the more serious charge of first-degree murder in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe. The questions included the timeframe for the OUI charge and whether convicting on a subcharge convicts the overall charge, indicating a focus on the role of alcohol in the case. Experts suggest that these questions are a positive sign for the defense, as they imply the jury is considering a lesser included charge. Read's first trial ended in a hung jury, and the defense has warned that the existing verdict slip could confuse the jury. The focus on the OUI charge suggests the jury is grappling with the impact of alcohol consumption on the events leading to O'Keefe's death. </p>

          <p>A $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family has gained backing from 55 attorneys general nationwide, resolving claims related to the opioid crisis. The settlement aims to end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, prevent the family from selling opioids in the U.S., and provide funds for opioid crisis abatement. Over half of the funds will be distributed within the first few years, with individual states receiving varying amounts. The settlement leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The funds will be used to compensate victims, address the opioid crisis, and provide overdose rescue medicines. </p>

          <p>Sarah Lin, a high school student from the Bronx, is advocating for the passage of the Open Captioning Accessibility Act in New York, which would mandate that movie theaters offer showings with open captions. Lin's motivation stems from her mother's progressive hearing loss and the challenges faced by the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in accessing movies. Closed captioning is seen as a more reliable option compared to assistive devices, which have been reported to be faulty. Lin hopes that the act will not only pass in New York but also serve as a model for national legislation, encouraging other states to follow suit and improve accessibility for all. The act aims to ensure that individuals with hearing difficulties can fully enjoy the moviegoing experience. </p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial dyes from its products sold in the U.S. by the end of 2027, and will immediately cease making new products containing these dyes. This decision aligns with a broader push from U.S. health officials to replace synthetic food dyes with natural alternatives. The company has already invested in removing or replacing artificial colors in some products, such as Kraft Mac & Cheese, while others, like Heinz Tomato Ketchup, never contained dyes. The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes, but is working to eliminate them by the end of 2026 through voluntary efforts from the food industry. This move reflects growing consumer demand for healthier food options. </p>

The growth in streaming is attributed to free ad-supported streaming TV offerings, the rise of YouTube, and shifts within legacy media companies to reach streaming-centric consumers.

          <p>The article explores the evolving ideals of female strength and body image, noting a shift from thinness to a focus on wellness and strength training. While muscles have traditionally symbolized male strength, women are increasingly embracing strength training, challenging conventional beauty standards. However, the pursuit of strength can also lead to optimization traps, mirroring past obsessions with thinness. The article discusses how cultural associations with strength and muscles can vary based on gender and race, and how the wellness industry often promotes unattainable ideals. Ultimately, the article suggests that focusing on the functional benefits of muscles and the joy of movement can be more empowering than fixating on their symbolic value. </p>
