        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a decline after Warren Buffett revealed his plans to step down as CEO, naming Greg Abel as his successor, and the company reported a drop in earnings. Buffett, at 94, will transition out of the CEO role on January 1, 2026, remaining as chairman to mentor Abel. Investors are processing the implications of this leadership change, though analysts believe Buffett's continued involvement will provide stability during the transition. The company's Class A shares fell nearly 4%, reflecting market uncertainty despite Berkshire's recent peak performance.</p>

          <p>Footwear company Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, marking the end of its public trading after nearly three decades. The acquisition, representing a 30% premium, occurs during a challenging period for the retail industry, particularly the footwear sector, which is affected by discretionary spending and global trade uncertainties. While Skechers withdrew its full-year guidance due to macroeconomic factors, 3G Capital remains optimistic about the company's long-term growth potential. Following the completion of the acquisition, Robert Greenberg will continue to serve as Skechers' CEO.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is facing opposition from residents in West Lake Hills, Texas, over unpermitted construction at his mansion, including a tall fence and metal gate.

          <p>Amanda Hess's new book, "Second Life: Having a Child in the Digital Age," explores the pervasive trend of seeking expertise and control in parenthood through online resources. Hess examines the apps, gadgets, and experts that promise to optimize every aspect of child-rearing, from sleep patterns to emotional development. The article highlights the illusion of control that these tools offer, contrasting it with the unpredictable reality of raising children. Ultimately, Hess suggests that the true meaning of parenthood lies in embracing the lack of control and the unique challenges that come with it.</p>

          <p>An analysis of recent Australian election results suggests that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation no longer holds the sway it once did in influencing voters. Despite consistently supporting conservative candidates, News Corp's outlets have failed to deliver victories, prompting a reassessment of their impact on public opinion. The decline in influence is attributed to the fragmentation of media consumption and a growing distrust in opinionated news sources. The article urges progressives to move beyond reacting to News Corp and focus on developing their own agendas and engaging with the world as it is.</p>
