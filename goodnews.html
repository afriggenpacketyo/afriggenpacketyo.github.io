        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A previously unknown novel by German journalist and historian Sebastian Haffner has become a bestseller in Germany, nearly a quarter-century after its discovery. Titled "Parting," the autobiographical love story was written in 1932 as the Nazi party was rising to power but was shelved by the author. The manuscript was found by Haffner's son after his death in 1999 and was finally published in June 2025. The book captures the atmosphere of late Weimar Republic Berlin, telling a story of young love set against a backdrop of impending political doom.</p>

          <p>Former Texas Congressman Colin Allred has announced he will run for the U.S. Senate in 2026, targeting the seat currently held by Republican John Cornyn. This comes just eight months after Allred's unsuccessful but high-profile campaign against Senator Ted Cruz. In his announcement video, the former NFL player and attorney criticized both Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, positioning his campaign on an anti-corruption platform. Allred, who flipped a Republican district in 2018, is entering a potentially crowded field for the Democratic nomination.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Political Protests Serve to Counter the 'Spiral of Silence'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political protests play a crucial but often overlooked role in preventing a "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where individuals wrongly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. This article argues that public demonstrations act as a powerful signal, correcting misperceptions about collective public opinion on sensitive issues like climate change or abortion rights. Research shows that after major events like Supreme Court rulings, public perception of others' beliefs shifts not toward the ruling itself, but toward the visible public reaction. By making dissent visible, protests build common knowledge and can prevent unpopular policies from persisting due to a mistakenly silent public.</p>

          <p>Denmark has implemented a new law requiring women to be included in the military conscription system alongside men when they turn 18. Under the new rules, both genders will enter a lottery that could compel them to serve an 11-month term, an increase from the previous four-month period. While women could volunteer previously, this change makes them eligible for the draft. The move follows similar policies in neighboring Norway and Sweden and comes as Denmark increases its defense spending to meet NATO targets amid heightened security concerns in Europe.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some of the 4,000 California National Guard troops currently deployed in Los Angeles back to wildfire duty. The troops were federalized by the Trump administration to respond to immigration-related protests, a move contested by Governor Gavin Newsom. With California expecting an active wildfire season, state officials have warned the deployment could hinder their firefighting capabilities. The proposal suggests returning 200 Guard members to state control to be on standby for wildfire response, addressing concerns about resource allocation during a critical time.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's recent transfer activities, including the pursuit of Brighton's Jo√£o Pedro, reflect new head coach Enzo Maresca's desire to create a more versatile and unpredictable attack. Maresca's system, which often inverts full-backs and relies on speedy wingers, struggled at times against defensive low blocks last season. The acquisition of players like Pedro, who can play as a second striker and link up play, aims to provide different tactical options beyond pure wing play. This strategy is designed to add new angles to the offense and share the creative load, making the team less reliant on a single approach.</p>

The compromise also allocates more money for child care programs, K-12 special education, and transportation projects.

The author highlights Mamdani's success in running on a practical socialist platform focused on affordability, such as rent freezes and free childcare, which resonated with a broad coalition of voters. The analysis also points to his moral integrity on issues like the Israel-Palestine conflict and his ability to mobilize a massive volunteer base as key factors that overcame significant spending by his opponents, suggesting people can overpower money.</p>

A UC working group is studying the potential change, which supporters argue would streamline collaboration, course access, and transfers across the system. However, the proposal faces opposition due to the significant estimated cost of $288 million to $371 million and concerns from faculty about increased workload. Critics also point to research showing such transitions can negatively impact student performance in the short term.</p>
