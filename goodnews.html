          <p>Allies of President Trump are beginning to request that elite law firms fulfill their commitments to provide free legal work for causes supported by him. This follows agreements between the Trump administration and several large law firms, in exchange for sparing them from executive orders, to provide nearly $1 billion in pro bono legal work. Veterans and conservative groups have been among those reaching out to firms like Skadden, Kirkland & Ellis, and Paul Weiss for assistance. However, the firms are navigating how to satisfy these commitments without compromising their autonomy or alienating their staff.</p>
