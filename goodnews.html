          <p>Shaoxing, a city in China, is implementing a unique economic stimulus by offering subsidies up to 5,000 yuan to those who host large banquets. This measure is part of a broader push by local governments to boost consumer spending in sectors like catering, cars, and housing amid strained economic growth. The policy navigates a fine line, encouraging spending while adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage extravagance. This local initiative is expected to generate an additional 178 million yuan in consumer activity this year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze over $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University. The administration had cited the university's alleged failure to address campus antisemitism, but the judge found this was used as a "smokescreen" for an ideologically motivated attack. The ruling stated the administration failed to follow legal processes before cutting off funds that supported over 900 vital research projects, including studies on cancer, Alzheimer's, and veterans' mental health. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, ranchers are challenging the industrial food system by embracing regenerative agriculture and direct-to-consumer sales models. The Mannix family, through their Old Salt Co-op, partners with other local ranches to process their own livestock and sell beef directly via restaurants, a butcher shop, and online. This approach aims to improve food security, support local producers, and promote sustainable land management. By allowing land to rest and recover, these ranchers have increased grass production even in dry years, demonstrating a resilient and ecologically beneficial model.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), a major federation of unions in the United Kingdom, is publicly urging Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider implementing wealth taxes in the upcoming budget. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak argued for a more progressive tax system to fund public services, suggesting levies on online gaming, bank windfall profits, and wealth itself. The proposal comes as the Labour government faces pressure to increase public investment while adhering to strict fiscal rules. The Treasury responded by stating that its primary focus remains on growing the economy.</p>

          <p>A former police detective shares essential advice on what to do if you are involved in a car accident, drawing from both professional experience and a recent personal head-on collision. The first crucial step is to stop the car and turn off the engine, as failing to do so is a legal offense. After checking for injuries, you should move the vehicle to a safe location if possible and activate hazard lights. The article stresses the importance of calling 999 immediately if anyone is injured, if the other driver leaves the scene, or if the road is blocked.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups have successfully negotiated an agreement in North Carolina to prevent approximately 98,000 voters from being removed from the rolls. The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Department of Justice, which had sought to disqualify voters who registered without providing a driver’s license or partial social security number. Under the new agreement, these voters will be allowed to provide the necessary information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue and ensuring their right to vote is protected.</p>

          <p>C-SPAN, the nonprofit public affairs network, has secured distribution agreements with major streaming services YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV. This move is a significant step for the organization's future, as it has faced financial deficits due to the declining number of traditional cable and satellite TV subscribers, which provide its main source of revenue. The new deals will expand access to C-SPAN's unfiltered coverage of U.S. government proceedings to millions of new subscribers nationwide. The U.S. Senate had previously passed a resolution urging streaming companies to carry the essential public service.</p>

          <p>Following a drop in Salesforce's stock after its latest earnings report, CEO Marc Benioff defended the company's performance and outlook in an interview. He described the company's results as "absolutely fantastic" and characterized its disappointing forward-looking guidance as "appropriately conservative." Benioff highlighted the success of the company's new AI agent product and noted its strong business with the U.S. government, claiming a recent competitive win over Palantir for an army contract. Despite his optimistic framing, the company's stock fell in response to concerns about slowing revenue growth.</p>

          <p>The publisher of a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre has reached an agreement with her family on a final version of the book. Relatives had publicly objected to the memoir, titled "Nobody's Girl," worrying it presented an outdated and overly positive view of her marriage, which had collapsed before her death. The publisher, Knopf, worked with Giuffre's family to add a foreword that contextualizes the narrative and outlines the changes in her life after the manuscript was completed. The family and publisher stated they both believe Giuffre's story must be heard.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova delivered a career-defining performance at the US Open, defeating Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-3 to advance to her first semi-final at the tournament.

Playing with fearless aggression, Anisimova overcame an early break to control the match with powerful groundstrokes, hitting nearly twice as many winners as unforced errors.

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District has settled a lawsuit filed five years ago by parents over educational failures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement will provide tutoring and other academic support to an estimated 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students over the next three school years. The original lawsuit alleged that LAUSD failed to provide adequate live instruction and technology, disproportionately harming Black and Latino students. While the settlement is seen as a victory for advocates, its timing means that students who were in high school when the pandemic began will not be able to benefit.</p>

          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a federal judge decided that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome web browser, a move that sent the stock of its parent company, Alphabet, soaring. While deeming Google a "monopolist" in online search, the judge spared the company the most severe penalty, calling a forced divestiture "incredibly messy and highly risky." However, the ruling did impose other remedies to foster competition, including requiring Google to share some of its valuable search data with certain rivals. The Department of Justice called the decision an important step forward in its efforts to protect consumers.</p>
