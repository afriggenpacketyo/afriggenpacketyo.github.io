          <p>Technology company Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium of firms poised to enable TikTok's continued operations in the U.S., contingent on a finalized framework deal between the United States and China. The exact structure of this multi-company agreement, including the extent of ByteDance's involvement and control over TikTok's critical recommendation algorithm, remains undefined. Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping are anticipated to discuss and potentially finalize the terms this Friday. This ongoing negotiation addresses TikTok's September 17 deadline to divest its U.S. business or face a ban, a measure upheld by the Supreme Court but repeatedly delayed by Trump's executive orders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are exploring the complex possibility of utilizing Shohei Ohtani in a bullpen role during the playoffs, in addition to his primary role as a starting pitcher. While President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman confirmed Ohtani will start, the team acknowledges that unforeseen October scenarios might necessitate relief appearances. Manager Dave Roberts and pitching coach Mark Prior have also discussed this option, drawing parallels to Walker Buehler's dual role last postseason. However, MLB's two-way rules present a logistical challenge, as Ohtani entering as a reliever would mean losing him as a designated hitter once he exits the mound, a rule Friedman believes "missed the mark."</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. and China have reached a "framework" deal for the social media platform TikTok, with commercial terms already finalized. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are slated to speak on Friday to discuss and confirm the agreement. Trump hinted on Truth Social that the deal concerns a company "young people in our Country very much wanted to save," suggesting a positive outcome. This development potentially pivots the platform to U.S.-controlled ownership, addressing the looming September 17 deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. business or face a ban, a contentious issue that has seen multiple enforcement delays by executive orders.</p>

          <p>Baker Mayfield orchestrated a thrilling 20-19 victory for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers over the Houston Texans, leading an 11-play, 80-yard game-winning drive that concluded with Rachaad White's two-yard touchdown run with only six seconds left. This dramatic comeback marked Mayfield's second consecutive game-winning drive to open the season, a historical achievement for a Buccaneers quarterback. Houston had taken a late 19-14 lead, but Mayfield's crucial 15-yard scramble on fourth-and-10 sustained the decisive drive. The victory offered redemption for the Buccaneers, reversing a previous last-second loss to the Texans in 2023.</p>

          <p>California is progressing towards designating Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as an official statewide holiday, following the recent passage of Assembly Bill 268 by the Legislature. If Governor Gavin Newsom signs the bill into law, it would permit community colleges and public schools to close on Diwali, and state employees would have the option to take the day off. Diwali, a five-day festival celebrated in October or November, signifies the Hindu new year and honors the goddess Lakshmi, representing prosperity. Proponents, including Assemblymember Ash Kalra, highlight that this recognition acknowledges the festival's cultural and religious significance, fostering greater inclusion for the Indian and South Asian diaspora within California society.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily prevented President Trump from removing Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board, just prior to a critical vote on interest rates. The court affirmed a lower court's decision, concluding that firing Cook would likely infringe upon the Federal Reserve Act, which aims to shield the central bank from political influence. Trump had based his attempt to remove her on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, which Cook has denied. This ruling is significant as it stops Trump from appointing a fourth nominee to the board, thereby preventing his nominees from forming a majority and maintaining the existing power balance as the Fed considers its first interest rate cut this year.</p>

          <p>Grammy and Oscar-winning producer Mark Ronson reflects on his formative 1990s DJ career in New York, sharing memorable anecdotes such as a mortifying mix-up while DJing for Prince and Mariah Carey's distinct song requests. His new memoir, "Night People," serves as a heartfelt homage to that vibrant era, inspired by the passing of a close friend. The book vividly captures the dynamic hip-hop scene and explores Ronson's personal need for control, which he traces back to an unstable childhood. He also recounts his experiences as a producer, notably Lady Gaga accidentally crashing his car and Amy Winehouse's intense creative period during the making of "Back to Black," viewing the DJ booth as his personal refuge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn approaches, experts offer four key strategies for decluttering homes, emphasizing its benefits for reducing stress and boosting energy. The first tip is to start small, focusing on individual drawers or cupboards to make the task manageable, and giving oneself permission to discard unwanted items, including gifts kept out of obligation. Second, planning where to take discarded items—such as charity shops, giveaway apps, or selling platforms—is crucial to avoid accumulation. Third, prioritize quality over quantity, keeping items that reinforce and uplift. Finally, distinguishing between nostalgia (longing for the past) and sentimentality (present emotional value) can help in deciding what to let go.</p>

          <h2>FDA Considers Removing "Black Box" Warnings from Menopause Hormone Therapy Amid Re-evaluated Risks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA is considering removing "black box" warnings from certain menopause hormone therapy treatments, prompting a re-evaluation of their benefits and risks. For women like Isabel Kallman, these warnings about stroke, blood clots, dementia, and breast cancer have caused hesitation. Dr. Mary Rosser and other experts argue that flawed 2002 research, which focused on older women, overstated these risks. More recent studies emphasize that the timing of treatment—starting closer to the final menstrual period—and delivery method can significantly mitigate risks. While an FDA panel stressed benefits and suggested warning removal, a group of 76 doctors calls for more scientific assessment and a public hearing before changes are made.</p>
