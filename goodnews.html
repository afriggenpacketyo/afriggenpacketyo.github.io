          <p>Taylor Swift's cinematic album release party for "The Life of a Showgirl" generated an impressive estimated $33 million at the domestic box office over its debut weekend. This event, a 90-minute film created in partnership with AMC Theatres, marks the biggest album debut event in cinema history. The film, which included music videos and behind-the-scenes footage, also earned $13 million internationally, bringing its global total to $46 million. This follows the massive success of her 2023 "Eras Tour" concert film, which became the highest-grossing concert film ever.</p>

          <p>During their game against the Cleveland Browns in London, the Minnesota Vikings scored a creative first-quarter touchdown using a trick play. Running back Cam Akers, lined up in a shotgun formation, faked a run before throwing a pass to a wide-open tight end, Josh Oliver, for the score. The play tied the game at seven points each after the extra point. The game was also marked by an injury to Vikings' quarterback Carson Wentz, who was filling in for the injured J.J. McCarthy, and a moment of silence for victims of a recent terror attack.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author and researcher Brené Brown suggests that poor communication skills are common because people are not taught to handle the vulnerability and discomfort that honest conversations require. In a recent interview, she emphasized that effective communication involves clarity, choosing the right words, and taking accountability when conflicts arise. Brown advises against relying on text for important conversations, as it loses crucial tonal context. To navigate difficult discussions, experts recommend using phrases that show you are listening and validating the other person's feelings, which can help de-escalate conflict and foster better understanding between individuals.</p>

          <p>Tech and real estate giants Amazon, Meta, and Prologis have co-founded the Sustainable Concrete Buyers Alliance (SCoBA) to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon concrete. The initiative aims to use the collective purchasing power of its members to create demand for environmentally friendly alternatives, as traditional cement production accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. By providing financial incentives and offtake agreements, the alliance hopes to help producers scale up new technologies and overcome the high costs of decarbonization. The group will also utilize a "book-and-claim" system, allowing companies to purchase environmental attribute certificates to support sustainable production globally.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir, "Cat on the Road to Findout," singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam, also known as Cat Stevens, explores his decades-long spiritual and artistic journey. The artist discusses his rise to fame, his search for meaning beyond superstardom, and his conversion to Islam, which led him to step away from music for nearly 30 years. He now reconciles his past and present by performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens, viewing it as a complete picture of his identity. The book also provides his perspective on past controversies, including his comments regarding Salman Rushdie, which he attributes to a poorly received attempt at dark humor.</p>

          <p>Hosting the season premiere of "Saturday Night Live," musical artist Bad Bunny addressed recent controversy surrounding his upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance. He pushed back against threats from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who warned that immigration agents would be present at the event. During his monologue, the Puerto Rican singer joked that even Fox News was happy about his performance and delivered a message in Spanish celebrating the indelible mark of Latinos in the United States.

These AI-piloted aircraft are designed to be more expendable, allowing for greater tactical risks.

          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common cause of arguments between couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used when discussing these subjects. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, turning simple questions into perceived accusations. To de-escalate conflicts, Travers advises individuals to become self-aware and apologize for harsh tones, rephrasing their statements. He also suggests that the person on the receiving end should calmly ask their partner to try again, interrupting the cycle of negativity without escalating the argument.</p>

Research shows that late-night device use is a primary cause of insufficient sleep among adolescents, a risk factor for issues like depression and poor emotional regulation.

The law also revives a more generous calculation for deducting business interest expenses and makes the 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction permanent.

          <p>JPMorgan suggests that the popular goal of saving $1 million for retirement is unrealistic and unnecessary for the majority of American households. Using an income-replacement model, the bank calculates that a household earning $90,000 annually would need approximately $700,000 by age 65 to maintain its lifestyle, assuming a 5% savings rate. A seven-figure target only becomes necessary for households earning $125,000 or more.
