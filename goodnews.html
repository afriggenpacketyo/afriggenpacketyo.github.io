        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' predictions and indicating continued resilience in the labor market. The unemployment rate slightly decreased to 4.1%, with significant job growth seen in the government and health care sectors. Despite this positive performance, concerns remain about potential economic headwinds from tariffs, which could affect growth and inflation. The strong report may lead the Federal Reserve to delay anticipated interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market's expansion in June was largely fueled by the public sector, which added 73,000 jobs. This figure accounts for about half of the total 147,000 nonfarm payrolls added during the month. Most of this growth occurred at the state and local levels, particularly in education, while the federal government continued to reduce its workforce. Along with health care, these two sectors were responsible for nearly 90% of the net job creation, while sectors like manufacturing and business services saw declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new survey of young Americans reveals their priorities in the workplace, with many favoring in-office work and valuing career development over remote flexibility. The CNBC-Generation Lab poll found that 76% of respondents ideally want to be in the office at least three days a week. The survey also highlighted reputational challenges for major tech companies like Tesla and Meta, which were viewed more negatively than Exxon Mobil. Despite concerns about a potential recession, these young workers support DEI initiatives but prefer to avoid political discussions at work.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that seniors should reassess their life insurance policies to ensure they align with their current needs amid shifting economic conditions. Key questions include whether coverage is still necessary, what type of policy is most suitable, and how it fits into their overall estate plan. With changes in family structure, financial obligations, and goals, policies purchased years ago may no longer be optimal. Professionals recommend reviewing coverage annually and considering options like trusts to avoid potential issues for beneficiaries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has rescinded export controls on chip-design software for China, a move seen as a significant step in de-escalating trade tensions. Major electronic design automation (EDA) companies, including Siemens EDA, Synopsys, and Cadence, confirmed they received letters from the Commerce Department lifting the restrictions. The controls, imposed in May, had required licenses for exporting such technology to China. This reversal comes as the two nations reportedly make progress on a broader trade truce, potentially easing pressure on the global semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Moody's stated that while the utility still faces challenges like performance penalties, the new capital provides a sufficient buffer to maintain its credit quality.

Domestic round-trip flights are averaging $265, the cheapest since 2021, as airlines grapple with an oversupply of flights and softer-than-expected demand. Several major airlines have cut their 2025 forecasts due to economic uncertainty and have planned to reduce unprofitable flights after the summer season. While international travel from the U.S. remains a strong point, even those fares have begun to ease. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cost for the UK government to borrow money has fallen, partially reversing a spike caused by political uncertainty. The yield on 10-year government bonds decreased after Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed support for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who had become emotional in Parliament. Market analysts suggest investors fear that if Reeves were to leave her position, fiscal discipline would weaken, leading to larger deficits. The stabilization provided some reassurance to financial markets, although concerns remain about the government's fiscal plans. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece reflects on the variety and uniquely American character of the fireworks available for purchase. Ultimately, it's a commentary on simple pleasures, family traditions, and navigating the rules of civic life in pursuit of a bang.</p>
