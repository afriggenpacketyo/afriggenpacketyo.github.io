Borrowers should monitor FOMC meetings and be aware of both the benefits and risks associated with HELOCs, including the potential for variable rates and foreclosure.

          <p>Manchester United's transfer strategy involves a focus on reinforcing the attack and addressing issues that need urgent attention. Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, wants to reinforce his attack and has a clear picture of what he wants his squad to look like. While the initial approach was to go for younger, hungry players, the urgent need to address certain issues means some positions require immediate reinforcement.</p>

          <p>Broadcom has begun shipping its Tomahawk 6 networking chip, designed to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) by doubling performance compared to previous versions. The chip's enhanced efficiency reduces the number of networking switches needed for tasks, making it suitable for building large-scale data centers with over 100,000 GPUs. The Tomahawk 6, using the Ethernet networking protocol, incorporates chiplets to increase silicon area and is produced on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's three nanometer process. Broadcom emphasizes the chip's ability to support AI networks simply on Ethernet, without needing esoteric technologies.</p>
