          <p>An international security expert has proposed that the United States could revitalize its rust-belt cities by adopting China's "Wuhan model" of economic development. This model focuses on integrating university research with private industry in second-tier cities to foster advanced manufacturing clusters, similar to Wuhan's Optics Valley. The suggestion comes from Robert Pape, who recently visited major tech hubs in China, including Wuhan, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen. This idea is being discussed amidst a temporary de-escalation in the US-China trade war, highlighting a potential avenue for constructive bilateral cooperation and economic rejuvenation for struggling American industrial regions.</p>

          <p>The annual Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, a Fourth of July tradition, is taking place today in Coney Island. This year's event features the highly anticipated return of 16-time champion Joey Chestnut, who was banned from last year's competition over a sponsorship dispute. He aims to reclaim his title from Patrick Bertoletti, who won in his absence. On the women's side, reigning champion Miki Sudo is defending her title after setting a new world record last year. Competitors have ten minutes to consume as many hot dogs and buns as possible for a $20,000 prize and the coveted Mustard Yellow Belt.</p>

          <p>Ismail Abdo, identified as one of Sweden's most wanted criminals and the head of the Rumba crime organization, has been arrested in Turkey. Abdo is accused of orchestrating a wave of violent crime in Sweden from abroad, related to a violent feud with the rival Foxtrot network over control of the country's drug market. Sweden has been grappling with a surge in gang-related violence, including shootings and bombings, often involving young recruits. The arrest is the result of extended cooperation between Turkish and Swedish law enforcement, marking a significant development in Sweden's efforts to combat organized crime.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Sonay Kartal has advanced to the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time after a decisive 6-4 6-2 victory over France's Diane Parry. After a nervous start on Court One, the 23-year-old rallied to win nine consecutive games, showcasing the powerful form that has defined her impressive tournament run. Kartal, who was ranked outside the top 800 just three years ago, has enjoyed a rapid ascent and could become the British number one by the end of the tournament. She will next face world number 50 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, continuing her remarkable journey at her home Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old cold case has resulted in a murder indictment for a 72-year-old man, Mark Sanfratello, thanks to advancements in DNA technology. Sanfratello is accused of killing his then-girlfriend, 27-year-old Teresa Peroni, who disappeared in Selma, Oregon, around July 4, 1983. She was last seen with Sanfratello after an argument at a party. The case remained unsolved for decades until a human skull found in 1997 was recently confirmed to be Peroni's through new DNA analysis. Sanfratello was located and detained in Chico, California, and is now awaiting extradition to Oregon to face the murder charge.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long fight for justice, the government's former independent adviser on a sexual assault review, Emily Hunt, has seen her abuser imprisoned. Christopher Killick was sentenced to three years for harassing Ms. Hunt, having previously pleaded guilty to voyeurism for filming her while she was unconscious in 2015. Despite a restraining order, Killick repeatedly breached it by posting about Hunt online, leading to a suspended sentence and eventually his final imprisonment. Hunt, who waived her anonymity to pursue the case and was awarded an OBE for her campaigning, expressed immense relief that he was finally jailed.</p>

          <p>A newly discovered interstellar object, designated 3I/ATLAS, is currently being tracked by astronomers as it passes through our solar system. This is only the third such object ever detected, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet, estimated to be about 12.4 miles wide, poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach in October at a distance of about 240 million kilometers. Scientists are studying its trajectory and composition to learn more about its origins from another planetary system within our galaxy, providing a rare opportunity to analyze pristine material from beyond our solar system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease has outlined five types of food he avoids feeding his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of sodium and nitrates. He also strongly advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes, as well as deep-fried foods prepared in industrial oils. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried foods to build healthy habits from childhood.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding whether to hire professional movers, financial experts suggest considering several key factors beyond the initial cost. Homeowners should assess if they own valuable or fragile items that would be expensive to replace if damaged during a do-it-yourself move. It's also important to calculate the value of time saved by outsourcing the labor, which could be used more productively. Experts also highlight the mental benefit, as reducing the stress of moving can protect one's peace of mind and job performance. Ultimately, the decision should not jeopardize long-term financial goals or lead to high-interest debt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new books are advocating for a philosophy that values the body for its functionality rather than just its appearance. Casey Johnston's "A Physical Education" explores how weight lifting can help people unlearn restrictive diet culture by focusing on building strength and capability. Similarly, a biography of fashion designer Claire McCardell highlights her revolutionary approach to creating comfortable, practical clothing with features like pockets, viewing women as "doers." Both works suggest a refreshing shift in perspective, encouraging individuals to embrace their bodies as working objects and prioritize function and comfort over conforming to narrow, often constricting, aesthetic standards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union and Germany are spearheading a proposal to create an alternative to the World Trade Organization (WTO), which they argue is no longer functional. The initiative comes as the WTO's dispute resolution body remains paralyzed due to the US blocking appointments of new judges for several years. The proposed new organization would initially form a coalition of like-minded nations, potentially by partnering with the CPTPP trade bloc in Asia, to liberalize trade and establish fair competition rules. The goal is to create a framework that can address modern trade challenges like US protectionism and Chinese state subsidies, while encouraging reform within the existing WTO structure.

          <h2>Study Identifies Six Common Personality Traits of 'Cool' People Across Cultures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 08:35:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international study has identified six personality traits consistently associated with people perceived as "cool" across a dozen different countries. Researchers found that individuals considered cool tend to be more extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open, and autonomous compared to those simply seen as "good." The study distinguished coolness from moral goodness, noting that cool people often push boundaries and spark change, which isn't always aligned with traditional or conforming behavior. The findings suggest that these core attributes of coolness are fundamental and universally recognized, transcending cultural and geographic differences.</p>
