          <h2>Assisted Dying Impact Assessment Projects Over 4,000 Deaths in Tenth Year After Law Change</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK government impact assessment estimates that assisted dying could account for over 4,000 deaths in the tenth year after legalization in England and Wales, representing less than 1% of all deaths. The assessment, conducted to inform MPs debating the issue, projects initial savings for the NHS ranging from ¬£919,000 to ¬£10.3 million in the first six months, but also significant staffing and training costs. Proponents argue that assisted dying provides compassionate end-of-life care, while opponents raise concerns about risks to vulnerable individuals and potential financial incentives for an overburdened NHS. The bill only covers terminally ill adults with less than six months to live and includes strict eligibility criteria and safeguarding measures.</p>

          <p>Singapore held its general election amid concerns over potential trade tariffs imposed by the United States, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong facing his first major test against a strengthened opposition. The ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has dominated Singaporean politics since 1965, but the opposition is seeking to increase its representation in Parliament. The election outcome is viewed as a gauge of Wong's leadership and the PAP's continued dominance, especially given economic uncertainties stemming from the US-China trade war and rising living costs. The PAP emphasizes its efforts to mitigate rising costs for citizens, while the opposition argues for stronger scrutiny of government policies.</p>

          <p>Europe is exploring ways to reduce its dependence on US credit card firms like Visa and Mastercard due to concerns over economic security and potential vulnerabilities. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has expressed alarm over the region's reliance on foreign-owned payment infrastructure and advocates for a European alternative. While some experts downplay the extent of US dominance in total European payment traffic, others highlight the increasing use of mobile payment apps dominated by American tech firms like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Potential solutions include adopting a model similar to Russia's, mandating domestic processing of card transactions, and promoting the development of a digital euro.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amid economic challenges and a volatile global landscape, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton vying for leadership. Voters are primarily concerned about the rising cost of living and housing affordability, while the country navigates its dependence on the United States for security and trade relations with China. Recent polls suggest Albanese's Labor Party is favored for a second term, despite earlier leads by the opposition. The election highlights voter dissatisfaction with both major parties, with increasing support for independent candidates and minor parties.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an 'unparalleled' antivenom using antibodies from a US man, Tim Friede, who has deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. Current antivenom therapies require matching the specific snake species, making Friede's mission a significant step towards a universal antivenom. This breakthrough could help save thousands of lives and prevent disabilities caused by snakebites, which kill up to 140,000 people annually.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the local currency's rise against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion to maintain the currency's trading band. This action precedes the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where potential interest rate cuts are expected to be discussed. Bankers anticipate similar interventions if the US lowers interest rates, prompting further capital inflow to Hong Kong. The HKMA will continue to monitor the market to ensure orderly operations.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative 'revolution' aimed at streamlining bureaucracy, boosting economic growth, and consolidating power within the Communist Party. The reforms, spearheaded by new party chief To Lam, include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating public sector jobs. These changes are expected to address dysfunction caused by the party's anti-corruption campaign and adapt to external pressures such as potential US tariffs. The overhaul also aligns with a broader ideological shift towards centralized governance and tighter party discipline, potentially benefiting To Lam's leadership.</p>

President Trump ended the exemption that allowed goods under $800 to enter the US tariff-free, now subjecting companies to tariffs as high as 145%. Temu has stopped shipping directly from China, transitioning to local warehouses, while Shein has not yet responded. Both companies have reduced advertising spending, leading to a decline in app downloads and a slight headwind to ads business for Google and Meta.</p>
