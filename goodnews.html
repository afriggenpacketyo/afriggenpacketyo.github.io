          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, India is poised for victory over England, leaving the hosts struggling at 72-3 by the end of day four. Indian captain Shubman Gill delivered a masterful performance, scoring 161 runs to follow his first-innings 269, allowing India to declare at 427-6. Facing a near-impossible target of 608, England lost key wickets, including Joe Root, and now must likely play for a draw to maintain their series lead. The outcome on day five will be pivotal for the series, which could be leveled at 1-1 with an Indian win.</p>

          <p>Israel has decided to send a delegation to Qatar for further negotiations on a potential Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal, reviving hopes for a breakthrough. The move follows a statement from Hamas indicating it had responded positively to a U.S.-mediated proposal for a 60-day truce. While U.S. President Donald Trump expressed optimism about a potential deal, significant challenges remain, as both sides are publicly far apart on key issues. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has maintained that Hamas must be disarmed, a condition the militant group has so far refused to discuss.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri by just 0.103 seconds on his final lap. The qualifying session at Silverstone was intensely competitive, with McLaren's Lando Norris finishing third and Mercedes' George Russell in fourth. Lewis Hamilton, who had been a strong contender, ultimately qualified in fifth place. Verstappen noted the tricky, windy conditions made the high-speed corners particularly challenging, but his final lap was sufficient to secure the top spot for the race.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, arguing it created the concept of a 'citizen.' He characterized the period as a bloody civil war, emphasizing that the nation's founding ideals emerged from deep turmoil and division, much like the political climate today. Burns asserted that heroism is not perfection and that understanding the founders' flaws makes their achievements more accessible and powerful. He stressed that being an American citizen requires a continuing obligation to engage with history and learn from its complexities.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared that she is choosing to be single, a decision relationship experts say can be a sign of strength and self-awareness. Theron explained that her choice was influenced by her parents' tumultuous relationship and her own tendency to lose herself in past romantic partnerships. By focusing on raising her two children as a single mother, she prioritized her own well-being and what she could healthily provide for her family. Experts praise her decision as an act of alignment with her true self, noting that for many women today, partnership is a preference rather than a necessity.</p>

          <p>England and Wales have been drawn into what is being called the toughest group of the Women's Euro 2025 tournament, alongside top-ranked teams France and the Netherlands. This grouping means three of the four teams are ranked in the top 11 globally, presenting a significant challenge for both home nations. Defending champions England will need to be sharp from the start, while debutants Wales, the lowest-ranked team, will embrace their underdog status. Analysts suggest there is a real possibility that both England and Wales could be eliminated before they even face each other in their final group stage match.</p>

          <p>A so-called 'cortisol cocktail' has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming the non-alcoholic drink can lower the body's primary stress hormone. The beverage typically includes ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that this combination can meaningfully reduce cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, doctors emphasize that proven stress-reduction techniques like quality sleep, exercise, and social connection are far more effective for managing stress.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of a Chinese typewriter from the 1940s, invented by linguist Lin Yutang, has been rediscovered, exciting scholars in the U.S. and Asia. The machine, called the MingKwai, is considered a crucial part of the origin story of modern Chinese computing. Its ingenious design broke down complex Chinese characters by their shapes rather than sounds, a concept that underlies how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. The typewriter's discovery highlights a pivotal moment in preserving the Chinese language for the digital age, representing a globalist vision that married Eastern culture with Western technology.</p>

          <p>After a ban of more than 100 years, public swimming has officially returned to the Seine River in Paris. The reopening follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project, tied to last year's Olympics, which has successfully brought the river's water quality up to European standards on most days. On Saturday, Parisians eagerly lined up to take a plunge in designated swimming areas near the Eiffel Tower, a move celebrated by Mayor Anne Hidalgo as the fulfillment of a 'childhood dream.' While some residents remain skeptical, the event marks a historic milestone for the French capital.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change negative public perceptions of the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team examines the stomach contents of sharks to assess their diet and the overall health of the marine ecosystem. Researchers emphasize that a healthy shark population is indicative of a healthy ocean. Despite public fascination with sharks, the lab faces challenges in securing financial support for its crucial research, which aims to shift the narrative around these often-misunderstood animals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Google X executive and happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a '90-second rule' to better manage anger and stress. The concept is based on neuroscientific findings that the physiological response to anger, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued feeling of anger is a conscious or unconscious choice to rerun the triggering thought. By allowing oneself this brief window to feel the emotion and then consciously choosing to move on, individuals can prevent rumination and recover more quickly from life's daily upsets.</p>

          <p>Inspired by a trip to Denmark, a business school professor undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies to combat burnout and find better work-life balance. She discovered that engaging in activities like pottery, tennis, and woodworking helped her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely, and connect more deeply with others. The author argues that hobbies are not a reward for achieving balance but are the secret to creating it. By actively pursuing interests outside of work and family obligations, she was able to redefine self-care and model a more fulfilled life for her children.</p>
