          <p>Japanese boxer Ginjiro Shigeoka is in stable condition after undergoing a craniotomy following his IBF minimumweight title match. Shigeoka lost a split decision to Pedro Taduran and suffered a right subdural hematoma, leading to the emergency surgery. According to Japan Boxing Commission rules, Shigeoka will have to retire from the sport as boxers who have had a craniotomy cannot hold a professional license.

          <p>France is implementing a sweeping outdoor smoking ban starting July 1, prohibiting smoking in beaches, parks, gardens, bus stops, and near schools. Health and Family Minister Catherine Vautrin emphasized the importance of children's right to breathe fresh air, with violators facing fines up to $153. Enforcement will be handled by regular police, with an expectation of public self-regulation. Outdoor caf√© seating areas will be exempt, and e-cigarettes are currently excluded, though future limits on nicotine levels in vapes are being considered. The move is supported by nearly 80% of French citizens, though some raise concerns about personal liberty.</p>
