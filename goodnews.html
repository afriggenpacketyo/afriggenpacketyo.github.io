CEO Eddie Wu outlined a strategy to position Alibaba Cloud as a leading full-stack AI service provider, unveiling the new Qwen3-Max large language model. The company is also expanding its global infrastructure, with new data centers planned for Brazil, France, the Netherlands, and several other countries next year. This move aims to bolster its computing power and secure its position in the race towards artificial superintelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

The article explores how his unapologetic ambition and self-ownership resonate with a younger generation, contrasting with the traditional humility of stars like Lionel Messi. Yamal's journey from a working-class background and personal hardship has forged a resilient and self-aware character, which he displays both on and off the pitch. While his immense talent is clear, his future success will depend on navigating the pressures of fame and translating his potential into sustained dominance.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered approximately £480 million in the past year by deploying a new artificial intelligence tool designed to detect fraud. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent claims made during the COVID-19 pandemic, including illegitimate Bounce Back Loans. The tool, named the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, scans new policies for potential weaknesses before they can be exploited. Following its success, the UK plans to license this technology to international partners, including the US and Australia, though its use has drawn criticism from civil liberties groups.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled a colossal $850 billion infrastructure plan, partnering with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank to build a network of supercomputing data centers. The initiative, requiring an amount of electricity equivalent to powering over 13 million homes, is a response to the explosive growth in demand for AI services like ChatGPT. Despite concerns from critics about a potential investment bubble and a circular financing model, Altman insists the buildout is necessary to meet near-infinite demand for AI compute power. He acknowledges the financial risks but remains confident in the long-term societal value of advancing artificial intelligence technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to his show with an emotional monologue, addressing his recent suspension by ABC following pressure from the Trump administration. He clarified that he never intended to make light of the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk but stood firm against what he called "a government threat to silence a comedian," labeling such actions as anti-American. The incident ignited a national debate on free speech, with Disney citing the need to de-escalate a tense situation as the reason for the initial suspension. Despite his return to the network, major broadcast groups Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the show on their affiliate stations.</p>

          <p>The city of Datong in China's Shanxi province successfully avoided disaster during heavy summer rains, thanks to a major infrastructure project completed over 15 years ago. Under former mayor Geng Yanbo, the city widened its main river and reinforced its banks, a move that was criticized at the time but has now been vindicated. This case is presented as an example of how long-term investment in urban resilience can protect cities from the effects of extreme weather. Economists suggest that such infrastructure spending not only improves disaster prevention but can also serve as a short-term economic stimulus.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered to pay a A$150,000 penalty for the unfair dismissal of presenter Antoinette Lattouf. A court found she was removed from the air due to her political views after sharing a Human Rights Watch post about the war in Gaza, following a lobbying campaign from pro-Israel groups. The judge stated the substantial penalty was necessary to ensure the ABC learns from its actions, which were described as surrendering its employee's rights to appease a lobby group. The case has sparked a national conversation about the broadcaster's independence and its support for culturally diverse employees.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has won the special election for Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a seat previously held by her late father. Her victory further tightens the Republican's slim majority in the House of Representatives, bringing the chamber's makeup to 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats. This result is expected to have immediate consequences, as Grijalva's first act will likely be to provide the final signature needed on a discharge petition to force a House vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files. The shrinking majority also poses significant challenges for GOP leadership in passing future legislation, particularly concerning government funding.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has stated that an escalator carrying former President Donald Trump and Melania Trump stopped abruptly due to a built-in safety feature, not intentional interference. A UN spokesperson explained that a videographer traveling backward up the escalator ahead of the couple may have inadvertently triggered the safety mechanism at the top. This explanation comes after the White House raised concerns about a deliberate act and called for an investigation. During his speech, Trump also experienced a teleprompter failure, which he later joked about, though UN officials noted the device was being operated by the White House's own team.</p>

          <p>This article presents China's recent decennial military parade as more than a simple display of military hardware, arguing it serves as a powerful symbol of national unity and resilience. From a non-Western perspective, the event is framed as a declaration of deep national cohesion that helps citizens transcend personal anxieties by connecting with the nation's destiny. For Hong Kong and Macau, the parade is positioned as a tangible representation of the institutional strength and stability provided by the mainland. The author suggests the spectacle reinforces the message that China's system offers a viable alternative to the Western model of governance.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal of his previous stance, former U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that Ukraine is in a position to "win all of Ukraine back in its original form." He made the comments on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, citing Russia's economic troubles as a key factor. This marks a major departure from his earlier suggestions that Ukraine might need to concede territory to achieve peace. Zelensky hailed the statement as a "big shift," interpreting it as a positive signal of U.S. support for Ukraine's efforts to reclaim its pre-invasion borders.</p>
