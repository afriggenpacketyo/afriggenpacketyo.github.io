          <p>Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) party is prioritizing a campaign to prevent the recall of its lawmakers by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), even as it prepares for a leadership election. Analysts suggest that failing to address the recall challenge could destabilize the KMT's leadership transition. KMT Chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has indicated his intention to step down after completing his term, suggesting Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor. The KMT plans to announce the party chair race in July, conduct internal voting in September, and install a new leader by October.</p>
