          <p>Credo, a 17-year-old semiconductor company, is experiencing a surge in its stock value, more than doubling this year, due to its specialized purple active electrical cables (AECs) becoming crucial for AI data centers. These $300-$500 cables are preferred by hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft for their reliability over fiber optics, preventing costly outages in massive GPU clusters. JPMorgan Chase initiated buy coverage, predicting the AEC market will hit $4 billion by 2028, with Credo holding an estimated 88% market share. The company expects significant revenue growth and profitability, benefiting from the trillion-dollar AI infrastructure expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis should transcend its designation as merely a tech and housing hub to become a significant center for cultural development within the Greater Bay Area (GBA). The article suggests that with sophisticated technological infrastructure already established in the GBA, the next competitive frontier lies in cultural influence rather than just connectivity. It advocates for a paradigm shift from property-led development to one prioritizing innovation and cultural growth. The vision aims for Hong Kong to emerge as a global cradle for cultural content, exporting its unique identity similar to Hollywood or K-pop.</p>

          <p>Northampton Saints have ascended to the top of the Prem table following a decisive 36-19 bonus-point victory against Newcastle Red Bulls at Kingston Park. This win, secured with five tries, places Saints ahead of reigning champions Bath, while Newcastle continues their search for a first league win since November last year. Despite playing half an hour with a man down due to JJ van der Mescht's two sin-bins, Northampton consistently found another gear. The Red Bulls, though showing moments of promise when numerically superior, ultimately failed to capitalize, leaving them still winless this campaign.</p>

          <p>Boeing has received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase its 737 Max jetliner production to 42 aircraft per month, a significant milestone after nearly two years of output restrictions. The FAA had capped production at 38 planes monthly following a near-catastrophic door plug incident on an Alaska Airlines flight in January 2024. This decision signals increased confidence in Boeing's production safety and quality, as the company works to recover from years of problems, including two fatal crashes and supply chain issues. The ramp-up is crucial for Boeing's financial turnaround, with further increases planned for the future.</p>

          <p>Ford is initiating recalls for nearly 750,000 vehicles across three separate issues concerning camera displays, steering, and seatbelts. Over 290,000 vehicles, including certain F-250, F-350, and F-450 SD models, are recalled due to a rearview camera display malfunction in specific lighting conditions. An additional 115,539 Super Duty trucks face a recall for a potential steering column detachment, risking loss of steering control. Furthermore, 332,778 Mustang models from 2015-2017 are being recalled because corroded seatbelt cables could prevent proper restraint. Dealers will provide free repairs for all affected vehicles to address these safety risks.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively working to cement his architectural legacy through ambitious construction projects, including a $250 million White House ballroom and a proposed arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial. The ballroom, privately financed by donors including tech executives and philanthropists, is now fully funded, with excess money potentially directed to the arch. Democrats, however, are bristling at these endeavors, with California Rep. Mark Takano introducing bills to regulate donor recognition on White House structures and prohibit federal funding during shutdowns. Trump views these projects as a welcome respite from pressing geopolitical matters, while critics argue they distract from critical national issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump described a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, connecting Russia to Alaska, as 'interesting.' The idea, floated by Russian investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, suggests a 70-mile link costing an estimated $8 billion with Boring Company's technology, completed within eight years. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy expressed disapproval of the concept following Trump's comments. This proposal emerges after a call between Trump and Russian President Putin to discuss resolutions for the Ukraine War, with further meetings planned between U.S. and Russian delegations.</p>

Sotheby's highlighted this as a rare opportunity to acquire a substantial group of Hockney's digital art. The artist, now 88, turned to his iPad for these plein air studies when traditional painting proved challenging in winter, with the full series later exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 2012.</p>

Del Taco, acquired in 2022 for $575 million, has recently struggled, leading to this strategic sale to focus on the core Jack in the Box brand. (not investment advice)</p>

This update expands existing 'Teen Accounts' features, now filtering out posts on 'certain risky stunts' and 'strong language' from recommendations, and hiding accounts that regularly share inappropriate material. While parents can adjust these settings, the move aims to reassure them about age-appropriate content, drawing a familiar analogy to movie ratings.
