          <p>During President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, the White House announced a commitment by the kingdom to invest $600 billion in a series of deals with the United States. A nearly $142 billion defense sales deal is included, providing Saudi Arabia with advanced warfighting equipment and services. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aims to raise the U.S.-Saudi partnership to $1 trillion across military, security, economic, and technological sectors. The White House also announced commitments from Saudi digital infrastructure business DataVolt to pursue a $20 billion investment in AI data centers in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the U.S. will remove all sanctions against Syria to give the country "a chance at greatness," marking a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy towards the region. Trump stated that the new Syrian government would hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace. Syria has been designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011 following a crackdown on anti-government uprisings. This decision is a major step toward restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria for the first time in over a decade.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria's new government, led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa, to give the country "a chance at peace." This effort comes at the urging of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Al-Sharaa, a former insurgent, assumed the presidency in January after leading an offensive that ended the Assad family's 54-year rule. The move marks a significant shift in U.S. policy, putting Trump at odds with Israel, which is skeptical of Al-Sharaa's past and has cautioned against swift recognition of the new government.</p>

          <p>The consumer price index rose 2.3% in April from 12 months earlier, a decrease from March, marking the smallest annual increase since February 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline contributed to the decline. However, economists caution that tariffs imposed by President Trump may reignite inflation. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports, could cost the average U.S. household an extra $2,800, according to a Yale Budget Lab report.</p>

          <p>Former FDA commissioner Dr. David Kessler warns about the lack of long-term data and strategies for safely discontinuing the use of weight loss drugs like GLP-1s. Kessler, who used these drugs himself, emphasizes that they are not miracle pills and require a comprehensive approach involving diet, exercise, and medical supervision. He notes that the FDA needs to require data on how to safely get off these drugs and how to go back on them safely, as there is currently no data and we are just running a national experiment. Kessler also expresses concern about the affordability of comprehensive weight management care.</p>
