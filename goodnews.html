          <p>A report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) reveals that over 158 million Americans cast ballots in the 2024 presidential election, with more than 211 million actively registered to vote. The data indicates that voter turnout was 64.7% of the citizen voting-age population, the second-highest rate in the last five presidential elections, trailing only the 2020 contest. The report also details voting methods, showing a shift back towards in-person voting compared to the pandemic-era 2020 election. Nearly 73% of voters cast their ballots in person, either on or before Election Day, while mail-in voting accounted for just over 30% of all ballots.</p>

          <p>A new mural in North Hollywood celebrates Dodgers utility player Kiké Hernández for his public support of immigrants amid recent enforcement raids in Los Angeles. The artwork by local artist Louie Palsino features Hernández's image with the words "Born X Raised" and "Los Angeles," inspired by an Instagram post where the Puerto Rico-born player condemned the treatment of immigrant communities. In his post, Hernández stated that while he wasn't born in L.A., the city adopted him, and he could not stand to see its community profiled and abused. The mural stands as a tribute to his solidarity and has been positively received by the community.</p>

          <h2>Shohei Ohtani's Return to Pitching Shows Promise Despite Some Offensive Cooldown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 15:24:22 EDT</div>

          <p>One month into his return as a two-way player, Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is demonstrating encouraging progress on the mound after recovering from his second Tommy John surgery. In six total innings pitched, he has allowed only one run while showcasing high-velocity fastballs and effective breaking pitches. While his hitting statistics have seen a slight dip since he resumed pitching, he still leads the National League in home runs and remains an MVP-caliber offensive force. The Dodgers are carefully managing his workload to ensure he can gradually increase his pitching endurance without compromising his crucial role as the team's leadoff hitter.</p>

          <p>AI-focused cloud company CoreWeave has announced it will acquire data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion. The deal is expected to significantly expand CoreWeave's infrastructure, giving it ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of power capacity and eliminating future lease obligations. CoreWeave plans to either divest Core Scientific's cryptocurrency mining operations or convert those sites for AI workloads. The acquisition represents a major strategic move for CoreWeave as it competes with cloud giants like Amazon Web Services by securing critical power and real estate for the growing demands of artificial intelligence.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially poised to cut interest rates later this year, prospective borrowers of Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are advised to take preparatory steps. Financial experts suggest that now is an opportune time for homeowners to check their credit reports and scores to qualify for the best possible terms when rates do fall. It is also recommended to research and compare various lenders beyond one's current mortgage provider to establish a baseline of competitive offers. Finally, homeowners should calculate potential repayment costs under different interest rate scenarios to ensure affordability, as HELOCs are secured by their homes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The nonprofit organization Chicxs Rockerxs moved its annual summer rock camp for girls and gender-nonconforming youth online to protect campers and their families from a recent surge in ICE raids in Southeast Los Angeles. Organizers made the swift decision after learning that some students were staying home out of fear. Instead of canceling, the staff pivoted to a virtual format, dropping off instruments and supplies to ensure the camp could continue as a safe space for creative expression. The move was praised by the community and participants as a thoughtful and necessary precaution to prioritize the safety and well-being of its predominantly Latinx immigrant community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of pterosaur, a flying reptile from the time of the dinosaurs, based on a 209-million-year-old jawbone found in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park. The creature, named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, is now believed to be the earliest pterosaur ever discovered in North America. Advanced scanning of the fossil revealed unique details, and analysis of its teeth suggests the seagull-sized reptile fed on hard-shelled prey like primitive, armored fish. The discovery was made in a rich fossil bed that has preserved a snapshot of a diverse ecosystem from the late Triassic period, offering new insights into this transitional era of evolution.</p>

          <p>California has made significant progress toward its goal of conserving 30% of its land and coastal waters by 2030, according to a new state report. The state has now conserved 26.1% of its lands and 21.9% of coastal waters, largely aided by the recent federal designation of two new national monuments and a marine sanctuary. However, officials warn that this progress could be reversed by the Trump administration, which has signaled it may seek to undo these protections. Despite these federal headwinds, state officials remain focused on expanding conservation efforts, particularly by integrating more land into the state park system to enhance biodiversity and climate resilience.</p>

          <p>The film "F1," starring Brad Pitt, has become Apple's most successful theatrical movie to date, surpassing $293 million at the global box office. Distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, the racing drama has out-grossed previous Apple Original Films like "Napoleon" and "Killers of the Flower Moon." A significant portion of its success is attributed to a strong partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over $60 million of its total ticket sales. While the film's high production and marketing budget means it still has a way to go to reach profitability, its box office performance marks a significant milestone for the tech giant's growing presence in the film industry.

In Wyoming, a man whose car was hit by a 16-year-old on an icy road launched a fundraiser to help her, raising nearly $14,000 to replace her totaled vehicle. He said he was moved to help after learning the teen had worked hard to buy the car herself. In another story from Seattle, two young brothers, both champion chess players, decided to donate their tournament winnings to help a 10-year-old boy suffering from chronic pancreatitis. The families met, providing a spark of hope and a lesson in the importance of helping others in need.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has sharply criticized the Justice Department for its handling of the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis called the government's motion to dismiss Abrego Garcia's civil lawsuit "meritless" and questioned whether he was indicted on human trafficking charges primarily as a means to secure his return. She expressed deep skepticism about the government's transparency and has ordered an official to testify under oath about the administration's plans for him if he is released from detention, to ensure his due process rights are respected.</p>
