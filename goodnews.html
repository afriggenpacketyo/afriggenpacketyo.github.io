          <p>The Fundstrat Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF (GRNY), managed by Tom Lee's firm, has seen remarkable success since its launch, accumulating $1.5 billion in assets in just eight months. The actively managed fund, which focuses on S&P 500 stocks aligned with multiple long-term themes like AI and millennial trends, has significantly outperformed its benchmark index. Its strategy involves selecting a concentrated portfolio of about 35 stocks, such as Robinhood and Oracle, that embody these "granny shot" themes, aiming for consistent results. The fund's strong performance and rapid growth highlight investor interest in thematic, rules-based investment approaches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests U.S. Fertility Policy Overlooks Male Infertility Treatments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 10:52:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Trump administration's focus on boosting U.S. birth rates and expanding access to IVF, policy discussions largely ignore the significant role of male infertility. This article argues that while debates rage between pronatalists who support IVF and those who favor alternative methods, a crucial opportunity is being missed to address male-factor infertility, which accounts for roughly half of conception struggles among heterosexual couples. Focusing on and expanding insurance coverage for male treatments could reduce the physical and emotional burden on women, who disproportionately undergo invasive procedures even when they are not the source of the issue. Such a shift could offer a politically viable path to improving fertility outcomes.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest a "Bridge Strategy" Can Maximize Social Security Retirement Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 10:37:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are highlighting the significant long-term financial advantages of delaying Social Security claims until age 70. Waiting past the full retirement age can increase monthly benefits by 8% annually, a guaranteed return that is hard to match elsewhere. To make this delay feasible, a new report from the Bipartisan Policy Center recommends a "bridge strategy," where retirees use other funds, such as investment portfolios or annuities, to cover living expenses in their 60s. This approach allows them to secure a larger, inflation-protected income stream for life, which is particularly valuable for managing longevity risk, though it requires careful financial planning.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of July 10, 2025, average national mortgage rates are approximately 6.70% for a 30-year loan and 5.88% for a 15-year loan, presenting challenges for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. While rates remain elevated compared to previous years, prospective borrowers can improve their chances of securing a better rate by strengthening their credit profile, as the best offers go to those with scores in the mid-to-high 700s. Experts advise shopping around and comparing lenders to find the most favorable terms. A potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could also bring some relief to the market in the near future.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, totaling 225,000 shares, as part of a pre-established trading plan. This sale is part of a larger plan adopted in March that allows him to sell up to 6 million shares through the end of the year. The transaction comes as Huang's personal net worth soars to $143 billion, nearly equaling that of Warren Buffett, driven by the explosive growth of Nvidia's stock. The chipmaker recently became the first company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization, cementing its dominance in the artificial intelligence industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has soared to a new record high, surpassing $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion, signaling strong institutional confidence. The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and the potential for an increased federal deficit, which can serve as a positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency. This surge triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further propelling the price upward as traders were forced to buy back bitcoin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study analyzing 210 emergency vaccination programs across 49 countries from 2000 to 2023 has found they were remarkably effective. The research indicates that these rapid vaccine rollouts in response to outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, cholera, and measles reduced both deaths and overall infections by approximately 60%. Beyond the significant human impact, the study, backed by the vaccine alliance Gavi, also highlights substantial economic benefits, estimated at $32 billion, primarily from averting deaths and disability. These findings underscore the critical value of vaccines as a cost-effective tool for managing global public health crises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, financial personality Dave Ramsey argued against the use of credit cards, even for those who claim to pay them off monthly. Ramsey stated that the idea of disciplined monthly payoff is a "great lie," citing data that 78% of cardholders roll over a balance. He contends that using plastic, as opposed to cash, psychologically encourages people to spend 12-18% more because it doesn't trigger the same mental "pain" of parting with money. Ramsey, who advocates for a debt-free lifestyle, insists that debit cards offer the same functionalities without the inherent risk of accumulating high-interest debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand for its products despite economic uncertainty. The denim maker announced it plans to absorb some of the initial costs from President Trump's new tariffs, which it estimates will have a $25-30 million impact for the rest of the year. However, this strategy could change depending on the evolution of U.S. trade policy, as many of its key manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia have been targeted with potential duties. The company's confidence is bolstered by strong direct-to-consumer sales and growth in its women's apparel category. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA will now consider drug affordability as a key factor when awarding new "national priority" vouchers, which can reduce drug review times to as little as one month, according to Commissioner Marty Makary. This move aligns with the Trump administration's stated goal of lowering prescription drug prices for Americans. The program aims to incentivize development in critical areas like cures for Type 1 diabetes and treatments for late-stage cancer, as well as to encourage domestic drug manufacturing. While the plan is intended to speed innovation, it remains unclear how the FDA will assess affordability before a drug is launched, and concerns persist about the risks of such rapid approvals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Trump administration continues to issue tariff threats, analysts suggest that China is adopting a more pragmatic, long-term strategy to counter U.S. trade protectionism. Instead of only issuing warnings, Beijing is focusing on strengthening its relationships with other trade partners, particularly its neighbors, by offering broader market access and promoting regional integration. This approach aims to build a more unified regional market that can collectively push back against Washington's policies. The strategy acknowledges the inevitability of U.S. tariffs on transshipped goods and emphasizes the need for China to project a firm diplomatic stance. (not investment advice)</p>
