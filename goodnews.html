        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street predictions, driven by a significant jump in revenue from its markets and banking divisions. The bank reported earnings of $1.96 per share on revenue of $21.67 billion, outperforming analyst estimates and marking a 25% increase in net income compared to the previous year. Bright spots included a 16% rise in markets revenue and an 18% increase in banking revenue, prompting the company to raise its full-year revenue forecast. The positive performance reflects the success of CEO Jane Fraser's ongoing turnaround strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese tech firm Baidu has partnered with Uber to integrate its Apollo Go autonomous vehicles into Uber's ride-hailing network outside of the U.S. and mainland China. The multi-year agreement will see thousands of Baidu's driverless cars become available to Uber riders, with initial deployments planned for Asia and the Middle East later this year. This strategic move allows Baidu to expand its autonomous driving business internationally. For Uber, it provides a partnership with a proven autonomous vehicle developer to compete globally against rivals in the self-driving technology space.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Many Top Stars Are Absent from BBC's Public Salary Disclosures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 08:18:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's annual salary report, while listing top earners like Gary Lineker and Zoe Ball, does not provide a complete picture of talent pay due to specific disclosure rules. Many high-profile stars are not included because they are employed by independent production companies or the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Studios, rather than being directly paid from the license fee. This structure is intended to allow BBC Studios to compete on a level playing field in the commercial market. Consequently, the earnings of numerous presenters, actors, and quiz show hosts from popular programs remain undisclosed to the public.</p>

          <p>At a rare meeting attended by President Xi Jinping and top leaders, China announced a fundamental shift in its urban development model. The country will move away from decades of large-scale expansion and instead focus on optimizing existing urban resources and improving quality of life. With 67% of its population now in urban areas, the new approach emphasizes human well-being, efficiency, and better governance. Key initiatives will include creating a new model for the property sector, renovating urban villages, and providing more citizenship benefits to migrant workers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers from China have successfully used publicly available satellite data from NASA to identify promising locations for deep-sea mining in the Indian Ocean. NASA's GRACE satellites, which map Earth's gravity field, detected anomalies along the Ninety East Ridge, indicating areas where the Earth's crust is unusually thick. Chinese scientists theorized these areas would be rich in valuable minerals pushed up from the planet's mantle. A subsequent research voyage confirmed their hypothesis, potentially saving years of exploration and significant financial resources by pinpointing mineral-dense zones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is launching a new £650 million scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles by offering discounts of up to £3,750 on new cars. The grants will apply to eligible models priced up to £37,000, with the goal of making zero-emission cars more affordable for families ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. While the government hopes this will boost the automotive sector, critics argue that the country's lack of sufficient public charging infrastructure remains a significant barrier for many potential EV buyers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norwegian author Linn Ullmann’s latest book, "Girl, 1983," is reviewed as a profound exploration of how personal history is shaped by both memory and its absence. Labeled a novel despite its clear autobiographical elements, the book centers on a writer trying to piece together a traumatic event from her adolescence that she cannot fully recall. Ullmann challenges the conventions of memoir by embracing these memory gaps, suggesting that lived experiences persist not just as recollections but as powerful absences. The work is praised for its deft manipulation of genre to convey a vulnerable and complex relationship with the past.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to better-than-anticipated performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's revenue was $45.68 billion, beating estimates, with fixed income trading revenue up 14% and investment banking fees rising 7%. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the U.S. economy's resilience but reiterated warnings about risks from trade uncertainty and geopolitical conditions. The strong results were achieved despite a 17% drop in net income compared to the prior year, a period that included a significant one-time gain. (not investment advice)</p>

Proponents in Shetland, including the local council and business leaders, argue that tunnels are essential for the region's thriving fishing, energy, and space industries.
