          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, highlighting increased market access for American exports, especially agricultural products, and reduced non-tariff barriers. The final details are still being finalized, with Commerce Secretary Lutnick mentioning the existing 10% tariff that generates revenue for the United States. UK Prime Minister Starmer praised the deal for boosting trade and creating jobs between the two countries. Britain says the deal will cut tariffs on UK cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, adding that the agreement sets a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin, whose nomination faced strong opposition. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and experience as a former district attorney. Martin's nomination was withdrawn due to criticism over his support for individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot. Pirro is a vocal supporter of Trump, who previously pardoned her ex-husband for tax evasion. Senator Thom Tillis cited Martin's support for Capitol riot defendants as his reason for opposing the nomination.</p>

          <p>A federal court ruled that Alabama's state-drawn congressional map intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents, violating the Voting Rights Act. The court ordered the state to continue using a court-ordered map that led to the election of Alabama's second Black congressman. The judges criticized Alabama's "deliberate decision to ignore" their order to create a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing. This decision follows a February trial over the state map, and Alabama is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Political editor Chris Mason analyzes the recent trade deal between the UK and the US, noting that it represents a limited but positive development for Prime Minister Starmer. While ministers emphasize the real-world benefits for workers and industries, critics argue that the deal primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than establishing a comprehensive free trade agreement. The agreement offers improved trading conditions compared to the immediate past but may not surpass those of six months prior. Despite the limitations, the deal avoids diluting the UK's Digital Services Tax and sidesteps contentious issues related to the NHS and food standards.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have agreed to a deal that will reduce tariffs imposed during the Trump administration on cars and metals. The agreement will reduce the import tax on cars to 10% for a set number of British vehicles and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free. While leaders in both countries are hailing the agreement as significant, analysts say that it does not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year. The office also said the two sides had agreed to "reciprocal access" for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers.</p>
