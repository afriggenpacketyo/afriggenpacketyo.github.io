          <p>A skydiving aircraft carrying 15 people crashed at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, resulting in injuries for all on board, some critically. Despite the severity, no fatalities were reported, with emergency crews commending recent mass casualty training for the effective response, highlighting the joint effort of police, firefighters, and EMS. The pilot reported engine trouble shortly after takeoff, attempting an unsuccessful landing back at the airport. This particular Cessna 208B was previously involved in a 2023 incident in Virginia where it went off a runway and sustained substantial damage. Federal and local authorities are currently investigating the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>A recent survey conducted by The Washington Post, which analyzed over 450,000 Yelp reviews and solicited reader responses, identified the top U.S. airports based on traveler experiences and unique amenities. Portland International Airport (PDX) in Oregon was ranked number one, praised for its live trees, sky-lit ceilings, and distinctive features such as a giant pink mailbox and occasional therapy llamas. Other highly-rated facilities included Long Beach (LGB) for its Art Deco design and al fresco dining, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) for its convenience to Washington, D.C., and impressive landmark views.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed new housing bills into law, significantly restricting the reach of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to streamline urban, multifamily housing developments. These reforms exempt most such projects from environmental review procedures and make it easier for cities to change zoning laws, directly addressing the state's severe housing shortage. This legislative shift, enacted despite strong objections from some environmental groups and labor unions, represents a notable pivot in Democratic policymaking. The article argues it prioritizes material abundance and the general public's needs over avoiding intra-party tension and status quo bias, potentially serving as a model for other states struggling with similar issues.</p>

          <p>Ken Casey, the outspoken founder and frontman of the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys, discusses his firm anti-Trump stance and the band's commitment to working-class values. Casey, a physical embodiment of Boston, believes their three decades of music have prepared them for the current political climate, which he views as a "scam." He recounts a viral incident at a Florida show where he challenged a Trump supporter's "Made in America" shirt, highlighting the hypocrisy. Casey also reflects on how identity politics and perceived Democratic Party dysfunction alienate working-class voters, advocating for a centrist leader who can effectively communicate with this demographic. He emphasizes his disdain for bullies and the importance of standing up for what is right.</p>

          <h2>Can Children Still Experience "Lazy Summers" in the Digital Age?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 07:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the contemporary debate on whether children can still experience "lazy summers" reminiscent of the 1990s, given the prevalence of structured activities and ubiquitous digital devices. Experts highlight that today's children have less unsupervised downtime and are subject to greater supervision, with smartphones now serving as a primary source of entertainment over traditional outdoor play. While current screen time is qualitatively different, focusing heavily on gaming and short-form videos, the article reveals that older teenagers are increasingly adept at managing their own device usage. It suggests that while a completely "wild summer" might be difficult for younger children, older kids demonstrate the capacity to balance screen time with real-world engagement.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu has implemented its biggest overhaul of its core search platform in a decade, integrating artificial intelligence to counter pressure from fast-moving rivals like DeepSeek and emerging short video platforms. Users can now input over a thousand characters in search, ask questions conversationally, and prompt the engine with voice, pictures, and files. Baidu has also integrated its Ernie Bot AI chatbot features, allowing users to generate photos, text, and videos directly within the product. This strategic move mirrors Google's efforts to enhance its search with AI, highlighting the disruptive impact on traditional search markets. Analysts see this as a crucial defensive and offensive play for Baidu to assert its leadership in the AI space amidst intense competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is set to discontinue its standalone free streaming television service, Freevee, next month, as part of a strategic move to consolidate its content offerings under Prime Video.

          <p>Casey Johnston's new book, "A Physical Education," delves into the transformative journey of women embracing weightlifting, actively challenging traditional diet culture's emphasis on shrinkage and aesthetic ideals. The article highlights how Johnston's personal experience shifted from joyless cardio to finding profound strength and self-acceptance through lifting, reframing exercise as building up rather than whittling away. It critiques the "busywork bullshit" exercises and the relentless societal pressure for women to constantly strive for a smaller physique, instead advocating for a focus on physical function over outward appearance. The piece suggests that weightlifting can foster a healthier relationship with one's body, emphasizing that food is fuel and that rest is an integral part of progress.</p>

          <p>China's Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has implemented new safety regulations for power banks, effective June 28, mandating that they possess China Compulsory Certification (3C certification) for air travel. Any power bank without this visible mark is now considered "substandard" and ineligible for flights. This new rule has prompted questions and concerns among travelers, leading airports to establish designated areas where passengers can discard or temporarily store non-compliant devices, and offering mailing services. This crackdown aims to enhance safety standards for portable power sources on flights, ensuring all such devices meet specific safety, health, and environmental impact requirements before they can be manufactured, sold, imported, or used within China.</p>
