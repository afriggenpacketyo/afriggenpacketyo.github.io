        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, passed away at 89 due to pneumonia. Nagashima was a key player for the Yomiuri Giants, contributing to their nine consecutive Central League and Japan Series titles from 1965 to 1973, and later managed the team. Known as "Mr. Giants," he was admired for his on-field prowess and charismatic personality, transcending sports. His retirement in 1974 was a major news event, and his words at the ceremony became part of Japan's cultural lexicon. His legacy extends beyond his playing career as he also helped elevate professional baseball's popularity in Japan.</p>

          <p>USC's baseball team suffered a season-ending defeat against Oregon State in the NCAA Corvallis Regional final, losing 9-0. Oregon State's pitchers dominated the game, limiting USC to only three hits. Oregon State's strong offense, including home runs from Aiva Arquette, Gavin Turley, and Trent Caraway, contributed to their victory. With this win, Oregon State advances to the super-regional round, while USC's season comes to a close. The Beavers will host Florida State in a three-game series starting Friday after the Seminoles won the Tallahassee Regional.</p>

          <p>South Koreans are participating in a snap election to select a new president following the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, who faced rebellion charges for imposing martial law. Pre-election surveys suggest Lee Jae-myung, Yoon's liberal rival, is likely to win due to public frustration with conservatives. The new president will immediately be sworn in for a five-year term and will confront significant challenges, including a slowing economy, President Trump's trade policies, and North Korea's nuclear threats. Both candidates have outlined different approaches to these issues, particularly regarding relations with North Korea and the United States.</p>

          <p>One of Big Bear's bald eaglets, Sunny, has taken its first flight from the nest, marking a significant milestone for the famed eagle parents, Jackie and Shadow. The eaglet, approximately 13 weeks old, jumped off a branch and successfully flew away, though it is expected to return to the nest soon. The other eaglet, Gizmo, has not yet left the nest and is developing at a slower pace. Both eaglets will remain in the habitat for one to three months before venturing out on their own in the fall.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision provides relief for older borrowers who rely on fixed incomes and may struggle to afford basic necessities if their benefits are reduced. The government has significant collection powers on student loans, including the ability to seize tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits. The administration's move aims to protect vulnerable Social Security recipients who are in default on their student loan debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts are debating whether Pop Mart's Labubu, a collectible character, could become as successful as Sanrio's Hello Kitty. Labubu has gained popularity, attracting fans like David Beckham's family and driving Pop Mart's stock to record highs. International sales have surged, particularly in the US and Europe. Some believe Labubu's success lies in its universal appeal, tapping into emotions through design and marketing without explicitly focusing on Chinese culture. JPMorgan Chase has initiated coverage of Pop Mart with an overweight rating, suggesting further growth potential.</p>

          <p>NPR is conducting a survey to gather information on the songs parents sing to their babies, prompted by a Yale University study showing that singing to infants improves their mood and well-being. The study found that babies who are sung to frequently are generally happier throughout the day. NPR is encouraging parents to share the songs they use to calm or bring joy to their babies, and even to upload recordings of themselves singing. The submissions may be featured on Morning Edition.</p>
