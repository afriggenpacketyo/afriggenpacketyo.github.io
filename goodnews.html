        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides essential guidance on distinguishing between heat exhaustion and the more severe condition of heat stroke. Key symptoms of heat exhaustion include headache, heavy sweating, and cool skin, while heat stroke is a life-threatening emergency characterized by a high body temperature and potential loss of consciousness. For heat exhaustion, the immediate advice is to move to a cool place and rehydrate. However, for suspected heat stroke, it is critical to call emergency services immediately while attempting to cool the person down, as it can be fatal if not treated promptly.</p>

          <h2>Long-Lost Novel by German Writer Sebastian Haffner Becomes Posthumous Bestseller</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A forgotten novel titled "Parting," written in 1932 by a young Sebastian Haffner before he fled Nazi Germany, has become a bestseller nearly a century later. Discovered after his death in 1999, the manuscript tells an autobiographical love story set against the backdrop of the Weimar Republic's collapse. Haffner, who later became a renowned journalist and historian known for his sharp analyses of Nazism, shelved the novel, and his family hesitated to publish it for over two decades. The book offers a glimpse of a more hopeful, literary side to the author, contrasting with his later, more somber historical works.</p>

          <p>A viral satellite image shared on social media, claiming to show the aftermath of an Iranian missile strike on Israel's Weizmann Institute, has been debunked. A DW Fact Check investigation confirmed that the image actually shows an Iranian military base in Tabriz that was damaged by an Israeli attack, not the other way around. By using reverse image search and comparing coordinates on Google Maps, the report verifies the true location of the damage. The incident highlights the ongoing spread of misinformation and repurposed visuals related to the conflict between Israel and Iran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NBA's free agency period began with significant moves from several teams aiming to bolster their rosters for the upcoming season. The San Antonio Spurs signed center Luke Kornet to support Victor Wembanyama, while the Houston Rockets added veteran forward Dorian Finney-Smith and center Clint Capela as part of a major offseason overhaul. Other notable agreements include D'Angelo Russell joining the Dallas Mavericks and Nickeil Alexander-Walker moving to the Atlanta Hawks. These early deals signal teams' intentions to build contending rosters ahead of the new season.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Political Protest's Role in Countering the 'Spiral of Silence'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that a primary, often overlooked function of political protest is to break the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where people mistakenly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. Public demonstrations serve as a visible signal of collective opinion, correcting misperceptions about what society truly believes on issues like climate change or abortion rights. The author cites research showing how protests following the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision shifted public perception of support for abortion access. By making dissent public, protests build common knowledge and prevent unpopular policies from persisting due to a mistakenly acquiescent public.</p>

          <h2>Danish Women to Face Military Conscription via Lottery System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 06:45:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has implemented a new law requiring women to be included in the military conscription system alongside men when they turn 18. Under the new rules, both genders will enter a lottery that could compel them to serve an 11-month term, an increase from the previous four-month period. This change, which follows the examples of Norway and Sweden, is part of Denmark's effort to boost its defense capabilities and meet NATO targets amid heightened security concerns in Europe. The government expects the number of annual conscripts to rise from 4,700 to 6,500 by 2033.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Chelsea's Transfer Strategy Under Maresca Seeks Tactical Unpredictability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 06:26:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests Chelsea's recent transfer activity, including the pursuit of Brighton's Jo√£o Pedro, is driven by head coach Enzo Maresca's desire for tactical versatility and unpredictability. Maresca's system, which often inverts full-backs and relies on wingers, sometimes struggled against deep-defending teams last season. The acquisition of players like Jo√£o Pedro, who can play as a second striker and link play from deep, offers a different profile than the team's existing speedy wingers. This strategy aims to create multiple modes of attack, share the creative load with Cole Palmer, and better equip the squad for the increased demands of Champions League football.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare has announced it will begin blocking AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a move that could significantly impact how AI models are trained. The new policy requires website owners to explicitly grant permission for AI bots to access their content, aiming to restore power to creators who lose traffic and revenue when AI models use their data without attribution. This shift addresses growing concerns that AI companies are harvesting vast amounts of text and images without compensating the original publishers, potentially hindering the development of large language models that rely on such data.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary offers key lessons for the national Democratic party. The author suggests his success demonstrates that practical socialist policies focused on affordability, such as rent freezes and free childcare, resonate deeply with voters. Furthermore, Mamdani's principled and consistent stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict, despite attacks, showed that moral integrity can be a political asset. The campaign's ability to mobilize a massive volunteer base to overpower a well-funded opponent highlights the power of grassroots organizing over money in politics.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled new tax incentives aimed at encouraging foreign companies to reinvest their profits within the country. The policy allows foreign firms to deduct 10 percent of their reinvested amount from their onshore taxes, an effort to restore investor confidence amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and E.U. This move is part of a broader strategy to signal that China remains open for business and to stabilize foreign capital flows. The incentives can be applied retroactively to qualifying investments made since the beginning of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>
