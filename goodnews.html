          <p>An exhibition in Shanghai is showcasing rare early editions of "Red Star Over China," the influential 1937 book by American journalist Edgar Snow. The display features the original English version, the first U.S. edition, and the earliest Chinese translation from 1938. Snow's work provided the Western world with its first detailed account of the Chinese Communist Party's early days, including extensive interviews with leaders like Mao Zedong. The exhibition commemorates the historical significance of the book, which documented Snow's time embedded with the Red Army in Yanan.</p>

          <p>A personal finance reporter shares insights from her experience buying a wedding dress, emphasizing the importance of timing and comprehensive budgeting. She learned that ordering a dress too close to the wedding date can incur significant "rush fees," potentially adding hundreds of dollars to the cost. The article advises brides to start shopping about a year in advance and to create an "attire budget" rather than just a "dress budget," factoring in often-forgotten expenses like veils, accessories, and alterations to avoid unexpected costs and stay within financial goals.</p>

          <h2>Expert Argues Against Diet Culture, Suggests Focusing on Food Access for Children's Health</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, author and anti-diet advocate Virginia Sole-Smith discusses the current anxieties surrounding children's diets, particularly concerning ultra-processed foods. She argues that pathologizing body size and restricting foods can be harmful, creating toxic relationships with food and fueling disordered eating. Instead of focusing on specific dietary rules, Sole-Smith advocates for addressing systemic issues like food insecurity and poverty. She suggests that ensuring children have enough access to food and are allowed bodily autonomy in their choices is more crucial for their well-being than adhering to strict nutritional guidelines.</p>

          <p>While many congressional Republicans are avoiding public forums, Representative Mark Alford of Missouri has held 15 public events, including five town halls, to engage directly with his constituents. Despite representing a safely Republican district, Alford faced tough questions and criticism on topics like President Trump's policies, tariffs, and recent cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. His willingness to face voters, even hostile ones, sets him apart from colleagues and offers a direct view into the concerns of voters, particularly regarding the impacts of the new Republican tax and spending package.</p>

Woltemade had a breakout season with Stuttgart, scoring 17 goals, and was the top scorer at the recent Under-21 Euros. His arrival is a significant move for Newcastle as they look to bolster their attacking options.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's shutdown of the widely used climate information portal climate.gov, a team of its former employees is working to resurrect the content on a new, non-profit website called climate.us. The original site, run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, was intentionally made difficult to access and its production team was fired. The new volunteer-led initiative aims not only to restore public access to climate science but also to potentially expand its mission to offer direct climate-related services to local governments, carrying on their work outside the federal bureaucracy.</p>

The choir's artistic director noted the connection to Freddie Mercury, who was born in Zanzibar, and the translation process was a meticulous effort to remain true to the original's meaning while adapting it to the Zulu language. The new version incorporates traditional African musical styles.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has granted 23 pardons and commuted the sentences of 10 inmates, including five who were serving life without parole for murder. In his clemency orders, Newsom stated that the individuals have demonstrated significant rehabilitation and self-improvement during their incarceration. The commutations will make the inmates eligible for parole hearings, where their potential release will be considered. The governor's office noted that many of those granted clemency had experienced significant childhood trauma, which was a factor in the decisions.</p>

          <p>Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates a significant and sustained decline in fatal drug overdoses in the United States, reaching a five-year low. Despite this positive trend, which began in mid-2023, President Donald Trump has continued to frame the fentanyl crisis as a growing threat to justify policies such as harsh mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. Public health experts attribute the drop in deaths to improved addiction treatment and successful efforts to disrupt fentanyl supply chains, while some critics worry Republican funding cuts could reverse this progress.
