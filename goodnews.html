          <p>Goldman Sachs is piloting an autonomous AI software engineer named Devin, developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant milestone for artificial intelligence on Wall Street. The bank plans to integrate Devin into its workforce of 12,000 human developers to handle routine coding tasks, with the potential to scale up to thousands of AI agents. This move to "agentic AI," which can execute complex multi-step jobs, is expected to significantly boost productivity but also fuels concerns about future job displacement within the financial industry.

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat health alerts for southern England, the Midlands, and the East of England as the country experiences its third heatwave of the summer. The warnings are in effect from Friday to Monday, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 32C. Less severe yellow warnings are active in northern England, while parts of Wales and Scotland may also see their hottest days of the year. The heatwave is forecast to subside by Monday as cooler Atlantic air moves in.</p>

          <p>Three Merseyside Police officers have been honored for their bravery in confronting Axel Rudakubana, the attacker who murdered three young girls at a dance workshop in Southport last year. Sgt Gregory Gillespie, PC Luke Holden, and PCSO Timothy Parry were the first to arrive at the chaotic scene and entered the building to face the armed assailant. They successfully disarmed and arrested Rudakubana, who was later sentenced to a minimum of 52 years in prison. The officers were recognized at the 2025 Police Federation bravery awards for their decisive actions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a nationwide injunction, blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship in the United States. The ruling, delivered on Thursday, prevents the policy from taking effect anywhere in the country. The executive order was a key and controversial part of the president's platform, seeking to reinterpret the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. This judicial action ensures that the long-standing principle of birthright citizenship remains intact for the time being, pending any further legal appeals.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which scientists from Oxford University suggest could be the oldest comet ever observed. Preliminary findings indicate it may be over seven billion years old, predating our own solar system by three billion years. This is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Researchers believe 3I/Atlas originated in the Milky Way's 'thick disk' and is composed largely of water ice, which could create a visible tail as it approaches the Sun later this year.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between the current US men's national team's preparations for the 2026 World Cup under Mauricio Pochettino and South Korea's successful 2002 campaign under coach Guus Hiddink. It notes how Hiddink overcame initial poor results and media criticism by focusing intensely on player fitness and fostering a cohesive, club-like atmosphere. The analysis suggests that while Pochettino faces different challenges, such as managing a roster of Europe-based players, lessons from Hiddink's strategy of maximizing preparation time and building an exceptionally fit team could be valuable for the U.S. as a co-host.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns that billions of dollars from opioid settlements are not being used as intended, two advocacy groups have launched a crowdsourced database to track spending. The Opioid Policy Institute and Popular Democracy created a website for the public to report alleged misuse of funds, aiming to pressure state attorneys general into providing stricter oversight. With federal funding for addiction services being cut, families and advocates fear states will use the "blood money" to fill budget gaps rather than combat the overdose crisis. The initiative highlights a growing demand for transparency and accountability.</p>

Despite initial concerns about potential player distraction, the innovation has reportedly been well-received.

          <p>The UK government has put on hold any immediate plans to reduce the £20,000 annual allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (Isas) following strong opposition. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reportedly considering the change to encourage more investment in stocks and shares to boost the economy. However, banks, building societies, and consumer advocates raised concerns that the move would disincentivize saving or lead to savers paying more tax. While the Treasury has stepped back for now, future reforms have not been completely ruled out. (not investment advice)</p>

New data shows a 54% year-on-year increase in Tesla sales in Norway for June, driven by the popularity of its revamped Model Y. An official from the Norwegian EV Association noted that while Musk's politics are a concern for some buyers, the brand's success is due to its vehicles offering good value and features suited to Norwegian needs, such as all-wheel drive and large luggage space.</p>

Concurrently, Loeb made a significant new investment by purchasing 1.45 million shares of Nvidia.
