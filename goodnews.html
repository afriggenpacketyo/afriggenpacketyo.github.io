          <p>This article analyzes the distinct roles of certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities in retirement planning, concluding that the better choice depends on an individual's financial goals. CDs are presented as simple, safe options ideal for principal preservation and short-term needs, while annuities are designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, mitigating the risk of outliving one's savings. Many retirees may find a combination of both instruments to be the most effective strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
