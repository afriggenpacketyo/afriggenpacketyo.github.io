        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of golf and its relationship with the White House, focusing on how different presidents have approached the game. From Taft's concern about public perception to Eisenhower's avid playing and Trump's integration of golf into his work, the article highlights the varying roles golf has played in presidential life. Reagan curtailed his golf after a terrorist attack in Beirut, and George W. Bush stopped playing during the second Iraq war. The article concludes by noting Trump's unique obsession with golf compared to his predecessors, and how the game has played a part in his presidency.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 08:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to find skilled workers, particularly aircraft mechanics, as the average age of certified mechanics is 54. A report indicates that the U.S. will be short 25,000 aircraft technicians by 2028, exacerbated by COVID-19 buyouts of experienced workers. Companies like GE Aerospace are trying to attract younger people with competitive salaries, but geographic immobility and a perceived lack of appeal in manufacturing jobs pose challenges. While wages have increased for technicians, some argue they need to rise further to address the impending workforce shortage, which could impact the entire world.</p>

          <p>Tinder is trialing a height filter for premium users, prompting mixed reactions about its potential impact on dating. Some users worry it may stifle connections based on superficial criteria, while others believe it could help shorter men find matches. One woman, Ashley, says she found love with her 5ft 6in partner, Joe, and a height filter might have prevented their meeting. Critics argue that limiting oneself to physical attributes reduces opportunities for meaningful connections, while others suggest the filter could reassure shorter men by helping them avoid women who exclusively date tall men.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the phenomenon of "anticipatory compliance," where institutions preemptively cater to Donald Trump's agenda, and argues for a counter-strategy of "anticipatory noncompliance." Examples include universities censoring course content and companies reducing DEI programs. However, the article notes a growing trend of resistance, with universities pushing back against demands, states challenging administration policies, and consumers boycotting companies that scale back diversity programs. The author emphasizes the importance of actively opposing unconstitutional actions to safeguard democracy and civil liberties, highlighting examples of legal challenges and public opposition to the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>This article details how a network of women in Latin America transformed access to safe abortions through self-managed methods, particularly using misoprostol. Beginning in the 1990s, activists shared information about the drug, developed protocols for its use, and established hotlines to provide support. They faced legal restrictions and social stigma, but their efforts led to increased access to safe abortions and influenced policy changes in countries like Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia. The movement evolved from providing information to offering accompaniment, emphasizing support throughout the abortion process and leading to the legalization of abortion in several countries.</p>
