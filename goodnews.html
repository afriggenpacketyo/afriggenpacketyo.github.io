          <p>The Fairness, Inclusion, Rehabilitation, and Expungement for Incarcerated Firefighters Act (FIRE Act) has been introduced in Congress to support former inmate firefighters by providing job training, workplace opportunities, and mentorship. The act seeks to address the barriers these individuals face in securing employment after release, despite their valuable experience and contributions to fighting wildfires. It also aims to create a pathway for expunging the criminal records of those who successfully complete probation and reentry programs. The act would also offer incentives for other states to start their own versions of fire camps.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk voiced his disappointment with the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House and supported by President Trump. Musk stated that the bill increases the budget deficit and undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which he previously led. He believes that a bill can be either big or beautiful, but not necessarily both. The tax provisions of the bill are projected to increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kara Hochreiter, a dietitian, suggests that golden milk is the best late-night drink for gut health due to its anti-inflammatory properties and soothing effect. Golden milk, a blend of turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, and dairy-free milk, contains compounds like curcumin that may reduce inflammation in the gut lining. Additionally, ginger may support gut motility, and the drink can contribute to hydration, promoting smoother bowel movements. Incorporating golden milk into a nightly routine can help you wind down and support optimal overnight gut healing.</p>
