          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its Prime Invitee Program, which permitted Prime members to share their free shipping benefits with individuals outside their own household. The company has begun notifying users that the program will end on October 1, 2025, directing them towards the more restrictive Amazon Family feature instead. Under the new rules, all users sharing benefits must reside at the same primary address. This policy change comes amid reports that Amazon's Prime membership growth in the U.S. has not met internal targets for the year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has barred President Donald Trump from deploying the National Guard or other military forces for domestic law enforcement activities within California. Judge Charles Breyer ruled that the administration's previous deployment of troops in Los Angeles willfully violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws. The injunction, which is currently limited to California, was issued in response to a lawsuit from the state challenging the use of troops to manage immigration-related protests.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have signed an open letter defending the independence of the Federal Reserve and supporting Governor Lisa Cook. The letter comes in response to President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Cook from her position over unproven allegations, an action the economists warn erodes trust in a key financial institution. They argue that the central bank was designed to be insulated from day-to-day politics to ensure credible monetary policy, a principle threatened by the administration's recent actions.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, making it one of the consumer giant's top five active investors. Elliott has sent a letter and presentation to PepsiCo's board, outlining a plan to restore business momentum and unlock what it calls a "historic opportunity" for shareholder value.

          <p>The results of a new clinical trial suggest that azelastine, a common over-the-counter antihistamine nasal spray, may be effective in preventing COVID-19 infections. In the study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, participants who used the spray three times a day had a 2.2% infection rate, significantly lower than the 6.7% rate in the placebo group. Researchers theorize the spray might inhibit the virus's ability to replicate within the nasal passages, offering a potential new tool for prophylaxis against respiratory infections.</p>
