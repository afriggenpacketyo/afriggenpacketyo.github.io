        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>School districts across the United States are implementing cellphone bans by requiring students to secure their devices in locked magnetic pouches, such as those made by Yondr. The move aims to reduce classroom distractions and improve student engagement, aligning with new state-level mandates in places like New York. While educators and many parents support the initiative, citing increased focus and social interaction, student reactions are mixed, with some attempting to bypass the system. The cost of the pouches, ranging from $25-30 per student, has also sparked debate over school budget priorities, though proponents argue it's a necessary investment in creating a better learning environment.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.8 billion for Saturday's drawing, making it the second-largest lottery prize in United States history. The grand prize grew after no ticket matched all winning numbers in Wednesday's drawing, extending the winless streak to 41 consecutive drawings. The potential winner of the massive prize will have the choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option of approximately $826.4 million before taxes. The record-breaking jackpot has generated widespread public interest, though the odds of winning remain exceptionally low at 1 in 292.2 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China projected its growing geopolitical influence and advocated for a multipolar global order. The event served as a platform for President Xi Jinping to present China as a stable alternative to the current international system, particularly amid perceived unpredictability from the United States. A notable moment of camaraderie between Xi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi symbolized a potential alignment of Eurasian powers. The summit emphasized the SCO's focus on combating terrorism and integrating economic initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, signaling China's ambition to lead a new era of global governance.</p>

          <p>A heartwarming resolution emerged after a viral video showed an adult woman taking a home run ball from a young Philadelphia Phillies fan during a game against the Miami Marlins. After Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader hit the ball into the stands, a dispute occurred where the woman claimed the ball and took it from the boy's father, who had initially retrieved it for his son. In response, the Marlins' staff gifted the young fan a swag bag. Following the game, Bader himself met the boy, Lincoln, and gave him an autographed baseball bat, turning a moment of disappointment into a memorable experience for the young fan.</p>

          <p>At its recent party conference, Reform UK showcased a new generation of politicians in an effort to demonstrate that it is more than a one-person entity centered around leader Nigel Farage. The party, which currently leads in national opinion polls, is focused on building a broader base of credible candidates for upcoming local and national elections. Figures like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, both former Conservatives, were given prominent roles. The party is implementing a more rigorous vetting process for its candidates to avoid past scandals and build a sustainable political force for the future.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing for the November 26th budget amidst a challenging economic and political landscape. Recent market instability, including fluctuations in government bond rates, and cabinet reshuffles are key factors influencing her fiscal decisions. While Reeves has dismissed concerns of a UK-specific crisis, pointing to global trends, the fragile markets serve as a warning against increasing national debt. The final budget measures will depend heavily on the Office for Budget Responsibility's economic forecasts and the government's ability to navigate pressure for either tax increases or spending cuts.

          <p>A UK-based community group called Sisters in Service is providing a vital support network for female military veterans who now work in healthcare. Co-founded by Dr. Bex Bennett, a former British Army officer and current NHS psychiatrist, the organization aims to address the unique challenges women face after serving in combat roles. Many female veterans feel isolated because public perception often overlooks their front-line experiences in conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan. The group offers a space for shared understanding and mutual support, helping members navigate the transition to civilian life and cope with the mental scars of war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ukrainian military is extensively using a variety of decoys, from inflatable tanks to plywood artillery, to mislead Russian forces and exhaust their ammunition. This strategy of deception forces Russia to waste valuable resources, such as expensive Lancet drones, on fake targets. Volunteer groups play a crucial role in producing these decoys, including full-scale models of high-value equipment like the British-made M777 howitzer. The tactic is highly effective, with some decoys surviving multiple strikes and being redeployed. Russia also employs similar deception, using imitation drones to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, highlighting the critical role of misinformation in modern warfare.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his devout faith and technological skills, Acutis created websites to document Eucharistic miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His canonization was fast-tracked by the Vatican, which attributed two miracles to his intercession, in a move seen as an effort to connect with and inspire younger generations of Catholics. A shrine at the London church where he was baptized has become a pilgrimage site, holding a relic of his hair.</p>

          <p>As Dame Anna Wintour transitions from her nearly 40-year tenure as editor-in-chief of US Vogue, questions arise about the magazine's future relevance in a rapidly changing media landscape. Wintour, who will remain as global editorial director, is credited with transforming Vogue by merging high fashion with popular culture, famously featuring celebrities like Madonna on the cover. Her successor, Chloe Malle, faces the challenge of keeping the iconic print publication influential amidst the dominance of digital media like TikTok and Instagram. Malle plans to shift Vogue toward a less frequent, more collectible format, but the brand's ability to shape culture without Wintour's direct editorial control remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, marking their 30th consecutive win. Despite the dominant final score, England had a shaky start, struggling with their line-outs and failing to capitalize on their powerful driving maul early in the match. Australia showed strong intensity and tactical kicking, briefly taking the lead and unsettling the host team. However, England's superior depth and defensive strength shone through in the second half, where they kept the Wallaroos scoreless. The performance highlighted areas for improvement as they head into the knockout stages of the tournament.</p>
