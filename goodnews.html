          <p>Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna are jointly pushing for a full release of Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Massie stated a desire to see more than just reported letters, emphasizing the need for financial records to "follow the money." Their bipartisan legislation aims to force a House vote on the matter, bypassing Speaker Mike Johnson, whom they criticize for adjourning the House early. The proposed law includes protections to redact victims' names and prevent the release of sensitive material.</p>

          <p>Challenging recent narratives of superhero fatigue, Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" achieved a successful domestic opening weekend, earning an estimated $118 million. The film's strong performance, coupled with a global haul of $218 million, is seen as a positive sign for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has had a mixed box office record since "Avengers: Endgame." Analysts suggest this success, alongside positive critical reception, indicates that a focus on quality over quantity is helping to reinvigorate the franchise and attract audiences back to theaters.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" had a powerful opening weekend, earning $118 million domestically and $218 million globally, providing a much-needed success for the studio. The film, the first "Fantastic Four" movie under Disney's ownership of the former Fox property, exceeded expectations and received positive reviews from critics and audiences. This strong debut is seen as a positive outcome of Disney CEO Bob Iger's stated strategy to focus on quality over quantity, following a period of mixed results for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>

          <p>According to sources, Beijing and Washington are set to extend their current tariff truce for another three months during trade negotiations in Stockholm. The original 90-day suspension of most tariffs was due to expire on August 12. While the extension signals a commitment to avoid escalating the trade war, insiders do not expect major breakthroughs on key issues like China's industrial overcapacity. The Chinese delegation is also expected to press the U.S. on its tariffs related to fentanyl, seeking clarity on what would be required for them to be eased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from imposing certain ideological requirements on grant recipients. The ruling blocks conditions that would have required organizations to align with the administration's views on gender identity and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) to receive federal funding. The lawsuit was filed by a nationwide coalition of service providers, including six from Rhode Island, who argue the restrictions would force them to abandon their core principles and harm the vulnerable communities they serve, such as domestic abuse survivors and unhoused LGBTQI+ youth.</p>

          <p>A one-year-old boy in Bihar, India, reportedly killed a cobra by biting it after the snake had coiled around his hands while he was playing. The infant, named Govinda, fainted after the incident and was rushed to a hospital for treatment. Doctors reported that the venom's effects were mild and not fatal, and the child is now in stable condition and under observation. The incident is particularly remarkable given that the Indian cobra is one of the "big four" venomous snakes responsible for the majority of snakebite deaths in the country.</p>

          <p>A financial columnist analyzes the newly established "Trump IRA," a savings vehicle for children under 18, viewing it as more of a political giveaway than a robust financial tool. While acknowledging the free $1,000 government contribution for newborns is worth taking, the article argues there are better long-term strategies for parents. The author suggests alternatives like 529 education savings plans, custodial Roth IRAs, and whole life insurance policies offer more significant and flexible benefits for a child's future. These options provide greater tax advantages, higher contribution limits, and more versatile uses for the funds. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day workweek reveal that the resulting boost in employee happiness is not just due to having an extra day off. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key factor is that workers feel more effective and productive on the clock. By condensing their work into fewer hours, teams are forced to streamline processes and eliminate busywork, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment. This feeling of being on top of their work and life contributes significantly to their overall well-being, improved work-life balance, and even business profitability.</p>

          <p>An estimated £274 million in government-allocated Child Trust Funds (CTFs) belonging to disadvantaged young people in the UK have not been claimed, according to charity warnings. CTFs are tax-free savings accounts set up for individuals born between 2002 and 2011, with initial government contributions. Many of these accounts, which become accessible at age 18, were automatically allocated by HMRC if families didn't act. The Share Foundation is now calling for an automatic release mechanism to ensure these dormant funds reach the young adults they were intended for.</p>

          <p>In a financial advice column, a 65-year-old woman with a $7 million net worth asks if her 73-year-old boyfriend, whose wealth is mostly tied up in his house, should release home equity so they can spend more lavishly together. The columnist strongly advises against this, warning that it would create a power imbalance and jeopardize the boyfriend's financial independence for the sake of a lifestyle he cannot otherwise afford. Instead of having him take on debt or sell assets, the columnist suggests the couple find ways to enjoy their time that don't rely on him matching her spending level. (not investment advice)</p>
