        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Republican-controlled legislatures in Utah and Idaho passing bans on flying pride flags on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted inventive workarounds. Salt Lake City adopted three new city flags incorporating the pride flag, the trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag into the city's traditional design. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag, after the Idaho legislature restricted allowable flags to a limited list. These actions highlight the ongoing tension between conservative efforts to restrict LGBTQ+ rights and local governments' attempts to affirm diversity and inclusion.</p>

          <p>During a House committee hearing, leaders from Haverford College, DePaul University, and California Polytechnic State University apologized for their institutions' responses to antisemitism on campus, particularly following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The hearing echoed previous sessions that led to resignations at Penn and Harvard, with Republicans threatening to withhold federal funding from uncooperative schools. Democratic representatives accused Republicans of using antisemitism as a political tool, while university leaders attempted to balance contrition with academic freedom. The article notes that many universities have tightened protest rules and issued harsher punishments, potentially explaining the reduced protest activity this spring.</p>

The Fed signaled rising economic risks, with concerns that Trump's tariffs could spur higher inflation and unemployment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that while consumer and business sentiment has dropped, the tariffs' impact hasn't yet materialized in economic data.
