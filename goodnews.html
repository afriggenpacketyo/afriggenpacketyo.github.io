          <p>Experts suggest that affordable credit card interest rates are unlikely to return soon, potentially remaining elevated into 2026. The Federal Reserve's cautious stance on interest rate cuts, coupled with rising consumer debt and delinquency rates, contribute to this forecast. While a Fed rate cut could help, lenders are also weighing default risks and operating margins before lowering APRs. Consumers are advised to explore debt repayment strategies and hardship programs to manage their balances amid the high-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Skeletal remains discovered on New Jersey beaches decades ago have been identified as Captain Henry Goodsell, the captain of the schooner Oriental, which sank in 1844. The identification was made possible through the investigative efforts of college students at Ramapo College's Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center. The ship was transporting marble when it likely sprung a leak and sank off the coast of Brigantine Shoal, resulting in the deaths of all five crew members. The students linked the ancestry matches and circumstantial evidence to identify the remains.</p>

          <p>The graduating class of 2025 from West Point includes honorary member Peter Wang, a Junior ROTC cadet killed in the 2018 Parkland shooting. Wang, who was 15 years old, was found dead in his JROTC uniform after holding a door open to allow classmates to escape during the shooting. For his actions, Peter was posthumously awarded the Medal of Heroism by the U.S. Army. West Point granted Peter honorary admission to the class of 2025.</p>

          <h2>Navigating HELOCs: Summer Strategies and Potential Pitfalls</h2>

          <p>Experts advise caution when using home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) this summer, emphasizing that they should be reserved for essential expenses and investments that generate a financial return. HELOCs are beneficial for consolidating credit card debt due to lower interest rates and for home improvements that increase property value. However, using HELOCs for non-essential items like vacations or pools is discouraged due to the risk of long-term debt and the potential for foreclosure. A HELOC might be a good option for college costs if private student loans are required, but not if federal student loans are available. (not investment advice)</p>
