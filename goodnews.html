          <p>Florida's Operation Dragon Eye, led by the U.S. Marshals Office, rescued dozens of children from child sex trafficking operations. The initiative involved 20 agencies and focused on locating 60 critically missing children and apprehending suspects involved in trafficking, drugs, and child endangerment. The rescued children, aged 9 to 17, received immediate medical and psychological support. Florida is among the top three states for reported human trafficking cases, prompting increased funding and legislative efforts to combat the issue, including stricter penalties for traffickers and awareness training for various professionals. The operation sends a message that Florida will not be a safe place for traffickers, and the state remains committed to finding missing children.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after a week of aerial attacks following Israel's initial strike on Iran's nuclear program. This announcement came after Iran reportedly carried out a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in response to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites. According to a U.S. official, there were no casualties at the base. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war concludes, but neither Israel nor Iran has confirmed the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel stated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions.

He also noted that the market seems to agree, as oil prices decreased. Braziel cautioned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China are causing issues for exporters, making global customers wary of relying on the U.S. as a trustworthy energy supplier.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, many Trump voters expressed support, viewing the actions as protecting American interests and preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Despite Trump's previous emphasis on avoiding "never-ending wars," supporters trust him to manage the situation effectively. Some prominent Republicans criticized the strikes, arguing they contradict the "America First" agenda. The voters interviewed believe the airstrikes do not conflict with Trump's America First agenda, seeing it as putting military and strategic interests first, and they believe Trump wants peace.</p>

          <p>President Trump's high-risk strategy of striking Iranian nuclear facilities may yield positive results if Iran's retaliation ends with limited damage. Trump stated that Iran's response was weak and expressed hope for peace in the region. The situation echoes the 2020 killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, where initial escalation de-escalated. Trump's approach involves a high-stakes gamble that could lead to negotiations and a resolution, but success hinges on Iran's willingness to de-escalate and engage in earnest discussions.</p>

          <p>Pixar's new film 'Elio' had its worst opening weekend ever, earning $21 million at the box office.

          <p>China is highly unlikely to use its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, according to a top U.S. analyst. Richard Fontaine, chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, said China's approach would be shaped by quiet negotiations and self-interest, not direct military intervention. He pointed to China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea last year, when Beijing reached an agreement with the group to spare Chinese-flagged vessels.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to meet a new Nato target to spend 5% of the UK's GDP on national security by 2035. Of that 5%, 3.5% to go on core defence and the remaining 1.5% on defence-related areas such as resilience and security. The split target is aimed at placating US President Donald Trump, who has urged Nato allies to spend more, while giving cash-strapped EU countries flexibility over how they meet the target.
