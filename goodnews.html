          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 06:42:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering extending its ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method involving dragging large nets across the seafloor, across a wider area of English waters. This proposal would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2, covering 41 of England's 181 Marine Protected Areas. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, and it aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed. President Macron opened the UN Oceans Conference calling for a moratorium on deep sea mining.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of rare earth elements exported by China in May experienced a significant drop, nearly halving compared to the previous year. Official data indicates this decline occurred as analysts suggest China's export controls on critical minerals could be a key negotiating tactic with the United States. The value of rare earth exports totaled US$18.7 million in May, a 48.3% year-on-year decrease, and a 13.7% monthly decline from April. Despite this, the cumulative amount of exported rare earths in the first five months of the year saw a slight increase of 2.3% compared to the same period last year.</p>

Speaking at London Tech Week, Huang highlighted that this technology can now be used in programming.

This new method of programming is similar to how one would train a person, making it accessible to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei aims to solidify his power in upcoming legislative elections, hoping to leverage his success in taming inflation through austerity measures. Voters will choose about half the seats in the lower chamber and a third of the upper Senate in October. A significant victory would give Milei leverage to pursue his agenda, including selling off government-owned companies and cutting social spending. While Milei's economic policies have brought stability, prices of basic goods remain high, and nearly 40% of Argentines are still in poverty.</p>
