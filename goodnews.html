          <p>President Trump has publicly praised Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan as a "success" following a meeting, a significant reversal from his call for Tan's resignation just days earlier over his alleged ties to China. The meeting, which included cabinet members, is aimed at developing suggestions for the administration, and Intel confirmed it was a "candid and constructive discussion" about U.S. technology leadership. This development occurs as the Trump administration actively shapes the semiconductor market, recently negotiating a deal with Nvidia for its China sales. (not investment advice)</p>

The final score was 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 7-6 (7-5), with Sabalenka advancing to the fourth round. Despite the loss, Raducanu's performance is seen as a positive sign of her continued resurgence and ability to compete against top-ranked players. Her improved fitness and resilience suggest a strong form leading into the upcoming US Open, where she famously won in 2021.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that gold will not be subject to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling.

The Swiss Precious Metals Association had warned the tariffs could negatively impact the international flow of physical gold.

          <p>Ticketing marketplace StubHub has revived its plans for an initial public offering and is now aiming for a September launch.

In an updated prospectus, StubHub reported 10% revenue growth in the first quarter, though its net loss widened. The move comes as the IPO market shows signs of life after a prolonged slowdown, with StubHub facing stiff competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This satirical article humorously imagines President Trump undertaking a complete, permanent renovation of the White House in the style of a reality TV show. The piece playfully mocks Trump's tastes and political agenda, with fictional scenes of him demanding an all-gold Oval Office, replacing the Rose Garden with a stone patio, and building a massive ballroom. The parody portrays the makeover as an effort to transform the "people's house" into a personal, monarchical residence, complete with leopards on leashes and a kidnapped pope to test the decor's authenticity.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to delay the reimposition of high U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days, pushing the deadline to mid-November. The extension was an expected outcome following recent trade negotiations in Stockholm. Without the delay, tariffs on Chinese imports would have reverted to their peak levels from April. This move is the latest instance of the administration's unpredictable trade policy, which has seen tariffs frequently paused, altered, or delayed with little advance notice for businesses.
