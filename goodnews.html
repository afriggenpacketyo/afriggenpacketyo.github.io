          <p>Microsoft's stock saw a 7% jump after the company announced fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst predictions. For the first time, Microsoft disclosed that its Azure and other cloud services revenue surpassed $75 billion for the fiscal year, a 34% increase. The Intelligent Cloud unit alone generated nearly $29.88 billion in the quarter, growing 26% and beating expectations. This strong performance comes despite recent layoffs and signals robust health in its key business segments, contributing to the stock's 22% year-to-date gain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Baltimore Orioles center fielder Cedric Mullins made a remarkable defensive play, scaling the center field wall to rob the Toronto Blue Jays of a potential go-ahead home run. This catch is being hailed as a candidate for catch of the year and is the latest in a series of incredible defensive plays by Mullins. Despite his individual brilliance, the Orioles lost the game to the Blue Jays 9-8. The play comes amid trade deadline speculation, with Mullins showcasing his elite skills as the Orioles have already traded away several other players.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, continuing its cautious "wait-and-see" strategy due to economic uncertainties, including the impact of tariffs. The decision was not unanimous, with two FOMC members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence signaling a division within the board. Chairman Jerome Powell stated the economy remains in good shape but faces risks, justifying the hold as inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. This move comes despite external pressure from President Trump to lower rates to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, savers are increasingly looking toward high-yield savings accounts to maximize their returns on deposits. This article explores the potential earnings on a $10,000 deposit, showing that with current rates around 4.20% to 4.30%, one could earn over $420 in a year. Unlike CDs, these accounts offer liquidity, but their variable rates mean that earnings can fluctuate with market conditions. The analysis provides a practical look at how savers can benefit from the current elevated rate climate while it lasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hollywood Premiere Motel, despite its low guest ratings, has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument due to its iconic 1960s Googie architectural style. Built in 1960, the motel is recognized as a rare and well-preserved example of roadside architecture from an era that catered to automobile tourism. Although the designation does not guarantee protection from demolition, it requires a review process for any proposed alterations. The motel's distinctive look has made it a popular filming location for various TV shows and music videos in recent years.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields climbed after the Federal Reserve announced it would not change its benchmark interest rate, a decision influenced by strong economic data. The 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields both saw notable increases, reflecting market reactions to the central bank's policy and stronger-than-expected second-quarter GDP growth of 3%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's subsequent comments about potential tariff-related inflation risks also influenced investor sentiment. The Fed's decision to hold rates was not unanimous, with two governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now estimating a net $2 billion negative impact from import duties. The automaker's second-quarter revenue of $50.2 billion beat expectations, though its electric vehicle division, "Model e," reported a loss of $1.33 billion. The new guidance projects adjusted earnings between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion, which is lower than its pre-tariff forecast. Ford's CFO noted that the company is in near-daily communication with the Trump administration regarding the financial pressures from steel and aluminum tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia is ordering hundreds of thousands of additional H20 AI chips from its manufacturer TSMC to satisfy unexpectedly strong demand from China. The H20 was specifically developed as a less powerful alternative to comply with U.S. export restrictions, competing with Chinese chipmaker Huawei. Despite its reduced capabilities compared to the H100 and H200 models available elsewhere, Chinese tech companies have a significant appetite for the hardware. This surge in orders highlights China's continued reliance on American-designed AI technology and provides a major sales boost for Nvidia in the restricted market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a better-than-expected quarterly report and a 10% stock rally, investors are questioning if life sciences company Danaher can maintain its momentum. The company has faced headwinds from a slow recovery in China, post-pandemic ordering shifts, and U.S. policy changes, causing its stock to struggle. While all of its operating segments beat estimates, challenges remain, particularly in China due to new procurement policies. Analysts suggest a sustained rally for the sector is still a quarter or two away, contingent on a return to mid-single-digit revenue growth across the industry. (not investment advice)</p>
