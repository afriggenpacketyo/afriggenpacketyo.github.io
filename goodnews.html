          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 17:06:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lucy Powell, a Labour minister, has apologized for comments made during a BBC Radio 4 debate where she appeared to dismiss concerns about grooming gangs as a "dog whistle" issue. The apology came after facing criticism from political opponents who felt her remarks trivialized the seriousness of child sexual exploitation. Powell clarified that she regards child exploitation with the "utmost seriousness" and that her comments were intended to challenge political point-scoring rather than the issue itself, explaining that as a constituency MP she has dealt with horrendous cases. During the debate, Powell clashed with a Reform UK member over diversity and inclusion roles within councils and the discussion turned to a Channel 4 documentary on sexual assault gangs, leading to her controversial response.</p>

          <p>Jim Dent, who passed away at the age of 85, is remembered as a pioneering Black golfer who rose from the caddie yards of Augusta, Georgia, to become one of the PGA Tour's longest hitters. Dent's early experiences caddying at Augusta National and playing at the municipal course known as ‘The Patch’ instilled in him values of honesty and hard work. Though he never won on the PGA Tour, Dent achieved success on the PGA Tour Champions, winning 12 times after turning 50. Augusta honored Dent in 2020 by naming the road leading into The Patch as Jim Dent Way, and he was inducted into the Caddie Hall of Fame two years later.</p>

          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located on a volcano in Hawaii, has achieved a significant milestone by capturing a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this instrument will aid in predicting potentially damaging solar storms that can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) described sunspots as "areas of intense magnetic activity" that can trigger solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Researchers believe the VTF's image provides promise that the telescope will help scientists better predict when powerful solar storms are coming toward Earth in order to mitigate the damage these geomagnetic disturbances might cause.</p>
