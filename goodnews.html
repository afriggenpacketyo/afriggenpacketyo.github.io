          <p>A UK cabinet minister has rejected former U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that the military should be used to stop asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for border policing, although the navy can be called upon if needed. The comments came as migrant crossings resumed after a week of bad weather and as the UK government proceeds with a "one in, one out" deportation deal with France to deter illegal migration.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been freed after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charity in the country for decades, were released following mediation by Qatar. Their family had raised serious concerns about their deteriorating health and the harsh conditions of their imprisonment. The Taliban, which has not been officially recognized by the UK, stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues for the passage of "Connor's Law," which would codify the English language proficiency requirement for commercial motor vehicle drivers. The author cites the tragic death of 18-year-old Connor Dzion, who was killed by a truck driver unable to read English warning signs, as a key reason for stricter enforcement. The piece contends that the Obama administration weakened this safety rule and that while the Trump administration reinstated enforcement, a federal law is necessary to ensure consistent application across states and prevent similar preventable accidents.</p>

          <h2>Higher Education's Role Is to Teach How to Think, Not What to Think, Amid AI and Polarization</h2>

          <p>Amid a crisis of public trust in higher education and the rise of AI, the president of Dartmouth College argues that the university's core purpose is more vital than ever. The goal is not merely transferring knowledge, which is abundant, but cultivating uniquely human skills like critical thinking, ethical discernment, and collaborative leadership. A residential college experience provides a crucial environment for face-to-face dialogue and debate, teaching students how to engage with different viewpoints and make sense of a complex world—skills that AI cannot master and online environments often undermine.</p>

          <p>The British foreign intelligence service, MI6, has launched a secure messaging portal on the dark web to recruit new spies, with a particular focus on attracting agents in Russia. The initiative, named Silent Courier, is designed to enhance national security by providing a discreet channel for potential informants to make contact. In his final public speech, outgoing MI6 Chief Sir Richard Moore made a direct appeal to potential agents worldwide to use the new platform, while also delivering sharp criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine and China's support for the war effort.</p>

          <p>Recent reports from OpenAI and Anthropic on how their AI models are being used show rapid, widespread adoption, particularly for tasks like practical advice, text generation, and problem-solving. While this data provides a snapshot of current trends, it raises caution about predicting AI's long-term economic effects, drawing a parallel to early, limited predictions about the use of computers in the 1950s. The key takeaway is that AI's diffusion through the economy is happening at an unprecedented speed, much faster than previous technologies, leaving less time for societal adaptation.</p>

          <p>The renowned magic duo Penn & Teller have been inducted into the prestigious Magic Circle, ending a 50-year period during which they were barred from membership. The pair, famous since the 1980s, were originally excluded for their practice of revealing the secrets behind their tricks, which violated the organization's core principle of secrecy. The Magic Circle's president acknowledged their past reputation as the "bad boys of magic" but praised their artistic and original performances, reflecting the organization's evolution towards embracing a more diverse group of creative performers.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series went on sale worldwide, drawing crowds from Beijing to London. The launch is a critical test for the company as it faces intensified competition in key markets like China from local brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi. Early signs in China are positive, with preorder volumes on one major e-commerce platform surpassing last year's models. The global release also comes as Apple is under pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises after a rollout that some analysts considered underwhelming.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish governments have unveiled a new agreement to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles, which Ireland's deputy prime minister described as a "night and day improvement" over the current controversial Legacy Act. The new framework aims to provide "maximum truth, justice and accountability" by restoring inquests that were previously halted and establishing independent oversight bodies. This deal seeks to resolve the diplomatic rift caused by the 2023 Legacy Act, which was widely opposed by victims' groups and political parties in Northern Ireland.</p>

The project aims to secure a direct supply of these metals, essential for electric vehicle batteries and military equipment, for the U.S. and its allies, directly challenging China's near-monopoly on cobalt production and processing.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old hiker has been released from the hospital after being attacked by a bear, likely a grizzly, on a remote trail in Yellowstone National Park. The man was hiking alone when he surprised the animal and sustained significant, though not life-threatening, injuries to his chest and arm while attempting to use bear spray. Park officials believe the bear was acting in self-defense after being startled and will not take any management action against it. The incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of wildlife encounters, although such attacks remain extremely rare.</p>

          <p>In a podcast discussion, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens and host Garry Kasparov explore the state of American democracy, arguing that the traditional left-right political divide is becoming obsolete. Stephens suggests that the country needs a new political realignment centered on a truly liberal party—one dedicated to free markets, free speech, and the rule of law, in opposition to both illiberal nationalism and socialism. He contends that such a party could only emerge from the collapse of one of the existing major parties, and that Democrats must shift towards the center to effectively counter the MAGA movement.</p>
