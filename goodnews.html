          <p>A Reddit user recounted an incident at his girlfriend's mother's birthday party where he stopped a two-year-old from sticking his hands into the cake, sparking a family conflict. The user moved the cake out of the child's reach after the child began picking off decorations and licking his hands, while the child's parents found the behavior cute. While some commenters agreed with the user's actions, citing hygiene concerns, others argued that he should have respected the family's tolerance for the child's behavior.

          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious in a dramatic Miami Grand Prix sprint race, capitalizing on a safety car period after teammate Oscar Piastri led early on. A safety car, triggered by a crash between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, allowed Norris to pit for slick tires and rejoin the race in the lead. Max Verstappen initially finished fourth but was penalized for an unsafe pit release, damaging his front wing and dropping him to last place. The race was further complicated by changing weather conditions, with drivers making strategic pit stops for slick tires as the track dried.</p>

          <p>Capital One's acquisition of Discover Financial holds the potential for an even greater payoff through international expansion. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized that building international acceptance of the Discover network is key to shifting more Capital One-branded credit cards away from Mastercard and Visa. By expanding Discover's global presence, Capital One aims to create a "flywheel effect" that enhances the combined business. The company also anticipates regulatory benefits from moving its debit-card business to the Discover network, allowing it to charge higher swipe fees.</p>
