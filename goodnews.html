        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Democrats have proposed a plan to establish police counters in accessible public venues like supermarkets and libraries across England and Wales. This initiative aims to make reporting crime easier for the public and improve confidence in policing, which the party argues has diminished. The proposal suggests funding this increased community presence by abolishing the roles of Police and Crime Commissioners, a move the party claims would free up over £100 million. This policy announcement comes as the party seeks to appeal to more voters during its annual conference.</p>

Their son expressed being "ecstatic and massively grateful" for the efforts that secured their freedom, which was brokered by Qatar. The couple, who ran a charitable training program in Afghanistan for 18 years, were detained in February for allegedly breaking Afghan laws, though the specific reasons were never disclosed. The family had previously raised serious concerns about the couple's deteriorating health while in detention.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw made what was likely his final regular-season start at Dodger Stadium, one day after announcing his retirement at the end of the year. In an emotional evening, Kershaw was honored with extended ovations from a sell-out crowd as he pitched 4⅓ innings against the San Francisco Giants. The night was doubly significant as the Dodgers officially clinched their 13th consecutive postseason berth during the 6-3 victory. The event celebrated the 18-year career of one of the franchise's most iconic and beloved players.</p>

          <p>With the new school year underway, the role of parent WhatsApp groups is once again in the spotlight, serving as both a vital communication tool and a source of stress. While useful for reminders about school events and organizing teacher gifts, many parents find the constant notifications and volume of messages overwhelming. The groups can also foster competitive parenting, spread misinformation, and create unnecessary anxiety, leading some parents to leave them entirely. Experts advise setting boundaries to manage the "enforced systems of communication" that these digital groups represent in modern parenting.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in Virginia's gubernatorial election, a key contest viewed as a referendum on President Trump's policies. The race pits Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. National issues, particularly the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce, are playing a significant role in the campaign, as Virginia is home to a large number of federal employees. Spanberger is positioning herself as an opponent of these cuts, while Earle-Sears is aligning with the economic record of the state's popular Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin.

With an estimated 8,000 drones in U.S. airspace at any time and hundreds of incursions reported over military bases, the Pentagon is exploring technologies ranging from acoustic detection to interceptor drones that capture threats with nets. The goal is to establish rapid response teams capable of neutralizing drone threats anywhere in the country within 24 hours.

          <p>The High Seas Treaty, a landmark global agreement to protect marine biodiversity in international waters, is set to become law after receiving its 60th ratification. The treaty, two decades in the making, will enable the creation of marine protected areas in the high seas, which cover over two-thirds of the world's oceans. Environmental groups have hailed this as a "monumental achievement" that will help countries meet the goal of protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030. Currently, only 1% of the high seas are protected, leaving marine life vulnerable to overfishing, pollution, and climate change.</p>

          <p>Qingzhou Wang, an executive of the Wuhan-based company Amarvel Biotech, has been sentenced to 25 years in a U.S. prison for trafficking chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Wang and a colleague were convicted in New York for shipping hundreds of kilograms of fentanyl precursors into the United States, often disguising them as common goods and using cryptocurrency for payment. This case marked the first time the U.S. has prosecuted Chinese companies for trafficking these chemicals directly into the country, rather than through Mexico. The prosecution drew strong condemnation from the Chinese government.</p>
