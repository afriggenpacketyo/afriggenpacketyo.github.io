          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coasts of Chile and Argentina, prompting a tsunami warning that was later canceled. The earthquake, followed by aftershocks, triggered an evacuation alert for the coastal section of the Strait of Magellan in Chile. Residents in Punta Arenas evacuated calmly. The epicenter was located under the ocean south of Ushuaia, Argentina, where water activities were suspended. There were no reports of damage or casualties, and Chilean authorities later allowed residents to return home, advising them to stay away from beaches.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a national election amid heightened geopolitical and trade uncertainty influenced by President Trump's policies. The Labor party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, holds a slight edge over the conservative Liberal-National coalition, led by Peter Dutton. High prices and a housing shortage are major voter concerns. Albanese has promised modest tax cuts and cheaper healthcare, while Dutton has vowed to slash fuel tax and invest in infrastructure. Several polls suggest Labor may be forced into a minority government.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to halt efforts to freeze funds to Maine schools after the state challenged the president's demands to bar trans girls from participating in girls' sports. Maine's Democratic Governor Janet Mills responded to Trump's threat to revoke funding by vowing to see him in court, and subsequently sued the USDA. The settlement restores funds for a child nutrition program that helps feed 172,000 children in the state. The settlement does not affect another ongoing lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the Maine department of education over its policy for trans athletes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked its enforcement. Judge Beryl Howell found the order violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The order sought to punish the firm for representing Hillary Clinton and hiring a research firm that retained Christopher Steele. Howell stated that the order sent the message that "lawyers must stick to the party line, or else." While other firms reached agreements with the White House to avoid penalties, Howell's ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie.</p>

          <p>The remains of two domestic cats discovered in a 500-year-old Spanish shipwreck in Florida's Pensacola Bay may be the earliest evidence of cats in the United States. The shipwreck, Emanuel Point II, dates back to 1559. Researchers suggest cats were brought on ships to control rodents. Analysis indicates the adult cat's diet consisted mainly of fish and possibly domestic meat. Cats are not native to the U.S. and are believed to have been brought by Europeans.</p>

Trump first proposed a military parade during his first term but scrapped the idea due to cost concerns. Additionally, Trump announced plans to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" and VE Day as "Victory Day for World War II."</p>
