          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to accelerate tariff negotiations, hoping to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement as early as June, according to Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa. Discussions will focus on non-tariff barriers and expanding bilateral trade and economic security cooperation. Japan aims to present proposals, including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and simplified safety screening for imported cars, while the U.S. seeks to reduce its trade deficits and create better-paying jobs. The Trump administration prioritizes early tariff deals with strategically important countries like Japan to gain an upper hand over China in the Indo-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, a former influential figure in Republican politics, made a rare public appearance to accept an award from the Cato Institute, calling for libertarians to uphold their principles.

          <p>Japan's average unemployment rate for fiscal year 2024 decreased to 2.5 percent, marking the first improvement in two years due to a persistent labor shortage, according to government data. The number of unemployed individuals decreased, while the number of employed people reached its highest level since 1953. Despite a slight dip in job availability, economists suggest the labor market remains tight, with demand for workers continuing to exceed supply. This trend is expected to persist in the foreseeable future.</p>
