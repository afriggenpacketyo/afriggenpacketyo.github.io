          <p>At Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders' meeting, Warren Buffett voiced his disapproval of President Trump's use of tariffs as a tool in global commerce. Buffett, whose conglomerate faces potential impacts from American trade policies, stated that trade should not be a weapon and defended global trade flows, drawing applause from shareholders. Despite Berkshire Hathaway reporting a drop in first-quarter earnings, attributed to losses tied to the California wildfires, Buffett downplayed market volatility, reiterating his long-term praise of the United States as a land of opportunity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that domestication is causing cats and dogs to evolve similar skull shapes due to human selection, despite being separated by millions of years of evolution. The study analyzed skull scans and found that selective breeding has led to convergence, with breeds like Persian cats and pugs sharing similar flat-faced structures. This trend, driven by human preferences for infant-like features, has resulted in exaggerated traits that can cause health problems in these animals. The research highlights the significant and sometimes detrimental impact of human intervention on animal evolution.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that grizzly bears, extinct in California since the 1920s, could potentially return to the state. The study identifies three regions that could support a robust grizzly population and highlights the ecological benefits of their reintroduction. While public support is divided, with many residents intrigued but others concerned about living alongside a formidable predator, the prospect of grizzlies returning offers a symbolic and ecological boost. Any reintroduction effort would be gradual and carefully managed, prioritizing remote areas and community engagement.</p>

          <p>Financial markets are increasingly acting as a check on populist leaders' excesses, reacting with anger to policies that disrupt global trade and threaten economic stability. Fund managers and pension funds have demonstrated sensitivity to actions like Donald Trump's trade policies and Liz Truss's borrowing spree, which sparked fears of high inflation. Experts suggest that this sensitivity serves as a real-time disciplining device on politicians, making capitulation speedier than in the past. However, this dynamic leaves those who feel left behind by the old system with a sense of anger and disenfranchisement.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese of Australia has won a second term as prime minister, completing a stunning turnaround for his governing center-left Labor Party. Voters, heading to the polls amid global uncertainty arising from the Trump administration, opted for the known quantity of the incumbent leader. His victory marks a resounding defeat of the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, who lost his parliamentary seat. Albanese's re-election was not an approval of his first term but a reluctant choice between two parties without bold ideas to fix the country‚Äôs problems, said Intifar Chowdhury, a lecturer in government at Flinders University in Adelaide.</p>
