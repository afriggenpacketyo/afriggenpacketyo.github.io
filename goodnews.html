          <p>Coastal rail service between Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion.

          <p>Costco reported better-than-expected earnings for its third quarter of fiscal year 2025, demonstrating its ability to manage challenges posed by higher tariffs.

The company's gross margin and operating margin also exceeded expectations, rising 41 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. Costco has mitigated the impact of tariffs by rerouting goods to non-U.S. markets, increasing locally produced goods, and moving more sourcing for its Kirkland Signature products to the countries or regions where the item is sold.

This shift is partly driven by geopolitical tensions and the potential for US tariffs, which have surprisingly seen Asian equities outperform. Cambridge Associates notes that Chinese and Hong Kong stocks offer attractive valuations compared to expensive US stocks. With compelling valuations and falling interest rates in the region, the case for diversifying away from US equities is becoming more compelling. (not investment advice)</p>
