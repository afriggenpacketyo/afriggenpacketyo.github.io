          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a former critic, for New Jersey governor, praising him as an "America First Candidate." Ciattarelli responded with gratitude and emphasized uniting the party to make New Jersey affordable and safe again. This endorsement marks a turnaround, as Ciattarelli previously criticized Trump. The endorsement has sparked reactions, with Bill Spadea, another Republican candidate, criticizing Ciattarelli's record, and the New Jersey Democratic Governors Association blasting the endorsement and claiming Ciattarelli would put Trump before New Jersey. The endorsement sets the stage for a competitive Republican primary.</p>

          <p>Most Asian stock markets continued their upward trend after the US and China agreed to suspend tariff increases, fueling optimism that the two economic superpowers will de-escalate their trade war. The agreement involves the US reducing its tariffs on China to 30% for 90 days, while China will lower its retaliatory measures to 10%. President Trump described the move as a "total reset," and further talks are expected. The news has boosted investor confidence, although some nervousness remains about the potential for future trade negotiations. The article suggests that both sides are aware of the need to repair their relationship and avoid further economic damage.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in a decade, according to a World Bank report. The growth was primarily driven by the oil and gas sector and strong performance in the tech and finance industries. The World Bank projects a slight increase in growth to 3.7% in 2025. However, the agriculture sector faces challenges due to insecurity and high input costs. The reforms implemented by President Bola Tinubu have come at a cost for many Nigerians, with poverty remaining high and inflation expected to stay above 20%.</p>
