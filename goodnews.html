          <h2>Federal Court Skeptical of Trump's Tariff Authority in First Hearing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 16:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first federal court hearing on President Trump's tariffs, judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade expressed concerns about the administration's claim that the judiciary cannot review the legality of the tariffs. The case, V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, centers on whether the tariffs meet the International Emergency Economic Powers Act's requirement of dealing with an "unusual and extraordinary threat." While the judges questioned the administration's broad interpretation of presidential power, they also struggled to define what constitutes such a threat, and the court's decision may ultimately have limited influence over the Supreme Court, which is likely to have the final say.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the stock market recovering to pre-tariff levels and a lower-than-expected inflation reading, investors remain cautious due to uncertainty about the final level of tariffs. Many investors feel compelled to participate in the market rally, but lack conviction about the economy's direction, while signs of tariff-fueled inflation are not likely to appear in economic data for months. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, hesitant to lower interest rates until the inflationary impact of tariffs is known, and uncertainty is causing businesses to delay investments and consumers to reduce spending. While the dollar has regained some ground, the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies remains significantly below its peak, indicating underlying economic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

The game involves a bowler trying to hit a wicket behind the batter, who attempts to hit the ball and score runs. Matches can range from three-hour T20 games to five-day test matches, and a "super over" is used to break ties in shorter formats, and India is favored to win the match against the United States.</p>

          <p>The latest inflation report indicates a cooling trend, with the annual inflation rate at 2.3% in April, the lowest since early 2021, however, gold prices have remained strong, surpassing $3,400 per ounce. While gold is typically seen as an inflation hedge, geopolitical tensions, central bank demand, potential interest rate cuts, recession fears, and currency volatility are also influencing its price. Analysts suggest that gold prices could reach between $3,500 and $3,800 by year-end, though short-term volatility is expected, and it is crucial to assess the broader economic landscape rather than solely focusing on inflation figures.

The move, influenced by discussions with Saudi and Turkish leaders, aims to support the new Syrian government in stabilizing the region, but the announcement was met with silence when Trump encouraged Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords. Across Syria, citizens celebrated the news, hoping for economic recovery and reintegration into the global financial system, while Trump also addressed concerns about Iran's role in the Middle East.</p>
