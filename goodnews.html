          <p>Identity software maker Okta saw its shares rise after reporting fiscal second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year. CEO Todd McKinnon noted that economic conditions were "much better than we thought," leading the company to bump up its fiscal 2026 forecast. Despite cautious spending from U.S. government customers, renewals across the federal sector remained strong, reflecting the critical nature of Okta's solutions. The company anticipates future growth from managing AI agent identities and selling software suites, while also announcing the acquisition of Israeli startup Axiom Security.

Trump suggested the company should revert to its old logo, admit a mistake, and leverage the "Billion Dollars worth of free publicity" as a "great opportunity." His comments, posted on Truth Social, came after his son also criticized the rebrand, which removed the "Uncle Herschel" character. The White House's official X account further amplified the sentiment with a "Go woke, go broke" tweet featuring a reimagined logo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has ordered the state legislature to redraw its congressional maps, a development that could potentially lead to Democrats gaining a U.S. House seat. The ruling stems from a 2018 voter-passed proposition aimed at independent redistricting and prohibiting partisan influence. This decision sets up a short window for changes, though appeals may impact the timeline. The ruling is part of a broader national trend of redistricting battles, with Republicans seeking to solidify control in states like Texas and Democrats pushing for favorable changes in California. The outcome in Utah could be crucial given the narrow GOP majority in the House.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has reached a settlement in a class action copyright infringement lawsuit, where authors accused the company of using their copyrighted works without permission to train its AI models. While the terms were not disclosed, the settlement avoids a trial where damages could have reached billions. A U.S. District Judge previously ruled that AI models could legally learn from copyrighted books under "fair use," but pirating source material might still be unlawful. Anthropic, backed by Amazon, was accused of pirating millions of books and later buying them, a move that could reduce potential damages.</p>

          <p>Conservative MP George Freeman will not face a parliamentary standards investigation into "cash for questions" allegations, having referred himself to the commissioner in June. Claims emerged that a company he advised helped him draft parliamentary questions related to space data and emissions tracking. Freeman, a former science minister, was previously advised against lobbying the UK government on behalf of GHGSat, for which he received a monthly salary. The Commissioner found insufficient grounds for a formal investigation, stating lobbying rules do not prohibit MPs from advocating for public interest issues if registration and declaration rules are followed, which Freeman maintained he did.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed the Trump administration's lawsuit against 15 Maryland U.S. district court judges, which challenged a standing order preventing immediate removal of migrants disputing their detentions. Judge Thomas Cullen ruled that the administration lacked the legal right to sue and that the judges were immune, criticizing the unprecedented nature of the executive branch suing the judiciary. Cullen suggested the administration should appeal the order through established congressional paths rather than a "confrontational" lawsuit, also noting the administration's repeated attacks on judges who rule against its agenda. This article underscores the separation of powers and judicial independence.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages present a timely financial opportunity for seniors and older homeowners in September 2025, especially given record-high home equity levels. This option allows individuals aged 62 or older to receive monthly payments from their home equity without immediate repayment obligations, unlike traditional loans. With significant equity available, seniors can access a sizable amount of money without worrying about the fluctuating interest rate climate, as monthly repayments are not required. A reverse mortgage can also be strategically used to pay down high-interest debt, offering financial independence, though careful consideration of terms and conditions is always advised.
