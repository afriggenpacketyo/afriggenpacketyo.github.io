          <p>The Chinese government has again committed to tackling the oversupply and excessive low-price competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a meeting with industry representatives, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology emphasized the need for lawful governance and the phasing out of outdated production capacity to ensure healthy, sustainable development. This directive follows President Xi Jinping's recent call to eliminate excess industrial capacity, as China's solar sector continues its global market expansion amidst internal economic pressures.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a key early presidential primary state, intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. His tour will cover eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, many of which are Republican strongholds. While a political advisor insists the trip is focused on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms and highlighting rural issues, the visit is widely seen as an effort to build a national profile. Newsom has made similar overtures to voters in other southern states.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a significant breakthrough by growing a human heart structure within a pig embryo, which reportedly continued to beat for 21 days. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, involved reprogramming human stem cells to enhance their survival and implanting them into pig embryos at an early stage. This development follows a previous success by the same team in cultivating human kidneys in pigs for 28 days, advancing the field of chimera research and the potential for organ generation.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has taken a person into custody after they crossed the heavily fortified border from North Korea. The individual, who was unarmed, traversed the Military Demarcation Line in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and was safely guided out of the mine-strewn area. The Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the person is being investigated by law enforcement, but did not specify if it was a defection attempt. The crossing occurs amid recently heightened border tensions, despite some efforts by South Korea's new president to rebuild trust with the North.</p>

Fuyao University of Science and Technology, established by glass magnate Cao Dewang, and Eastern Institute of Technology, founded by semiconductor leader Yu Renrong, represent a new wave of philanthropy aimed at bolstering China's goal of scientific self-reliance.
