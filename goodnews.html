          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 17:06:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of San Francisco has announced it will provide Microsoft's Copilot AI, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o, to its 30,000 government workers. Mayor Daniel Lurie stated the initiative aims to improve city services by allowing employees like nurses and social workers to handle administrative tasks more efficiently. The decision follows a successful six-month pilot program involving over 2,000 workers, which demonstrated productivity gains of up to five hours per week. The city will leverage its existing Microsoft license, incurring no additional cost for the AI tool, which will assist with data analytics, report drafting, and language translation.</p>

          <h2>Reddit Implements Age Verification in the UK to Comply with Online Safety Act</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 17:03:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social media platform Reddit is introducing age verification for UK users to restrict access to mature content for those under 18. This measure is in response to the UK's Online Safety Act, which mandates robust age-checking techniques for sites with adult material and comes into force on July 25. An external firm, Persona, will handle the verification process using selfies or government-issued IDs, with Reddit only retaining the user's verification status and date of birth. Companies failing to comply with the new rules face significant fines or potential service blockages from UK internet providers.</p>

          <h2>New Federal Law Provides Tax Deduction for New Car Loan Interest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:47:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will allow some U.S. car buyers to receive a new tax break starting in 2025. The law permits the deduction of up to $10,000 in loan interest for new passenger vehicles assembled in the U.S., a benefit that can be claimed even by those taking the standard deduction. However, the break is limited by income thresholds, phasing out for single filers earning over $100,000 and married couples over $200,000. The deduction excludes used cars and leased vehicles and is set to expire in 2028.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly exploring a potential club-record deal to sign Eintracht Frankfurt's French striker, Hugo Ekitike. The 23-year-old had an impressive season in the Bundesliga, scoring 15 goals and providing eight assists, and would likely command a transfer fee exceeding £70 million. Despite this high-profile pursuit, sources indicate that Newcastle has no intention of selling their current top scorer, Alexander Isak, who has attracted interest from other top European clubs. Ekitike joined Frankfurt permanently last summer and is under contract for another four years, suggesting a significant investment would be required to secure his transfer.</p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 88 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also saw slight increases. The new levies, set to take effect on August 1, rekindled trade tensions with key partners and raised concerns about potential price hikes for consumers. Despite the geopolitical uncertainty, the market's reaction was muted, suggesting investors may be desensitized to the tariff threats or are awaiting more concrete details on their implementation and impact.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, briefly trading above $123,000 before settling slightly lower. This rally is attributed to significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing optimism around potential U.S. crypto legislation. Lawmakers are beginning deliberations on a series of bills, dubbed "Crypto Week," aimed at providing a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts suggest that increased institutional buying is a primary driver of the price surge, with some predicting further appreciation in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials attribute the positive trend to billions in spending and an increased focus on clearing encampments and moving individuals into temporary shelter.
