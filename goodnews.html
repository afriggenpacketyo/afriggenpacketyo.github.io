          <p>A dog named Petunia has been crowned the winner of the "World's Ugliest Dog Contest" at the Sonoma County Fair in California. The annual competition, which has been running for nearly 50 years, celebrates unique and unconventional canine beauty. Petunia and her owner received a $5,000 prize for the victory. The event also serves to promote a positive message about animal adoption, as many of the contestants are rescue dogs from shelters and puppy mills. Organizers describe the contest as a testament to the idea that a pet's value is not defined by its pedigree.</p>

          <p>After 26 years of marriage, David and Victoria Beckham continue to display a strong public connection, as seen during a recent vacation in Saint-Tropez. The couple, who married in 1999 and share four children, have built a significant family brand. However, their relationship is contrasted with an ongoing rift involving their eldest son, Brooklyn, and his wife, Nicola Peltz. Speculation about family tensions has persisted for years, fueled by the couple's absence from family events and rumors of a feud between Nicola and Victoria. Despite the drama, the Beckhams recently celebrated their anniversary with affectionate social media posts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American shopping malls are experiencing a revival by replacing defunct anchor stores with a diverse mix of non-retail tenants. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people weekly and has spurred activity in the remaining retail stores. This trend, known as "reprogramming the box," involves subdividing large spaces for businesses like entertainment complexes, restaurants, and even apartments. Industry data suggests this strategy is increasing mall traffic and creating new community hubs, challenging the long-held narrative of the American mall's decline.</p>

          <p>After a helmet-to-helmet hit in football, a New Jersey teenager named Logan Coleridge experienced debilitating symptoms like dizziness and severe headaches that persisted for months. When physical therapy failed to provide relief, a concussion specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed the true cause: an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a rare and dangerous tangle of blood vessels in his brain. Logan underwent successful surgery to remove the AVM and has since made a full recovery. His family is now advocating for earlier and more thorough testing for young athletes with persistent post-concussion symptoms.</p>

By using a network of wireless sensors and weather algorithms, the system optimizes boiler and chiller operations, claiming to have saved clients over $100 million in energy costs to date. The company recently secured a $55 million Series B funding round, which it plans to use for nationwide expansion and to further integrate artificial intelligence into its efficiency models. This innovation addresses a critical need in commercial real estate as energy costs and climate concerns continue to rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern-day alchemy: creating tons of gold as a byproduct of nuclear fusion. The theoretical plan suggests that neutrons generated during the fusion process could be used to transmute other metals, like mercury, into gold. This would not be the primary goal but rather a way to generate revenue to offset the immense costs of developing commercial fusion power, a potential source of near-limitless clean energy. While scientifically plausible, the concept remains entirely speculative, as commercially viable fusion reactors do not yet exist.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a veteran CIA officer who was instrumental in unmasking one of the most damaging spies in U.S. history, has died at the age of 79. In 1991, Grimes postponed her plans to scale back her career to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were disappearing. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs was crucial in identifying her colleague, Aldrich Ames, as the mole. Ames was arrested in 1994 after taking millions from the Soviet Union for betraying U.S. assets. Grimes's work was a testament to her dedication to the agents who had made the ultimate sacrifice.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is urging communications company Viasat to separate its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) business. Carronade argues that the market misunderstands Viasat, valuing it as a legacy satellite company threatened by competitors like Starlink, while overlooking its high-growth, high-margin defense segment. The firm believes a spin-off or IPO of the DAT business could unlock significant value, estimating it could be worth between $6.3 billion and $16.2 billion, compared to the entire company's current enterprise value of about $8 billion.

Both nations' leaders credited President Trump for his role in the breakthrough, which marks a significant diplomatic achievement.

          <p>OpenAI's launch of its new flagship model, GPT-5, has received a lukewarm reception in China, a key market in the global AI race. While OpenAI touted the model as its "smartest, fastest, most useful" yet, with improved performance in areas like coding and visual perception, some Chinese experts found it lacking in revolutionary breakthroughs. One prominent venture capitalist described it as an incremental update rather than a game-changing one. The mixed reviews highlight the heightened competition and high expectations within the AI industry, where each new release is scrutinized for its potential to redefine the technological landscape.</p>

The new line will connect Hotan in Xinjiang with Shigatse in Tibet, integrating with the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line. This railway is a key component of China's ambitious plan to establish a 5,000-kilometer plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035, enhancing connectivity and logistical capabilities in the remote western territories.</p>

          <p>Travelers can avoid costly international cell phone charges by employing several strategies. For frequent travelers, switching to a carrier like T-Mobile, which includes basic international roaming in some plans, may be beneficial. For heavy data users, purchasing a local or international eSIM from providers like Airalo is often a cheaper alternative to daily roaming packages from major carriers. Finally, the most straightforward method is to rely on free Wi-Fi whenever possible and prepare for offline use by downloading maps and guidebooks ahead of time. This ensures connectivity for essential tasks without incurring unexpected fees.</p>

          <p>Stargazers hoping to catch the peak of the annual Perseids meteor shower next week may be disappointed, as a full moon is expected to diminish its visibility. NASA has stated that viewing conditions are not ideal, as the bright moonlight will likely wash out all but the brightest meteors. The Perseids, which originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet, are known for producing bright fireballs and are most visible in the Northern Hemisphere. While some meteors may still be seen in the predawn hours, astronomers advise that this year's celestial show will not be as spectacular as in previous years.</p>

          <p>In a Los Angeles neighborhood, residents frustrated by government inaction took matters into their own hands by painting their own crosswalks at an intersection they deemed dangerous. The city's Department of Transportation quickly removed the DIY crosswalks, citing liability concerns and the need for comprehensive studies. However, public pressure following the incident led the city to officially repaint the crosswalks within a week. The event has become a symbol of civic frustration with bureaucratic red tape and has highlighted a broader debate about the city's capacity to deliver basic services efficiently and effectively.</p>

          <p>In a sign of easing tensions, North Korea has started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border with South Korea. This action follows a similar move by Seoul, which halted its own broadcasts of K-pop music and news reports in a bid to reopen dialogue with Pyongyang. The reciprocal de-escalation is one of the first since South Korean President Lee Jae Myung took office and reversed the hard-line approach of his predecessor. These cross-border loudspeaker campaigns have been a recurring feature during periods of heightened conflict between the two nations, which technically remain at war.</p>
