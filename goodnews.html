        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity at record highs, Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are popular for home improvements or debt consolidation, but experts warn against maxing them out due to significant risks. HELOCs feature variable interest rates, meaning payments can become unaffordable if rates rise, straining household budgets and potentially leading to foreclosure. Maxing out a HELOC also negatively impacts credit scores and debt-to-income ratios, complicating future loan applications. Financial advisors recommend a repayment plan, monitoring interest rate changes, and considering alternatives like home equity loans or cash-out refinances to manage debt and mitigate risks.

          <p>Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's younger brother, publicly stated that Elon "deserves to be paid" by Tesla, referencing his brother's lack of a cash salary for years. This comes as Tesla faces a legal battle over Elon Musk's previously revoked $56 billion 2018 pay package. Tesla's board recently granted an "interim" pay package of 96 million shares, worth about $29 billion, which vests if Musk continues as CEO and if the company loses its appeal in Delaware. An investment group has called for Nasdaq to investigate, arguing the new package required shareholder approval. Tesla plans to put a long-term compensation strategy to a shareholder vote in November.</p>

          <p>Interpol announced the arrest of over 1,200 individuals across 18 African countries and the UK in a major cybercrime crackdown dubbed "Serengeti 2.0." The operation, conducted between June and August, identified approximately 88,000 fraud victims and disrupted 11,432 malicious online infrastructures. Recovered funds totaled $97.4 million, with significant busts including the dismantling of 25 cryptocurrency mining centers in Angola and a transnational inheritance scam in Ivory Coast. This initiative highlights the growing threat of cybercrime in West and East Africa, where it now accounts for more than 30% of reported crimes. The seized equipment in Angola is now being repurposed to support power distribution in vulnerable areas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that economic conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts, acknowledging a "challenging situation" with sweeping changes in tax, trade, and immigration policies. Speaking at Jackson Hole, Powell noted the labor market's resilience but cited rising downside dangers and the risk of tariff-driven inflation. Despite these concerns, he stated that the Fed's current restrictive policy allows for careful consideration of adjustments. His remarks led to a significant rally in stock markets and a drop in Treasury yields, with Wall Street widely anticipating a rate cut at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Powell also reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target and independence from political pressure.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are navigating President Trump's tariff increases by employing strategic price adjustments and diversifying their sourcing. While some tariff costs have been absorbed, others have been passed on to consumers, though not as severely as initially feared. Companies are importing goods earlier, stocking up, and shifting supply chains to mitigate impacts. Consumer spending remains steady, with some trading down to private-label items, particularly among lower-income households. Strong brand loyalty and new revenue streams, such as advertising and third-party marketplaces, are helping some businesses weather the economic uncertainty, while others, like Crocs, face a more concerning outlook.</p>

          <p>Amid elevated living costs and stock market volatility, experts suggest five ways for retirees to maximize their income and protect savings. Strategies include delaying Social Security benefits until age 70 to significantly increase monthly payments, downsizing or relocating to areas with lower living costs to reduce housing expenses, and utilizing annuities or reverse mortgages for guaranteed income streams. Additionally, making catch-up contributions to retirement accounts for those 50 and older, or taking on part-time work, can boost savings and income. Finally, reviewing tax-efficient withdrawal strategies, such as Roth conversions in lower tax brackets, can optimize long-term financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has been granted its first permit by the New York Department of Transportation to begin testing self-driving cars in New York City. This marks the city's inaugural autonomous vehicle testing launch, with Waymo initially deploying up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September. New York state law requires a human driver behind the wheel during testing. This expansion follows Waymo's launches in Austin and Philadelphia, and increased operations in San Francisco, as the company aims to broaden its national footprint. Mayor Eric Adams welcomed the move as a step towards safely advancing the city into the 21st century.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his High Court libel case against The Guardian, which had published allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The judge dismissed Clarke's claim, finding that the newspaper successfully defended its stories on grounds of truth and public interest. Mrs. Justice Steyn stated that the meaning of the articles was "substantially true" and found Clarke not to be a credible witness, rejecting his claim of an "unlawful conspiracy." Over a dozen women testified during the six-week trial about their experiences. The Guardian's editor welcomed the decision as a victory for the women who suffered and a landmark for investigative journalism.</p>

          <p>Texas Instruments' $60 billion manufacturing megaproject in the U.S. will produce "critical foundation semiconductors" for Apple's iPhones and other devices. This commitment from Apple follows President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on chips not manufactured in the U.S., prompting Apple to increase its U.S. spending to $600 billion. TI's new fabs in Utah and Texas, including its Sherman facility set for full production by late 2025, will significantly boost its capacity for analog and embedded chips, which are essential components across various technologies. Despite initial stock market dips due to weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts see TI as a potential "tariff winner" due to its U.S. foundry advantage. The project aims to create 60,000 U.S. jobs.</p>
