          <p>Nvidia announced a substantial investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI, designated for the AI lab's ambitious plan to construct extensive data centers powered by Nvidia's advanced AI processors. This monumental partnership highlights the integral connection between the two industry leaders, who are significant drivers of the recent artificial intelligence boom. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized the critical need for this unprecedented infrastructure to develop next-generation AI capabilities, with Nvidia becoming a preferred supplier for chips and networking equipment. The investment, deployed progressively, reinforces Nvidia's market dominance and OpenAI's commitment to scaling its technology, signaling a major step in AI infrastructure development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michelob Ultra has officially claimed the title of the best-selling beer in the United States, surpassing Constellation Brands' Modelo Especial in both retail channels and on-premise establishments. This achievement signifies a notable rebound for parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev, particularly after its flagship Bud Light lost market leadership following a controversial partnership. Modelo's recent decline is linked to various business challenges, including tariffs on imports and a decrease in demand from key consumer demographics, prompting Constellation Brands to revise its fiscal year sales projections downwards. This market shift underscores the fluid nature of consumer preferences and intense competition within the U.S. beer industry.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, jolting thousands of residents awake just before 3 AM. Centered east-south-east of Berkeley, the tremor was described as strong and prolonged, causing objects to fall and leading to an increase in 911 calls. Despite the significant shaking, authorities reported no major damage or injuries across the city. Public transportation, including BART, implemented speed reductions for safety inspections, causing delays. This event serves as a potent reminder of the region's inherent seismic risks and the ongoing importance of earthquake preparedness for its inhabitants.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid sought to minimize a visible sideline confrontation with star tight end Travis Kelce during their recent win against the New York Giants, telling reporters not to "make too much of it." The exchange, which included yelling and a physical bump, occurred after an offensive failure. Reid characterized Kelce's actions as a display of passion, acknowledging his role as a "policeman" in such moments. This marks the second high-profile sideline dispute between the two, echoing an incident during Super Bowl LVIII. Despite the team's slow start this season, Reid emphasized his understanding of Kelce's competitive drive.</p>

          <p>Newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has forcefully argued for aggressive cuts to the central bank's benchmark interest rate, asserting it is currently far too restrictive. He posited that shifts in tax and immigration policies, along with declining rental costs and deregulation, are transforming the economic environment, enabling a nearly 2 percentage point rate reduction. Miran's stance significantly contrasts with the Federal Open Market Committee's prevailing cautious approach to monetary policy. He warns that maintaining overly restrictive rates risks unnecessary job losses and elevated unemployment, despite his overall optimistic outlook for economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices have soared to new record highs, exceeding $3,700 per ounce, driven by investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst global economic and geopolitical uncertainties. The article explains that gold's performance is typically strong in low-interest-rate environments and periods of instability, with central bank purchases also supporting demand. For investment, experts primarily recommend exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by physical gold over direct bullion purchases, citing better liquidity and lower costs. While gold mining stocks are also an option, financial advisors generally advise capping gold exposure at under 3% of a diversified portfolio, acknowledging the commodity's inherent volatility.

A critical component of the agreement involves copying TikTok's content recommendation algorithm and retraining it exclusively with U.S. user data, with Oracle designated as the comprehensive security provider.

Abdel Fattah, a renowned pro-democracy blogger, was initially arrested in 2019 and later sentenced for "spreading false news." His release comes after a request from the National Council for Human Rights and sustained international pressure, including advocacy from the UK government and the United Nations. His mother recently concluded a nine-month hunger strike demanding his freedom.

          <p>As the Trump administration suggests a link between Tylenol use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism, the scientific community firmly rejects a causal connection, citing extensive research. Experts highlight that autism spectrum disorder is largely linked to polygenetic risks, involving numerous gene variants rather than a single medication. The rise in autism diagnoses over decades is primarily attributed to evolving clinical definitions, broader diagnostic criteria, and heightened public awareness, rather than an actual "epidemic." Medical professionals continue to recommend acetaminophen as the safest pain reliever for pregnant women, warning against the dangers of untreated fevers and alternative medications.</p>
