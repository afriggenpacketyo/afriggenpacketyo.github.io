          <p>Republicans in the House have advanced a bill introduced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to permanently rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, despite opposition from Democrats. Democrats have criticized the bill as a politically motivated attempt to appease former President Donald Trump, who initially signed an executive order to change the name. Republicans, however, argue it is a historic move that symbolizes America First and the country's energy independence. The bill is expected to be voted on by the full House this Thursday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to mifepristone, an abortion pill, echoing the Biden administration's stance in the case. The lawsuit challenges regulatory changes made by the FDA that expanded access to the medication, including telemedicine prescriptions. The administration argues that the case does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Texas federal district court where it was filed. This action aligns with the Biden administration's previous position, despite President Trump's opposition to abortion rights.</p>

Mathematics professor Terrence Blackman notes the importance of square roots in cybersecurity, highlighting their role in encryption.

          <p>Hims & Hers Health reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, but the company's stock fell in extended trading due to a weaker-than-expected revenue outlook for the second quarter.

While the company anticipates more collaborations in the future, its revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter fell short of analysts' estimates.
