        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Portugal's ruling Democratic Alliance is set to govern again in a minority government after recent elections, but the hard-right Chega party has emerged as a significant political force. The article explains that Chega, with its anti-immigrant message, garnered over 22 percent of the vote, signaling a shift in Portuguese politics. Analysts suggest this rise will likely pressure the government to adopt more right-leaning stances on issues like immigration. The center-left Socialist Party experienced major losses, marking its worst political performance since the end of the Salazar dictatorship, highlighting Chega's inroads into traditionally left-leaning regions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a landmark agreement to enhance security cooperation and reduce trade barriers introduced by Brexit. The article indicates that the deal aims to improve relations after Brexit, allowing easier border crossings and trade. The agreement includes an extension of fishing rights for European trawlers in British waters until 2038, which has faced criticism from Brexit supporters. The deal also includes plans for a youth mobility program and increased security cooperation, reflecting a shift in climate due to the war in Ukraine and President Trump‚Äôs approach to European security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and EU have reached a "reset" deal aiming to boost economic growth, but claims of a "huge" boost are debated. The article notes that while the deal reduces trade barriers, it only dismantles a fraction of those erected post-Brexit. The agreement on plant and animal health is expected to benefit food producers, while the key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that Brexit has caused a 4% reduction in GDP, and fully compensating for that would require rejoining the single market and customs union.</p>
