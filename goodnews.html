        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four Barbary lion cubs recently debuted at Dvůr Králové Safari Park, a crucial development in an international endangered species program aimed at reintroducing the breed to its native North African habitat. The majestic Barbary lion, once prevalent in the Atlas Mountains, went extinct in the wild by the mid-1960s due to overhunting and habitat loss. These cubs, along with others born at the park, will be strategically placed in other zoos to ensure genetic diversity. While discussions with Moroccan authorities for reintroduction are underway, the process faces numerous bureaucratic and environmental hurdles, including ensuring sufficient prey and local community cooperation. This long-term vision highlights the vital role of captive breeding programs in preventing species loss.</p>

          <p>Google has announced a partnership with Italian firm Energy Dome to deploy long-duration energy storage systems utilizing carbon dioxide. This innovative "CO2 Battery" compresses CO2 into a liquid to store energy and expands it back to a gas to generate electricity, offering up to 24 hours of backup power. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, it uses readily available mechanical components and a closed-loop process. This collaboration aims to enhance the reliability of renewable energy sources like wind and solar, supporting Google's goal of 24/7 carbon-free operations by 2030 and potentially revolutionizing grid stability and energy security globally.</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol is poised to make history this weekend as she becomes the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball regular-season game, officiating during the series between the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves. A 48-year-old former collegiate softball player, Pawol began her professional umpiring career in the Minor Leagues in 2016, following extensive participation in MLB's Umpire Camps. Her groundbreaking debut follows similar gender integration milestones in other major professional sports leagues, including the NBA and NFL. This achievement underscores her sustained dedication and talent within the sport, opening new pathways for women in traditionally male-dominated roles within professional baseball.</p>

          <p>Apple plans to commit an additional $100 billion to US domestic manufacturing over the next four years, bringing its total investment to $600 billion. This move, announced by the White House, aims to boost US production and could alleviate tensions with President Trump, who has pushed for more US-based manufacturing and threatened tariffs on companies like Apple. The initiative, dubbed the "American Manufacturing Program," seeks to reshore critical supply chain components. While analysts note that shifting production could take years and increase product costs, this commitment underscores Apple's efforts to align with national economic priorities and protect its supply chain from tariffs.

          <p>Human foot remains discovered inside a hiking shoe on the shores of Fish Lake in south-central Utah this past May have been definitively identified as David White, a man who mysteriously vanished in September 1997. Investigators ingeniously linked the hiking boot, manufactured for only one year in 1996, to White's long-unsolved disappearance. White had intended to go fishing when he went missing, and his boat was later found adrift on the lake without him. DNA testing, comparing samples from the foot and White's daughter, confirmed a parental match with 99.9994% certainty. This breakthrough brings long-awaited closure for White's family and the search and rescue teams involved in the original investigation.</p>

          <p>The perplexing death of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, initially reported as a suicide, was ultimately uncovered as a murder thanks to a crucial piece of forensic evidence. Homicide detectives Abby DeSanto and Jennifer O'Donnell found Matthew Ecker's account, stating Pennig locked herself in the bathroom and shot herself, contradicted by a dry sink and, most critically, a metal ring from the bathroom door lock discovered beneath Pennig's body. This small piece indicated the door was forced open *before* she was shot, proving Ecker had lied. This pivotal discovery allowed detectives to reconstruct the crime, leading to Ecker's conviction for second-degree murder in February 2024 and a subsequent 30-year prison sentence.</p>
