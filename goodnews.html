          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, this article reflects on the devastating impact on pets left behind, leading to the 2006 Pet Evacuation & Transportation Safety (PETS) Act. The law incentivizes states to include animals in disaster plans, recognizing that many people refused to evacuate without their pets, risking their own lives. The crisis highlighted that saving pets is crucial for saving humans. Emergency responders now emphasize taking pets during evacuations, though challenges remain in large-scale animal care during disasters.</p>

          <p>Helen Oyeyemi's latest novel, "A New New Me," is described as her "weirdest yet," following Kinga, a Polish woman with dissociative identity disorder, whose seven or eight selves each govern a day of the week. The article highlights the novel's whimsical yet confident writing, which plunges into a mystery when Kinga-A finds a tied-up man in her pantry. The review notes the book's exploration of storytelling, communication, and the fragmented nature of self, while largely sidestepping the trauma typically associated with DID. It praises the novel's humor and intriguing background elements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes America's severe housing shortage, acknowledging the YIMBY movement's focus on regulatory reform but arguing that land-use laws are not the sole impediment. It highlights that the housing sector has not fully recovered since 2008 due to additional constraints, including expensive and scarce construction loans, a shortage of skilled labor, and rising material costs exacerbated by tariffs. The article proposes a more comprehensive solution involving government financing, tax policy adjustments, expanded vocational training, and increased immigration for trades workers, alongside continued land-use reform.
