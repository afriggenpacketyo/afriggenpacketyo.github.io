          <p>Treasury yields decreased as President Trump suggested implementing a 50% tariff on the European Union, citing stalled negotiations and trade imbalances. Trump also mentioned a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., causing Apple's stock to fall. Investors sought safety in bonds due to these trade war concerns. Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Financial Group noted the importance of capitalism operating without top-down intervention. This followed a week of bond market volatility driven by concerns about Trump's budget bill and Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Americans prepare for the Memorial Day holiday weekend, gas prices are lower than last year, potentially benefiting President Trump and Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections. While gas prices have increased since Trump's return to the White House, they remain at their lowest seasonal level since 2021. Falling prices at the pump could improve Trump's poll numbers, which have been negatively impacted by inflation and trade war concerns. Republican strategists believe the current gas prices reflect the administration's energy policy, while others emphasize the need to address broader affordability issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investing in gold can be a strategic move, especially amidst economic uncertainty, but beginners should be aware of key factors before investing. Physical gold offers tangible ownership but involves storage costs and premiums, which have recently spiked. Gold ETFs provide an efficient and liquid entry point, while gold mining stocks carry higher risk due to market volatility. It's crucial to view gold as a long-term hedge rather than a quick profit source and to be wary of scams and high premiums. (not investment advice)</p>
