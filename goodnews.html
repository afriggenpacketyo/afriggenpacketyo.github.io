        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily roundtrip flights from Newark Liberty International Airport, representing about 10% of its schedule there, due to ongoing air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems. CEO Scott Kirby cited that 20% of Newark's air traffic controllers were unavailable after technology failures, making the cuts necessary to protect customers. The airline is urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. Last year, the FAA moved Newark controllers to Philadelphia to ease congestion, and Kirby praised the Trump administration's infrastructure investment plans. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large-scale parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14, coinciding with the Army's 250th birthday and President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade will involve approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The timing of the parade and White House involvement have raised speculation that Trump is using the Army's anniversary to fulfill his desire for a grand military display, which was previously scrapped due to high costs. City officials have expressed concerns about potential infrastructure damage from heavy vehicles and are seeking reimbursement for any necessary repairs.</p>

          <p>Ana Caldas, a transgender swimmer, won five gold medals in the women's 45-49 age category at the U.S. Masters Swimming Spring National Championship in Texas. This victory sparked controversy on social media, as Texas has a law banning transgender athletes from competing in women's sports. U.S. Masters Swimming's policy allows transgender swimmers to compete in their identified gender category if they meet certain hormonal therapy requirements. The Trump administration also has an executive order requiring publicly funded institutions to ban trans athletes from women's sports, adding to the debate surrounding trans competitors in sports.</p>

          <p>Fifteen-year-old Benjamin Qin Muji, a philosopher, explored the question of whether machines can think and feel pain in an essay for the International Philosophy Olympiad. Benjamin argued that AI can think and is conscious due to its ability to process information and synthesize ideas, but it cannot feel pain because it lacks a biological body. His reasoning earned him top place in the China trials, highlighting the growing importance of addressing the legal implications of AI and the evolving definition of humanity in the age of advanced technology.</p>

          <p>Durga Chew-Bose's remake of Fran√ßoise Sagan's "Bonjour Tristesse" captures the dreamy seaside luxuriance of the original but suffers from over-intellectualization of the characters' motives. The film follows C√©cile as she navigates a summer with her father and his girlfriend, disrupted by the arrival of Anne, a friend of C√©cile's deceased mother. While the film boasts strong visuals and music, its hyperaware dialogue and self-reflection undercut the recklessness and delusion that drove the original narrative, making it feel more clinical than revelatory.</p>
