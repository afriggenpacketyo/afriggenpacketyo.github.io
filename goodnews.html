          <p>The UK government plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of a major defense review. Prime Minister Starmer is expected to announce the plan, which aims to enhance the armed forces' "warfighting readiness" amid growing threats. The review includes a ¬£15 billion investment in the nuclear warhead program and commitments to boost munitions production and cyber capabilities. This initiative is projected to create 30,000 jobs and apprenticeships, bolstering the UK's defense capabilities and supporting long-term employment. The optimism score is based on the stability the plan would bring.</p>
