          <p>India has established a commanding position in the second Test against England, leaving the hosts struggling at 72-3 while chasing an improbable target of 608. The situation was largely dictated by Indian captain Shubman Gill, who followed a first-innings 269 with a remarkable 161, allowing his team to declare at 427-6. Gill's total of 430 runs in the match is the second-highest in Test history. With England's top order collapsing and the highest successful Test chase being 418, India is heavily favored to level the series 1-1 on the final day of play.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri on his final lap in a challenging qualifying session. Piastri secured a surprise second place, with his teammate Lando Norris finishing third, highlighting McLaren's strong performance at Silverstone. Mercedes' George Russell finished fourth, ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton in fifth, in what was a very close session with the top drivers separated by mere fractions of a second. Verstappen noted the windy conditions and the car's low-downforce setup made for a tricky but ultimately successful qualifying run.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as a profoundly important event in world history, arguing it created the concept of a "citizen." He emphasized that the period was a violent and divisive civil war, not a sanitized moment of unity, and that understanding its flaws and complexities makes its achievements even more inspiring. Burns believes that embracing this complicated history, including the founders' contradictions regarding slavery, provides a lifeline to the present, reminding a divided nation that it has overcome deep fissures before by returning to its foundational, albeit imperfect, ideals.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared her conscious decision to be a single mother, explaining it was rooted in self-awareness and a desire to break family cycles of turmoil. Theron reflected on growing up with alcoholism in her family and her own tendency to "lose herself" in relationships, often placating narcissistic partners. Realizing she was not equipped to be healthy in a relationship while raising children, she chose to build her family on her own terms. Relationship experts praised her choice as a sign of strength, alignment, and an empowered decision not to repeat painful patterns.</p>

          <h2>'Tipflation' and Digital Prompts Create Confusion and Pressure for Consumers</h2>

          <p>The rise of digital payment systems has led to an increase in tip requests in unexpected places, from fast-food counters to self-service kiosks, a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation." This trend, accelerated by the pandemic's shift to contactless payments, often presents customers with pre-set tip options of 15% or more, creating social pressure and confusion. Marketing professors who study the topic note that while the technology makes tipping easier, it can also lead to guilt-tipping and irritation among consumers. The design of these systems often defaults to a tip, making it socially awkward to opt out.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:00:01 EDT</div>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend known as the "cortisol cocktail," a non-alcoholic drink with ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium, claims to lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that the beverage can directly reduce cortisol levels. Endocrinologists explain that cortisol is a necessary hormone and doctors rarely aim to lower it except in cases of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, its stress-reducing effects are more likely a placebo or related to improved hydration and sleep from magnesium.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai, an innovative Chinese typewriter designed in the 1940s by linguist Lin Yutang, has been discovered after being lost for decades. Believed to be a crucial artifact in the history of modern Chinese computing, the machine was found in a New York basement and acquired by Stanford University. The typewriter ingeniously solved the challenge of inputting thousands of Chinese characters by breaking them down by shape, a concept that underlies modern East Asian input methods. The discovery is celebrated by scholars as finding a key link in the evolution of non-alphabetic computing technology.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 1923, public swimming has officially returned to the Seine River in Paris, following a $1.5 billion cleanup project. On Saturday, residents took a celebratory plunge in designated swimming areas near the Eiffel Tower, a milestone Mayor Anne Hidalgo called the realization of a "childhood dream." The ban was lifted after officials confirmed the water quality now meets European standards on most days, a key legacy of the city's investment for the 2024 Olympics. While some remain skeptical, the opening marks a historic moment of urban environmental reclamation for the French capital.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change negative public perceptions of the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team conducts research that includes temporarily capturing sharks to examine their stomach contents, providing insights into both the animal's diet and the bay's ecosystem. Researchers emphasize that a healthy shark population indicates a healthy ocean. Despite public fascination, they note that securing financial support for shark research remains challenging due to the animal's fearsome reputation.</p>

          <p>A renter in Scottsdale, Arizona, was fined $4,000 by his property management company, Denali Real Estate, for posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in the lease, which is illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA). This federal law protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback without fear of retaliation or financial penalties from companies. After being contacted by local news, the company stated it would remove the clause from future leases, highlighting an illegal practice that many renters may not be aware of.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for better managing emotional responses to upsetting events. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule acknowledges that the physiological rush of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline lasts about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued anger or stress is a result of mentally replaying the negative thought. Gawdat advises using this 90-second buffer to consciously decide how to move forward, rather than unconsciously renewing the emotional cycle, thereby gaining control over one's state of mind.</p>

          <p>An Emory University professor, inspired by the hobby-centric culture in Denmark, undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies to combat her Type-A mindset. The experience fundamentally changed her, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely by connecting with new communities, and redefine self-care away from passive appointments to active engagement. She found that having hobbies forced her to set better boundaries and led to deeper conversations with others. The author concludes that actively pursuing hobbies is a secret to finding balance, rather than waiting for balance to appear.</p>

This figure is more than double that of the second-ranked state, North Carolina. The state's appeal is often attributed to its tax-friendly policies, as it has no state income, estate, or inheritance tax, making it financially advantageous for seniors. In contrast, California saw the largest exodus of retirees, with a net loss of nearly 57,000. (not investment advice)</p>
