          <p>Shaquille O'Neal has agreed to pay $1.8 million to settle claims that he misled investors by promoting the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. O'Neal, who once urged fans to trust the platform, will resolve the allegations without admitting wrongdoing.

          <p>President Trump stated that Chinese students are welcome in U.S. colleges and universities, potentially reversing earlier policy concerns. The announcement was made as part of a brief outline of a trade deal with China. The statement contrasts with earlier reports that the U.S. would "aggressively" revoke visas for Chinese students and increase vetting. The decision may ease concerns at universities, which rely on international student tuition and see Chinese students as vital to their academic communities.
