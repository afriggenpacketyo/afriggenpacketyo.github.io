          <p>During an appearance on "The Drew Barrymore Show," actress Valerie Bertinelli shared that despite two long marriages, she has never been asked out on a traditional first date. She explained that her relationship with her first husband, the late Eddie Van Halen, began after they met backstage at a concert and were together ever since, marrying eight months later. Bertinelli has also been outspoken about the emotional abuse she endured in her second marriage to Tom Vitale, from whom she split in 2022. She now views her ability to speak openly about her past experiences as a sign of healing and freedom.</p>

          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting has announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its 38 ABC-affiliated stations, ending a preemption of the late-night show. The broadcaster had stopped showing the program after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial remarks related to the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ABC had reinstated the show after a six-day suspension, but major affiliate owners like Sinclair and Nexstar had continued to block it. Sinclair stated its decision was based on ensuring its programming serves the interests of its communities while honoring network obligations.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Opening a Certificate of Deposit in Early October</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 14:41:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve having recently cut interest rates, savers are facing diminishing returns, but opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in early October could still be a strategic move. Financial experts point to three key reasons: locking in a fixed rate allows interest to begin compounding immediately, it secures a return before an anticipated rate cut at the end of the month, and it preempts banks that might lower their CD rates in advance of the Fed's decision. Proactively securing a CD now can help maximize savings in a declining rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has readmitted former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum after a year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs who had the whip withdrawn after voting against the party line to support scrapping the government's two-child benefit cap. This move signals a potential softening of the party's stance on the controversial policy, which is facing increasing pressure for abolition from within Labour and from outside figures. The issue is expected to be a major topic at the upcoming Labour Party conference.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Timeline and Consequences of Late Credit Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 14:17:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As credit card delinquencies rise, it is crucial for consumers to understand the timeline of consequences for late payments. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most issuers will not report it to credit bureaus until it is 30 days past due, which is the first major threshold for credit score damage. At 60 days late, card companies may impose a high penalty APR, and by 90 days, more aggressive collection efforts can begin. Proactive communication with lenders before missing a payment is the most effective way to mitigate financial harm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced it will permit Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. This marks a significant step forward for the manufacturer, as the FAA had revoked this privilege in 2019 and 2022 following fatal crashes and production defects. The agency stated the decision reflects confidence in Boeing's improved production quality but clarified that its inspectors will still alternate certification duties with the company. The move is seen as a sign of returning trust between the regulator and the aerospace giant.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup began with an electrifying moment as American golfer Bryson DeChambeau nearly drove the 397-yard first hole, leading to an early lead for the U.S. team. However, the initial excitement at Bethpage Black was short-lived, as Team Europe quickly mounted a formidable comeback. The European squad dominated the morning foursome matches, winning three of the four points available and silencing the raucous home crowd. The strong European performance has put the U.S. team on the defensive early in the highly anticipated competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a new home equity loan has slightly decreased. For a $150,000 loan, current average rates would result in a monthly payment of approximately $1,847 for a 10-year term and $1,452 for a 15-year term. These figures represent a modest saving of about $16 per month compared to rates from earlier in the year. While not a dramatic drop, the potential for further rate cuts later this year may make home equity borrowing an increasingly attractive option for homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

This, along with a slight dip in membership renewal rates, caused a minor drop in the company's stock price.

The boy, in turn, decided the ball should go to Raleigh, trading it for a signed bat.

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has seized more than $220 million worth of cocaine in a series of recent drug interceptions in the Pacific Ocean. Crews from the cutters Midgett and Diligence stopped multiple smuggling vessels off the coasts of Mexico, Central, and South America, confiscating a combined total of nearly 30,000 pounds of narcotics. The agency released photos of the seized drugs being offloaded and of one of the smuggling boats on fire. The Coast Guard states that such vessels are often sunk after narcotics are removed to prevent them from becoming navigational hazards.</p>

The author suggests that the New York audience, known for its passionate and sometimes confrontational nature, will create an especially challenging environment for the visiting European team, turning the crowd itself into a formidable opponent.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining traction as an alternative to traditional retirement withdrawal methods like the 4% rule. This approach involves converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending and unexpected costs. The strategy aims to provide a balance of financial security and flexibility, reducing stress during volatile markets by ensuring a stable base income. (not investment advice)</p>
