          <p>Deutsche Bank reported second-quarter profits that surpassed analyst expectations, with net profit reaching €1.485 billion, a significant recovery from a loss in the same period last year. Despite this, revenues were impacted by the euro's strength against the dollar, and the core investment banking unit showed mixed results, with a decline in its origination and advisory division. The bank expressed confidence in meeting its full-year targets, citing business momentum and cost discipline, even as it navigates challenges like sluggish loan growth and broader trade uncertainties.

          <p>Marcus Rashford's transfer from Manchester United to Barcelona is being met with intrigue and cautious optimism in the Catalan city. Journalists and fans acknowledge that while he wasn't the club's first choice, his versatility and relatively low cost are valuable assets given Barcelona's financial constraints. The key question is which version of Rashford will arrive: the world-class talent from a few years ago or the player who struggled for form recently. His arrival marks the first time an Englishman has played for Barcelona since Gary Lineker, creating hype and hope for a career revival.</p>

          <p>As NFL training camps begin, several high-profile players are absent from the field due to ongoing contract negotiations, a common tactic to avoid injury before securing a new deal. Notable players holding out include Dallas Cowboys' star Micah Parsons, who is seeking a top-market contract after three dominant seasons, and Cincinnati Bengals' defensive end Trey Hendrickson, who led the NFL in sacks last year. Washington Commanders' receiver Terry McLaurin is also seeking a new deal after a career-best season, creating uncertainty for teams as they prepare for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India are set to formalize a landmark free trade agreement, which has been under negotiation for nearly three years. The deal involves India reducing tariffs on British goods like cars and whisky, while the UK will increase imports of Indian textiles and gemstones. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the pact as a major win that will create jobs and drive growth, with projections suggesting it could boost the British economy by £4.8 billion annually. The agreement now requires parliamentary approval in the UK before it can take effect.</p>

          <p>The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is showcasing Nigerian artist John Madu in an exhibition titled "Van Gogh x John Madu: Paint Your Path." Madu, a self-taught artist from Lagos, has created ten large paintings that reinterpret Vincent van Gogh's famous works with a modern West African perspective. The exhibition highlights the parallels between the two artists, including their self-taught styles and influences from East Asian art. Madu, who considers himself a "global citizen," sees the project as a tribute to a master who inspired him since childhood.</p>

          <p>China is launching a program to provide monthly subsidy vouchers to seniors, a rare move toward direct fiscal support aimed at easing the financial burden of its aging population. The electronic coupons, worth between 500 and 800 yuan, are for seniors assessed with physical disabilities to help pay for services like meal assistance and day care. This policy is intended to stimulate the elderly-care service industry and unlock domestic consumption by reducing precautionary savings among households. The plan will be piloted before a nationwide rollout later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a nationwide block on President Trump's executive order that sought to end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and temporary residents. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the proposed policy is unconstitutional, affirming a lower court's decision. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's efforts to reinterpret the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. The case is now one step closer to being reviewed by the Supreme Court, which will likely have the final say on the contentious issue.</p>
