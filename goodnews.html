          <h2>China's Export Surge Driven by Southeast Asia Amid US Trade Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in April, primarily fueled by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which effectively counteracted a sharp decline in exports to the United States due to escalating tariffs. The overall exports rose by 8.1%, surpassing expectations, while imports saw only a slight decrease of 0.2%. Despite a 21% drop in exports to the U.S., exports to ASEAN countries soared by 20.8%, with notable growth in shipments to Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. This shift indicates China's adaptability in navigating trade challenges and diversifying its export markets amidst ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <h2>Trump Suggests Potential Tariff Reduction on Chinese Goods Amid Trade Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 01:01:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has hinted at the possibility of reducing tariffs on goods imported from China as high-level trade talks are scheduled to commence. Trump acknowledged that tariffs, currently at 145%, cannot increase further, suggesting a potential decrease. These comments were made during the unveiling of a tariff agreement with the UK, the first since Trump imposed steep levies in April. The upcoming meeting in Switzerland signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war between the two economic superpowers, although analysts caution that the negotiations are likely to be lengthy and complex.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks, highlighting the challenges they face in the competitive National League West division. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged that the division is strong and that no team is likely to dominate. Yoshinobu Yamamoto struggled, allowing five runs, while the Diamondbacks' Brandon Pfaadt pitched effectively. The Dodgers' loss underscores the potential for a tight division race, reminiscent of the 2021 season, which could place additional pressure on their regular-season performance.</p>

The agreement is expected to benefit the British car industry by reducing American tariffs. The newspapers also report on the election of a new Pope, Leo XIV, the first US pope, with The Guardian reporting he promised to "build bridges." The Financial Times reports that BlackRock is ending flexible working for senior staff, ordering them back to the office five days a week.</p>

          <h2>Trump Hails Framework of U.K. Trade Deal, but Tariffs Persist</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with Britain, aiming to reduce tariffs and boost trade between the two nations. The deal includes increased access for U.S. agricultural products to the U.K. market and reduced non-tariff barriers. While a 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually will be subject to this rate, with higher rates for additional vehicles. The agreement is seen as a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer and signifies the U.S.'s openness to trade with countries that respect America.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Exports Show Resilience in April Despite US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 23:12:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% in April, defying expectations despite increased tariffs imposed by the United States. The growth is attributed to transshipment through other countries and trade contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. Experts anticipate a gradual weakening of trade data in the coming months and hope for a swift resolution to trade negotiations between China and the US. Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory duties by China on American goods.</p>
