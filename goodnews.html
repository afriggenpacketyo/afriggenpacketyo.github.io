          <h2>Fictional Rock Band Spinal Tap Returns for Sequel Featuring Paul McCartney and Elton John</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 19:34:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The iconic mockumentary rock band Spinal Tap is returning for a sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," more than four decades after the original cult classic film. The new movie, directed by Rob Reiner, reunites the band members—played by Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, and Christopher Guest—for one last contractually obligated gig. The plot follows their search for a new drummer, a notoriously perilous position in the band's fictional history, and features cameo appearances from real-life rock legends Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John. The film revisits the deadpan humor and rock-and-roll satire that made the original a beloved classic.</p>

          <p>South Africa's highest court has struck down an apartheid-era law, ruling that men now have the right to take their wives' last names upon marriage. The Constitutional Court declared the previous legislation unconstitutional, stating it discriminated based on gender and was a "colonial import" that contradicted many African cultural traditions. The case was brought by two couples who challenged the Department of Home Affairs after being denied their naming preferences. The government has been given two years to amend the law, a decision that has sparked widespread debate on social media about tradition and equality.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are presenting a challenge for regulators aiming to foster a stable, long-term bull market. Beijing hopes that steady stock market growth will encourage households to shift wealth from the property market, thereby boosting consumer spending and supporting the broader economy. After a recent pullback tempered the market's rapid ascent, officials are now focused on avoiding the volatile boom-and-bust cycles of the past. The goal is to guide a more measured and sustainable uptrend, which could reduce risks associated with speculative retail investing while still building household wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

The restaurant abruptly closed in March following a labor dispute with its former owner, the Richard J. Riordan Trust. As part of the acquisition, Pustilnikov reached an agreement with the hospitality union Unite Here Local 11 to rehire all 25 laid-off employees and maintain their union representation. The deal was celebrated by workers and city officials as a victory for preserving both a piece of L.A. history and the livelihoods of its dedicated, long-serving staff.</p>

          <p>The California Legislature has passed a bill designed to protect the medical data of transgender individuals from being shared with law enforcement in states with restrictive laws. The legislation, authored by State Sen. Scott Wiener, builds on California's status as a "refuge state" for gender-affirming care. It would prevent healthcare providers from releasing patient information in response to subpoenas based on another state's laws and block police from accessing prescription data without a warrant. The move is a direct response to efforts by the Trump administration and Republican-led states to investigate and curtail access to gender-affirming healthcare.</p>

          <p>Following a day where all major indexes reached record highs, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against market "cynics," asserting that positive economic indicators support a continued bull market. Cramer suggested that many money managers remain bearish due to post-recession caution and concerns over national debt and geopolitical tensions, causing them to miss out on recent gains. He pointed to a surprise increase in weekly jobless claims and revised payroll data as signs that could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. He contended that despite a "fraught backdrop," numerous individual stocks remain undervalued and poised for growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stock prices for both Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance saw a significant surge following reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing a takeover bid for its rival.

He realized his mistake only when the bride walked down the aisle and, not wanting to cause a disruption, stayed through the ceremony and even the group photos.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella admitted to employees that the company's leadership must "do better" to rebuild trust following recent layoffs and a new return-to-office mandate. During an internal meeting, Nadella responded to a question about a perceived lack of empathy, acknowledging the feedback and the need for improvement. The company recently cut 9,000 jobs and now requires workers near its headquarters to be in the office three days a week. While Wall Street has applauded Microsoft's financial performance and AI strategy, the changes have caused friction with some members of its workforce who feel a loss of autonomy.</p>
