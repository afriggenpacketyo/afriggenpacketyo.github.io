          <p>China's expanded visa-free entry policy has demonstrated considerable success, leading to a substantial increase in international tourist arrivals during the first half of 2025 and significantly bolstering the nation's consumption. Countries such as South Korea, Japan, the United States, Thailand, and Russia emerged as primary contributors to this influx of foreign visitors. Notably, Shanghai's Pudong International Airport registered 2.37 million overseas entries, ranking highest nationally for international traffic. The capital, Beijing, also experienced a remarkable doubling of visa-free arrivals compared to the same period last year, reaching over 840,000, underscoring the policy's effectiveness in attracting global travelers and stimulating economic activity across key urban centers.</p>

          <h2>Netflix Attracts Top Directors with Lucrative Deals and Creative Freedom</h2>

          <p>Netflix continues to successfully attract some of Hollywood's most esteemed directors, such as Martin Scorsese and Greta Gerwig, despite its unconventional approach of largely bypassing wide theatrical releases. The streaming service leverages lucrative contracts, substantial creative freedom, and immediate access to its vast subscriber base of over 300 million to entice top talent. Industry insiders highlight that Netflix has also become a crucial platform for auteurs whose high-budget or genre-risky films might not otherwise secure production. While some analysts question the financial implications of this strategy, Netflix prioritizes delivering content directly to its subscribers and significantly reduces marketing costs, solidifying its distinctive and influential role in the global entertainment landscape.</p>

          <h2>UK to Extend Bereavement Leave for Early Miscarriages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 08:55:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a significant legal change, extending bereavement leave entitlements to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. This amendment to the Employment Rights Bill marks a crucial expansion from the current policy, which only grants such leave for losses occurring after 24 weeks or for children under 18. The proposed new right to leave would be unpaid and last for a minimum of one week, with specific details subject to further consultation. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized that this initiative aims to provide grieving parents with necessary time away from work, formally recognizing early pregnancy loss as a legitimate and profound bereavement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are publicly acknowledging 96-year-old artist Janet Bennett as the original designer of the iconic, colorful tile mosaics at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), a recognition that the airport itself has not officially granted. Bennett created these murals in 1961, which have since become a recognizable backdrop in numerous films and television shows. The Dodgers sought her input for a similar tile wall installation at Dodger Stadium, aiming to honor her previously uncredited contribution, which was even misattributed in an obituary. While LAX officials cite a lack of historical records for their silence, the Dodgers' clear attribution finally provides Bennett with long-overdue recognition for her significant artistic legacy.</p>

The city had extended invitations to all countries and regions with diplomatic missions or UN representative offices in Japan. Despite initial considerations that Taiwan did not strictly fit these criteria, the city deliberated on how to accommodate its desire to attend.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article identifies Fluor (NYSE: FLR) as a compelling investment opportunity within the nuclear power sector, largely owing to its substantial 57% majority ownership stake in NuScale, a company at the forefront of developing innovative small modular reactors. While many emerging nuclear startups, including NuScale, are not yet profitable, Fluor itself is currently generating earnings. The analysis points out that a significant portion of Fluor's market capitalization is directly supported by its interest in NuScale, and the company boasts a healthy balance sheet with more cash than debt. Despite acknowledging potential risks such as NuScale's elevated valuation, analysts project robust profitability for Fluor in the near future, suggesting it may be currently undervalued.

The legislation's core impact involves making the existing 2017 Trump tax cuts a permanent fixture, thereby solidifying their long-term financial implications for individuals and businesses. Beyond this, the bill introduces a new "senior bonus" and enhances several deductions, including a larger state and local tax deduction, alongside an increased estate and gift tax exemption. Furthermore, the article highlights the inclusion of specific tax breaks for tip income, overtime pay, and auto loans, in addition to establishing a new tax-advantaged savings account designed to benefit children's financial futures.

          <p>A hiker who plunged 26 feet into a crevasse on Switzerland's Fee Glacier was remarkably rescued, largely thanks to the decisive actions of his long-haired Chihuahua. After the man's distress call was relayed to emergency services, Air Zermatt rescue teams initially faced difficulty locating him on the expansive glacier surface. A pivotal moment occurred when a rescue specialist observed the small dog positioned precisely beside the hidden crevasse where its owner had fallen. The Chihuahua's steadfast presence and indicative behavior enabled rescuers to accurately pinpoint the accident site, leading to the successful extraction of the injured man. The rescue service lauded the dog as a "four-legged hero" whose contribution was instrumental in saving its master's life.</p>
