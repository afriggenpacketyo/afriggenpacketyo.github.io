        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall inflation has cooled, the prices of certain everyday items, such as coffee and beef, continue to rise rapidly, impacting consumers' budgets. Coffee prices have soared due to droughts in Vietnam and Brazil, restricting global supply, while beef prices have increased due to a drought in beef-producing regions of the U.S. in 2022, leading to a reduced national beef herd. Car repair costs have also climbed due to the increasing complexity of car technology and a shortage of skilled technicians. Conversely, apparel prices have generally decreased, but outerwear for both men and women has seen significant price increases.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline on Thursday amid growing expectations that the U.S. and Iran may soon reach an agreement regarding Tehran's nuclear program. President Trump indicated progress in securing a nuclear deal with Iran during his Middle East trip, shortly after an Iranian advisor signaled a willingness to sign a deal in exchange for lifted economic sanctions. The potential for a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal is expected to significantly impact oil markets, potentially increasing crude oil exports by as much as 1 million barrels per day.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that the Haenyeo, all-female free divers of Jeju Island, possess physiological and genetic adaptations that enable them to endure their extreme lifestyle. Researchers found that the Haenyeo exhibit a significantly greater drop in heart rate during simulated dives compared to non-diving women from the same island. Genetic analysis revealed two genes associated with cold tolerance and blood pressure regulation, suggesting that the population of Jeju Island has been genetically sculpted by generations of divers. These adaptations may offer insights into developing therapies for stroke prevention.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to Israel in his second term appears to be shifting, with a greater emphasis on regional dealmaking and less concern for aligning with Israeli interests. Despite strong rhetoric supporting Israel, Trump has engaged in direct negotiations with its adversaries, including Hamas and Iran, without consulting Israel. This shift reflects a growing frustration with Netanyahu and the rising influence of the "restrainer" wing of Republican foreign policy. The changing dynamics in the Middle East also play a role, as Saudi Arabia and the UAE prioritize regional stability and seek to de-escalate tensions with Iran.</p>
