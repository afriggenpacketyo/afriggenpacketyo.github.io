        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Portugal held its third general election in three years following the collapse of the previous government due to a confidence vote failure, with issues like housing and immigration dominating the campaign. Opinion polls suggest Luis Montenegro's Democratic Alliance (AD) is likely to win the vote, but without a clear majority. The far-right Chega party has gained ground, advocating for stricter immigration policies amidst a steep rise in the number of immigrants. The country also faces a housing crisis with soaring prices and rents, compounded by Portugal's status as one of Western Europe's poorest countries. </p>

          <p>Haas F1 team is seeking a review of the FIA's decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, arguing that the lap was completed before a red flag was issued due to a crash. Despite television footage and live-timing data appearing to support Haas's claim, the FIA maintains that the red flag was triggered before Bearman crossed the finish line. Haas is requesting clarification and measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, emphasizing the need for fair and accurate decision-making in Formula 1 racing. </p>

The procedure, conducted on a 41-year-old man with reduced bladder capacity due to cancer treatments, aims to offer an alternative to traditional methods using bowel tissue, which often lead to complications. Doctors plan to conduct four more bladder transplants as part of a clinical trial to assess long-term outcomes and potential risks.

          <p>A new study reveals that simple changes in how bricks are stacked in kilns in Bangladesh can significantly reduce air pollution. The study, which involved over 275 kilns, found that using a zig-zag pattern to increase airflow and ensuring consistent coal delivery can reduce fuel use and emissions by approximately 20%. This low-cost intervention also improves worker conditions and increases profits for kiln owners. The research team is now collaborating with the Bangladeshi government to implement these practices more widely. </p>
