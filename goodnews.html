          <p>The Murdoch family has finalized a deal to resolve the succession battle for control of its global media empire, which includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Under the agreement, Lachlan Murdoch will secure control of the business, while his three older siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will each receive $1.1 billion for their shares. This arrangement effectively ends the legal and personal conflicts among the siblings over the future of the company. The deal solidifies Lachlan's leadership and is seen as maintaining the conservative direction of the media conglomerate's most influential outlets.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 16:07:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate recently experiencing a significant drop, prospective homebuyers can take several steps to secure even better terms. Improving one's credit score is paramount, as higher scores directly translate to lower interest rates offered by lenders. Additionally, providing a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, reduces the lender's risk and can result in a more favorable rate and avoidance of private mortgage insurance. Homebuyers should also consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which often feature lower initial interest rates.

          <p>Shares of online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant surge, jumping over 15% after S&P Global announced its addition to the S&P 500 index. The inclusion, which will take effect before trading on September 22, is a major milestone for the company and often acts as a catalyst for stock performance. Companies added to the benchmark index typically see increased demand from passive and index funds that track the S&P 500. After months of speculation, the move validates Robinhood's market position, with its stock now up more than 210% year-to-date, reflecting a strong recovery since its 2021 IPO.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While most seniors cannot completely avoid paying for Medicare Part B, there are specific circumstances where enrollment can be delayed or costs can be subsidized. The most common method is to remain on a creditable employer health plan past age 65, which allows for penalty-free delayed enrollment. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs can help cover or eliminate the monthly premiums. It is crucial to understand, however, that forgoing Part B can make one ineligible for supplemental coverage like Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans, potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs for unexpected medical needs.</p>

The investment was part of a Series B funding round that values the league at $340 million and also included participation from soccer star Alex Morgan. Unrivaled was created to provide WNBA players with a high-paying domestic option during their offseason, claiming to offer the highest average salary in professional women's sports league history. This move reflects Williams' ongoing commitment to championing and investing in women's sports, aiming to elevate opportunities and compensation for female athletes.</p>

          <h2>Comparing the Benefits of a $40,000 CD Versus a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 15:52:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding where to place a significant sum like $40,000, savers should weigh the distinct advantages of certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. CDs offer a fixed interest rate for a set term, providing predictable returns and protection against future rate drops, but they penalize early withdrawals. High-yield savings accounts provide more flexibility and access to funds, but their variable interest rates will likely decline as the Federal Reserve cuts rates. The best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, liquidity needs, and their assessment of the long-term interest-earning potential of each option. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Projections from Norway's parliamentary election indicate that Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere's center-left Labour Party is on track to secure a narrow victory. The left-leaning alliance is expected to win a slim majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament, allowing the minority government to remain in power. The election campaign focused on domestic issues such as inflation and the cost of living, but international instability also played a role. Observers suggest that global uncertainty may have led voters to favor the stability offered by the incumbent government, despite its reduced support compared to the 2021 election.</p>

          <p>An early season cold front is set to bring a significant cooling trend and some precipitation to California this week, offering relief from recent heatwaves and wildfires. Temperatures are forecast to drop 10 to 20 degrees below normal, with inland areas struggling to reach the mid-80s. The low-pressure system is also expected to bring light rain and thunderstorms to Northern California, which could help suppress ongoing wildfires in the region. While Southern California is not expected to receive significant rainfall, a deep marine layer may bring some coastal drizzle, temporarily mitigating fire danger.</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates fall to an 11-month low, homeowners who bought during recent peaks may be considering refinancing. Key questions to contemplate include whether current rates, now in the low 6% range, are low enough to justify the action, especially if one's current rate is near 8%. Homeowners must also weigh the risk of waiting for potentially lower rates against the savings they could realize now. It's essential to calculate the closing costs, which typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, and ensure the break-even point aligns with long-term plans for the home.

In a humorous statement, the Great Run Company admitted its mistake, calling the items "the most unique T-shirt and medal in Great North Run history." Despite the geographical blunder, which even the event's founder failed to notice, many participants have taken the error in stride, viewing it as a quirky souvenir.</p>
