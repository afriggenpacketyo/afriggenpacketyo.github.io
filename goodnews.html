          <p>Amazon is investing heavily in automating its logistics, potentially saving billions annually by 2030. According to Morgan Stanley, the company is experimenting with delivery robots, including AI-powered humanoid robots that could deliver packages directly to customers' doors from Rivian electric vans, reducing delivery times and labor costs. These robots are being tested at a San Francisco "humanoid park" obstacle course, marking the next phase in Amazon's automation strategy. The analyst firm projects that increased robotics in warehouses could lead to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030, with Amazon's retail business being a significant beneficiary of generative AI, enhancing profitability and market dominance in logistics (not investment advice).</p>
