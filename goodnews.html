          <p>The Pittsburgh Pirates have traded Gold Glove-winning third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes to the Cincinnati Reds in a notable NL Central division deal. In exchange, the Pirates will receive reliever Taylor Rogers and shortstop prospect Sammy Stafura. Hayes, who signed a long-term $70 million contract, provides the Reds with exceptional defensive skill, though he has struggled offensively this season. The trade signals a cost-clearing move for the rebuilding Pirates while bolstering the Reds' roster as they aim for a playoff spot, currently sitting just a few games out of a wild-card position.</p>

The successful IPO reflects a gradually reopening market for tech companies and strong investor confidence in Figma's performance.

          <p>Brown University has settled with the Trump administration, restoring nearly $50 million in federal research funding and closing several government investigations into the institution. The agreement requires Brown to reaffirm its commitment to nondiscrimination policies and grant federal officials access to admissions data. Unlike a similar settlement with Columbia University, Brown's deal involves no financial penalty. The university will also implement the administration's definitions of male and female for certain campus programs and facilities, but the agreement preserves Brown's autonomy over teaching, learning, and academic speech.</p>

Meta also raised its third-quarter sales forecast and increased its capital expenditure outlook, signaling heavy investment in AI infrastructure, including a notable investment in Scale AI. Despite a continued operating loss in its Reality Labs division, the overall strong performance and positive outlook underscore the success of the company's strategic shift toward artificial intelligence.

The company's net income more than doubled, and it added 2.3 million funded customers, bringing its total to 26.5 million. The growth was driven by strong net deposits, higher asset valuations, and a significant increase in Robinhood Gold subscribers. While crypto and equities trading revenue slightly missed forecasts, strong performance in options trading and net interest revenue highlighted the company's successful expansion into a broader wealth management platform.

          <p>Microsoft's market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion in after-hours trading, making it the second company to reach this milestone, following Nvidia. The surge came after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, with shares jumping 8%. Revenue grew at its fastest rate in over three years, largely driven by a 34% increase in sales from its Azure cloud computing business. The achievement highlights the immense investor confidence in Microsoft's position as a primary beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, placing it ahead of Apple in the market cap rankings.

          <p>Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, has announced she will not seek the governorship of California in the upcoming election. The decision ends months of speculation and opens up the race to lead the nation's most populous state. In her statement, Harris indicated that her public service would not be in elected office for now, but she plans to remain politically active, helping elect Democrats and sharing more about her future plans soon. Her withdrawal leaves a crowded field of Democratic candidates to compete for the position being vacated by the term-limited Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>This article presents a curated list of six independent Latin artists whose innovative work merits consideration for the upcoming Latin Grammy Awards. While major commercial artists often dominate nominations, this piece argues for celebrating musicians who are pushing the genre's creative boundaries without major label support. The highlighted artists include Argentine digital artist Juana Aguirre, Chilean songwriter Gepe, and Guatemalan-born cellist Mabe Fratti. The author suggests their forward-thinking and critically acclaimed albums from the past year showcase a progressive evolution in Latin music that the Latin Academy should acknowledge and reward.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Harris's Decision to Forgo Governor's Race Keeps 2028 Presidential Option Open</h2>

          <p>By declining to run for California governor, Kamala Harris has strategically kept the possibility of a 2028 presidential campaign alive, according to political analysis. Running the nation's largest state while simultaneously preparing a presidential bid would have been a monumental challenge, and she would have faced pressure to commit fully to California voters. While some close to Harris questioned her appetite for the state-level role after serving as vice president, the decision allows her to avoid that path. She would enter a potential 2028 primary with high name recognition, but also face a likely large field of Democratic contenders.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5%, citing a solid economy but also elevated uncertainty and inflation remaining above its target. The decision was not unanimous, with two FOMC members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged pressure from President Trump but emphasized that the decision was data-dependent, noting that the economy does not appear to be held back by restrictive policy. The central bank will continue monitoring economic indicators, including tariffs' impact, before its next meeting in September. (not investment advice)</p>

Streeting stated he is not willing to negotiate further on pay but will resume talks focused on improving working conditions, such as career progression and rota scheduling. He warned the union that the recent strike had squandered the government's goodwill, but confirmed his door remains open for discussions to find a resolution.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Senate committee has advanced bipartisan legislation that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to vote the bill forward in an 8-7 vote. The measure would require lawmakers to sell their stocks within 180 days and certify compliance annually. The bill's advancement, despite some Republican opposition, marks a significant step for a proposal aimed at preventing potential conflicts of interest and increasing public trust in elected officials.
