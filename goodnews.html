          <p>Officials from the United States and China commenced trade talks in Geneva, marking the first face-to-face discussions since President Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. The meetings aim to resolve a trade war that has disrupted financial markets and import activities in both countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent leads the U.S. delegation, while Vice Premier He Lifeng represents China. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter expressed hope that the talks would yield positive results for the global economy, though a swift resolution is unlikely as negotiations are expected to be a long and complex process.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct and common sense in decision-making, contrasting it with over-reliance on data and research. Diller recounts his experiences at ABC, where he championed the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week," and emphasizes that predicting public appetite is impossible. He praises the use of instinct over data, noting that too much information can overload and obscure good ideas. Diller shares anecdotes about greenlighting projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" based on their compelling stories.</p>

Despite concerns about potential dangers upon reentry due to its sturdy construction, Roscosmos stated that "Kosmos 482 no longer exists."

          <p>The Channel Islands, often called California‚Äôs Galapagos, are home to a vast underwater ecosystem teeming with life, including giant sea bass and vibrant kelp forests. Marine protected areas (MPAs) around the islands preserve roughly 21% of their waters, supporting thousands of species. However, the California Fish and Game Commission is reviewing these MPAs, considering proposals to either expand or reduce protections. While scientists and conservationists advocate for continued preservation, commercial fishers express concerns about potential restrictions on their fishing rights. The article emphasizes the ecological and economic benefits of the MPAs and the challenges of balancing conservation with human activities.</p>
