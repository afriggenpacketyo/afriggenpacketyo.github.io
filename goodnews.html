        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League has released its 2025-26 season fixtures, but warned of potential changes at short notice due to the increased number of teams participating in European competitions. With nine teams in Europe, scheduling conflicts are likely to arise, particularly for teams progressing to the knockout rounds. England boss Thomas Tuchel will face challenges with Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester City playing key matches before international windows. The first expanded lot of TV fixtures will require careful juggling to accommodate Champions League representatives playing on Tuesdays.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to skirt higher duties imposed by the U.S. government, involving strategic alterations to products' materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into lower-tariff categories. Despite broad-based tariffs, exemptions exist, allowing companies to benefit through creative product tweaks. This practice, legal as long as goods are honestly presented to customs, enables manufacturers to reduce duty liabilities by reclassifying items. Industries such as consumer goods and apparel find it easier to implement tariff engineering compared to heavily regulated sectors like automotive and aerospace.</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable rocket, marking a significant step in its expansion into the space sector. The test flight, conducted on Hokkaido, Japan, saw the prototype rocket reach an altitude of nearly 300 meters before landing close to its designated spot. The company aims to develop the technology for a suborbital launch by 2029, anticipating increased demand for satellite launch rockets. This initiative leverages Honda's existing technologies from product development and automated driving systems.</p>

          <p>The U.K. Parliament has voted to decriminalize some late-term abortions in England and Wales, marking a significant reform to British abortion laws. The new legislation prevents women from being investigated, arrested, prosecuted, or imprisoned for terminating their own pregnancies, regardless of the term. This change addresses cases where women have ended pregnancies outside of approved settings, such as buying pills online. The law still requires approval in the House of Lords, and it does not change rules for abortions in clinical settings or prosecutions for those assisting women in late-term abortions.</p>
