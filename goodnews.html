          <p>Bitcoin experienced a slight price increase, moving back above the $111,000 mark, while the broader stock market faced a downturn. This occurred as gold prices surged to a new all-time high of around $3,500, driven by its traditional role as a safe-haven asset during times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Market analysts suggest that while Bitcoin benefits from similar themes, its recent performance has been partially dampened by a significant rotation of investment into Ethereum.

          <p>In an open letter, nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have condemned President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position. The signatories argue that this action threatens the central bank's crucial independence and undermines the stability of the U.S. financial system. The letter emphasizes that the Federal Reserve was designed to be insulated from day-to-day politics and warns that politicizing its decisions could increase monetary policy uncertainty, ultimately raising borrowing costs for families and businesses across the country.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.3 billion for the upcoming Wednesday drawing after no winning tickets were sold for Monday's $1.2 billion prize. The new grand prize now ranks as the fifth-largest in the game's history, with a cash value of approximately $589 million. This will be the 41st consecutive drawing without a jackpot winner, a streak that has been building since the last grand prize was won in California on May 31, 2025, continuing to fuel lottery ticket sales across the country.</p>

          <p>During Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Beijing, analysts noted that China and Russia have significant opportunities to expand their trade relationship, particularly in non-sanctioned goods and yuan-rouble settlements. Despite a recent dip in Chinese automotive exports to Russia, there is strong Russian demand for Chinese consumer goods, electronics, and machinery that are difficult to obtain from the West. The two nations signed over 20 bilateral agreements covering energy, aerospace, and agriculture, reinforcing their strategic alignment amid ongoing economic pressure from the United States.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a prominent New York Democrat, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, ending a 34-year career in Congress. The 78-year-old lawmaker stated his decision was influenced by the need for generational change within the Democratic party, a lesson he said was highlighted by Joe Biden's unsuccessful presidential bid. Nadler, who played a key role in both of Donald Trump's impeachments as chair of the House Judiciary Committee, suggested other aging Democrats should also consider stepping aside for new leadership.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski has won the Green Party leadership election, promising to employ a bold "eco-populist" strategy to challenge the Labour Party and expand the party's influence. Polanski, a 42-year-old London Assembly member, defeated two of the party's sitting MPs with a platform focused on more confrontational communication and a decisive shift to the left. His unconventional background and support for radical policies like a Universal Basic Income signal a new direction for the party as it aims to build on its recent electoral successes and connect with a broader range of voters.</p>

          <p>Researchers with the USDA are experimenting with an unconventional method to protect cattle from gray wolves: drones equipped with loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC music and clips from films. The project, taking place near the California-Oregon border, aims to haze the predators by using novel and startling noises to interrupt their hunts without causing physical harm. While the technique has shown initial success in scaring wolves away, questions remain about its long-term effectiveness and practicality for ranchers, given the high cost and operational challenges of the technology.</p>
