          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, causing injuries to at least 22 people on board. The ship, which was on a goodwill visit, lost the top of two masts when it struck the bridge structure. According to authorities, no one fell into the water, and the bridge did not sustain any damage. New York Police Department's chief of operations suggested that mechanical issues and a power cut might have contributed to the accident, which is currently under investigation by the Mexican Navy.

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, primarily women and children, who fled to eastern Congo after the 1994 genocide, were repatriated after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of the region. Organized by the U.N. refugee agency and Save the Children, the returnees were transported to a transit center for emergency assistance and reintegration support. Many of these refugees were Hutus who fled Rwanda fearing reprisal for the state-sponsored genocide against Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The repatriation is part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR, aiming to bring home approximately 2,000 people, adding to the over 101,000 already repatriated. ()</p>

          <p>Despite growing public regret over Brexit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces strong opposition from the national news media as he cautiously seeks to mend ties with the European Union. Tabloid newspapers, many of which supported the Brexit campaign, are criticizing Starmer's efforts, accusing him of betraying the vote to leave the EU. Starmer's attempts to negotiate a new defense and security agreement with the EU are complicated by a media landscape that often promotes a jingoistic view of British exceptionalism. The Prime Minister's cautious approach reflects the divisive legacy of Brexit, which has led to political paralysis and frequent changes in leadership. ()</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union are moving towards a new era of cooperation, potentially including a defense pact, as President Trump's America reduces its commitment to the continent. The two sides are expected to meet for a summit in London to discuss a landmark defense and security agreement aimed at bolstering military security in Europe. This comes as the United States is pulling back from its traditional role in global leadership on defense and free trade. While negotiations on the new relationship have faced challenges, including disputes over fishing rights, the summit underscores a commitment to working together in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical environment.

          <p>Chinese researchers have announced the development of a new fiber-optic gyroscope designed to improve navigation stability for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This "groundbreaking" gyroscope is engineered to maintain stability across a wide temperature range, making it suitable for inertial navigation systems that do not rely on external signals like satellites. These systems are crucial for military and security applications because they are immune to interference. Fiber-optic gyroscopes offer advantages over traditional mechanical gyroscopes due to their simple structure and high resolution. ()</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Walmart for attributing potential price increases to tariffs imposed by his administration. Trump insisted that Walmart should "eat the tariffs" rather than pass the costs on to consumers. Walmart responded by stating its commitment to keeping prices low. The confrontation underscores the tension between the administration's trade policies and the retail sector. ()</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler surged to the lead at the US PGA Championship, finishing with a strong performance on the third day. The catalyst was his drive on the 304-yard par-four 14th, which came to rest three feet from the cup. Scheffler expressed his determination to seize the opportunity to win the major tournament, acknowledging that it would require another exceptional round. Only four players this century have won the US PGA Championship after coming from three or more behind at the 54-hole stage. ()</p>

          <h2>Michael Gove Signals Potential for Second Scottish Independence Referendum</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove suggested that a second Scottish independence referendum could be possible if there is overwhelming public support for it. While Gove does not believe another referendum is currently necessary, he acknowledged that the UK government may have to reconsider its position if support for independence grows significantly. Gove's comments align with SNP leader John Swinney's call for "demonstrable support" for independence. Gove, however, stressed the importance of focusing on improving public services and the economy.

          <p>Pop culture, including TikTok, Netflix, and celebrity endorsements, has reshaped public perception of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents. Initially portrayed as greedy monsters, the brothers have gained sympathy due to increased awareness of trauma and sexual abuse. A judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, and the California Parole Board will now consider their case. The shift in public opinion could influence Governor Gavin Newsom's decision regarding their potential release. (sexual assault disclaimer: Sexual assault is mentioned as a factor influencing public opinion, but not explicitly detailed in this summary.) ()</p>
