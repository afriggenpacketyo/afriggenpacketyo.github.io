          <p>A woman whose body was discovered on a Dutch beach in 2004 has been identified as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer, finally resolving a two-decade-old cold case. Her identity was confirmed following a crucial tip-off to Dutch police, prompted by an appeal aired on German TV as part of the international Operation Identify Me campaign. This initiative, launched in 2023, leverages public appeals and shared police records to name women who died in suspicious or unexplained circumstances across Europe, having already identified three others. While her identity brings significant closure to her family, the cause of death remains unknown, and authorities are continuing their investigation into the circumstances of her passing, hoping to provide full answers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a groundbreaking discovery, revealing that adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity, offering a novel method for clean power generation in cold environments. Their research found that when salt-doped ice is subjected to bending, it produces an electrical response comparable to high-performance ceramic materials known for their electrical properties. This phenomenon is attributed to flexoelectricity, which is the generation of an electrical charge when a material experiences non-uniform strain. The team has successfully fabricated devices from saline ice, demonstrating its potential as a low-cost energy source and marking a significant advance in renewable energy technology for colder regions.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants delivered a decisive 34-17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, marking the defending Super Bowl champions' second consecutive loss. Rookie running back Cam Skattebo scored three touchdowns, while fellow rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart showcased a strong performance, throwing for 195 yards and rushing for 58 after overcoming an injury scare. The Giants' defense also played a key role, sacking Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts three times and securing an interception, his first of the season. This significant win for the Giants, their fourth against the Eagles in the last 18 games, highlights a challenging period for Philadelphia as their offense struggled with miscues and repetitive play calls like the "tush push."</p>

          <p>Chinese regulators, including the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), have unveiled new measures to combat disorderly price competition. This joint policy aims to limit intense competition that has led to price wars and self-destructive cost-cutting practices within certain industries, which regulators deem detrimental to the national economy. Authorities will guide industry associations to evaluate average production costs and help companies set reasonable prices, intervening with cost investigations and price inspections when necessary. The move seeks to prevent negative effects on industry development, product innovation, and quality, ensuring market stability and healthy economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Fund managers express concern that such high multiples leave little margin for error, suggesting the market may lack patience if these companies fail to deliver on expectations. This situation reflects Beijing's strong support for domestic tech and a directive for firms to avoid using Nvidia processors, creating a unique investment landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dramatic 2-1 walk-off victory against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 of the National League Division Series, advancing to the NL Championship Series. The game ended in the 11th inning due to a shocking throwing error by Phillies pitcher Orion Kerkering, who mishandled a grounder and threw the ball wildly to the backstop, allowing the winning run to score. This "instant classic" concluded a tense pitchers' duel that stretched into extra innings, with both teams' bullpens delivering strong performances, including Roki Sasaki's three perfect relief innings. The Dodgers now move forward as favorites in their quest for a World Series title defense, while the Phillies face another frustrating playoff exit.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, is expected to launch her campaign for the U.S. Senate next week, aiming to unseat long-time Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, who is term-limited as governor, has gained national attention for her clashes with former President Trump, notably over transgender sports policies, famously telling him "See you in court." Her entry into the race is a significant development for Democrats, who view Maine as a rare opportunity to flip a GOP-held seat and challenge the Senate's Republican majority, despite a challenging national Senate terrain. Mills will join an expanding primary field, including progressive oyster farmer Graham Platner, in what is anticipated to be a closely watched contest.</p>

His defense team argues Roberson is innocent, contending Nikki died from severe pneumonia exacerbated by medications, not shaken baby syndrome as initially diagnosed. The ruling orders the trial court to re-evaluate his conviction under Texas' "junk science" law, which allows relief if evidence used is no longer credible, citing the case of Andrew Roark who was exonerated on similar grounds. This article highlights growing scrutiny of shaken baby syndrome diagnoses, with over 40 exonerations since 1992.</p>

This dolphin-sized creature, dating back approximately 185 million years, is the only known example of its kind and helps fill a significant gap in ichthyosaur evolution, a period from which fossils are incredibly rare. Scientists note its distinctive long, sword-like snout and a prong-like bone near its nostril. Marks on its skull suggest it may have been killed by a bite from a larger ichthyosaur, offering a glimpse into the dangerous life in Mesozoic oceans.</p>
