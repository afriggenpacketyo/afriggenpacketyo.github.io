          <p>Alibaba CEO Wu outlined a comprehensive strategy for the company's AI development, aiming for artificial superintelligence and becoming a "world’s leading full-stack AI service provider" by leveraging its Qwen open-source models and cloud services. This blueprint highlights the intense competition between Chinese and US tech giants in artificial intelligence, a field with vast economic, social, and geopolitical implications that have attracted massive investments. The article suggests that China's focus extends beyond just hardware like chips to encompass a full ecosystem of software and computing infrastructure, offering a strategic lesson for the US. As Wu spoke, Alibaba's shares surged to a four-year high, indicating strong market confidence in their ambitious AI vision and its potential.</p>

          <p>The UK is prepared to use the full value of frozen Russian assets, totaling over £25bn, to support Ukraine's war effort, according to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. This joint action with France and Germany aims to increase pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and facilitate negotiations, taken in close cooperation with the US. Previously, only profits and interest from these assets were used. The announcement follows recent European discussions on a €140bn loan to Ukraine and calls from US President Donald Trump to seize Russian assets. Ukraine's President Zelensky welcomed the move, urging more sanctions and air defense systems amidst renewed Russian missile strikes.</p>

          <p>British band Wolf Alice has achieved an unprecedented fourth consecutive Mercury Prize nomination for their new album, "The Clearing," a feat unmatched by other acclaimed artists. Singer Ellie Rowsell admits to anxiety despite the recognition, contrasting with her intense stage presence. Guitarist Joff Oddie emphasizes their serious approach to albums, calling a good one "one of the highest forms of art." The article explores their musical evolution from folk to alt-rock and their latest embrace of 70s FM pop, recorded with producer Greg Kurstin. Despite some critical reception to their stylistic shift, the band expresses newfound confidence in connecting with audiences through diverse sounds.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 22:33:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has rejected a Trump administration proposal, the "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education," which offered preferential access to federal funds in exchange for adhering to specific policies. MIT President Sally Kornbluth stated the proposal would "restrict freedom of expression" and was inconsistent with the university's core values, including the belief that scientific funding should be based on merit. The compact sought to cap foreign admissions, restrict political comments by university leaders, and enforce a binary gender definition. MIT's decision highlights a broader clash between the administration and academic institutions over autonomy and values.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump underwent a "semiannual physical" at Walter Reed medical center, just six months after his annual check-up, as he prepares for a trip to the Middle East following a Gaza ceasefire deal. The White House described it as a "routine yearly checkup," with his physician, Sean Barbabella, stating Trump is in "exceptional health" and his cardiac age is 14 years younger than his chronological age of 79. This visit follows recent speculation about his health, fueled by public appearances showing a bruised hand and previous diagnoses like chronic venous insufficiency. The administration aims to dispel rumors, though the president has historically been private about his health details.</p>

          <p>Senior U.S. officials have provided a detailed timeline outlining the months-long negotiations that led to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and the initial phase of President Trump's peace plan. The process involved extensive diplomatic efforts by special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, engaging Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, and Israel. Key breakthroughs included Hamas accepting a ceasefire proposal in August, Netanyahu's apology to Qatar for a past airstrike, and intensive talks in Sharm El Sheikh that separated the deal into two phases: hostage release and a subsequent "almost permanent ceasefire." This intricate negotiation highlights the complexities of achieving peace in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a deal with AstraZeneca, making it the second major drug company to agree to discounted prescription drug prices for Medicaid patients. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will offer drugs at "most-favored-nation" prices, matching the lowest rates found in other high-income countries, and list primary care medications on the upcoming government website, TrumpRx. While the company promises up to 80% discounts for eligible patients, experts like Darius Lakdawalla and Sean Sullivan express skepticism about the deal's broad impact on Medicaid users, who already benefit from "best price" protections. The initiative aims to lower U.S. drug costs, with AstraZeneca also pledging investments in U.S. manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite league rules stating scores are final, the team unanimously agreed it would be wrong to keep the trophy.

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse, has retired to the country after sustaining injuries during a chaotic runaway incident in central London last year. Quaker was one of five Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horses spooked by construction noise, leading them to bolt through the city, colliding with vehicles and causing injuries. While four other horses have returned to duty, Quaker suffered bleeding and a small break, necessitating his retirement for welfare reasons. His rider, who broke his back in the incident, has since recovered and returned to riding. The Horse Trust, a sanctuary for military horses, will now provide Quaker with a peaceful retirement.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. online retailers have removed several million listings for prohibited Chinese electronics following a crackdown by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). FCC Chair Brendan Carr announced the removal of items from companies like Huawei, Hikvision, ZTE, and Dahua, citing national security concerns that these devices could allow China to "surveil Americans" or disrupt communications networks. The FCC is tightening restrictions, planning a vote to prohibit authorization of devices with banned components and the sale of previously authorized equipment. This ongoing effort reflects escalating U.S. actions against Chinese tech companies deemed national security risks, impacting various sectors from telecom to surveillance.</p>

The updated documents will also showcase natural landscapes from all four UK nations, including Ben Nevis and the Giant's Causeway, inside their pages.

Passports with Queen Elizabeth II's coat of arms will remain valid until expiry. The transition includes new security features to combat forgery, reflecting a "new era in the history of the British passport" and a commitment to secure public service.</p>
