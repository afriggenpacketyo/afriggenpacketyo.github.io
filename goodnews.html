          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as a swing vote. He discusses the court's ideological shift, his pivotal decisions on same-sex marriage and abortion, and his concerns about the decline of reasoned discourse in America. Kennedy also shares personal anecdotes, including a reconciliation with Justice Scalia and his views on constitutional interpretation. The article highlights his belief that "the cases swung, not me," emphasizing his consistent judicial philosophy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is met with skepticism from dermatologists, despite anecdotal evidence from users. While some research suggests oral collagen may have an impact, experts like Dr. Emma Wedgeworth doubt its ability to specifically target skin after digestion. The article highlights that topical creams are ineffective, and advises marine collagen if taken orally. Ultimately, dermatologists recommend sunblock, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking as more impactful for skin health.</p>
