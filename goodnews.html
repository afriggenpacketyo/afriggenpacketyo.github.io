        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles's long-held urban planning philosophies, which once faced architectural opposition, are now inspiring the design of England's next generation of new towns. Government plans for 12 new towns will incorporate principles like walkability, environmental friendliness, and "gentle density" through terraced housing and mansion blocks, rather than high-rises. This article highlights how the King's advocacy for traditional building styles and harmony with nature, seen in his Poundbury and Nansledan schemes, has gained mainstream acceptance. These new developments aim to avoid past mistakes of car-centric designs and poor public spaces, focusing instead on creating sustainable, community-oriented environments with significant affordable housing.</p>

          <p>Oberlin High School in Ohio offers "Men's Work," a program led by Johnny Cole of Hey Brother and teacher David Reese, creating a unique space for teen boys to openly discuss their struggles. The initiative aims to challenge "manosphere" messaging prevalent online, which often pressures boys to be physically strong and discourages emotional expression. This article highlights that only 38% of teen boys feel comfortable discussing mental health with friends, compared to 58% of girls, underscoring the program's importance. It seeks to provide a "more loving way to move forward" by offering adult male role models who encourage emotional openness and self-understanding.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is intensifying his rhetoric against the Reform UK party, vowing to use "every ounce of our energy to fight Reform" at the upcoming Labour Party Conference. Starmer acknowledges Labour's past failure to address concerns about illegal immigration, a key issue for Reform. This article also details his enthusiastic embrace of a digital ID plan, arguing that public comfort with sharing personal data online makes government-mandated digital ID more palatable now than two decades ago. Despite a petition against digital ID garnering over a million signatures, Starmer aims to convince a "quieter majority" and establish clear political dividing lines.</p>

          <p>Nine-year-old Jameson Pennings, a Philadelphia Phillies fan, selflessly gifted a foul ball he caught to Donna Morey, a fellow fan celebrating her 80th birthday. Jameson overheard Morey's daughter trying to get a ball for her mother, and realizing an 80-year-old had slim chances, he walked over with his treasured souvenir. This article captures Morey's shock and gratitude, describing the act as symbolizing "goodness in this world." Jameson explained his decision by saying Morey was older and likely wouldn't attend many more games, while he could get "many more balls," finding greater happiness in giving.</p>

This article mentions that a lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had previously urged declassification, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart being spotted on Saipan. While many historians believe she simply ran out of fuel, theories persist about spy missions or capture by the Japanese, despite previous FBI reviews concluding against such scenarios.</p>

          <p>Southern California has witnessed over 2,000 lightning strikes in the past two days, primarily over the Pacific Ocean, as a low-pressure system moves slowly across the region. The National Weather Service attributes this to a cutoff low-pressure area retaining moisture. This article highlights that the Bay Area experienced an even greater number, with over 13,000 total strikes, mostly occurring during wet conditions with minimal fire risk. Forecasters predict a weak low-pressure system will bring additional thunderstorms, winds, and isolated showers to Southern California through the weekend, with potential for heavy downpours over burn scars.</p>

          <p>Team Europe achieved a dominant start on day one of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, taking a 5½-2½ lead into Saturday's play, marking their strongest position on American soil in a generation. Winning both the morning foursomes (3-1) and afternoon fourballs (2½-1½) sessions, Europe is now a strong favorite to secure their first away win since 2012. This article highlights historical statistics showing that teams leading after the opening two sessions often win the trophy. Despite US captain Keegan Bradley's defiant stance and confidence in his team, Europe's performance, particularly from players like Jon Rahm, has significantly deflated the home crowd's mood.</p>

This article recounts the horrific incident where four teenage girls—Jennifer Harbison, Sarah Harbison, Eliza Thomas, and Amy Ayers—were tied up, shot, and left in a burning I Can't Believe It's Yogurt! shop.
