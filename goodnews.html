          <p>Apple is seeking a stay on a recent court decision that found the company in contempt for violating an order related to its case with Epic Games. The ruling requires Apple to allow developers to include external payment links in their apps without paying Apple's commission, which Apple claims could cost the company substantial sums, potentially in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars annually. Apple argues that the ruling punishes them and that developers are already exploiting the order to reduce consumer choice. Apple maintains it has complied with the court's order and plans to appeal the contempt ruling, with CEO Tim Cook stating the company strongly disagrees with the decision.</p>

The vice-minister of justice, Wang Zhenjiang, emphasized the urgent need to improve institutional measures to tackle problems encountered by private enterprises and to unleash the sector's internal momentum and creative vitality.</p>

          <p>Kavan Markwood, the Pittsburgh Pirates fan who fell 21 feet at PNC Park, is recovering faster than expected from injuries to his skull, brain, spine, ribs, and lungs. He is now off the breathing machine and out of intensive care, preparing for physical therapy rehab. Doctors believe cognitive rehab will be critical due to his brain injuries, but Markwood can talk, walk, and perform simple tasks. The cause of the fall remains under investigation, though initial reports suggested possible intoxication, which a Pirates spokesperson disputes.</p>
