          <p>Elissa Strauss challenges the traditional "Hero's Journey" narrative, arguing that motherhood and caregiving can also be epic adventures filled with life-altering trials and profound insights. She contends that caring for another can be a transformative experience, offering wisdom and personal growth that rivals solo adventures. By viewing motherhood through this lens, Strauss hopes to dismantle simplistic binaries often applied to mothers and encourage greater respect and support for caregivers in an age of increasing isolation. She advocates for recognizing the value of human connection and intimate relationships as pathways to wisdom and hero status.</p>

          <p>Malibu, California, is considering building a sewer system along Pacific Coast Highway after a wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes with outdated septic systems, sparking a debate about controlled growth and environmental protection. While Malibu leaders remain committed to preserving the community's semirural roots, they recognize the need to address water quality concerns related to leaky septic tanks. The proposed sewer line would serve existing homes and businesses in the burn zone, with measures in place to prevent high-density development. The city faces challenges in determining where to treat the waste, who will pay for the project, and how to manage waste during the construction period.</p>
