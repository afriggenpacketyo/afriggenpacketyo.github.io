          <h2>King Charles' Christmas Tradition Threatened by Pheasant Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 04:00:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles is reportedly displeased by a potential pheasant shortage at Sandringham Estate, which could disrupt the royal family's cherished Christmas shooting tradition. The shortage may force the cancellation of the traditional Boxing Day shoot, a central part of the royal family's holiday plans. The king has historically opposed importing birds, preferring to maintain the estate's game population, but this eco-friendly approach has not been successful this year. Some suggest this change could allow the king to prioritize reconciliation with Prince Harry, while others note the king's willingness to adapt traditions, as demonstrated by his unconventional Christmas speech location.</p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has been excluded from England's squad for their World Cup qualifier against Andorra on Saturday. Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher and Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins are also absent, with Watkins returning home due to a minor injury. Head coach Thomas Tuchel mentioned that Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting his omission is related to fitness concerns. Saka, who has 43 caps for England, has not yet played under Tuchel, and it remains uncertain if he will feature in the friendly against Senegal on June 10.</p>

The focus on personal responsibility and self-improvement has distracted from the impact of public policy, infrastructure, and community on health outcomes. In places where people live longer and healthier lives, such as Japan and South Korea, healthy living is normalized by government and culture. Achieving longevity requires collective responsibility, supporting policies that prioritize nutritious food, active cities, clean air, preventive healthcare, and public services.</p>
