          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a major hurricane, is currently located north of the Caribbean and its path is being closely monitored. Meteorologists are considering the possibility of the Fujiwhara effect, a rare phenomenon where two storms merge or become entangled, if Humberto interacts with another developing system in the western Atlantic. While the developing system appears weaker, the interaction could alter their paths, though likely only slightly. South Carolina had declared a state of emergency in preparation for potential impacts from the storm system. This article summarizes the potential path and effects of Hurricane Humberto and a second developing system. Optimism remains relatively high due to the lack of predicted direct landfall. </p>

          <p>President Trump posted a cartoon on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, continuing his criticism of Powell's cautious approach to cutting interest rates. The image, possibly AI-generated, shows Trump shouting "YOU'RE FIRED!" at Powell. Trump has previously attempted to fire Fed officials, but a recent Supreme Court decision suggests the president lacks the authority to do so at will. Despite Trump's threats, financial markets have remained largely unaffected, though economists believe firing Powell could raise long-term interest rates due to concerns about the Fed's independence. This article outlines Trump's continued attacks on Powell and the potential implications for the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has intensified into a Category 5 hurricane, posing a potential threat to the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda. The storm is expected to remain a major hurricane for several days, with swells likely causing life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast beginning Monday. Forecasters are also monitoring a second storm system in the northeast Caribbean, expected to bring heavy rainfall to Cuba and the Bahamas, and potentially approach the southeastern U.S. coast early next week.
