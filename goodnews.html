          <p>New York lawmakers passed a $254 billion budget, which includes benefits for legislators and residents. Lawmakers collected long overdue paychecks after a five-week budget lapse.

It also assists online shoppers with transparent refund policies and regulates "buy now, pay later" companies. The budget addresses corrections officer staffing shortages and continues a crackdown on artificial intelligence, requiring A.I. chatbots to detect suicidal thoughts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial planning expert Ric Edelman argues that the classic 60-40 market portfolio is no longer viable due to increasing longevity and breakthroughs in health and science. Edelman suggests that investors need to allocate a higher percentage of their portfolios to equities, recommending 70% to 80% for those who want to avoid outliving their savings. With Americans living longer, the traditional portfolio cannot provide enough money for an extended lifespan. Edelman emphasizes the implications of humans living to 100 and beyond, driven by advances in technology and biotech.</p>

          <p>A federal judge appeared ready to temporarily block the Trump administration's sweeping overhaul of the federal government. The judge asserted that Supreme Court precedent makes clear that while the president has the authority to seek changes at agencies, he must do so lawfully. Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order to pause further implementation of the administration's planned mass layoffs. The judge indicated that a temporary restraining order was likely necessary "to protect the power of the legislative branch." This situation is overall positive.</p>
