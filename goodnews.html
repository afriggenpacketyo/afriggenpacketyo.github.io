          <p>Global mining and trading firm Glencore has concluded its review and decided to maintain its primary stock market listing in London, providing a significant boost to the London Stock Exchange. The company determined that a move to New York would not create additional value for shareholders at this time, despite a trend of other major firms leaving London for higher U.S. valuations. This decision comes as Glencore reported a first-half net loss of $655 million, nearly triple the previous year, citing lower commodity prices and tariff uncertainties. The company has initiated a $1 billion cost-cutting program to address the financial downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

The announcement from organizers and Benn's promoter comes after a previously agreed-upon September date was cancelled due to concerns about Eubank's readiness.

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk reported a 67% increase in sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, in the second quarter, though this figure fell slightly short of analyst expectations. The company is facing challenges from increased competition, disappointing trial results for a new obesity drug, and pressure from the U.S. government to lower prescription drug prices. In response to recent stock price declines, Novo Nordisk has announced plans to implement cost-cutting measures and enhance its commercial focus. The company has reiterated its full-year financial outlook despite slashing its U.S. sales growth forecast for Wegovy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis by JPMorgan, HSBC is expected to maintain the highest dividend yield among banks in the Greater China region, projecting shareholder returns of 9% to 11% this year. The forecast follows HSBC's announcement of a 10 US cent per share second-quarter dividend and a new $3 billion stock buyback program. JPMorgan analysts raised their price target for HSBC's stock, suggesting it could reach HK$122 by the end of 2026. The report indicates that HSBC's strong capital buffer will protect its dividend payments from potential impairments related to its stake in China's Bank of Communications.

          <p>In a significant strategic shift, U.S. artificial intelligence leader OpenAI has launched two new open-source AI models, its first such release since 2019. The models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, are described by CEO Sam Altman as being among the best and most usable open models available. This move is widely seen as a direct challenge to the recent global rise of Chinese open-source models, such as Alibaba's Qwen family. The release signals OpenAI's return to its roots and intensifies the competition in the open-source AI landscape, although analysts note China still leads in the sheer number of models on the market.</p>

          <p>China's nationwide campaign to resolve risky local government debt has achieved its first major success, with the Inner Mongolia autonomous region being removed from a key high-debt watchlist. The region was one of 12 province-level jurisdictions flagged by Beijing for financial risks, which had previously forced it to cancel major infrastructure projects like a new subway system. This development signals progress in China's two-year plan, initiated in 2023, to restructure and control the massive debts accumulated by local governments through off-balance-sheet financing vehicles. Local authorities are now tasked with consolidating this progress and continuing debt resolution efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Transitioning from Other Sports to the NFL is Difficult</h2>

          <p>Using Welsh star Louis Rees-Zammit's recent decision to end his NFL pursuit and return to rugby, this article analyzes the immense challenges crossover athletes face. A primary obstacle is the complexity of the NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult to learn than law books. Another major factor is the 'planet theory,' which posits that for skill positions like running back, there is a vast pool of athletically gifted players, making it hard for newcomers to stand out. Unlike linemen, whose rare size is a premium, skill players must possess unparalleled athleticism and rapidly develop a high 'football IQ' to succeed.</p>

          <h2>China Increases Coffee Imports from Africa to Meet Surging Domestic Demand</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is actively strengthening its coffee supply chains from Africa to satisfy a booming domestic market, a strategy that also aligns with its goal of securing diverse overseas resources. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are leading this initiative, signing agreements in top coffee-producing nations such as Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to invest in development and procure large quantities of beans. This push leverages a zero-tariff policy for many African nations and provides an alternative market amid U.S. tariff uncertainties. The strategy reflects China's broader effort to lock in supplies for various commodities to meet the demands of its growing consumer class.</p>

He stated that while he expects them to "swap paint again" after a minor collision in Canada, he is positive they will not deliberately run each other off the track.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers player Max Muncy made a powerful return from a knee injury, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs in a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy's performance provided a much-needed spark for the Dodgers' lineup, which had entered a deep slump during the month he was sidelined. The slugger had initially feared his July 2 injury was season-ending but recovered faster than expected. His successful comeback, along with strong offensive contributions from other previously slumping teammates, provided a significant boost for the team as it heads into the final stretch of the season.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks continued their strong performance, securing a 100-91 victory over a surging Indiana Fever team that was playing without its injured star, Caitlin Clark. The win marks the Sparks' seventh in their last eight games, a streak fueled by the team's return to full health after more than a year of roster instability. Guards Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson led the Sparks with 25 points each, while the team's defense was bolstered by the return of Cameron Brink, who recorded five blocks.

In exchange, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, a deal that strengthens the network's content offerings ahead of its planned direct-to-consumer service launch. The agreement, which still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, marks a major strategic partnership between the two sports media giants. This framework concludes nearly five years of discussions and positions ESPN to further solidify its market dominance by integrating more of the NFL's valuable and popular programming.</p>
