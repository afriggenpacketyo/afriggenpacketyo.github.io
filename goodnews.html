          <p>Marvel Studios has seen a significant box office rebound with its latest film, “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” which earned $118 million in the U.S. and Canada during its opening weekend. This strong debut, exceeding pre-release expectations, marks a welcome success for Disney and Marvel after a series of underperforming superhero films. The movie, which is the first "Fantastic Four" adaptation under Disney's ownership, received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, with an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The performance suggests the Marvel brand remains powerful when supported by a well-received film, providing a much-needed boost for the franchise.</p>

          <p>Preparations are in progress to refit a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, donated by the Qatari royal family, for President Trump's use as Air Force One. The aircraft, valued at $400 million, will require extensive and costly renovations to meet security and operational standards before it can be put into service. The donation has raised concerns about potential violations of the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clause, which prohibits presidents from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional consent. A Democratic congressman has called for an investigation into the matter, while the administration has defended the acceptance of the plane as a "very nice gesture."</p>

          <h2>US and China Expected to Extend Tariff Truce for an Additional 90 Days</h2>

          <p>Sources from both Beijing and Washington indicate that the United States and China are set to extend their current tariff pause for another 90 days during trade talks in Stockholm. The original 90-day suspension of most retaliatory tariffs was due to expire on August 12. While the extension signals a commitment to de-escalation, insiders do not anticipate major breakthroughs on specific sticking points like industrial overcapacity. Instead, the talks are expected to focus on clarifying positions, with the Chinese delegation reportedly planning to press the U.S. on its criteria for lifting fentanyl-related tariffs imposed earlier this year.

          <p>In a remarkable incident in the Indian state of Bihar, a one-year-old boy reportedly killed a cobra by biting it after the snake had coiled around his hands. The child, named Govinda, was playing at home when the encounter occurred. According to his family, he bit the snake before anyone could intervene, killing it instantly.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek have shown significant boosts in employee happiness, and it's not just due to having an extra day off. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a major factor is that the compressed schedule forces workers and teams to become more effective, cutting out busywork and streamlining processes. This heightened sense of productivity and feeling on top of their work contributes greatly to overall well-being and job satisfaction. The shift also fosters a stronger sense of teamwork and accountability, as colleagues collaborate to achieve shared efficiency goals.</p>

          <p>An estimated £274 million in government-allocated Child Trust Funds (CTFs) belonging to disadvantaged young people in the UK has gone unclaimed, according to charity The Share Foundation. These tax-free savings accounts were set up for children born between September 2002 and January 2011, with initial government contributions. Many of these accounts, now worth an average of £2,000 each, were automatically allocated by HMRC and remain dormant. The charity is calling for a new automatic release mechanism to ensure the funds are paid out when holders turn 21, preventing nearly £1 billion from being left unclaimed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Travel Expert Shares Seven Common Phrases to Avoid Sounding Like an "Obnoxious American" Abroad</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A travel writer with experience in 70 countries outlines several phrases that American tourists should avoid to be more respectful and culturally aware. These include asking for prices in U.S. dollars, commenting on how "cheap" things are, and assuming other countries are divided into states. The expert also advises against seeking out American chain restaurants like Starbucks instead of supporting local businesses. Other faux pas include complimenting someone's English in a country where it's a primary language and referring to a destination as a "third-world country," which can come across as judgmental and ignorant of local context.</p>
