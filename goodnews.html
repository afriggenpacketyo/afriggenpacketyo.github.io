          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The attack, a response to the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, did not result in any casualties. President Trump stated that the U.S. had prior warning of the Iranian strike, and Qatari authorities confirmed the missiles were intercepted. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed responsibility, stating the attack targeted the U.S. base with a "devastating and powerful missile."</p>

          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save ¬£5 billion a year by 2030. The welfare reform bill includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The reasoned amendment cites concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers have voluntarily agreed to speed up and reduce prior authorizations, a process that is often a major pain point for patients and providers. Dozens of plans under large insurers such as CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Humana, Elevance Health and Blue Cross Blue Shield committed to a series of actions that aim to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce the administrative burden on providers. Insurers will implement the changes across markets, including commercial coverage and certain Medicare and Medicaid plans, benefiting 257 million Americans.</p>
