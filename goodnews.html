          <h2>US Sees Significant Drop in Violent Crime Rates After Pandemic Spike</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article reports that the United States is experiencing a significant decrease in violent crime rates, mirroring a sharp increase during the pandemic. FBI data indicates that murder rates fell by nearly 12% year-over-year in 2023, with preliminary 2025 data suggesting further declines, potentially reaching historic lows. The decrease is attributed to the easing of pandemic-related stressors, such as school closures and strained social services, as well as targeted government initiatives like community violence interruption programs. Despite the positive trends, public perception lags, with many Americans still believing crime is on the rise, highlighting a disconnect between reality and perceived safety. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump on Friday cleared the merger of U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, after the Japanese steelmaker's previous bid to acquire its U.S. rival had been blocked on national security grounds. U.S. Steel shares surged more than 20% to close at $52.01 per share after Trump's announcement. Trump said he would hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30. </p>

Marine biologists from the Keys Marine Laboratory of the University of South Florida (USF) partnered with scientists from Tampa’s Florida Aquarium to develop a large-scale restoration project. The corals are acclimatizing in temperature-regulated seawater beds in Long Key. </p>

          <p>Yara Haridy, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago, likes to stun people by telling them that our skeletons evolved from a jawless fish. They find that the sensitivity of our teeth (which causes them to ache and zing when confronted with an icy treat or a dentist's drill) can be traced back to the exoskeletons of those ancient, armored fish. These results explained why we get toothaches. </p>
