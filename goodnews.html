          <p>A 23-year-old man, Anthony Thomas Reyes, was apprehended by the Secret Service after attempting to scale the wall at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Reyes reportedly told law enforcement that he intended to "spread the gospel" to Trump and marry his teenage granddaughter. This was not Reyes' first attempt to trespass at Mar-a-Lago, as he had previously been warned for trespassing on New Year's Eve. The Secret Service detained him without incident, and he was charged with occupied trespassing by the Palm Beach Police Department.</p>

          <p>Blake Lively is withdrawing two claims of emotional distress in her lawsuit against Justin Baldoni, while Baldoni's lawyer seeks access to Lively's medical and mental health records. Lively's lawyers accuse Baldoni's counsel of a "press stunt," stating they are streamlining the case for trial, but the judge has ruled that the dismissal must be either with or without prejudice. Lively initially filed a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint against Baldoni, alleging a smear campaign after she reported on-set sexual harassment. Lively had sought to dismiss a defamation countersuit from Baldoni, citing a California law against weaponizing defamation lawsuits against those who have spoken out about sexual harassment.</p>

The storm system is bringing heavier rains farther inland, and the Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for San Bernardino County.</p>

This project reflects China's efforts to export agricultural technology to emerging markets, particularly in the Middle East.
