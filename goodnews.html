        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence to manage the complexities of global trade, particularly in response to tariffs. Companies are deploying AI tools to visualize supply chains, assess the impact of tariffs, and make informed decisions about adjustments to sourcing and pricing. Salesforce has developed an AI agent that processes changes to the U.S. customs system, while Kinaxis uses machine learning to simulate the impact of tariffs on different parts and materials. While AI is not a 'silver bullet,' it enhances trade policy by transforming global trade challenges into data-driven advantages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government's child poverty strategy, initially expected in the spring, has been delayed, with a spokesperson stating it will be published later in the year, potentially in the autumn alongside the Budget. The Child Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, is evaluating measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. While the SNP has criticized the delay, accusing Labour of prioritizing imitating Nigel Farage over tackling child poverty, some charities believe the delay could allow for a more substantial and effective strategy to be developed. The government maintains its commitment to addressing the structural causes of child poverty.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing trend of "quiet quitting" among Japan's Gen Z, who are increasingly prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, admit to doing the bare minimum at their jobs to have more "me time." Experts suggest this shift is influenced by witnessing their parents' sacrifices for companies and a desire for a more balanced life, especially after the pandemic prompted a reevaluation of priorities. The article highlights that this change could lead to happier individuals and potentially boost the economy as young people spend more on leisure activities.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, but the victory came at a cost to their already strained pitching staff. A rain delay limited starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw to just two innings, and the lengthy game forced the bullpen to cover 11 innings. Despite holding a lead, closer Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth, but Teoscar Hern√°ndez's RBI double in the 13th inning secured the win. The article underscores the challenges the Dodgers face navigating a tough schedule with a depleted pitching rotation.</p>

          <p>This article explores the unique relationship between local players and their fans, using the example of Brighton's Lewis Dunk, who expressed his desire to remain a "one-club man." It discusses the pressures and expectations placed on local players, who are often seen as representing their community. While fans may idealize the notion of players spending their entire careers with their boyhood clubs, the reality is often different, with players sometimes sacrificing loyalty for opportunities at bigger clubs. The article balances the benefits of playing for a local club with the potential downsides of increased pressure and scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to make it available at 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on consumers. The reserve rice is expected to be available in stores as early as June. The move comes amid criticism that the government has failed to curb a spike in rice prices, which has hurt households as inflation outpaces wage growth.

This endorsement follows a review of the buyout plan by federal agencies, despite previous concerns about national security risks. Both steelmakers welcomed the decision, with Nippon Steel emphasizing its commitment to protecting American workers and the steel industry. The potential acquisition had been a point of contention during the U.S. presidential election, with Trump initially opposing Japanese ownership.</p>

An increase in yuan-denominated trades and investments would benefit Hong Kong's financial sector, especially amid strengthening ties between China and oil-rich Qatar.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter on May 1 as it approached for landing, leading to two commercial jets aborting their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact, attributed to a temporary antenna issue, caused confusion for air traffic controllers who lacked a confident fix on the helicopter's location. While the Army maintains the helicopter followed its approved flight path, the incident has raised concerns about close calls between military aircraft and commercial planes near the airport, especially after a fatal midair collision earlier this year. The NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through the media before providing it directly to the agency.</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Jane Austen Wrecked My Life," a warm romance film about Agathe, a lonely bookshop clerk in Paris who longs for a Darcy-like love. After her friend submits her writing to the Jane Austen Residency, she meets Oliver, a descendant of Jane Austen, leading to an unexpected connection. The film, directed by Laura Piani, is praised for its excellent casting, particularly Camille Rutherford as Agathe and Charlie Anson as Oliver. The movie romanticizes literature, writing, and poetry as much as romantic relationships, portraying writing as a means for Agathe to overcome past traumas and embrace new opportunities.</p>

          <p>Mexican music star Juli√≥n √Ålvarez's sold-out concert at AT&T Stadium in Arlington has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances that prevented him from entering the U.S. in time for the event, according to a statement from CMN and Copar Music. About 50,000 tickets had been sold for the show. √Ålvarez expressed his disappointment on Instagram, attributing the postponement to the cancellation of his work visa. In 2017, √Ålvarez's U.S. work visa was revoked due to alleged ties to a drug trafficker, but he regained his visa in 2025 after being removed from the sanctions list in 2022.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Supermarkets Offer Cheaper Foreign-Grown Rice Amid Rising Domestic Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 23:19:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Faced with record-high rice prices, Japanese supermarket operators are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at its stores on June 6, priced approximately 15 percent lower than domestically-grown rice. Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen strong demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest in more affordable rice options, as the average price of domestic rice has nearly doubled compared to the previous year due to a poor harvest and increased demand.</p>

          <p>Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, stated that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance after holding trade talks with U.S. officials. He expressed hope for an agreement next month, emphasizing trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security. The endorsement of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel by Trump was noted as a symbolic development. Akazawa reiterated Japan's call for the removal of additional tariffs, but acknowledged the potential for compromise given the U.S. administration's firm stance.</p>
