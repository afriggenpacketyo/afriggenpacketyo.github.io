          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 06:07:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, has led to soaring prices and supply shortages. Japanese exports of green tea have quadrupled in a decade, with prices for the raw tea leaves used for matcha jumping 170% at a recent auction. The surge in demand is straining Japan's aging farming communities and production capabilities, leading retailers to ration supplies and major distributors like Ito En to create new divisions to manage the intense competition for the popular green powder.</p>

          <p>In a rare contract for the North American market, Beijing-based CAS Space has successfully launched two tiny satellites for ThumbSat, a startup from Tijuana, Mexico. The 'femtosatellites,' each weighing less than 100 grams, represent Mexico's first commercial mission to low Earth orbit and aim to prove the viability of smaller, more accessible satellite technology. This mission is being hailed as a milestone for China's efforts to expand its role in the global commercial launch market, showcasing its balance of cost and reliability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that the historical struggle of Black Americans against systemic racism offers a crucial framework for understanding and combating the rise of fascism today. Drawing on the analysis of author Toni Morrison, it argues that American racism is a precursor to fascism and that the enduring tools of Black resistance—including profound belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of protest, and deep-seated faith—provide a powerful model for defending democracy against current authoritarian threats. The author suggests this history teaches resilience and hope in the face of seemingly impossible odds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Britain experiences hotter summers, the use of home air conditioning is rising, sparking a debate about its consequences. While providing comfort and improving productivity, air conditioners contribute to climate change through potent hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants and add to high electricity bills for consumers. Experts advise purchasing energy-efficient models and ensuring proper disposal to mitigate environmental harm, acknowledging that in a warming world, cooling is increasingly becoming a necessity rather than a luxury for many households.</p>

          <h2>Falling Mortgage Rates Prompt Debate on Whether to Buy a Home Now or Wait</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 05:22:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. mortgage rates for 30-year loans falling to around 6.5% and housing inventory increasing, prospective homebuyers face a difficult decision. Some may be tempted to wait for rates to drop further, but market experts caution against trying to time the market perfectly. They argue that falling rates often lead to increased buyer competition and higher home prices, potentially negating any savings. The prevailing advice is to focus on purchasing a home that fits one's current budget and needs, with the option to refinance later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a significant meeting, signaling a thaw in relations. Xi emphasized that the two nations should be partners, not rivals, while Modi noted an 'atmosphere of peace and stability' between them. This meeting, Modi's first in China in seven years, occurs as both countries face trade pressures from the United States, providing a shared incentive to strengthen their bilateral ties and resolve long-standing border tensions.</p>

          <p>This week marks ten years since former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, 'wir schaffen das' ('we can do it'), as she opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees. The 2015 decision profoundly reshaped German society, culture, and politics, and a decade later, the nation continues to grapple with its legacy. The anniversary has prompted widespread reflection on both the successes in integration, such as employment rates among refugees, and the persistent challenges that continue to fuel political debate.</p>

          <p>In a novel approach to wildlife management, biologists near the California-Oregon border are using drones to haze gray wolves away from livestock. The drones are equipped with speakers that blast sounds like the AC/DC song 'Thunderstruck,' movie dialogue, and live human voices to scare the predators. This non-lethal method is part of an ongoing experiment to reduce wolf-rancher conflicts as wolf populations recover, offering a creative and potentially effective tool for promoting coexistence between humans and wildlife.</p>
