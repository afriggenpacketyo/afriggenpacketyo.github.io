          <p>A new tax law proposed by President Trump, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," introduces significant changes to the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption that could benefit startup founders and early investors. The bill increases the capital gains tax exclusion cap from $10 million to $15 million and raises the qualifying gross assets limit for companies to $75 million. These adjustments are designed to make forming a C corporation more attractive for fast-growing ventures, potentially stimulating early-stage investment and providing more flexibility for founders planning an exit strategy.

          <p>For savers looking to protect their money from inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer competitive returns. While national average rates for CDs remain modest, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some short-term accounts yielding over 4% APY. The article explains that due to an inverted yield curve, shorter-term CDs of around one year are currently offering better rates than longer-term ones. To secure the best returns, consumers are advised to compare offers from online banks, which typically have lower overhead costs and can offer more competitive rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 09:27:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners with significant equity may find home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to be affordable borrowing options in the current high-interest-rate environment. Average rates for these products are considerably lower than those for personal loans and credit cards, with 10-year home equity loans averaging around 8.36% and HELOCs near 7.89%. The article distinguishes between the two, noting that home equity loans provide a lump sum at a fixed rate, while HELOCs offer a variable-rate revolving line of credit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major policy announcement, UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has pledged that a future Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on the purchase of main homes. The surprise declaration, made at the party's conference, is aimed at boosting homeownership and improving social mobility for millions. The plan would apply to primary residences in England and Northern Ireland, with the estimated £9 billion cost to be funded through savings from the welfare budget and foreign aid. The move sets a clear dividing line with the current Labour government.</p>

This solidarity has been demonstrated through joint public actions, such as NWSL players wearing shirts to support the WNBPA's contract negotiations, and behind-the-scenes cooperation on educational programs and political advocacy. By working together, the two unions are amplifying their individual efforts to secure fair pay, better working conditions, and greater respect for female athletes in the face of underinvestment and corporate interests.</p>

          <h2>Book Review Explores Potential Fixes for Baseball While Celebrating Its Traditions</h2>

          <p>A review of sportswriter Jane Leavy's new book, "Make Me Commissioner," delves into her proposals for improving the game of baseball for modern audiences while maintaining its core appeal. The book engages in a "spitballing" session with various figures from the sport to address its lagging pace and over-reliance on analytics. While Leavy warns that the sport must adapt to survive, the review concludes that the book is less a clinical prescription for rule changes and more a celebration of baseball's rich storytelling tradition and quirky character.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan's Taliban foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is set to visit New Delhi for discussions on counterterrorism, trade, and humanitarian aid, marking a significant step in the relationship between the two nations. Although India does not formally recognize the Taliban regime, this engagement is viewed as a strategic pivot for both sides. The visit allows the Taliban to expand its diplomatic footprint beyond Pakistan and China, while India seeks to regain strategic space and influence in Afghanistan, particularly as the Taliban's ties with Pakistan have soured.</p>

          <p>Amazon is introducing prescription drug kiosks at some of its One Medical primary-care clinics in Los Angeles, a move that could further disrupt the traditional pharmacy industry. These vending machine-style kiosks, operated by Amazon Pharmacy, are designed to dispense hundreds of common medications like antibiotics and inhalers within minutes of a patient's doctor visit. The initiative aims to improve convenience and reduce the number of prescriptions that go unfilled by bringing the pharmacy directly to the point of care, addressing a key barrier for patients.</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisors Highlight Tax Benefits of Qualified Charitable Distributions for Retirees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 08:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees looking to make charitable donations can maximize their tax benefits by using a strategy known as qualified charitable distributions (QCDs). This allows individuals aged 70½ or older to transfer up to $108,000 directly from a pretax IRA to a charity in 2025. The key advantage is that the distributed amount is excluded from the donor's adjusted gross income, which is more beneficial than a standard deduction and can help avoid higher Medicare premiums. This move can also be used to satisfy required minimum distributions (RMDs). (not investment advice)</p>
