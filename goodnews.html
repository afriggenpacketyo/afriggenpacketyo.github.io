          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth uncrewed test flight of Starship, achieving orbit but encountering issues after entering its suborbital trajectory. An apparent propellant leak led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin. Consequently, SpaceX lost control, and the vehicle re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a non-ideal angle, leading to its expected disintegration over the Indian Ocean. Despite the "rapid unscheduled disassembly," SpaceX views the test as a learning opportunity to improve Starship's reliability for future missions aimed at making life multiplanetary.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced his disapproval of the domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House, which was heavily supported by President Trump. Musk stated that the bill's high price tag increases the budget deficit, undermining the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The legislation, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," includes extensions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increased border security spending. Musk, who previously reduced his involvement in government, expressed concern that the bill prioritizes size over fiscal responsibility.</p>
