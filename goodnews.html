          <p>The NFL's finance committee has approved the sale of a 2.35% stake in the Chicago Bears, establishing a new league record valuation of $8.9 billion for the franchise. The stake, previously held by the estate of the late Andrew McKenna, was sold to the team's existing majority owners, the McCaskey and Ryan families. This valuation significantly surpasses the team's estimated worth from a year ago and reflects the soaring value of NFL teams, even as the Bears continue to explore options for a new stadium to replace the aging Soldier Field.</p>

          <p>In a challenging economic climate with high interest rates, managing multiple debts has become increasingly difficult for many borrowers. This article outlines several structured strategies to tackle debt, including the "debt snowball" method, which focuses on paying off the smallest balances first for psychological motivation, and the "debt avalanche" method, which targets high-interest debts to save money. Other viable options discussed are consolidating debts with a personal loan, using a 0% APR balance transfer credit card, or seeking professional help through a debt management plan.

          <p>Doctors and public health officials are pushing back against a Trump administration announcement that suggested pregnant women should "tough it out" and avoid acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. Medical experts emphasize that untreated high fevers during pregnancy can pose serious risks to fetal development, including cardiac and central nervous system abnormalities. They reaffirm that acetaminophen remains the safest over-the-counter option for pain and fever relief during pregnancy, and that avoiding it when medically necessary could lead to more harm for both mother and baby.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, borrowing costs for home equity products have decreased, making them more attractive for homeowners. A comparison of a $100,000 loan shows that a home equity line of credit (HELOC) currently has slightly lower monthly payments than a traditional home equity loan due to its variable interest rate. However, the article advises homeowners to weigh the long-term stability of a fixed-rate home equity loan against the potential for further rate reductions with a variable-rate HELOC.

          <p>Ukraine has significantly expanded its domestic weapons manufacturing, now producing millions of drones annually to execute a new strategic campaign against Russia. This strategy focuses on long-range attacks deep inside Russian territory, specifically targeting oil refineries, pipelines, and other critical economic assets to disrupt the funding of Russia's war effort. By developing its own technology, including cruise and ballistic missiles, Ukraine aims to apply its own form of economic sanctions, a move that has reportedly already created fuel shortages within Russia.</p>
