          <p>A SpaceX capsule carrying the four astronauts of NASA's Crew-10 mission has successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, concluding a nearly five-month stay on the International Space Station. The crew, consisting of two NASA astronauts, one JAXA astronaut, and a Roscosmos cosmonaut, conducted over 200 science experiments aimed at preparing for future deep-space exploration. This mission was the 12th crewed flight by SpaceX for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which continues to provide U.S. access to the station. Their replacements, the Crew-11 mission, had already arrived at the ISS a week prior.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea dismantling some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the inter-Korean border, signaling a potential de-escalation of tensions. This action follows South Korea's own removal of speakers earlier in the week, a move initiated by the new liberal government in Seoul to improve relations. The two nations had been engaged in a Cold War-style psychological warfare campaign, with the South broadcasting K-pop and news and the North responding with disruptive sounds. This recent thaw comes after a period of heightened animosity under South Korea's previous conservative administration.</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, has been redeveloped into a luxury apartment building called The Hartby at a cost of over $104 million. The former site of St. John's College, which had been deteriorating for decades, was converted into a 205-unit complex featuring studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments. Developers preserved original architectural elements like exposed brick and arched windows while adding modern amenities. A portion of the units are designated for affordable housing, and the project has been embraced by the local community for revitalizing the historic landmark.</p>

          <p>Haley Amaya, a 27-year-old model and dancer born in Los Angeles to a Honduran immigrant mother, is working to preserve her cultural heritage by teaching traditional dance. She founded the Cinco Estrellas ballet group, offering free folkloric dance classes to children in the MacArthur Park area, a community heavily impacted by recent immigration raids. Growing up, art provided Amaya an escape from a dangerous neighborhood and a way to connect with her identity. Now, she balances a successful modeling career with her role as a cultural ambassador, using her platform to empower a new generation and give back to her community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who originated the widely cited "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, now suggests that a higher rate is feasible for today's retirees. His updated research, which incorporates a more diversified portfolio including small-cap and international stocks, indicates a safe initial withdrawal rate of 4.7% is possible. Bengen argues that many retirees are overly conservative and could be spending more to enjoy their retirement, suggesting that with proper strategy, a rate around 5.25% to 5.5% could be appropriate for current retirees, a significant increase from his original guideline.

          <p>A new museum exhibition is celebrating the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most famous and successful flower painters of her time, surpassing even Rembrandt and Vermeer in contemporary fame. Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and botanist, Ruysch had unique access to exotic specimens, which she depicted with scientific precision and artistic genius. Despite the challenges faced by women artists, she achieved international acclaim and financial success. The article explores her unique style, which combined aesthetic beauty with an undercurrent of nature's darker, more monstrous aspects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki asserts that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle can be explained by simple probability and environmental factors, not supernatural causes. He argues that the high volume of air and sea traffic in the area means that, on a percentage basis, the number of disappearances is no different than any other well-traveled part of the ocean. This view is supported by institutions like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and Lloyd's of London. NOAA points to factors like the volatile Gulf Stream, complex navigation, and potential magnetic anomalies as logical explanations for the incidents.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins argues that parents who are constantly on their phones are modeling behavior that can hinder their children's development and future success. She advises that parents cannot expect their kids to have a healthy relationship with technology if they themselves are not modeling it. Excessive screen time in children is linked to poor sleep, mental health issues, and shortened attention spans. Robbins suggests parents make a conscious effort to put their phones away, especially at home, and to get curious about their children's online activities rather than being judgmental.</p>

          <p>According to a 2025 Charles Schwab survey, Americans believe a net worth of $2.3 million is required to be considered wealthy, a decrease from last year's $2.5 million benchmark. However, the amount varies significantly by region, with residents in the West citing a need for $3 million, compared to $1.8 million in the South. Despite the lower national figure, nearly two-thirds of respondents feel that achieving wealth is harder now due to inflation and economic uncertainty. The survey also found that the average net worth needed to feel financially "comfortable" is much lower, at $839,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are finding new life by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants such as churches, bowling alleys, and large bookstores. The Dayton Mall in Ohio, for example, sold its former Sears space to a local church, which has drawn thousands of new visitors who then patronize other mall businesses. Industry experts note this trend of subdividing large retail spaces for niche and experiential businesses is boosting foot traffic and creating a "cross-shopping" effect. This diversification is helping enclosed malls, once thought to be dying, to rebound and reposition themselves as community hubs.</p>

          <p>After a concussion from football, a New Jersey teenager named Logan Coleridge experienced months of debilitating headaches, dizziness, and memory problems that therapies could not resolve. When a specialist finally ordered an MRI, doctors discovered the true cause was not the concussion but a rare, underlying condition called an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain. Logan underwent successful surgery to remove the AVM and has since recovered, with his family now advocating for more thorough testing after head injuries. His life has returned to normal, and he is preparing to return to football.</p>

Through meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs, she connected Ames, the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, to large cash deposits made after meetings with a Soviet official. Her crucial work led to Ames's 1994 arrest, stopping a spy who caused immense damage to U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing tons of gold as a byproduct of generating nuclear fusion energy. The theory suggests that neutrons produced during the fusion process could be used to transmute other elements, like mercury, into gold. This would create a valuable revenue stream to help offset the immense cost of developing commercial fusion power. While the idea is scientifically plausible and has intrigued physicists, it remains speculative, as commercial-scale fusion reactors do not yet exist, making this a long-term and ambitious vision.</p>
