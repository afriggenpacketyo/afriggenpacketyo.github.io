          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock in France, the politics of remembrance has gained momentum with three new initiatives attempting to recognize and heal historical injustices. Parliament voted to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer wrongly accused of treason, to the rank of brigadier general. A law was passed to recognize and compensate former returnees from French Indochina after the end of colonial rule in 1954. The Assembly adopted a resolution addressing a "double debt" to Haiti, calling for recognition, repayment, and reparations.

          <p>Dave Ramsey warns that nearly 50% of Americans make a significant Social Security mistake, potentially jeopardizing their retirement security. Ramsey's research indicates that a large percentage of Americans are not saving adequately for retirement, relying heavily on Social Security benefits, which typically replace only 40% of pre-retirement income. He recommends creating a savings benchmark of at least 15% of gross income, having an emergency fund, and eliminating debt to secure a comfortable retirement.
