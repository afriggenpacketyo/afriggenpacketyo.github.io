          <p>Recovery efforts are ongoing across Scotland after Storm Floris, described as the "most damaging summer storm in recent memory," left thousands of homes without electricity. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) has restored power to 50,000 homes but 22,000 still face outages, primarily due to tree-related damage. The storm caused widespread disruption with gusts up to 90mph, leading to canceled trains, flights, and events like the Edinburgh Fringe. Officials expect most power to be restored soon, but some localized outages could extend for several days.</p>

          <p>Chemical companies Chemours, DuPont, and Corteva have agreed to a settlement with the state of New Jersey, committing to pay $875 million over 25 years. The agreement resolves claims related to environmental pollution, particularly from PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to various health issues including cancer. This settlement follows over $11 billion in similar agreements in 2023, as federal regulations and public awareness of PFAS contamination continue to drive litigation. The payments will address damages from the companies' historical operations and other contamination sites across the state.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance, citing effective cost-cutting strategies and strong business performance, which caused its stock to rise. The pharmaceutical company also reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by sales of its Covid products and other key drugs. The updated forecast now projects an adjusted profit between $2.90 and $3.10 per share. This positive outlook comes as the company navigates President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and potential tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates remaining relatively high, savers are weighing whether to choose short-term or long-term options. Currently, short-term CDs are offering slightly better rates than long-term ones, an unusual situation known as an inverted yield curve, which often signals that markets expect interest rates to fall. Financial experts suggest that locking in a long-term CD now could be a wise move to secure a high rate before potential drops. However, the best choice ultimately depends on an individual's financial goals and how soon they will need access to their funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Increased Screenings Lead to More Early-Stage Colon Cancer Detections in Younger Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 10:02:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant rise in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49, which is linked to an increase in screening rates for this age group. The recommended screening age was lowered to 45 in recent years, and screening uptake has since increased by 62% between 2019 and 2023. Experts call this promising news, as finding the cancer at an early stage makes it more than 90% curable. Despite the progress, researchers note that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the restaurant industry reveals that Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, has developed a reputation as an incubator for top executive talent. Numerous leaders at rival chains, including the CEOs of Starbucks, Brinker International, and Cracker Barrel, previously held senior roles within the Yum system. The company's focus on leadership development, massive global scale, and competitive internal environment are cited as key factors. This trend, which traces back to its origins as part of PepsiCo, has made Yum a go-to source for boards seeking proven industry leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A practicing neurologist has outlined four specific foods to avoid to protect brain health, going beyond general advice about processed items. The list includes damaged canned goods due to the risk of botulism, a potent neurotoxin, and certain large tropical reef fish that can carry ciguatoxin. The other foods to avoid are undercooked pork, which can lead to brain cysts from tapeworm larvae, and unpasteurized milk, a source of dangerous pathogens like listeria. The article stresses that these foods pose rare but severe risks of neurological damage, including paralysis, seizures, and even death.</p>

CEO Alex Karp attributed the blowout results to high demand for its artificial intelligence platforms and government contracts focused on efficiency. The company significantly raised its full-year revenue forecast, reflecting strong growth in its U.S. commercial and government sectors. Despite the strong performance, some analysts remain cautious, citing the company's high valuation relative to its earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a significant bid for RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, with the total offer potentially reaching €85 million (£73.8m). The English club believes this is a fair valuation for the Slovenian forward and is confident the player is interested in a move to Old Trafford. Newcastle United is also in contention, having made a competing bid for Sesko. Manchester United's offer is seen as a serious step to secure the player, and the club may be willing to part with current striker Rasmus Hojlund to accommodate the new signing.</p>
