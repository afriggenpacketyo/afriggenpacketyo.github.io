          <p>Karen Read, acquitted in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston cop John O'Keefe, expressed gratitude to her legal team and supporters after the verdict. Her father credited the legal team, composed of lawyers from Boston, New York, and Los Angeles, for securing the not guilty verdict. The defense team included David Yannetti, Alan Jackson, Liza Little, and Robert Alessi. Experts predict the lawyers will see a boost in their careers, potentially representing celebrities and handling high-profile cases. Read, who famously gave numerous interviews after her first trial, may also file lawsuits against the investigators who charged her.</p>

While she may still participate in a vehicle, her granddaughter, Dione Sims, will lead the 2.5-mile walk in her place. Lee previously expressed gratitude for the support she received after being hospitalized, with the event commemorating the 160th anniversary of Juneteenth.

          <p>Dongchoon Circus Troupe, South Korea's last and oldest circus, is celebrating its 100th anniversary. Founded in 1925, Dongchoon once thrived during the golden age of South Korean circuses in the 1960s, but later faced declining audiences due to the rise of television and other forms of entertainment. Park Sae-hwan, the head of the circus, expressed his determination to keep Dongchoon alive, fearing that the country's circus arts would disappear without it. Today, Dongchoon continues to perform acrobatic shows at a seaside tourist area in Ansan, drawing both older and younger generations, with plans to build a circus school to nurture South Korean circus artists.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 23:15:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the US imposes duties on various goods, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty costs. This legal practice involves altering an item's materials or dimensions to fit into a different product classification code. For example, some manufacturers are bundling steel and aluminum elements into final products to qualify for lower duties under Section 232. Companies must balance redesigning products with avoiding fraudulent misrepresentation of product classifications, as illustrated by Ford's case of misclassifying cargo vans. This strategic design approach can significantly reduce duty liability. (not investment advice)</p>

Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary, following approval from President Trump.
