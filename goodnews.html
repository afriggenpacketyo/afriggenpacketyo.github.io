          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies Act, has been introduced in the Senate to require private insurance companies to fully cover all childbirth-related expenses without co-pays or deductibles. This includes prenatal care, ultrasounds, delivery, postpartum care, and mental health treatment. The bill has gained support from both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups, reflecting a rare consensus on the need to alleviate the financial burden of childbirth. The legislation would be funded through modest increases in insurance premiums, averaging around $30 annually per person, and seeks to address concerns about declining birth rates and the high cost of having children in America.</p>

          <p>OpenAI, initially founded as a nonprofit research lab focused on safe AI development, now faces internal and external pressures as it navigates the tension between its original mission and the pursuit of profit. The company's success with ChatGPT has led to increased investor interest and a push to transition to a for-profit model, sparking concerns from former employees, AI experts, and regulators about abandoning its commitment to responsible AI development. Despite internal debates and proposed structural changes, OpenAI continues to expand its AI infrastructure and pursue industry dominance. The central issue revolves around defining and ensuring "safe" and "beneficial" AI in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>

Manchester United, Everton, Nottingham Forest, and Newcastle also showed interest in the England Under-21 player. Champions League football and face-to-face talks with head coach Enzo Maresca were reportedly deciding factors for Delap, who was spotted at Stansted Airport before a medical. The decision remains whether Delap will play for England Under-21s this summer or join his new club for the Club World Cup.</p>

Joe Walsh, the first Alzheimer's patient to receive the treatment, has shown promising results with reduced inflammation. The treatment is part of a larger effort to find new ways to interrupt the cascade of events in the brain that lead to Alzheimer's dementia. Researchers are seeking ways to tamp down the inflammation that accompanies brain changes, especially as the disease progresses, and a clinical trial is scheduled to begin later this year.</p>

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on dark energy, now questions the standard model of cosmology, which he helped establish. Riess's measurements of the universe's expansion rate differ from those extrapolated from the afterglow of the Big Bang, creating a "Hubble tension." While some cosmologists expect the discrepancy to disappear with more data, Riess believes it suggests the standard model may be flawed. If the standard model is overturned, it could change our understanding of the universe's end, potentially challenging the idea of a heat death. </p>
