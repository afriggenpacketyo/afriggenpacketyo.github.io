        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's newly elected President Lee Jae Myung is expected to pursue stable ties with Japan, particularly given regional security challenges and uncertainties arising from U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. Despite Lee's past critical remarks about Japan, experts anticipate a pragmatic approach, especially considering the need for cooperation with the United States and Japan amidst North Korea's nuclear threats and China's assertiveness. Lee acknowledged Japan as an important partner and pledged pragmatic diplomacy. This shift is seen as an attempt to present himself as a realistic leader during turbulent times, and the need for strong regional alliances.</p>

          <p>Private equity bosses at the SuperReturn 2025 conference in Berlin are showing increased optimism about opportunities in Europe, contrasting with sentiments from the previous year, this shift is driven by factors such as falling interest rates and Germany's fiscal package. Blackstone's Vice Chairman Thomas Nides believes that increased political stability in France, Germany, and the U.K. makes investing in Europe a good bet. Digital infrastructure, energy efficiency, and defense were highlighted as key areas for potential growth. The sentiment shift reflects a desire to explore options outside the U.S. amid policy chaos in Washington.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy, caused by the bacteria species Mycobacterium lepromatosis, was present in the Americas for at least a thousand years before European colonization. Researchers analyzed over 800 samples from ancient remains in Canada and Argentina, reconstructing and dating the bacterial genomes. The study indicates that Mycobacterium lepromatosis spread rapidly across the Americas, affecting indigenous populations well before the arrival of Europeans, who introduced a different leprosy-causing bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae. This discovery enhances the understanding of pre-colonial diseases and the complex relationship between pathogens and humans throughout history.</p>
