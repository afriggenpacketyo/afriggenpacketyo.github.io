          <p>Actress Jennifer Aniston recently looked back on her 2005 divorce from Brad Pitt, describing the period as a "vulnerable time" made more difficult by relentless tabloid coverage. In a new interview, she recalled how the public narrative of a "love triangle" with Angelina Jolie was "juicy reading for people" but something she took very personally. Aniston explained that at the time, she lacked the "strong enough constitution" to not get affected by the intense speculation. She reflected on the need to persevere through the painful public ordeal.</p>

          <p>The fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Erin, has formed west of the Cabo Verde islands. Forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict the storm will move west and could intensify into the season's first hurricane later in the week. While it currently poses no immediate threat to the United States, early models suggest it may become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean.

          <p>In The Hundred cricket tournament, 22-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker delivered a standout performance to help Manchester Originals secure a 10-run victory against London Spirit. Baker's impressive opening spell, where he conceded only four runs from his first 10 balls, was crucial in restricting the opposition's chase. Despite a strong innings of 71 from London's David Warner, Baker's disciplined and pacy bowling earned him player of the match honors. Team captain Phil Salt and England great James Anderson both praised the young bowler's exceptional skill and potential.</p>

The agreement will shift the UFC away from its pay-per-view model, with all events streaming on Paramount+ and some major fights simulcast on the CBS broadcast network. UFC CEO Dana White mentioned discussions are underway to potentially host a fight on the White House lawn for the nation's 250th anniversary.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that imported gold will not be subject to tariffs, directly overriding a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs agency had determined that certain gold bars from Switzerland would face a 39% tariff, a move that caused gold futures to hit a record high. Following Trump's declaration on social media, gold prices fell significantly. The Swiss Precious Metals Association had previously warned that the tariffs could negatively disrupt the international flow of physical gold, which is crucial for backing futures market contracts.

          <p>In a hard-fought match at the Cincinnati Open, Britain's Emma Raducanu was edged out by world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set classic that lasted over three hours. Despite the 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 7-6 (7-5) loss, Raducanu's performance was a strong indicator of her return to form and ability to challenge top-tier players. The match showcased her improved resilience and powerful service game, particularly during a grueling 22-minute game in the final set. The performance is seen as a positive sign for Raducanu heading into the upcoming U.S. Open.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to delay the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese imports for another 90 days, pushing the deadline to mid-November. The tariffs were set to revert to their peak levels this week, but the extension follows recent trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Stockholm. This move continues a pattern of unpredictable trade policy, where deadlines and tariff levels have been frequently altered with little notice. The pause prevents an immediate escalation of the trade war, providing temporary relief for businesses affected by the duties. (not investment advice)</p>

At its peak in 2001, AOL had over 30 million subscribers, but that number has dwindled significantly, with fewer than 300,000 Americans reporting a dial-up-only connection in 2023.

Investors reacted to the anticipated drop in global supply by bidding up stock prices, expecting that lithium prices will rise.
