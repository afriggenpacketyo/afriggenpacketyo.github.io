          <p>The England women's football team, the Lionesses, has embraced a new mantra of being 'proper English' to drive their performance at the Euro 2025 tournament. The phrase, signifying fight, tenacity, and being hard to beat, was reinforced after a disappointing opening loss to France. Players say the slogan helped them refocus on their roots and team connection, leading to a convincing 4-0 victory over the Netherlands and reviving their campaign to defend the title.</p>

In reality, majors in fields like nutritional sciences and philosophy currently have lower unemployment rates for recent graduates than finance or computer science. The article notes a rising demand for humanities majors, with firms like BlackRock actively seeking graduates with creative thinking and soft skills, especially in an era of advancing AI.
