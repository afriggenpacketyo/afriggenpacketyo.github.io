        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has nullified the nearly half-billion-dollar penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud case, deeming the amount excessive and a potential violation of constitutional protections against severe punishment. While the court upheld the finding of liability for fraud, it argued the financial harm did not justify such a large award to the state. The ruling keeps non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York, in place, though the panel of judges was divided on the overall merits of the case.</p>

          <p>Chipotle has initiated an autonomous drone delivery service, named "Zipotle," in the Dallas area through a partnership with logistics provider Zipline. The service allows customers to receive their digital orders via small aircraft called Zips, which can deliver food within minutes by hovering and lowering the package to the ground. Initially available to a small number of customers, the program aims to provide faster delivery and keep food fresh, serving locations that are traditionally difficult to access, like parks and backyards.</p>

          <p>The Trent Rockets defeated the Oval Invincibles by six wickets in The Hundred women's cricket competition, keeping their slim chances for qualification alive. Despite a mid-innings wobble while chasing a target of 110, Heather Graham's unbeaten 19 runs guided the Rockets to victory with 16 balls remaining. The Oval Invincibles struggled to build partnerships, with Meg Lanning's 45 being the standout performance in their total of 109-7. Both teams must now win their remaining games to have a chance of advancing.</p>

In corporate news, Meta Platforms has reportedly paused its aggressive hiring of artificial intelligence researchers and engineers, a move described by the company as routine organizational planning rather than a slowdown in its overall AI investment strategy.

          <p>Apple is raising the monthly subscription price for its Apple TV+ streaming service by $3, from $9.99 to $12.99, marking the third increase since its launch in 2019. The price hike follows similar moves by other streaming services and comes amid reports that the platform is losing significant amounts of money despite its growing subscriber base. This strategic shift occurs as Apple also increases its commitment to U.S. manufacturing, potentially looking to bolster revenue from its services division amid external pressures on its core hardware business.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the potential returns on a $25,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) given the current elevated interest rates. While yields have decreased from their 2023 peaks, they remain attractive compared to standard savings accounts, offering fixed, predictable growth without market risk. The potential earnings vary significantly based on the CD's term, ranging from approximately $269 for a 3-month CD to over $5,250 for a 5-year CD, allowing savers to choose based on their financial goals and liquidity needs.

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July, contrary to analysts' expectations of a decline, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. This uptick is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Concurrently, housing inventory rose to its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease price pressure, with the median home price showing only a marginal 0.2% year-over-year increase.

His advocacy comes as national data shows that one-third of public school officials consider traffic near their buildings a threat to students, prompting some districts to install new enforcement cameras.</p>

          <p>This photo essay documents the varied emotional and practical realities of "empty nesters" in the Los Angeles area, challenging the traditional image of a mother mourning her children's departure. Through intimate portraits and interviews, the project reveals a spectrum of experiences, from grief and loneliness to newfound freedom and self-rediscovery. The stories highlight that the "empty nest" is often a fluid state, sometimes repopulated by returning children, and serves as a period of profound transition and re-evaluation of identity, relationships, and life's purpose for parents.</p>

          <p>A recent successful fundraiser for anti-factory farming charities has highlighted the concept of "moral offsetting," where individuals who feel guilty about eating meat can donate money to animal welfare causes instead of changing their diet. Proponents, like the organization FarmKind, argue it's a pragmatic way to fund effective advocacy in a world where veganism remains a niche choice. However, the article also explores the ethical complexities, questioning whether such offsets absolve personal responsibility and trivialize animal suffering, similar to how one wouldn't "offset" abusing a pet with a shelter donation.</p>

The five lessons emphasize having faith in the future, embracing discomfort as a catalyst for growth, seeking deeper spiritual happiness over fleeting pleasures, and understanding that personal well-being is intrinsically linked to serving others. Originating in 19th-century Persia, the Baha'i faith's positive and resilient message was forged through persecution, offering a time-tested framework for finding meaning and joy amid life's challenges.</p>

          <p>In Kiruna, Sweden, the town's historic Lutheran church has been carefully transported three miles from its original location. The 113-year-old wooden structure, built in a style inspired by Sami traditions, had to be moved as part of a massive, multi-year project to relocate the entire town center. The relocation is necessary to avoid unstable ground created by the expansion of a large, nearby iron-ore mine, which is critical to the local economy but threatens the town's original site.</p>
