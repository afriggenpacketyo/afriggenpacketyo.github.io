        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, the most common reasons couples fight include tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone signals contempt, a predictor of divorce, while family arguments reflect unmet needs and value clashes. Uneven chore distribution leads to resentment, and ineffective communication escalates conflicts. Strategies to move past these issues include naming the effect, reassuring each other, acknowledging the invisible load, and using a designated word for time-outs. </p>
