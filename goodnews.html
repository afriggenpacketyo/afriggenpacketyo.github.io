          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump may extend a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which is set to expire on July 9. A spokesperson stated the deadline is not critical and the president could extend it, particularly if trading partners like Japan continue to negotiate in good faith. This comes as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks, aiming to secure concessions on the higher duties imposed by the Trump administration. Japan currently faces a potential combined tariff rate of 24 percent under the proposed scheme. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ecuadorian authorities have recaptured Jos√© Adolfo Mac√≠as, the fugitive drug trafficker known as 'Fito' who is also wanted by the United States. Mac√≠as, leader of the 'Los Choneros' gang, was found hiding in a house in Manta, Ecuador, more than a year after his escape from a Guayaquil prison. His 2024 escape triggered a wave of violence across the nation, including riots, kidnappings, and an armed attack on a live television broadcast, prompting the government to declare war on drug mafias. U.S. prosecutors have indicted him on charges of importing large quantities of cocaine and smuggling firearms.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez are holding their wedding celebration in Venice, Italy, drawing a high-profile crowd of celebrities for events beginning on Thursday. Guests including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Tom Brady were seen arriving, with around 200 people expected to attend the weekend's festivities. The influx of famous personalities has sparked some local protests under the 'No Space for Bezos' campaign, which aligns with broader European concerns about over-tourism and rising living costs. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos, 61, and S√°nchez, 55, who both divorced their previous spouses in 2019.</p>

          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in the fashion industry for decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial responsibilities at the U.S. edition of Vogue. The 75-year-old will retain her powerful positions as Vogue's global editorial director and chief content officer for parent company Cond√© Nast. A new role, head of editorial content for American Vogue, will be created to oversee the U.S. publication, allowing Wintour to focus more on her global and corporate duties. Wintour has been the editor-in-chief of Vogue since 1988, and her influential, often intimidating, leadership style is widely believed to have inspired the character in 'The Devil Wears Prada.'</p>

          <p>A large and bright meteorite, known as a fireball, was witnessed streaking across the sky over Georgia and South Carolina before exploding. NASA reported the meteor, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. It detonated 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, releasing energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT and creating a pressure wave that was heard as a loud boom by residents on the ground. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the rare daylight event, which may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old from Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive a newly approved drug that could potentially cure her life-threatening inherited immune disorder. The condition, APDS, claimed the lives of her mother, grandmother, and other relatives. The drug, leniolisib, is the first targeted treatment for the disorder, which was only identified in 2013 by Cambridge researchers with help from the patient's family. The treatment works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function normally. This milestone represents a remarkable journey from disease discovery to an NHS-approved treatment in just 12 years, offering new hope for affected patients.</p>

The match saw the return of key midfielder Rodri from a long-term injury, whose presence was instrumental in controlling the game.

Foley expressed confidence in the company's ability to manage the tariff impact for the rest of the year. His comments followed a strong earnings report that beat estimates, with the company noting that consumers continue to prioritize flavor and cook at home at rates above pre-pandemic levels.
