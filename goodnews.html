          <p>DoorDash is set to acquire British food delivery firm Deliveroo for $3.9 billion, marking a significant expansion into overseas markets. The deal values Deliveroo at ¬£2.9 billion, with DoorDash offering 180 pence per share, a 44% premium over Deliveroo's closing price on April 4. This acquisition will allow DoorDash to operate in over 40 countries, covering a combined population of over 1 billion people, providing local businesses with essential tools and technology to thrive. DoorDash CEO Tony Xu expressed excitement about the possibilities this merger creates for both companies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The acquisition of Deliveroo by DoorDash exemplifies the diverging fortunes of US and UK stock markets, with DoorDash using its greater financial strength to acquire its UK rival. While both companies began similarly, DoorDash's valuation is now 35 times that of Deliveroo, reflecting a broader trend of companies shunning the London Stock Exchange for US listings due to higher valuations and greater investor appetite. This trend underscores the challenges faced by the UK in retaining its major firms, as US markets offer more attractive opportunities for growth and expansion. BlackRock and JP Morgan have noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering restricting visa applications from nationalities perceived as more likely to overstay their visas and claim asylum, including those from Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. This crackdown aims to address the issue of individuals entering the UK legally on work or study visas and then seeking asylum. Labour's plans to reduce migration include making it a criminal offence to endanger the lives of others at sea, to target small boat crossings, and cutting demand for overseas hires by developing training plans for sectors that are currently reliant on migrant workers. A new immigration white paper is expected to provide further details on these plans.</p>

          <p>Hugo Boss shares experienced a surge after the fashion retailer reported a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales, driven by weaker demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China. Despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainties, the company reiterated its full-year guidance, projecting sales between 4.2 billion euros and 4.4 billion euros. CEO Daniel Grieder noted that global trade tensions have impacted first-quarter demand, leading the company to closely monitor macroeconomic developments. Citi analysts highlighted that any major changes in the external political or economic environment could pose a risk to Hugo Boss's sales performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Labour Day holiday saw a rebound in tourism, with visitor numbers surpassing pre-pandemic levels, but per capita spending remained stagnant, indicating potential deflationary pressure. Improved tourism and retail sales are sending mixed signals amid a trade war with the United States, as the economy relies more on the domestic market. Goldman Sachs noted that per-head tourism revenue remained below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting continued consumption downgrading. The data highlights the challenges China faces in balancing supply-side success with boosting domestic demand.</p>

          <p>The REAL ID Act, enacted in 2005, finally has its deadline implemented, aiming to establish federal standards for state-issued IDs to prevent counterfeiting and verify information. However, the law faced resistance from states citing cost, privacy concerns, and the burden of providing extra documentation. Despite the decentralized approach, millions have yet to apply for REAL ID versions of their licenses. The Trump Administration is now attacking the two-tier system of state licenses, hinting at penalties for jurisdictions that issue licenses to residents without checking immigration status. The Transportation Safety Administration is now auditing compliance, starting with the states it thinks have done the best job.</p>

The companies are adapting by localizing their supply chains, onboarding U.S. sellers, and utilizing local warehouses to mitigate tariff impacts. While prices may increase, experts remain confident that Temu and Shein will continue to offer competitive prices due to their agile supply chains and ability to operate on razor-thin margins. Furthermore, Trump's trade tariffs on China and other trade partners have also affected American retailers and e-commerce sites like Amazon.</p>
