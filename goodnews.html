          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is expected to be called up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia as an injury replacement. The decision is considered controversial because Farrell has not played international rugby for nearly two years and is returning from a recent concussion. His selection by his father, coach Andy Farrell, comes ahead of other match-fit players who have been actively training with their national squads. Despite the debate, Farrell's extensive experience and leadership qualities were cited as key factors in his potential inclusion.</p>

This optimism overshadowed an ADP report showing the first private sector job loss since March 2023, suggesting market sentiment is currently focused on trade stability over immediate labor market health.

          <p>The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is experiencing a dramatic resurgence, with new listing volumes surging to $14 billion in the first half of the year, the strongest start since 2021. This boom is fueled by a confluence of factors, including regulatory support from Beijing, a slower pace of listings in mainland China, and mainland investors seeking opportunities in Hong Kong. High-profile dual listings from Chinese companies are driving the frenzy, positioning Hong Kong to potentially become the world's top destination for IPOs this year. (not investment advice)</p>
