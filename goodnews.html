          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has kept its base rate steady at 4.75%, mirroring the Federal Reserve's decision to hold its target range at 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that there was no urgency to alter US monetary policy, emphasizing the need to monitor data for any inflationary effects from tariffs. This decision marks the third consecutive meeting where the Fed has maintained its interest rate, despite ongoing pressure from President Trump to implement cuts to ease economic funding costs. The Fed's independent monetary policy continues to be a focal point amid trade war dynamics.</p>

Norrie channeled his anger from a previous defeat into a strong performance, dominating his match in just over an hour. Boulter, however, couldn't replicate her previous form on clay, losing to her opponent despite the latter's recent losing streak, marking a mixed day for British players at the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have initiated a public inquiry into the live music industry's business practices, focusing on issues facing consumers.

The inquiry aims to address unfair and anti-competitive conduct, with the DOJ and FTC seeking public comments on the matter. This development comes almost a year after the DOJ and 40 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation, alleging monopolistic practices and calling for the company's breakup.</p>

          <p>Washington state Governor Bob Ferguson has signed a rent control bill into law, setting limits on rent increases and making the state among the first in the nation to provide such protections for tenants. The new law caps rent increases at 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower, and includes single-family homes. The legislation aims to address the state's housing affordability crisis and provide stability for renters. The bill signing was praised by advocates who have long fought for rent stabilization measures to protect vulnerable populations from excessive rent hikes.</p>

          <p>AppLovin's shares experienced a significant surge after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, and announced the sale of its mobile gaming business. The company agreed to sell its mobile gaming division to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash, while also acquiring a 20% ownership stake in Tripledot. While AppLovin's second-quarter sales forecast fell short of analyst expectations, the company's first-quarter net income rose substantially compared to the previous year. The sale will allow AppLovin to focus more on its advertising technology business.</p>

          <p>In an Arizona court, an AI-generated version of a deceased man addressed his killer during sentencing, a move praised by some and criticized by others. Chris Pelkey's family used AI technology to recreate him using voice recordings, videos, and pictures, allowing him to deliver a victim impact statement. The judge appreciated the use of AI, and sentenced the killer to ten and a half years in prison. While supporters believe this is a step into the future, others worry about the ethical implications and potential misuse of AI in legal cases.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares climbed following reports that the Trump administration intends to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," a set of AI chip controls. The proposed rule, which would have restricted exports of advanced AI chips to certain countries, was set to take effect on May 15. The Department of Commerce confirmed the plan, stating that the existing rule is overly complex and would stifle American innovation. AMD CEO Lisa Su has emphasized the importance of balancing national security concerns with maintaining access to chips to boost the American chip industry.</p>
