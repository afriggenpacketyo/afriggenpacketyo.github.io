          <p>Vice President JD Vance spoke at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, emphasizing the Trump administration's growing embrace of cryptocurrency. Vance, a long-time crypto proponent, advocated for the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, viewing them as a "force multiplier" for economic strength. He urged industry involvement in politics to safeguard crypto's future, while criticizing policies that discriminate based on beliefs and promising to reverse strict regulations. The conference also featured other Trump allies, underscoring the administration's increasing alignment with the cryptocurrency sector. Vance's remarks reflect a broader effort to integrate crypto into the mainstream economy. Optimism score is 65. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review found that Heathrow Airport's chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, was unreachable when a power outage forced the airport's closure, affecting 270,000 journeys. Woldbye's bedside phone was on silent, preventing him from being alerted to the crisis, which senior staff addressed by suspending operations. The review concluded that the decision to halt operations was correct for safety and security, despite criticism over the length of the shutdown. Recommendations included a secondary contact method for notifying key personnel during critical incidents. The incident highlighted the need for improved contingency planning.

          <p>Toyota Motor aims to significantly increase its plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales, targeting roughly 20% of its U.S. sales volume by 2030, up from 2.4% last year. This strategy comes amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, in which the company also continues to invest. David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, emphasized the company's commitment to PHEVs and increasing their electric-only range. The planned expansion aligns with potential regulatory changes, including the possible elimination of California's zero-emissions vehicle mandate by President Trump. The company is focused on production capacity and product strength compared to competitors. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are currently serving prison sentences for charges including bank fraud and tax evasion. The Chrisleys were convicted in 2022 for submitting false financial statements to obtain loans and concealing income from the IRS. Trump, in a call with the couple's children, expressed his belief that they received harsh treatment. The pardon follows efforts by their daughter, Savannah, who argued that her parents were unfairly targeted due to their celebrity status.

While Circle didn't provide a specific reason, it's likely driven by venture capital firms seeking liquidity after a period of meager returns and a multiyear drought in IPOs.

          <p>Experts recommend regularly checking and properly disposing of expired medications and supplements to ensure safety and effectiveness. Expiration dates indicate how long a medication is guaranteed to work safely, and using products past this date can lead to reduced potency or bacterial contamination. Proper storage in a cool, dry place, such as a kitchen cabinet, is essential to prevent medications from degrading prematurely. The best disposal method is through medication take-back locations, but if unavailable, mixing medications with coffee grounds or kitty litter and discarding them in household garbage is an alternative. Sunscreen also has an expiration date and should not be used after it expires. Optimism score is 80.</p>
