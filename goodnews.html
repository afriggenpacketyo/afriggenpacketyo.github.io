          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol, holds a significant lead over his rival, Kim Moon Soo. Eurasia Group also predicts an 80% chance of victory for Lee, anticipating a more left-leaning agenda and potential shifts in trade negotiations with the U.S. Goldman Sachs notes similarities between Lee and Kim's goals, but highlights differences in their economic policy platforms, with Lee favoring fiscal support for strategic industries. The Bank of Korea recently cut rates, expecting economic growth to decline, and the South Korean won is anticipated to appreciate against the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan plans to test a domestically developed kamikaze sea drone this month to bolster its naval defenses against growing pressure from mainland China. The "Kuai Chi Project," led by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), aims to evaluate the drone's combat capabilities before mass production begins in 2026. The defense ministry has allocated over US$25 million for the project, with plans to acquire over 200 of these vessels to support coastal assault operations. The attack vessel will feature an AI-enabled targeting system, capable of autonomously striking enemy ships.</p>

The divers believed the longline was illegal when they spotted it off the Jupiter Inlet in 2020. While the gear was worth $1,300, the value of the lost sharks amounted to several thousand more. Their attorneys argued that their prosecution was government overreach, and the pardon restores their rights to vote, own firearms, and travel freely.</p>
