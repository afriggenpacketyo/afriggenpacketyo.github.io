          <p>Ether, a prominent cryptocurrency, achieved a new record high for the first time since 2021, spurred by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole. Powell suggested that current economic conditions might warrant adjusting the policy stance, implying potential interest rate cuts. This dovish sentiment reportedly caught traders off-guard, leading to significant short liquidations in the crypto market and pushing Ether's price higher. The article highlights a shift in market momentum and growing institutional interest in stablecoins, which are heavily reliant on the Ethereum blockchain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Democrats have introduced a new bill aiming to establish clear legal thresholds for advanced chips that would require congressional approval before being exported to China. The measure seeks to curb the Chinese Communist Party's access to cutting-edge technology, which lawmakers believe fuels surveillance, military modernization, and influence campaigns. Under the proposed bill, chips exceeding specific performance benchmarks, including processing power, memory, and interconnect speeds, would be subject to review. This initiative underscores national security concerns regarding technological transfer and seeks to strengthen U.S. control over critical semiconductor components.</p>
