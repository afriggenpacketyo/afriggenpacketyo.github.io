          <p>The governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially announced their symbolic recognition of a Palestinian state, a move intended to support a two-state solution. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that this decision is not a reward for Hamas but rather an effort to revive hopes for peace for both Palestinians and Israelis. This historic step by key U.S. allies comes despite opposition from both the United States and Israel. The recognition aligns them with over 140 other nations that have already taken this step.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a mutual defense pact, strengthening their long-standing security partnership amid growing regional tensions. This move is seen as Riyadh's strategy to diversify its security alliances, reducing its historical reliance on the United States as its primary guarantor. Analysts suggest this pact signals an evolution in Gulf Arab states' foreign policy as they navigate the complexities of U.S.-China rivalries. China is expected to view this development positively, potentially opening doors for increased arms sales in the region.</p>

          <p>As annual fees for premium travel credit cards rise, a credit expert advises consumers on how to maximize their value. Key mistakes to avoid include opting for no-fee cards which often have poor rewards, hoarding points that can be devalued by issuers at any time, and failing to update cards as lifestyles change. The article suggests that even cards with a modest annual fee can provide significant value through better reward programs. It also recommends contacting the card issuer to negotiate the fee before downgrading or canceling a card. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that exceptional social skills in children are cultivated at home through specific parental behaviors, rather than just memorizing polite phrases. Parents of socially skilled children tend to talk openly about emotions, model empathy in daily interactions, and foster authentic confidence by allowing kids to try and fail. They also teach children how to repair relationships after conflict, validate their feelings, and listen more than they lecture. These practices help build an environment of emotional safety, which is foundational for developing strong interpersonal skills.</p>

          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is embracing a significant dramatic shift in his career by portraying mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr in the new film "The Smashing Machine." Johnson revealed that he tapped into his own childhood trauma to play the complex character, who struggled with addiction and depression. He admitted to being nervous about the raw, demanding role, a departure from the blockbuster action films that defined his career. Johnson views this project not just as a new chapter but as a "whole new book," seeking deeper creative fulfillment beyond box office success.</p>

          <p>The landmark 1954 Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, officially overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson nearly 60 years earlier. The legal battle was spearheaded by NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall, who argued that segregation was a system designed to perpetuate the subjugation of Black Americans. The unanimous court ruling declared that state-sanctioned segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. While the decision did not immediately end segregation in practice, it was a monumental step in the civil rights movement, and Marshall later became the first African American Supreme Court Justice.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed a dominant victory at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, strengthening the team's recent revival. The race began with significant drama as McLaren's Oscar Piastri, the current championship leader, crashed out on the very first lap after an ambitious overtaking attempt. Piastri's main rival and teammate, Lando Norris, was unable to fully capitalize, finishing seventh after getting stuck in traffic. The podium was rounded out by Mercedes' George Russell in second and Williams' Carlos Sainz in third, who secured his team's first podium finish since 2021.</p>

          <p>A UN-backed project, Seabed 2030, aims to map the entire ocean floor by the end of the decade, a vast and largely unexplored domain. Currently, only about 20% of the seabed has been surveyed with modern sonar, leaving underwater mountains, canyons, and ecosystems unknown. Environmental journalist Laura Trethewey notes that while this mapping could unlock scientific discoveries and insights into past climate change, it also poses risks. A complete map could accelerate deep-sea mining and resource extraction in international waters, which are governed by unclear legal frameworks, raising concerns about conservation and regulation.</p>

          <p>Artist Adam Cvijanovic has created a large-scale mural for the entrance of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, the first major artistic addition to the landmark in 75 years. Titled "What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding," the artwork depicts the 1879 Apparition at Knock in Ireland alongside a powerful tribute to America's history of immigration. At the suggestion of Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the mural includes scenes of 19th-century immigrants, first responders, and present-day arrivals. The piece aims to convey a message of treating all people with respect, a theme Dolan noted is particularly relevant today.</p>

          <p>China has entered the top 10 of the United Nations' Global Innovation Index for the first time, an achievement that highlights the ineffectiveness of U.S. efforts to contain its technological advancement. The opinion article argues that Washington's strategy of tech decoupling, including export controls and blacklisting firms, has not stifled Chinese innovation but has instead catalyzed it. Faced with restrictions, China has intensified its domestic research and development, with spending reaching over 3.6 trillion yuan in 2024. This demonstrates China's successful drive toward technological self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested its highly profitable investment in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD. The initial $230 million purchase in 2008, championed by the late Charlie Munger, grew substantially over 17 years as BYD's shares surged by approximately 3890%. Berkshire began selling its shares in August 2022 and has now confirmed the complete exit. While not explicitly stated, the sale aligns with Buffett's recent moves to reduce exposure to geopolitical risks associated with China, similar to his quick sale of a stake in Taiwan Semiconductor.

          <p>The United States recently conducted a significant trilateral military drill, Freedom Edge, with allies Japan and South Korea but notably did not include an aircraft carrier. This departure from past practice has led some analysts to speculate that Washington may be downplaying the exercise to improve relations with China and North Korea. Others suggest the move reflects the Trump administration's strategy of demanding greater contributions from its Asian allies in its efforts to contain China. The multi-domain exercise took place in international waters and focused on addressing shared threats within the first island chain.</p>

          <p>Many women are reaching fertility clinics with significant gaps in their knowledge about their own reproductive biology, leading experts to call for more comprehensive sex education in schools. Doctors report that patients are often unaware of how age impacts fertility, the lifestyle factors affecting sperm quality, or even the basic timing of ovulation. Surveys confirm this widespread lack of knowledge, which can lead to difficulties in family planning. Proponents argue that teaching fertility alongside pregnancy prevention would empower individuals to make more informed decisions about their reproductive health and futures earlier in life.</p>
