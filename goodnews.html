          <p>The United States and Taiwan are discussing a potential spaceport collaboration that could revolutionize long-distance travel. The American Institute in Taiwan announced that the partnership would focus on suborbital flights, an emerging technology where a vehicle briefly enters space before landing. This innovation could slash the travel time between Houston, Texas, and Taipei, Taiwan, from approximately 14.5 hours to as little as 2.5 hours. While still in the experimental phase, these flights are being explored for tourism and high-speed cargo, with China and Russia also developing similar commercial services.</p>

          <h2>China's Jiangsu Province Closes Economic Gap with Guangdong, Fueled by Tech Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 08:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The economic gap between China's top two provincial economies, Guangdong and Jiangsu, is shrinking, with Jiangsu's GDP reaching 97.44% of Guangdong's in the first half of 2025. The margin narrowed to just over 175 billion yuan, the closest in years, challenging Guangdong's long-held position as the country's economic leader. Analysts attribute Jiangsu's resilience to its diversified industrial structure, lower dependence on real estate, and reduced reliance on exports compared to Guangdong. In contrast, Guangdong's export growth has slowed dramatically, weighing on its overall economic performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, reporting an adjusted earnings per share of 87 cents on revenue of $12.62 billion. The company's performance was bolstered by strong demand in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment, which saw a 3% increase in volume. However, this growth was offset by a 1% decline in global unit case volume, with North America, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific markets all experiencing shrinking demand. The company narrowed its full-year earnings forecast, indicating confidence despite economic uncertainties in some regions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced a major shift in its decades-long policy, confirming it will transition from open seating to assigned seats starting January 27, 2026. Customers will be able to book flights with assigned seats beginning July 29 of this year. This change allows the airline to offer new fare bundles and options, including seats with extra legroom, as it overhauls its revenue strategy. The airline is also revamping its boarding process, replacing the A-C letter groups with numerical groups from 1 to 8, with priority based on seat location and loyalty status.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled its next-generation high-speed rail technology, achieving speeds over the previous 350km/h barrier while maintaining comparable energy consumption. Scientists overcame significant aerodynamic resistance by redesigning the train's head and undercarriage, reducing drag by over 24% in total. This technological advancement comes as the United States has revoked federal funding for California's high-speed rail project. The Chinese breakthrough was achieved by drawing inspiration from nature and optimizing previously overlooked areas of the train for better aerodynamic efficiency.</p>

          <p>In a rare display of unity, supporters of rival Los Angeles soccer teams LAFC and the Galaxy set aside their intense rivalry to protest recent federal immigration raids. Before a match, LAFC fans unveiled a large banner reading "Los Angeles Unidos Jamás Será Vencido" ("Los Angeles, united, will never be defeated"), showing solidarity with communities affected by the raids. The gesture comes as LAFC is one of the few professional sports teams to have issued a statement supporting its community, while the Galaxy's silence has led to boycotts from some of its own fans, highlighting a divide in how sports organizations are responding.</p>

          <p>With extreme heat becoming a leading cause of weather-related deaths, this article posits that shade should be treated as a vital form of public health infrastructure for the 21st century. As global temperatures continue to rise, even with emission cuts, society must adapt to a hotter planet. The author argues that increasing shade, whether through planting more trees or building artificial structures like canopies and awnings, is an effective and democratic way to cool urban environments and protect public health. This approach could make outdoor spaces more livable and reduce the health risks associated with increasingly frequent and intense heat waves.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emerged as a major political influencer in Washington, with some analysts suggesting his clout now eclipses that of Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. Huang's influence is tied to the critical role of Nvidia's AI chips in the global technology race, giving him a strong position to navigate the political landscape. This was recently demonstrated when Nvidia announced it expects to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, a move Huang had openly lobbied for and which aligns with arguments made by key White House advisors about maintaining U.S. tech leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article presents research arguing that Democrats can win back a significant portion of working-class Donald Trump voters by adopting a "social populism" strategy. The analysis indicates that while these voters are more socially moderate or conservative than the Democratic base, they are also "economic egalitarians" who support pro-worker policies like raising the minimum wage and protecting jobs. The research identifies that approximately 11% of working-class Trump voters hold these socially moderate and economically progressive views, representing a crucial, winnable segment of the electorate that could sway future elections if targeted with the right message.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on the peculiar and enduring nature of sibling relationships, where childhood perceptions often override adult realities. While sorting through her late mother's house, she observes how she and her siblings continue to view each other through the lens of their youth, despite clear evidence of their adult skills and professions. For instance, she struggles to see her sister as a competent gardener or her brother as a skilled decorator, just as they seem to doubt her own capabilities. The piece humorously explores how these ingrained family dynamics and perceptions are remarkably resistant to change over time.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Northwestern University have developed a new device to help address a common source of anxiety for new mothers: knowing how much milk their baby is consuming. The small, wireless set of electrodes is worn on the mother's breast and uses electrical signals to measure the volume of milk expressed during a feeding, transmitting the data to a smartphone. This technology provides real-time feedback, offering reassurance to parents and valuable data for pediatricians. Currently in development, the device aims to reduce the stress and uncertainty that can often lead mothers to abandon breastfeeding early.</p>
