          <p>Japan's core inflation rate rose to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years and exceeding economists' expectations. This increase in inflation strengthens the argument for the Bank of Japan to consider exiting its decade-long ultra-easy monetary policy. Headline inflation also remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has indicated a readiness to continue raising rates at a gradual pace, while also assessing the potential impacts of U.S. tariffs. The CNBC article notes this is a developing story.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court strongly suggested that Federal Reserve board members would have special protection against being fired by a president, while allowing President Trump to fire two members of other federal agencies' boards. The ruling exempts the Federal Reserve from presidential control, citing its unique structure and historical tradition. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, arguing that existing law protects members of the NLRB and MSPB from presidential removal except for good cause. The CNBC article details the legal arguments and potential implications for the Federal Reserve's independence.</p>
