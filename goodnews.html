        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, surpassing forecasts of 0.1% despite slowing from the previous quarter. This growth was primarily driven by the services and construction sectors, with revised upward estimates for April's GDP. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged positive signs, opposition figures criticized the pace of growth, and economists expressed doubt about maintaining this momentum due to global economic weakness and potential future tax rises. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates to 4% amidst these economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, reported a 27% year-over-year increase in second-quarter operating profit, significantly exceeding forecasts. This strong performance was primarily fueled by its burgeoning artificial intelligence server business, which for the first time accounted for a larger share of revenue (41%) than smart consumer electronic products (35%). The company anticipates continued substantial growth in its AI server segment for the current quarter. However, evolving global political and economic conditions, including potential US tariffs, are being closely monitored. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States Department of State has designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, as foreign terrorist organizations. This action, part of the Trump administration's commitment to countering terrorism, is seen by analysts as potentially easing China's long-held concerns over fatal terrorist attacks that often target Chinese citizens. Experts suggest this move could open a new avenue for counterterrorism cooperation between China and the US, facilitated through Pakistan, fostering greater regional stability.</p>

          <p>This article explains BTecs, which are practical qualifications in the UK, assessed through exams, coursework, and projects. BTec Firsts are equivalent to GCSEs (Level 2), while BTec Nationals are comparable to A-levels (Level 3) and can lead to university or direct employment. Graded from Pass to Starred Distinction, BTecs are popular among a diverse range of students, including many over 22 and white working-class students. Recent government policy shifts have paused plans to scrap numerous BTecs, recognizing their importance in key sectors.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Effectiveness and Implications of US Secondary Sanctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 03:07:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores secondary sanctions, a US foreign policy tool that targets third-party countries or entities doing business with sanctioned parties, such as Russia. Unlike primary sanctions that restrict a sanctioning country's own citizens, secondary sanctions leverage the US dollar's global importance and access to its financial system to compel compliance. While successful in past cases like Iran, experts debate their overall effectiveness, noting challenges in enforcement, risk of retaliation, and potential to push targeted nations closer together. They are seen as a powerful but nuanced tool that must be deployed carefully.</p>

US composer Jonathan Wright alleged the 2015 hit copied his 2011 rendition. However, the court upheld previous rulings, determining that Wright's version lacked sufficient originality to warrant copyright protection, as both songs are based on a traditional melody popular at US summer camps.

          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who report drinking alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a dip coinciding with increased concern about the health risks of even moderate drinking. Experts suggest this shift is driven by greater public knowledge regarding alcohol's negative effects, including increased risks of cancer and mental health issues. Younger generations, in particular, are more inclined to view moderate drinking as harmful and are embracing alcohol-free alternatives. This trend may also be influenced by social acceptability shifts and economic factors.</p>
