          <h2>FDA to Review Mifepristone Data Amid Safety Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 20:25:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA is set to review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill, following a request from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This review comes amid concerns, particularly from Republican Senator Josh Hawley, about the drug's safety, although experts like Dr. C√©line Gounder argue that these concerns are often misguided and based on flawed reports. Mifepristone was initially approved in 2000 after extensive review and has been used by over 5 million patients since then, with medication abortions accounting for more than half of all abortions in the U.S. healthcare system in 2023. Despite previous Supreme Court rulings preserving access to the drug, restrictions exist in 28 states, highlighting ongoing debates about its availability. </p>

          <p>Air quality in the Eastern U.S., which had been severely impacted by smoke from Canadian wildfires, is expected to improve. The smoke had created unhealthy conditions from the upper Midwest to New York City, prompting health warnings and advisories. While the worst appears to be over, residents are still advised to monitor air quality reports and take necessary precautions. The wildfire smoke situation serves as a reminder of the widespread impact of environmental events and the importance of air quality monitoring. </p>

          <p>Rod Stewart has canceled his second performance at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace due to a lingering illness, specifically the flu. The singer, who is 80 years old, had previously postponed a show earlier in the week for the same reason. Stewart expressed his apologies to fans and indicated that the canceled show would be rescheduled, as he needs more rest to recover. This cancellation comes after Stewart announced plans to step back from large-scale world tours, intending to focus on smaller venues and a different style of music. </p>

          <p>Health experts are warning pregnant women, or those trying to conceive or breastfeeding, to avoid using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro due to unknown risks to unborn babies. The UK's drug safety experts emphasize that the effects of these medications on fetal development are not fully understood. Concerns are growing that the increasing popularity of these drugs, often obtained from unregulated sources, may lead to unsafe usage and inadequate medical advice. Women are advised to use contraception while taking these medications and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant, and those using oral contraceptives should also use a condom. </p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to End TSA's Quiet Skies Surveillance Program</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to discontinue the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) "Quiet Skies" program, a domestic surveillance initiative for travelers. The program, which aimed to identify potential aviation security risks, has faced criticism for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes. The decision to end Quiet Skies comes amid debates about the program's effectiveness and its potential for infringing on civil liberties. It remains unclear whether the program's staff and resources will be reallocated within the administration. </p>

          <p>A judge has ordered the Trump administration to take steps to provide due process to migrants who were deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The judge stated that the men, who were expelled without a chance to contest their removals, are likely to prevail in their claims of unfair treatment. The ruling underscores the importance of ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, are afforded their legal rights. The case highlights ongoing debates about the fairness and legality of deportation policies. </p>
