          <p>This opinion article argues that the West's historical lens, shaped by its own past of conquest and rivalry, risks misinterpreting China's rise as inherently aggressive, potentially leading to war. Drawing on Allison's study of rising powers, the article suggests the West sees its own reflection in China, overlooking China's distinct 5,000-year history and land-bound cultural DNA. To avert conflict, the West must "shatter the mirror" of its own historical projections and understand China's defensive rather than expansionist motivations.</p>

          <p>A 49-year-old man, Billy Cagle, was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after allegedly threatening to "shoot it up" on social media. His family alerted police, who located an AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds in his truck outside the terminal. Police believe Cagle was scouting the area before retrieving the weapon, and his timely arrest averted a potential tragedy. Cagle, a felon with mental health challenges, faces charges including terroristic threats and criminal attempt to commit aggravated assault.</p>

          <p>President Trump's repeated calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco are creating tension amidst the city's post-pandemic resurgence, largely driven by the artificial intelligence sector. San Francisco is experiencing declining crime rates, increased tourism, and a recovering real estate market. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff initially supported the deployment but later retracted, stating it was unnecessary given the city's improved safety. The potential federal intervention contrasts with local officials' efforts to highlight the city's positive trajectory and economic growth.</p>

          <p>Cannabis-infused beverages, containing THC and/or CBD, are experiencing a surge in popularity as Americans increasingly reduce their alcohol consumption. Sales of these drinks are projected to grow significantly, driven by consumers seeking non-alcoholic, lower-calorie alternatives. While brands market health benefits, doctors caution about potential side effects like anxiety, paranoia, and impaired coordination. The regulatory landscape is patchwork, but these beverages are legal in 44 states, with major retailers like Target beginning to test their sale.</p>

          <p>Decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a melted-down statue of General Robert E. Lee, are now featured in a new Los Angeles art exhibition titled "Monuments." The exhibition, opening October 23, displays these statues alongside contemporary art, aiming to challenge narratives of American history. Curator Hamza Walker asserts the monuments represent white supremacy and the "Lost Cause" ideology, contrasting with President Trump's calls for reinstallation. The show explores the contentious history of these symbols and their role in sparking protests.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that a tiny microchip implant, combined with special glasses, has helped some legally blind patients with geographic atrophy regain the ability to read. The photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA) involves a hair-thin implant under the retina and glasses that project images via infrared light. Of 32 patients, 26 showed significant visual acuity improvement. While requiring concentration, this breakthrough offers hope for the five million people worldwide affected by this leading cause of blindness in older individuals.</p>

          <p>A Lakers fan, Andrew Garcia, has dropped his small claims lawsuit against LeBron James after a fantasy sports app, PrizePicks, compensated him for tickets purchased under the mistaken belief James was retiring. Garcia had sought $865.66 for tickets bought after James teased a "decision of all decisions" on social media, which turned out to be unrelated to his NBA career. PrizePicks deposited promo funds, offered additional tickets, and merchandise, leading Garcia to withdraw the case.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history and evolving nature of the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing its design for amendment and ongoing interpretation. Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen discuss how amendments, like the 13th and 19th, allowed it to grow with the country, despite early resistance to ratification. They highlight the founders' expectation of constant revision and the crucial role of deliberation. Concerns are raised about current checks and balances, with Congress's inaction and the Supreme Court's expanded power deviating from the founders' original intent.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth companies surged as investors reacted to Chinese export restrictions and the Trump administration's push for a domestic supply chain. President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Albanese signed an agreement to invest in joint ventures to reduce dependence on China for critical minerals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the administration would set price floors for these industries to combat market manipulation. This industrial policy is expected to benefit companies like NioCorp and MP Materials, with further government backing anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

With China imposing export controls, investors anticipate government support for domestic miners. Cleveland-Cliffs, already experienced in iron ore mining, aims to be part of the solution for American manufacturing independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police announced it will no longer investigate "non-crime hate incidents," allowing officers to focus solely on criminal investigations. This policy change follows the dropping of a probe into Father Ted creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence on X. Linehan's arrest sparked backlash and calls for legal action against the police. The Met commissioner stated officers shouldn't police "toxic culture war debates," and the move aims to provide clearer direction, though the recording of such incidents was initially recommended after the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry.</p>
