          <p>Jack Draper secured his place in the Madrid Open final by defeating Lorenzo Musetti in a tightly contested match, with a final score of 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Draper, the British number one, is set to compete against Casper Ruud of Norway in the final. Draper expressed that the level of play was high from both competitors, and he reflected on the sacrifices he makes on a daily basis to reach key moments like these. This marks Draper's first clay-court final and makes him the first Englishman to reach the Madrid Open final, following Andy Murray as the second Briton to do so.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified antibodies in the blood of Tim Friede, a man who has been bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, that can neutralize the venom of multiple deadly snake species. This discovery, reported in the journal Cell, could lead to the creation of a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives each year. The antibodies, when combined with a drug that blocks neurotoxins, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species from various regions. This research offers a promising path toward a more effective and accessible treatment for snakebites, which affect millions of people globally, particularly in rural areas of Africa.

The Conservatives experienced losses, relinquishing control of several councils, but managed to win the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoral race from Labour.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry expressed a desire to reconcile with his family in Britain during an interview, admitting uncertainty about his father, King Charles III's, prognosis and acknowledging the divisiveness caused by his memoir. This interview was released shortly after Harry lost his legal battle regarding his security in the UK. Harry voiced his frustration over the security dispute, which he believes is preventing him from reconciling with his father, who is undergoing cancer treatment. The judge ruled that the government committee's decision to downgrade Harry's automatic protection was lawful, citing his stepping back from royal duties.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede has willingly been bitten by venomous snakes hundreds of times over nearly 25 years in an attempt to develop immunity and create a broad antivenom. Researchers have now identified antibodies in Friede's blood that neutralize neurotoxins from multiple snake species. This discovery, published in the journal Cell, has led to the development of a new antivenom cocktail that offers mice complete protection against 13 snake species and partial protection against six more. The team plans to test the cocktail in dogs bitten by venomous snakes in Australia and hopes to expand its coverage to include vipers.</p>

Coach Tyronn Lue adjusted the Clippers' lineup to create more space for Harden, allowing him to attack one-on-one and create opportunities for his teammates.

NASA also plans to streamline its workforce, IT services, and facility operations, while terminating multiple missions.
