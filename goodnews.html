          <p>The JBJ Soul Kitchen, a restaurant chain founded by Dorothea Bongiovi and Jon Bon Jovi, operates on a unique model where patrons can either pay a suggested donation or volunteer their time to earn a meal. With four locations in New Jersey, the initiative aims to empower individuals rather than provide charity, allowing them to work as servers or dishwashers. The restaurants also offer community outreach, connecting patrons with resources for housing and healthcare. Despite some minor local controversy, the establishments are highly rated for their food quality and represent a commitment to community support.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a significant weekly gain, crossing its 200-day moving average after the company committed to a $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, easing investor concerns about potential tariffs. This development has improved market sentiment for the tech giant, which had been underperforming. Separately, reports indicate the Trump administration is exploring a historically large stock offering for government-controlled mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with major banks reportedly involved in discussions about the potential deal.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the most anticipated celestial events, is set to peak on August 12-13, but viewing conditions are expected to be poor. A bright, 84% full waning gibbous moon will coincide with the peak, significantly reducing visibility. The American Meteor Society predicts that the moonlight will wash out most of the fainter meteors, cutting the number of visible meteors from a potential 50 per hour to just 10-20. The Perseids are caused by debris from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle burning up in Earth's atmosphere, and they will remain active, though less intensely, until late August.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian oil refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing Russian crude is not expected to derail ongoing free trade agreement talks between the EU and India. Experts suggest the move is largely symbolic and that India can easily adapt its exports. Paradoxically, the greater pressure from potential U.S. tariffs on Indian goods under the Trump administration may actually increase India's motivation to secure a stable trade deal with the EU. This dynamic could push India to diversify its economic partnerships, potentially benefiting EU-India relations in the long run. (not investment advice)</p>

To honor the brand's legacy, the new store will accept old 20% off coupons regardless of their expiration date.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, many Americans are struggling with compounding interest charges. This article outlines several strategies to combat this debt, including transferring balances to a 0% introductory APR card, which can provide an interest-free period of up to 21 months to pay down the principal. Other options include enrolling in a credit card issuer's hardship program for temporary relief, using a personal loan to consolidate high-interest debt, or paying off the balance before the statement closing date to avoid interest calculations altogether.

          <h2>CD Laddering Recommended as a Strategic Savings Approach Amid Shifting Interest Rate Environment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 13:27:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates, financial experts suggest using a CD laddering strategy to maximize savings while maintaining flexibility. This approach involves opening multiple certificates of deposit (CDs) with staggered maturity dates, allowing savers to lock in currently high rates before they fall further. By spreading funds across short-term and long-term CDs, individuals can benefit from higher yields on some funds while ensuring regular access to their money. This strategy is particularly timely, as it balances the benefits of high rates with the need for liquidity in an unpredictable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists from East Carolina University have discovered four shipwrecks at a historic site in North Carolina, one of which is believed to be the remains of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer that exploded during an attack in 1748. Wood samples suggest the vessel was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from the ship was found in 1985. The team also uncovered three other wrecks and colonial port infrastructure. The remarkably preserved timbers are being recovered to protect them from erosion and will be conserved for further study.</p>

          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has taken the most detailed image to date of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet poses no threat to Earth and is estimated to have an icy core no larger than 3.5 miles across. The object was discovered last month and, like its predecessors, appears dark and reddish. Some scientists, like Harvard's Avi Loeb, have raised questions about its unusual characteristics and trajectory, suggesting it warrants close monitoring to determine if it could be an artificial object, though it is widely considered a natural comet.</p>

          <p>As Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" turns 100, this article reflects on its lasting power as a masterpiece of midlife crisis and its ability to resonate differently with readers at various stages of life. The story, which unfolds over a single day, juxtaposes the societal anxieties of its 51-year-old protagonist with the post-war trauma of a young veteran. While often read in youth as a critique of a declining bourgeois order, the novel offers a profound exploration of mortality, memory, and the affirmation of life. The article argues its themes are deeply personal and enduring, solidifying its place as a classic.</p>

          <p>The digital advertising market is seeing a resurgence, largely driven by the successful implementation of AI tools by tech giants like Meta and Alphabet, which both reported strong quarterly earnings. Meta's CEO credited AI with improving ad system efficiency, leading to a 22% sales increase. However, this growth is not universal, as smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results. Snap's revenue growth was modest after a botched platform update, while Pinterest cited tariff-related concerns and reduced spending from some advertisers, highlighting a growing performance gap in the tech sector.

          <p>Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials rose after the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the second quarter, driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is essential for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and robotics. The improved financial results and production metrics signal that the company is moving toward profitability, supported by a recent $400 million investment from the Department of Defense. MP Materials is currently ramping up its magnet production facility in Texas, which will supply major manufacturers like General Motors. (not investment advice)</p>
