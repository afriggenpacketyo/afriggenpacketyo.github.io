          <p>As the average cost of a Halloween costume rises to over $37, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes for free. For the past nine years, Waggoner has been thrifting for clothes and materials, which he then redesigns into unique costumes at his home. He hosts events where children can pick out a costume, and he notes that this year has been his busiest due to increased financial pressures on families. Waggoner, who spends over $5,000 annually on this project, believes every child deserves the chance to celebrate Halloween, regardless of their family's financial situation.</p>

          <p>Nathan Thomas, a sophomore at Jefferson County High School, is advocating for greater youth involvement in local governance by proposing the creation of a Youth City Council in Wrens, Georgia. He presented his idea to the Wrens City Council, outlining a structure that would mirror the adult council and provide a platform for young people to organize events and have a voice in community affairs. Thomas believes this initiative is needed due to the city's large youth population and sees it as a model for a similar county-level organization. His goal is to foster future leaders and give young residents a meaningful role in their local government.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid significant market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds employing options-based strategies. This approach can provide more reliable downside protection and generate income that is not sensitive to fluctuating interest rates, which is particularly relevant in the current rate-cutting cycle. The article highlights that such strategies offer a diversifying source of income and defense against equity drawdowns, which are consistent needs for many portfolios. It notes the growing demand for these products and advises investors to seek out funds managed by experienced professionals to avoid unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to common stereotypes, a recent study from DatingNews.com and the Kinsey Institute indicates that men are more inclined than women to accelerate relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that a primary motivator for men is financial savings. Experts suggest this trend is also linked to men's reliance on romantic partnerships as their main source of social and emotional support, as traditional masculinity often discourages close, intimate friendships with other men. This can lead to lower psychological well-being for single men compared to single women, who tend to maintain stronger support networks.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines aircraft clipped the tail of another stationary United plane while taxiing to its gate at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who were able to deplane normally after a delay. The incident involved the wing of one plane striking the horizontal stabilizer of the other. This event adds to recent concerns about aviation safety following several other runway collisions and near-misses at U.S. airports. An investigation into the circumstances of the low-speed collision is underway.</p>

          <h2>NASA Scientist Proposes 'Radical Mundanity' as Solution to Fermi Paradox</h2>

          <p>In a new paper, NASA astrophysicist Robin Corbet offers a straightforward explanation for the Fermi Paradox, the mystery of why humanity has not detected signs of alien intelligence. His "radical mundanity" hypothesis suggests that while other civilizations may exist, they are likely only slightly more advanced than our own and face similar technological and financial limitations in exploring the cosmos. According to this theory, aliens lack capabilities like faster-than-light travel and eventually abandon costly interstellar exploration or signaling efforts after finding no one else. This sober perspective contrasts with more speculative theories like the zoo hypothesis or the idea that advanced civilizations become imperceptible to us.</p>

          <p>A complex repair operation has begun to restore the main power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has relied on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow for the repairs, a development hailed as crucial for nuclear safety. The plant, Europe's largest, requires a constant power source to cool its six shutdown reactors and prevent a potential nuclear incident. Ukrainian officials confirmed their specialists are involved and noted this is the 42nd time power lines have needed restoration since Russia's invasion.</p>

She identifies three major mistakes: applying only for highly competitive national scholarships, not applying to enough scholarships, and writing generic essays. Greene recommends focusing on local, state-level, and "intersectionality" scholarships with more specific criteria to narrow the applicant pool. She also stresses that applying for scholarships is a numbers game and suggests students should aim to submit between 100 to 200 applications to maximize their success.</p>

The term, which originated in internet and meme culture, is used to express surprise or speechlessness and is noted for its deliberate, humorous break from grammatical rules. The selection was made through an online vote organized by the publisher PONS Langenscheidt, with nearly two million people participating. The choice highlights the growing influence of the English language and the trend toward brevity in youth slang. It narrowly beat out "goonen," a term for excessive self-gratification.</p>

Shareholders have criticized the deal's all-cash structure, which will significantly increase KDP's debt leverage and was structured favorably for JAB.

Key lessons include understanding online privacy, recognizing that time is a precious resource, and not sharing sensitive personal information.
