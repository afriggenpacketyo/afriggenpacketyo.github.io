          <p>Doordash announced it will acquire SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in cash. This acquisition comes as Doordash reported first-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations, causing shares to drop approximately 4%. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025 and will expand Doordash's services to grow local commerce and support financial goals. The article also notes that Doordash has agreed to a $3.9 billion deal with British food delivery service Deliveroo.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan stated she will challenge the Labour government in Westminster if its decisions harm Welsh communities, prioritizing Wales' interests over party loyalty. She highlighted potential harm from cuts to disability benefits and the winter fuel allowance, advocating for Wales to benefit more from offshore wind projects. Morgan emphasized that while there's a bond, disagreements will be voiced, and unfairness will be challenged, promoting a grown-up modern government.

Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour hailed the decision as historic, securing the future of prediction markets in America.

          <p>Friedrich Merz failed to be elected German chancellor in the first parliamentary vote, falling short of a majority. This unexpected setback has prompted a halt in the parliamentary session for discussion of next steps, causing losses in the German Dax stock market index. Despite the initial failure, Merz is still expected to eventually be elected chancellor in a second vote within 14 days. Analysts suggest this outcome may sow doubts about his ability to fully pursue his agenda, potentially damaging his domestic and international authority.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Met Gala's theme, "Tailored for You," celebrated Black style and the history of dandyism, coinciding with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's spring exhibition, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style." The event raised a record $31 million for the museum's Costume Institute and highlighted the influence of Black identity on fashion. The exhibition explores how Black people have used fashion and dress as a contest of power and aesthetics, from enslavement to the present. The theme was inspired by Monica L. Miller's book, "Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity."</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge, driven by speculation of pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. Despite the recent weakness, the Taiwanese dollar is still up over 8% this year against the greenback. Experts believe the surge was largely due to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging U.S. dollar debt. Investors are closely monitoring the Taiwanese central bank, with some speculating that authorities are tolerating a stronger currency to win trade concessions from the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite the trade war with the U.S., China has largely avoided de-dollarizing its economy, as indicated by an Oxford Economics report. China's export orientation necessitates substantial dollar assets, and few high-grade alternatives exist for its foreign exchange reserves. The report suggests China is more likely to weaken the yuan than sell U.S. assets in response to trade tensions. This strategy allows exporters to buy more of the Chinese currency with U.S. dollars earned from sales overseas.</p>
