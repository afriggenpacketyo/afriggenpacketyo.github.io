Goodge ran the equivalent of two-and-a-half marathons daily, facing challenges like dust storms, injuries, and hallucinations.

The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at significant depths and assess the environmental impact. Japan hopes to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon, compared with the 34 tons absorbed by coastal plants in fiscal 2023.
