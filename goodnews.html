        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, resisting public calls for a rate cut from the Trump administration. In his statement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's political independence, stating that decisions are based on economic data and not political factors to avoid influencing elections. The committee acknowledged that tariffs have started to affect prices but noted the full economic impact remains uncertain. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a quarter-point rate cut, highlighting a division within the institution. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents in several southwestern states, including California, Texas, and Colorado, can expect an increase in tarantula sightings as the spiders' annual mating season begins. During September and October, tens of thousands of mature male tarantulas, typically 8 to 10 years old, emerge from their burrows in search of females. These large, hairy arachnids are generally docile and rarely bite humans unless provoked. While their bite is comparable to a bee sting, their primary defense mechanism is releasing irritating hairs from their abdomen, and they are an important part of the regional ecosystem.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that ongoing trade negotiations with China are progressing well and that he anticipates a fair agreement will be reached between the two nations. Speaking to reporters, he offered an optimistic outlook on the talks but did not provide specific details about the potential terms or timeline of a deal. This update comes amid continued economic friction, with recent data showing a 24% year-on-year decline in Chinese exports to the U.S. in the second quarter of 2025. Negotiators from both countries have described recent discussions as constructive but have differed on the timing of a tariff pause.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation aimed at prohibiting members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. The bill, known as the PELOSI Act, received a crucial vote from Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who joined Democrats on the panel to move it forward for a potential full Senate vote. The proposed measure is more stringent than the existing STOCK Act, requiring divestment within 180 days and banning blind trusts, which critics call workarounds. The move reflects growing public demand for stricter ethics rules to prevent potential conflicts of interest among federal lawmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have successfully launched the NISAR satellite, a joint mission designed to map the Earth's surface with unprecedented detail. The $1.3 billion satellite will use two different radar frequencies to track subtle changes in the planet's land and ice, measuring shifts as small as one centimeter. The data gathered will help scientists better understand the causes of natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. This launch represents the most significant space collaboration to date between the United States and India, enhancing global environmental monitoring capabilities.</p>

In her statement, Harris expressed her love for her home state but explained that after deep reflection, her path to public service will not be through elected office at this time. This decision opens up a wide and competitive field for other Democratic hopefuls vying to lead the nation's most populous state.

          <p>There is renewed hope for solving the infamous 1991 yogurt shop murders in Austin, Texas, where four teenage girls were killed. Investigators are now relying on advanced DNA technology to analyze a small, decades-old male DNA sample found on one of the victims. Previous Y-STR testing led to the release of two men who had been convicted based on coerced confessions, as the DNA did not match them. Although a promising lead in a public database turned out to be a dead end after further analysis, officials remain hopeful that continuing improvements in genetic science will eventually identify the perpetrator.</p>

The crew, which also includes a Japanese astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut, will fly aboard the Crew Dragon Endeavour, making its record sixth flight.

          <p>As Americans grapple with record-high credit card debt, an informational article outlines the criteria for qualifying for debt forgiveness programs, which can potentially reduce balances by 30-50%. The most likely candidates are those facing genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or major medical expenses, which they can document for creditors. Borrowers with significant amounts of unsecured debt, typically over $10,000, are also in a stronger negotiating position. Additionally, those who have already fallen behind on payments may have more leverage, as creditors prefer a partial settlement to a total loss from bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent underwater expedition has discovered extensive communities of larger life forms, such as tubeworms and mollusks, thriving at depths over 31,000 feet in the Pacific Ocean's deep-sea trenches. These extreme environments, characterized by immense pressure and a lack of sunlight, were previously thought to primarily support microbial life. Researchers believe these creatures survive not on nutrients trickling down, but by capitalizing on chemical energy produced by microbes from ancient carbon deposits on the seafloor. The findings challenge existing models of life at extreme depths and suggest such ecosystems may be more common than anticipated.</p>

Last month, the Defense Department had announced it might cut off access due to cybersecurity concerns, a move that worried meteorologists, especially with an active hurricane season approaching. The data, from the long-running Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, is vital for storm tracking and forecasting models.

This comes as Meta invests billions in hiring top AI talent and establishing a new research lab to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. Zuckerberg's vision contrasts with approaches focused on automation, instead emphasizing AI as a personal tool. The heavy spending on AI echoes Meta's multi-billion-dollar investment in the metaverse, and investors are keenly watching to see how this new, costly venture will be developed and monetized.</p>
