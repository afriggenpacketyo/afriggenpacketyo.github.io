          <p>Amid persistent inflation, many homeowners are using home equity loans and HELOCs, which offer lower rates than credit cards or personal loans. However, there are significant risks to consider, such as choosing a variable-rate HELOC when predictable payments are needed, which could become costly if interest rates rise. The article also warns against borrowing more than necessary, as this can lead to financial strain if income changes or home values decline. It emphasizes the importance of understanding all associated closing costs and fees to avoid unexpected expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is set to release its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street closely watching the performance of its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, and its advertising revenue. Investors are particularly focused on the impact of President Trump's tariff policies, which the company had previously warned could affect results. Analysts suggest these tariffs may have inadvertently benefited Amazon by weakening competition from Chinese e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. The company's significant spending on artificial intelligence and its future guidance will also be key indicators for the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh addressed the increasing number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration, stating that they are a necessary response to presidents using executive orders to bypass Congress. Speaking at a judicial conference, he explained that as presidents push the limits of their power, courts are inevitably drawn in to decide on the legality of their actions. Kavanaugh defended the court's process, noting internal changes to handle these cases, and emphasized the collegiality among the justices despite differing views. He likened the criticism judges face to that of sports referees, calling it part of the job.</p>

          <p>After years of expressing a desire for a larger event space, President Trump is proceeding with the construction of a new ballroom at the White House, with work set to begin in September. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by Trump and other private donors and will replace the current East Wing. The new ballroom is designed to seat 650 guests, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity of about 200, eliminating the need for outdoor tents for large events like state dinners. This marks the latest of several aesthetic and structural changes Trump has made to the White House campus.</p>

          <p>United Talent Agency (UTA) and Michael Kassan, the founder of MediaLink, have agreed to drop their respective lawsuits, ending a contentious legal battle that began after UTA's $125 million acquisition of the advisory firm in 2021. The dispute involved mutual accusations of breach of contract, with UTA alleging excessive spending by Kassan and Kassan claiming UTA failed to honor the terms of their agreement. Both parties released a joint statement confirming the amicable end to their dispute but did not disclose the specific terms of the settlement. Kassan has since launched a new consulting firm.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is marking a significant milestone by opening its 1,000th new bank branch in seven years, located in Charlotte, North Carolina. This achievement is part of a multi-year, multibillion-dollar strategy to expand its physical footprint, which now includes branches in all 48 lower U.S. states. The expansion contrasts with the industry trend of branch closures since the 2008 financial crisis. The bank aims to open an additional 500 locations by 2027, projecting that its new branches will attract over $160 billion in deposits and enhance accessibility for its customers nationwide.</p>

The project will prioritize creating efficient licensing structures for financial "super apps" and aims to prevent innovative companies from moving offshore due to burdensome regulations.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has solved a long-standing botanical mystery, revealing that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers analyzed hundreds of potato genomes and found that the starchy vegetable originated from a hybridization event. An ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form tubers, while a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species from Chile contributed a gene that controls their growth. This genetic combination was essential for the creation of the potato as we know it today, demonstrating how inter-species breeding can spark new evolutionary traits.</p>

          <p>A key consumer protection for federally backed reverse mortgages, known as the "95% rule," can significantly impact a family's ability to retain a home. This rule stipulates that if heirs wish to keep the property after the borrower passes away or moves out, they only need to pay the lesser of the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value. This is crucial because accrued interest can cause the loan balance to exceed the home's worth. The rule ensures heirs are not forced to pay more than the property's value, providing peace of mind and predictability in estate planning. (not investment advice)</p>
