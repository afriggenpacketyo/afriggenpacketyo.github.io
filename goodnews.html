          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share amid economic headwinds by focusing on value-oriented promotions. CEO Russell Weiner stated the company is successfully attracting diners from competitors, including low-income customers, by offering deals on popular items, unlike rivals who discount less desirable products. While the company reported strong same-store sales growth, its overall earnings missed expectations due to a charge related to its China licensee. The strategy hinges on providing perceived better value than both fast-food rivals and eating at home. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR story details Alek Hermon's experience during the final days of his father's life, highlighting the profound impact of a nurse named Ray. While his father was in a coma, Hermon spent long, early morning hours at the hospital and initially held a negative judgment of the nurse. However, after the difficult decision to remove his father from life support, Ray, who was an assistant in the operating room, found Hermon in the hallway and embraced him in a moment of shared grief. This act of profound, unexpected kindness from a stranger provided immense comfort during an incredibly isolating and traumatic time.</p>

          <p>Author Joseph Lee's new book, "Nothing More of This Land," delves into the deep-rooted Indigenous history of Martha's Vineyard, an island often known only for its affluent summer visitors. As a member of the Aquinnah Wampanoag tribe, Lee explores the complexities of Indigenous identity on Noepe, the island's original name. The book discusses the challenges of preserving culture and land in a place that is both a sacred home and a luxury tourist destination. Lee shares personal experiences and examines the broader meaning of sovereignty, community, and belonging for Native peoples today.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece highlights the surprising efficiency of the U.S. State Department's new online passport renewal service. The author recounts receiving a new passport in just 14 days, a stark contrast to the expected lengthy bureaucratic process. This successful modernization of a government function is presented as a rare triumph in customer service, challenging the common perception of government inefficiency. The article credits the public servants who developed the system and suggests it serves as a positive model for other government agencies, benefiting millions of diverse Americans who hold passports.</p>

          <p>Musician Tyler, the Creator has released a new surprise album titled “Don’t Tap the Glass,” his second full-length project in less than a year. The 10-track LP follows his October album “Chromakopia” and features a funky, club-oriented sound produced entirely by Tyler himself. In a social media post, he explained the album was inspired by a conversation about the fear of being filmed while dancing in public. He encourages listeners to engage with the music through movement, stating the album was not made for "sitting still."</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues University Leaders Have Affirmed That Anti-Zionism is a Form of Antisemitism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that recent testimony from university leaders at UC Berkeley, CUNY, and Georgetown has provided crucial clarity on the campus debate over antisemitism. When asked directly, the leaders affirmed that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination—a core tenet of Zionism—is antisemitic. The author contends this recognition is a vital step in protecting Jewish students from discrimination and helps shift campus debates from arguments over Israel's existence to substantive discussions about its policies. The piece suggests this clarity can help foster more productive dialogue on a contentious issue.</p>

          <p>A brief article from The Economist describes the protocol for launching an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), dispelling the myth of a single red button. The actual process is a complex, redundant system designed to prevent any single individual or crew from initiating a launch or blocking a legitimate one. It involves multiple missileers in separate underground bunkers simultaneously turning keys and levers after decrypting and verifying official orders. This highlights the extensive safeguards built into the nation's nuclear command and control infrastructure to ensure security and prevent unauthorized use of the weapons.</p>

          <p>A new article explores the potential of GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, to treat polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Women with PCOS who have taken these drugs report significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight management issues, which are often linked to insulin resistance. While research is still in early stages, small studies suggest the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss can help regulate hormones and alleviate PCOS symptoms. However, high costs and lack of insurance coverage remain significant barriers for many patients.</p>

          <p>With college costs steadily rising, many students rely on federal student loans, but it's crucial to understand their borrowing limits. This article provides a breakdown of the maximum annual and lifetime amounts available, which vary based on dependency status, year in school, and whether a student is an undergraduate or graduate. For instance, a dependent first-year undergrad can borrow up to $5,500 annually, while the lifetime limit for all undergraduate loans is $31,000. Since these amounts may not cover the full cost of attendance, students often need to explore private loans to bridge the remaining financial gap. (not investment advice)</p>

Backed by several crypto investment firms, The Ether Machine is part of a growing trend of entities replicating MicroStrategy's bitcoin accumulation strategy for the ether market.

          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four hours, smartphone addiction is a growing public health concern linked to anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. This article outlines scientifically-backed methods to reduce problematic usage, which is now recognized as a behavioral addiction. Recommended strategies include creating physical distance from the device, such as leaving it out of the bedroom, and reducing its rewarding nature by turning off notifications or using a black-and-white screen. For more severe cases, therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help address the root causes of the addiction and retrain compulsive behaviors.</p>
