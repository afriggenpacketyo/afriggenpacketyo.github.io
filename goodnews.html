          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that its online services will experience disruptions until July due to a cyberattack that occurred over the Easter weekend. The retailer estimates that this attack will reduce profits for the current year by around ¬£300 million, a significant hit to their financial outlook. CEO Stuart Machin stated that while there is no change to the company's long-term strategy, the incident allows M&S to accelerate the pace of change. The ransomware attack is believed to be the work of Scattered Spider, utilizing tools from the cyber-crime service DragonForce.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer in an effort to encourage residents to use air conditioning without worrying about costs amid increasingly extreme heat. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike announced that a supplementary budget bill, including 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) to cover the costs, will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly session in June. This plan is expected to benefit about 8.2 million households, saving them around 5,000 yen on their water bills over the four months. Metered water usage will still be charged as usual.</p>

          <p>Indian writer, lawyer, and activist Banu Mushtaq has become the first author writing in the Kannada language to win the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp.' The collection, translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India. Judges praised Mushtaq's characters as "astonishing portraits of survival and resilience". Mushtaq's work mirrors many of the challenges faced by the women in her stories, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society.

          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses are reporting that doing business in China has become increasingly difficult, citing regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and a perceived depreciation of foreign firms in China‚Äôs evolving industrial policy. Despite these challenges, British firms continue to demonstrate substantial engagement with and commitment to the Chinese market. Escalating tensions between China and the US have compounded the issue, causing many firms to delay investments not just in China, but globally with any China exposure. The British Chamber of Commerce in China is calling for a more favorable policy environment with clear and fairly enforced rules.</p>

          <p>Japan‚Äôs agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage with a remark that he had never bought a bag of rice, his nation‚Äôs staple grain, which is currently in short supply. The comment drew attention to the government‚Äôs inability to resolve the rice shortage, which has driven up the cost of a food consumed by almost every Japanese household. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto‚Äôs resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister in an effort to contain the political fallout. The shortage has been blamed on decades-old policies meant to protect small-time farmers, blocking newcomers from buying or using agricultural land.</p>

          <p>Taku Eto, Japan's agriculture minister, resigned following criticism over his comment about not needing to buy rice due to gifts from supporters, which was seen as insensitive amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister to address public concerns. This comes as Japan posted a trade deficit in April and as the G7 aims for stability despite tensions over U.S. tariffs. Japan will also offer fast-track entry to South Koreans in June to mark the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties. The Kyodo News digest also highlights the achievements of mathematician Masaki Kashiwara, the rise in Japanese students studying abroad, and a sharp decline in Chinese smartphone exports to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed a bill into law legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients, making it the 11th state with such a statute. The End-of-Life Options Act allows mentally capable adults diagnosed with a terminal illness and given six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. Patients must be presented with other end-of-life care options, including palliative care and hospice. The law requires two waiting periods and a second medical opinion before a prescription can be obtained.</p>
