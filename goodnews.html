          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete, competed in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) track-and-field finals, winning first-place medals in high jump and triple jump and placing second in the long jump. The CIF implemented a policy change allowing an additional athlete to compete and earn a medal in events where a transgender athlete also qualified. The U.S. Department of Justice launched a Title IX investigation into transgender athlete participation in California high school sports. Protests occurred outside the stadium, with some holding signs that read "Save Girls Sports", and one person was arrested after an altercation. Despite the controversy, Hernandez's mother expressed pride and support, while some high school coaches offered encouragement.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter convicted for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon she received from President Trump, citing that accepting it would contribute to a false narrative. Hemphill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for unlawful parading and was sentenced to probation. She believes the pardons are inappropriate and damage Americans' views of the federal government. Unlike other January 6 defendants who sought copies of their pardons, Hemphill sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, with the Department of Justice acknowledging her non-acceptance.</p>

          <p>A woman on Reddit is seeking advice after offering a coworker rides to work, which led to unforeseen consequences due to the coworker's chronic tardiness. The woman and her coworker were written up twice, jeopardizing her job. When the poster told her coworker she could no longer drive her if she wasn't on time, the coworker accused her of being cold and ditching her. The poster feels taken advantage of and sought advice on how to handle the situation, with commenters suggesting she set a firm departure time or stop offering rides altogether.</p>

          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecast to make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., potentially reaching as far south as northern California and Alabama. The storm, spurred by a coronal mass ejection, could disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. Space weather officials detected a solar flare associated with the storm, and the aurora is expected to be best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>

At their annual convention, party activists discussed the need for bold policy and improved messaging on economic issues.

          <p>The UK government will announce a major defence review that includes plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines to replace the current fleet. The review recommends the armed forces move to "warfighting readiness" to deter growing threats. The government is also expected to confirm a ¬£15bn investment in its nuclear warhead programme. The new submarines are expected to support 30,000 jobs and apprenticeships, with construction beginning in the late 2030s.</p>
