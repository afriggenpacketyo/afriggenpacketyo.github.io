          <p>The Justice Department is dismissing Biden-era civil rights lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, deeming them overly broad. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated that the DOJ is closing investigations into several other police departments, retracting findings of constitutional violations. Dhillon argued that the consent decrees would impose years of federal micromanagement on local police departments and incur significant compliance costs without adequate legal basis. This decision marks a shift in federal oversight of local law enforcement, returning control to local communities.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canada Goose soared over 20% after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings surpassed analysts' expectations, although it withdrew its fiscal 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty. The luxury retailer cited unpredictable global trade and consumer spending patterns as reasons for the change. While tariffs are not a direct threat, the company is concerned about their indirect effects on the global economy. Canada Goose remains confident in its brand strength and ability to adapt to changing conditions, with most of its production currently compliant with USMCA regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require extensive clinical trials before approving them for broader use. This decision means that many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials for approval in healthy individuals aged 6 months to 64 years. Experts express concerns that these requirements may limit access to boosters for younger age groups due to the time and expense of clinical trials.</p>

Lowe's expects slight year-over-year gains in total sales and comparable sales, with continued growth in its pro business.

Telework also delivers cost savings and productivity gains, with organizations halving office footprints and employees reclaiming commute time.

          <p>The article discusses the use of camera traps in Mexico to monitor and protect jaguars, which are endangered in the region. The Northern Jaguar Project (NJP) has been working with ranchers to conserve jaguars by paying them for photos of the cats taken on their land. The program, called Viviendo con Felinos, has been successful in expanding the area across which jaguars and their prey are protected. By making living wild animals more valuable than dead ones, the project has helped shift the culture and customs of the region, making ranchers more tolerant of jaguars.</p>
