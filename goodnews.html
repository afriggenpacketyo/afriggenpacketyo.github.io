          <p>Oracle's stock experienced its best week since 2001, driven by a strong earnings report and optimistic projections for its cloud computing business.

CEO Safra Catz anticipates sales exceeding $67 billion for the upcoming fiscal year, surpassing consensus estimates. Oracle is rapidly expanding its cloud infrastructure, attracting clients like Meta and OpenAI, and plans to invest significantly in data centers to meet growing demand (not investment advice).

          <p>The presence of foreign flags at protests in Los Angeles against federal immigration raids has sparked debate, with some interpreting it as a sign of allegiance to foreign governments. However, observers argue that the flags, particularly those of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador, symbolize solidarity with immigrants and pride in their heritage. Mexican American satirist Lalo Alcaraz notes that the flag-wavers are often American citizens expressing support for their immigrant parents. This display contrasts with past demonstrations where organizers encouraged the waving of American flags to avoid complaints about foreign symbols.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The preliminary injunction prevents the government from removing Khalil due to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge cited potential irreparable harm to Khalil's career, reputation, and freedom of speech. However, the ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation for other reasons, such as alleged omissions on his green card application.</p>
