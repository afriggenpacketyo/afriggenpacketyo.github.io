          <p>Wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso will participate in England's summer tour despite a three-match suspension for a high tackle during a match against France A. He will miss the two Tests against Argentina but will be available for the match against the United States on July 19. Coach Steve Borthwick emphasized that the tour presents a valuable opportunity for the squad's continued development, especially for younger players experiencing overseas touring with England for the first time. Borthwick added that traveling together will help strengthen team bonds and integrate new players into the team's environment.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that his goal for the upcoming national election is for the ruling coalition to retain its majority in the House of Councillors. With rising living costs and inflation as key issues, the election will be a critical test for Ishiba, who has been leading a minority government. Ishiba dismissed cutting the consumption tax, advocating for cash handouts to struggling households, and emphasized the need for "win-win" relations in tariff negotiations with the United States. He also highlighted the difficulty of forming a coalition with other parties, requiring agreement on every policy.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and Kaiser Permanente, plan to streamline the prior authorization process to expedite patient care. The initiative aims to create a standardized online submission system, reduce the number of claims requiring prior authorization, and provide real-time responses to requests. The changes, set to take effect in 2026 and 2027, are intended to alleviate administrative burdens on doctors and reduce delays for patients. AHIP estimates that these efforts could benefit over 250 million Americans, although the real impact will depend on the experiences of patients and physicians.</p>

          <p>Existing home sales saw a marginal increase of 0.8% in May, according to the National Association of Realtors, although prices reached a record high. Sales were strongest in the Northeast but declined in the West, with high mortgage rates continuing to be a significant factor. Despite a substantial increase in housing supply, prices remain elevated due to strong demand, with the median price of an existing home reaching $422,800. Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, anticipates that lower interest rates in the second half of the year could stimulate home sales.</p>

          <p>Home sales in the U.S. experienced their slowest May in 16 years, with existing home sales falling 0.7% compared to the same month last year, although sales were up slightly, 0.8%, from April. Affordability remains a key challenge, with median home prices significantly outpacing wage gains, while sales activity is running at 75% of pre-COVID levels. Despite a more than 20% increase in the number of homes for sale, prices have continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace, with the median single-family home price up 1.3% from May 2024. The Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cuts later this year could provide some relief to the market.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a 10-year industrial strategy that includes plans to lower energy costs for businesses by exempting them from certain green energy levies. The measures could reduce energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses, alongside other plans aimed at boosting growth. The strategy includes improving workers' skills, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending. While manufacturers have welcomed the plans, the hospitality sector has expressed disappointment at its exclusion, with concerns raised about the impact of the government's Employment Rights Bill on growth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the next policy meeting in July if inflation pressures stay muted. Bowman's comments align with those of fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting that Trump's tariffs are likely to have a temporary and muted impact on prices. Bowman supported the change in the post-meeting statement, noting diminished policy uncertainty and a focus on potential labor market weakness. Traders are assigning a 23% probability to a rate move at the July meeting, with a higher likelihood of a cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>
