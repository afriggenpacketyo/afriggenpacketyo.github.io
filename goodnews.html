          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition. This fulfills a campaign promise and marks a major victory for school choice advocates after years of effort. Starting next school year, families can receive $10,000 per year, with up to $30,000 for children with disabilities, though critics argue it will drain resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families. The program will be capped at $1 billion initially, potentially costing up to $4.5 billion annually by 2030.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's practice of selling citizenship to foreign investors, effectively banning the last "golden passport" program in the EU. The court deemed such schemes a "mere commercial transaction" that undermines the solidarity and mutual trust between member states. While Malta's Prime Minister vowed to rework the system, concerns remain about "golden visa" programs, which offer residence permits for investments and pose similar risks of money laundering and corruption. Transparency International hopes the momentum from ending golden passports will extend to regulating golden visas.</p>
