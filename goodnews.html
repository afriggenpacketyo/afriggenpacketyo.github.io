          <p>College football analyst Paul Finebaum has sharply criticized Bill Belichick's coaching performance at North Carolina, stating he is 'working toward being the worst coach in college football history.' The Tar Heels have started the season 2-3, including significant blowout losses to Clemson and UCF. A source close to the program described it as an 'unstructured mess' with 'no culture.' Belichick was hired after Mack Brown's departure, but his transition to the college game has been unexpectedly challenging, leading to widespread disappointment among fans and commentators.</p>

          <p>Joan B. Kennedy, the first wife of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, has passed away at the age of 89. A classically-trained pianist and former model, she endured a tumultuous marriage marked by family tragedies, her husband's infidelities, and her own battles with alcoholism and mental health. Despite standing by her husband through scandals, including Chappaquiddick, their estrangement led to divorce. Her son, Patrick Kennedy, highlighted her courage in publicly addressing her struggles, which helped to break stigma around mental health and addiction recovery, leaving a lasting impact on advocacy and the arts.</p>

The deal involves OpenAI committing to purchase 6 gigawatts of AMD chips, challenging Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market. Huang noted Nvidia's own $100 billion investment in OpenAI over the next decade, which allows direct sales to the ChatGPT creator. He also confirmed Nvidia's participation in xAI's funding round, emphasizing his eagerness to invest in Elon Musk's ventures. Huang views these investments as crucial for building global AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act introduces significant changes to the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption, making C corporation status more attractive for startups. The bill raises the capital gains exclusion cap from $10 million to $15 million for stock acquired after July 4, 2025, and allows for tiered exclusions after three or four years of holding. This reform aims to incentivize early-stage investment and provide greater flexibility for founders and early employees in realizing gains. It also increases the gross asset limit for qualifying C corps to $75 million, potentially boosting capital access for fast-growing ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged past $4,000 an ounce, reaching a record high, as investors seek safe haven assets amidst global economic and political uncertainty. The rally is attributed to President Trump's tariffs, delays in economic data due to the U.S. government shutdown, and a weakening dollar. Central banks have also significantly increased gold purchases since 2022, diversifying away from U.S. treasuries. Analysts warn that gold's value could fall if the shutdown ends quickly or if interest rates rise, but the current environment supports its upward trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a humanitarian mission with Doctors Without Borders in the Mediterranean, NPR's international team witnessed dolphins swimming alongside their rescue ship, the Geo Barents. This moment of natural beauty provided a much-needed respite for the crew, who were engaged in the exhausting and often traumatizing work of saving migrants. The ship rescued 258 individuals, many of whom had embarked on perilous journeys from Libya. The sight of the dolphins served as a poignant reminder that even amidst a cruel world, life and beauty can persist, offering a brief moment of uplift for those involved in critical humanitarian efforts.</p>

          <p>New research suggests an 'unusual' side effect of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, is becoming more common: abnormal patterns of FDG uptake in PET-CT scans. These altered patterns could lead to misinterpretations by doctors, potentially causing unnecessary tests, incorrect cancer staging, and treatment delays. Researchers from Alliance Medical found these issues during oncologic scans and are advocating for national and international guidance. Imaging professionals are advised to meticulously document patients' medication histories to prevent such diagnostic errors, ensuring accurate and timely care.</p>

This surprise proposal, delivered at the party conference, aims to boost home ownership and social mobility. The policy is estimated to cost around £9 billion, which Badenoch claims will be funded by savings from the welfare budget and foreign aid. While first-time buyers are already exempt for properties up to £300,000, this move would remove the tax entirely for primary residences, excluding additional properties and those purchased by companies or non-UK residents.</p>

Leavy, a veteran sportswriter, examines how the sport, rooted in the 19th century, struggles to captivate younger audiences with shorter attention spans. She acknowledges recent rule changes, like the pitch clock, have improved game pace and re-engaged some fans. However, Leavy advocates for further cultural initiatives, such as free admission for kids and postgame autograph sessions, to broaden its demographic appeal. The article also highlights a debate between traditionalists and data-driven strategists over preserving the 'human element' in the game.</p>

While ARMs offer immediate savings, they are considered riskier due to potential rate adjustments after a fixed term. Overall mortgage application volume fell 4.7%, with refinance demand down 8% and purchase applications down 1%.
