This contrasts with the previous standard of approving shots based on antibody responses.

          <p>A new study using machine learning casts doubt on the theory that dark streaks on Mars are evidence of flowing water. Researchers analyzed over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images and found that the slope streaks were more likely associated with wind and dust deposition rather than liquid or frost. The findings suggest a dry origin for these features, potentially altering the search for habitable environments on the Red Planet. The study reviewed these features but found no evidence of water and our model favors dry formation processes.</p>

          <p>As a pediatrician, I spend a lot of time engaging with families about nutrition. My philosophy is simple: If you empower a child to embrace healthy eating habits early on, they are more likely to carry these positive behaviors into adulthood. Early intervention can be transformative and help substantially reduce their long-term risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Many parents already know the importance of feeding kids vegetables and limiting added sugar. We often discuss "eating the rainbow," emphasizing the need for a diverse range of colorful fruits and vegetables. Parents frequently prioritize dark leafy greens, antioxidant-rich blueberries and healthy-fat-packed avocados. However, there's one nutritional powerhouse that often gets overlooked: beans. Here's why I wish more parents fed this underrated superfood to their kids.</p>
