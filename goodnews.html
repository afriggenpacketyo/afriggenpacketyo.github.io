          <h2>Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment for 2026 Projected to be Lower Than Recent Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 15:08:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New projections indicate that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 may be the lowest in five years, potentially at 2.4%. This adjustment, which provides an annual inflation boost to Social Security beneficiaries, including retirees and disabled individuals, is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year. The CPI-W, which is used to calculate Social Security's COLA, has increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months. The actual COLA could change depending on inflation trends in the coming months, but if enacted, it would be the smallest increase since 2021.</p>

          <p>President Trump lauded the U.S.-Saudi relationship as a "bedrock of security and prosperity" during a visit to Riyadh, where the White House announced a $600 billion investment from Saudi Arabia, including a major defense sales agreement. Trump praised Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and highlighted Saudi Arabia's economic development, contrasting it with perceived failures of "western intervention" in other Middle Eastern countries. The agreements included judicial cooperation, defense modernization, and investments in U.S. data centers. Trump also stated his intention to normalize relations and lift sanctions on the new government in Syria.</p>
