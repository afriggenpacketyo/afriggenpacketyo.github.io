          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has not yet endorsed Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic socialist who won the New York City mayoral primary. While Jeffries congratulated Mamdani on running a successful campaign focused on the cost of living, he stated they do not know each other well and need to have a substantive conversation. Jeffries plans to meet with Mamdani to discuss his vision for the city before making any decision on an endorsement, reflecting a cautious approach from party leadership.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans requiring food businesses in England to make healthy food more accessible and appealing to customers. As part of a strategy to combat obesity, major retailers will partner with the government, potentially using promotions, loyalty points, and store layouts to encourage healthier choices. While the health secretary praised the collaborative approach, critics have labeled the initiative as "nanny state" intervention, arguing it is not the government's role to dictate consumer purchases.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued four people after their 61-foot sailboat caught fire approximately one mile off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. A witness reported that the vessel was engulfed in flames quickly, accompanied by what sounded like several explosions. All four individuals were safely evacuated to a bystander's boat and brought to shore without any injuries, while another vessel assisted in extinguishing the fire. The cause of the blaze is currently under investigation by the U.S. Coast Guard and state wildlife officials.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will evaluate the most suitable governing framework for his coalition following the critical House of Councillors election in July. Securing a majority in the upper house is a "must-attain" goal, though he acknowledges it will be challenging amid voter concerns over inflation and economic uncertainty. The election is seen as a public verdict on his minority government, which is grappling with issues like rising prices and the economic impact of U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite statistics showing Gen Z is having less partnered sex than previous generations, a new analysis argues they are the most sexually progressive generation in history. The article posits that this generation is not anti-sex but is instead redefining it, rejecting traditional expectations and infusing sexuality with political meaning, particularly in a post-Roe v. Wade landscape. By challenging concepts like virginity and traditional gender roles, Gen Z is actively reshaping societal norms around sex, desire, and identity, even as they navigate a politically charged environment.</p>

For instance, workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 have a median balance nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. The report also highlights the effectiveness of automatic enrollment, which has boosted median balances for long-tenured employees by approximately 60% compared to those who had to opt-in voluntarily.

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the Labour government mishandled the rollout of its welfare reform bill after facing a major backbench rebellion that forced significant concessions. The government reversed plans to cut Personal Independence Payment (Pip) for existing claimants and will now review the assessment process, a move that has satisfied most rebel MPs. Streeting stated the government is now in a "better position" to pass the reforms, which are aimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability of the welfare system.</p>

          <p>In a commentary, activist and writer V (formerly Eve Ensler) reflects on the challenge of resisting despair in a climate of authoritarianism and injustice. She argues that survival depends on embracing duality‚Äîfeeling pain without being immobilized by it‚Äîand directing rage into purposeful action. Drawing inspiration from activists in the Congo and the U.S., she calls for building community, taking direct action to care for one another, and believing that maintaining one's humanity is a powerful form of resistance against forces that seek to dehumanize.</p>
