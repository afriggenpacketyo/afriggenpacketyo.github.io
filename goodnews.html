          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new AI Action Plan to ensure U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. The plan includes over 90 federal actions, such as expediting data center construction, supporting semiconductor plants, and updating the electric grid. It also aims to eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI systems by setting new rules for government contractors and compel federal agencies to repeal regulations that hinder AI development. The initiative, championed by Trump's AI Czar David Sacks, seeks to bolster the nation's competitive edge against countries like China.</p>

          <p>Retail traders, largely coordinating on social media platforms like Reddit, have driven significant stock price increases for GoPro and Krispy Kreme. This speculative activity mirrors the 2021 GameStop phenomenon, targeting companies with high short interest and relatively low share prices. GoPro shares surged 15%, while Krispy Kreme rose 5%, as traders appeared to shift focus from previous targets like OpenDoor. This "junk rally" is occurring amidst a broader market upswing, fueled by optimism over recent trade news and economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a pair of legal decisions, Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia is set to be released from criminal custody in Tennessee, and federal immigration authorities have been barred from immediately detaining him. A Tennessee judge denied the Justice Department's request to keep Abrego Garcia detained pending his human smuggling trial. Concurrently, a Maryland federal judge ordered that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) must provide 72 hours' notice before initiating any removal proceedings, ensuring he is not swiftly deported. The rulings allow Abrego Garcia to return to his family in Maryland under supervision while his criminal case proceeds.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes a 15% tariff on Japanese imports, a reduction from the previously threatened 25%. President Trump stated that Japan will also invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to American products like cars and rice. The agreement resolves weeks of tense negotiations and has provided a political boost for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose position was precarious. Following the announcement, shares in Japanese automakers surged, reflecting optimism in the industry.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Costs of a $100,000 Home Equity Loan Versus a Personal Loan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 14:36:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow a large sum like $100,000, a home equity loan is currently a significantly cheaper option than a personal loan due to lower interest rates. With average home equity loan rates around 8.3-8.4% and personal loan rates near 12.65%, the savings are substantial. Over a 15-year term, for example, choosing a home equity loan could save a borrower over $47,000 in total interest compared to a personal loan. While both offer fixed rates, the secured nature of a home equity loan allows for more favorable borrowing terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hasbro has exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter expectations, largely due to the strong performance of its digital gaming division. Revenue from games like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go! grew 16%, helping to compensate for a 16% decline in its traditional consumer products segment. The company's toy business has been negatively affected by tariffs and shifting retailer orders. Despite reporting a net loss of $855.8 million, attributed to a large goodwill impairment, the company's adjusted earnings were strong, leading Hasbro to raise its full-year financial guidance.

          <h2>President Trump Considers Eliminating Capital Gains Tax on Primary Home Sales</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on the profits from selling a primary residence. This move, which Trump suggested could boost the housing market, would remove a tax currently levied on profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for joint filers. The idea follows the introduction of a similar bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who argues it would help homeowners, especially seniors, and address housing shortages. However, tax policy experts suggest that a complete elimination is unlikely and that raising the existing exemption thresholds is a more probable outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review of the Bregenz Festival in Austria praises the event's ambition, particularly its spectacular lakeside opera productions. This year's main outdoor attraction is a flamboyant staging of Carl Maria von Weber’s “Die Freischütz,” featuring a massive, gothic-inspired set on a stage built directly on Lake Constance. In contrast, the festival also presented a powerful, more conventional production of George Enescu’s rarely performed opera “Oedipe” indoors. The article notes the festival's large scale and budget, which draws hundreds of thousands of visitors, but also mentions a looming 30% cut in government funding.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his House seat in the 17th Congressional District. Lawler, who had been considered a potential challenger to incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul, stated his decision was based on the importance of maintaining the Republican House majority. His district is a key battleground that was critical to GOP control in past elections. The decision narrows the potential field of Republican gubernatorial candidates, where Rep.
