        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates steady, specifically holding the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. This decision follows the monetary easing measures implemented last month aimed at stimulating economic growth amidst trade tensions with the United States. Chinese authorities had previously cut lending rates for the first time since October by 10 basis points, and several commercial banks also reduced deposit rates to safeguard their net interest margin. Recent remarks from Chinese policymakers suggest satisfaction with the current monetary policy stance, indicating a potential shift towards alternative methods to stimulate economic growth.

          <p>Hunan has become the first province in China to utilize special-purpose bonds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, allocating 20 billion yuan for this year. This adjustment to the annual fiscal budget marks a shift in how these bonds, typically used for revenue-generating construction projects, are being used. The funds will be distributed based on outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing cities and counties to complete construction, clear obligations, and reduce fiscal risk. While seen as a positive step, the allocated sum may be insufficient compared to the scale of local government debt, raising concerns about which arrears will be prioritized and which firms will receive payments.

One player described the experience as "a bit weird" and expressed his desire to focus on playing football rather than politics.

          <p>Eric Dane, battling ALS, appeared with filmmaker Janell Shirtcliff at a premiere, sparking confusion about his relationship status. While reports suggest Dane and Shirtcliff have been in an on-and-off relationship, another source claims Dane is exclusively dating Priya Jain. This comes after Dane's estranged wife, Rebecca Gayheart, recently called off their divorce and is described as his "stalwart supporter." The situation is reminiscent of Dane's past controversy involving a nude bathtub video with Gayheart and another actor.</p>

          <p>A former plantation in Harpersville, Alabama, is being transformed into a space for healing, art, and reparative history. The Wallace Center for Arts and Reconciliation is collaborating with a narrative studio to recenter the stories of Black descendant communities through creative storytelling. The initiative includes an exhibit called "Out of Whole Cloth," which tells the stories of free people in post-Emancipation Alabama. The project aims to address the romanticization of antebellum sites and promote a deeper understanding of shared humanity.</p>

          <p>A former manager of an El Cajon company pleaded guilty to hiring undocumented workers and received a sentence of one year of unsupervised release with no jail time. The case stemmed from a federal investigation that included an undercover agent and an armed raid at the business. The manager admitted to communicating with other managers about employees with "bad paperwork." The attorney for the manager criticized the federal authorities for using excessive resources to investigate and raid the business.</p>

          <p>Labubu, an elf-like creature from Chinese toy maker Pop Mart, has become a global sensation with celebrity endorsements and long queues for purchase. The word Labubu doesn't mean anything, but it is the name of a character in ‚ÄúThe Monsters‚Äù toy series created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung. The Labubu dolls have appeared in several series of "The Monsters", such as "Big into Energy", "Have a Seat", "Exciting Macaron" and "Fall in Wild". Pop Mart's profits have almost tripled in the past year due to the dolls' popularity, contributing to Chinese soft power.</p>
