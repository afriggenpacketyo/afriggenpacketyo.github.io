          <p>South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix has announced its readiness to mass produce next-generation HBM4 chips, which are critical for advanced artificial intelligence computing, including Nvidia's highly anticipated Rubin architecture. This significant technological advancement positions SK Hynix ahead of its main rivals, Samsung Electronics and Micron Technologies, in the competitive high-bandwidth memory market. The news has propelled the company's stock to an impressive rally, increasing its market capitalization by over $80 billion since the beginning of the year. SK Hynix expects to double its HBM sales for the current year compared to 2024, forecasting continued robust demand from the AI sector well into 2026, underscoring its pivotal role in the global technology landscape.

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper is beginning to challenge SpaceX's dominant Starlink in the satellite-powered internet market, securing its first in-flight WiFi contract with JetBlue, despite Starlink's existing airline partnerships. Kuiper, with 102 satellites in orbit, has a significant gap to close compared to Starlink's thousands, but aims for 3,236 by 2029. The market is rapidly expanding, with an estimated 70,000 low Earth orbit satellites planned by 2031, driven by the anticipated rollout of 6G communications and the need to connect 2.5 billion people lacking internet access. Amazon's entry injects fresh competition into this burgeoning sector, which promises to revolutionize global connectivity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Housing Secretary Steve Reed has reiterated the government's firm commitment to building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, a central pledge from Labour's general election manifesto. Reed vowed to dismantle barriers hindering construction and hinted at sanctions for developers who delay projects, though specific measures remain undefined. Industry leaders, however, warn of "huge challenges" due to escalating costs, rising taxes, and persistent delays in planning application processing. The government is also exploring various options to house asylum seekers without exacerbating pressure on the already strained housing market, indicating a multi-faceted approach to the housing crisis.</p>

          <p>California's Assembly has passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and significantly expand high-density housing near public transit hubs. The legislation, which allows for buildings up to nine stories adjacent to certain transit stops, aims to tackle the state's severe housing affordability crisis. Critics argue that the bill represents an overreach, stripping local authorities of their ability to manage responsible growth and potentially altering single-family communities. However, the bill gained crucial momentum after a powerful labor group reversed its opposition in exchange for amendments ensuring union hiring on specific projects, boosting its prospects of becoming law.</p>
