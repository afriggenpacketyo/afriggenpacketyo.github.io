        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, gaining crucial access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. Chevron's CEO, Mike Wirth, stated the ruling affirms that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers and acquisitions. Following the news, Chevron's shares saw initial gains before closing slightly lower, while Exxon's stock fell more than 3%.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States, specifically targeting the $250 billion stablecoin market. The bipartisan bill aims to provide clear rules for issuing dollar-backed stablecoins, which the administration believes will strengthen the U.S. dollar and upgrade the financial system. During the signing ceremony, Trump celebrated the legislation as a fulfillment of his promise to make the U.S. a leader in financial technology. The move is seen by the crypto community as a significant step towards mainstream adoption and validation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced that nearly 60,000 metric tons of food aid are in the process of being distributed worldwide, countering reports that stockpiled supplies were being incinerated. Officials clarified that all food expiring before October 2026 has already been programmed for delivery to crisis areas, including Syria and Sudan. This response comes after criticism over the destruction of about 500 tons of emergency food and a broader restructuring that saw USAID's functions absorbed by the State Department. The department emphasized its commitment to efficiently managing and delivering life-saving assistance under its new operational model.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis from the Tax Policy Center indicates that the newly enacted "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will result in an average tax saving of approximately $2,900 per household in 2026. The legislation extends many provisions of the 2017 tax cuts while adding new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on tips and overtime. However, the report highlights that the benefits are disproportionately aimed at higher-income households, with the top 20% of earners expected to receive about 60% of the total tax relief. Lower-income families are projected to see a much smaller relative benefit from the new tax structure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 15:30:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly signed GENIUS Act represents the first major piece of U.S. federal legislation governing cryptocurrency, focusing specifically on stablecoins. These digital currencies aim for stability by pegging their value to assets like the U.S. dollar, making them potentially safer for payments than more volatile cryptocurrencies. The law establishes clear regulations and consumer protections, allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. This framework is expected to increase public trust and accelerate the integration of stablecoins into mainstream financial services, aligning with the Trump administration's goal of promoting the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that a majority of high-income individuals, earning $300,000 or more annually, still struggle with credit card debt, often due to lifestyle inflation. This article outlines several debt relief options tailored for these earners, who typically have strong credit scores and greater financial leverage. Strategies include using debt consolidation loans to secure lower interest rates, leveraging 0% APR balance transfer cards, and negotiating directly with creditors for rate reductions. Seeking guidance from a financial advisor is also recommended to create a personalized plan that addresses complex financial situations and underlying spending habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Historical Overview of Queerness Across Different Cultures and Eras</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical exploration of queerness, tracing its acceptance and persecution through various societies and time periods, from antiquity to the modern day. It highlights how figures like Leonardo da Vinci navigated societal norms and how ancient cultures, such as those in Rome and Greece, had different conceptions of same-sex relationships. The narrative contrasts this with the severe punishments and stigmatization that arose with the spread of Christianity, which often used biblical stories to condemn non-binary identities. The piece also touches on the concept of a third gender in various cultures and the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights today.</p>

          <p>American Express revealed that its affluent customer base continues to spend freely, with a 7% increase in total card spending for the second quarter, matching the previous quarter's growth. However, the company noted a specific weak spot in travel, as spending on airline tickets remained flat compared to last year, primarily due to lower domestic economy airfare prices. While premium cabin and luxury hotel bookings remain strong, the stall in airline spending is a point of concern for investors. Despite beating profit and revenue expectations, Amex shares fell amid concerns about increased competition in the premium card market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Texas Roadhouse have recently declined as accelerating beef inflation poses a challenge to the steakhouse chain's operating margins. Beef prices saw a significant 15% year-over-year increase in the second quarter, a sharp rise from the previous quarter. Despite these commodity price pressures, analysts at Bank of America raised their price target for the stock, citing the company's strong traffic trends and continued market share gains in the full-service steak category. The long-term outlook remains positive, though the industry is waiting for cattle inventory and herd sizes to rebuild and stabilize prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author Philippa Langley, known for her role in discovering the remains of King Richard III, now claims to have solved the 500-year-old mystery of the two princes who disappeared from the Tower of London. Contrary to the popular narrative, immortalized by Shakespeare, that Richard III had his young nephews murdered, Langley's decade-long "Missing Princes Project" has reportedly unearthed evidence that both princes survived. Her research, detailed in a new book, challenges the historical account she attributes to Tudor propaganda. While some historians remain skeptical, Langley argues the burden of proof now lies with those who claim the princes were killed.</p>
