          <p>Egg freezing is rapidly gaining popularity as a way for women to preserve fertility, shifting from a niche medical procedure to a mainstream option. The process involves hormone injections and a surgical retrieval, costing an average of $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage and future IVF fees. While celebrated as empowering, experts caution that it is not a guarantee of future motherhood, with success rates varying based on age and the number of eggs frozen. The article explores the emotional, financial, and ethical dimensions of the technology, which some bioethicists argue masks larger societal issues that pressure women to delay childbirth.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis suggests that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could be achieved within the next decade, potentially revolutionizing society. He predicts AI will accelerate drug discovery to the point of curing all diseases and could eliminate scarcity, leading to an era of "radical abundance." The article showcases advances like the AI assistant Astra and the world-building model Genie 2, which can create interactive 3D environments from images. While optimistic, Hassabis also acknowledges the significant risks, including misuse by bad actors and the challenge of ensuring advanced AI systems remain aligned with human values.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City metropolitan area, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the minor quake, which caused brief shaking and startled residents but resulted in no reports of significant damage or injuries. While earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, this event follows a more notable 4.8 magnitude quake that occurred in the same region in April 2024. Officials and seismologists reassured the public that a quake of this size is not considered a major threat.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines Boeing 787 bound for Munich experienced a left engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, prompting the pilot to declare an emergency. The flight, carrying 219 passengers and 11 crew members, safely returned to Dulles where it was met by emergency personnel. No injuries were reported, and the airline confirmed the diversion was due to a mechanical issue, subsequently canceling the flight and arranging alternative travel for passengers. The incident highlights the effectiveness of pilot training and emergency protocols in ensuring passenger safety during a critical in-flight event.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash cloud 27,000 feet into the air. The eruption occurred just days after a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region, leading seismologists to believe the seismic activity may have triggered the volcanic event. An aviation alert was issued for the area, which is sparsely populated and poses no immediate threat to local communities. Researchers are studying the connection between the powerful quake and the subsequent eruption on the highly volcanic peninsula.</p>

          <p>Electronics manufacturer Amphenol is reportedly close to finalizing a deal to acquire the connectivity and cable division of CommScope Holding for approximately $10 billion, including debt. The Wall Street Journal reported that the transaction could be announced as soon as Monday, marking a significant consolidation in the communication network infrastructure sector. This potential acquisition follows CommScope's previously reported exploration of a sale for its largest unit by revenue. The move would significantly expand Amphenol's portfolio, building on its prior purchase of CommScope's wireless network businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Marvel film “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” remained at the top of the North American box office in its second weekend, earning $40 million. However, this figure represents a steep 66% decline from its impressive debut, a more significant drop than other recent superhero films. The weekend's new releases, the animated comedy “The Bad Guys 2” and the parody “The Naked Gun,” secured the second and third spots with $22 million and $17 million, respectively. The film's global total has now reached $369 million, but its sharp domestic fall raises questions about its long-term box office endurance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has emerged as a leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity last year than traditional powerhouse California. This growth is driven primarily by utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on favorable economics and streamlined regulations for projects under 75 megawatts. However, the boom faces headwinds from new federal policies rolling back tax credits, which is expected to cause a sharp decline in rooftop solar installations. Despite policy uncertainty, the low cost of solar compared to natural gas continues to make it an attractive option for large-scale energy production. (not investment advice)</p>
