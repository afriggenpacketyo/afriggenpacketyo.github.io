          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that she declined U.S. President Donald Trump's offer to deploy American troops into Mexico to assist in combating drug trafficking. Sheinbaum emphasized that Mexico's sovereignty is not negotiable, highlighting a potential point of contention between the two nations despite existing cooperation on immigration and trade. Trump's administration has been increasing military presence along the U.S.-Mexico border and designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, and Sheinbaum stated that cooperation is possible, but each country must operate within its own territory. The White House National Security Council affirmed Trump's close collaboration with Mexico while underscoring the ongoing threat from foreign terrorist organizations and the need for Mexico to intensify its efforts against these groups.</p>

          <p>Government data reveals that Japan's child population has decreased for the 44th consecutive year, reaching a new record low of 13.66 million as of April 1, with the ratio of children to the overall population falling to 11.1 percent. Despite government initiatives to combat the declining birth rate, such as financial assistance and expanded daycare services, the trend persists, with the child population decreasing in all 47 prefectures. This long-term decline highlights Japan's ongoing struggle to reverse its demographic challenges, as the country's child population has been falling continuously since 1982 after peaking in 1954.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a rerun of its presidential election after the original vote in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities and alleged Russian interference. The annulled vote saw far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly leading in the first round, and he is now banned from standing in the rerun. Allegations include the use of social media to spread pro-Georgescu messages as part of a "Russian hybrid attack." The election is seen as crucial for Romania's pro-Western orientation, with candidates like Nicusor Dan and Crin Antonescu emphasizing the importance of maintaining ties with the EU and NATO.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the recent panic surrounding baby food pouches and ultra-processed foods (UPFs), arguing that it is another way of making mothers feel guilty. The author, Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, points out that the focus on personal responsibility overlooks broader social, political, and economic factors that influence food choices. Cosslett argues that the criticism of convenience foods like pouches is often weaponized in ways that disproportionately impact women, particularly working mothers, and fail to account for structural inequalities of class, gender, race and disability.</p>

The gene therapy works by modifying the patient's own cells to help them create the missing protein needed to help the body fight infection, giving the boy a working immune system.
