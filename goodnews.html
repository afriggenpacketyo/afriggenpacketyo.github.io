          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland for prolonged negotiations regarding tariffs that threaten the global economy. President Trump stated that "great progress" was made and that a "total reset" was negotiated in a friendly manner, with the goal of opening China to American business. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated initial discussions focused on de-escalation, as the current tariff levels are unsustainable. Both sides hope to scale back tariffs, relieving financial markets and companies dependent on U.S.-China trade, though some analysts doubt any substantive results will emerge from the Geneva meeting.</p>

          <p>Willie Eugene Sims, 69, was arraigned on murder charges in San Jose, California, nearly 50 years after the strangulation of Jeannette Ralston in 1977. The case went cold due to a lack of credible leads, but investigators never gave up. A break came when the F.B.I.'s upgraded fingerprint search algorithm matched Sims' thumbprint on a cigarette carton found at the crime scene. Investigators also used DNA evidence and an old sketch to link Sims, who was an Army private at the time of the murder, to the crime.</p>
