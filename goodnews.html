        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Competition between the United States and China is intensifying in global supply chains, potentially benefiting eight developing countries over the next five years. Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, India, and Brazil are poised to gain from the relocation of manufacturing from China, offering lower labor costs and strong trade ties with Western markets. This shift is driven by Washington's "friendshoring" efforts and the "China+1" strategy, encouraging multinationals to diversify production to reduce tariff exposure. Chinese firms are also exploring lower-cost regions, particularly within the Belt and Road Initiative, leading to a reshaping of global supply chains.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is increasingly relying on prescribed burns to mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires by reducing the amount of flammable vegetation. The state has set an ambitious goal to deliberately burn at least 400,000 acres of wilderness each year, primarily managed by federal agencies. However, budget cuts to these agencies could hinder these efforts, prompting California to increase its forest management budget. Prescribed burns require careful planning and coordination due to safety concerns and regulatory hurdles, but experts emphasize their importance in maintaining ecosystem health and preventing destructive wildfires.</p>

          <p>Assisted stretching is gaining popularity, with studios like StretchLab and Stretch Zone expanding across Los Angeles. This practice involves a trained therapist, or 'flexologist,' stretching clients to improve flexibility and mobility. While not a replacement for medical professionals, assisted stretching can offer benefits such as increased range of motion and stress relief. Experts recommend consistent sessions for long-term results, though the sports medicine community debates the overall benefits of stretching, and the financial cost can be a barrier for some.</p>
