          <p>Actress Sophie Turner, 29, has publicly declared her desire to permanently reside in her native England, expressing a profound sense of belonging and an increased appreciation for the integral role of family and friends in her well-being, a sentiment she didn't fully realize while living in the United States. This decision follows her relocation two years ago after the finalization of her four-year marriage to singer Joe Jonas. Turner, known for "Game of Thrones," also highlighted how motherhood has positively influenced her career, allowing her to bring more depth to her work. The article recounts the details of her divorce, including a heated custody battle where she was initially portrayed negatively in tabloids, and the judge's declaration that the marriage was "irretrievably broken."</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has developed southeast of Bermuda and is currently tracking north-northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean. As of Sunday evening, the storm was positioned about 295 miles east of Bermuda, maintaining maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. Forecasters anticipate Fernand will experience some strengthening through Monday before likely beginning a weakening trend on Tuesday, consistently remaining over open waters and not posing an immediate threat to land. This article highlights that Fernand follows Hurricane Erin, which formed in a similar region on August 15, aligning with NOAA's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season this year.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has escalated to an estimated $750 million, positioning it as the game's 10th-largest grand prize, following the absence of a winner in Saturday's drawing. The substantial jackpot offers an estimated cash value of $338.6 million for the next drawing, scheduled for Monday evening. Although the grand prize remained unclaimed, the article notes that several tickets secured other significant prizes, including three that successfully matched all five white balls. With the odds of winning the top prize standing at 1 in 292.2 million, public interest and anticipation are rapidly building around this considerable sum, which has not been won since May 31.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is gearing up for the 10th test launch of its colossal Starship rocket, recognized as the largest rocket ever constructed, from its facility near Boca Chica Beach in Texas. This upcoming flight aims to rigorously test the two-stage rocket's massive booster through a series of burns, hovering maneuvers over the Gulf of Mexico, and a controlled water landing. Concurrently, the rocket's upper stage will undertake a suborbital flight, attempting to deploy simulated satellites. This launch is particularly significant as it follows a series of recent failures, including a loss of control and a preflight engine explosion. Despite these setbacks, the Starship program remains pivotal for NASA's ambition to land astronauts on the moon by 2027 and for Elon Musk's long-term goal of establishing a human colony on Mars.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer presents his "Monday playbook" for investors, analyzing the stock market's robust rally driven by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent signal for interest rate cuts. Powell's pivot, influenced by a significant deceleration in hiring, overshadowed earlier concerns about tariffs, shifting the market's calculus. Cramer delves into various sectors, offering strategic insights on the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, housing-related companies, industrials like DuPont and Honeywell, and enterprise software. He highlights the non-monolithic nature of these large tech firms and the outrageously bullish narrative for housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs. The article also discusses the impact of political dynamics, such as President Trump's influence on the Fed and specific companies like Intel. (not investment advice)</p>

The massive purchase occurred when he was traded from the Miami Heat to the Phoenix Suns and needed to furnish an entirely empty apartment immediately. O'Neal, known for his lack of patience, filled numerous carts with a comprehensive list of items including multiple TVs, laptops, and various appliances. Following the double decline, American Express security contacted him, suspecting his card had been stolen due to the extraordinary transaction size. O'Neal then had to personally confirm that he was the one making the record-breaking purchase.
