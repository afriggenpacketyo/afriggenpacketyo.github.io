        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Trump administration's pullback on federal regulations, the fight to protect consumers from medical debt has shifted to state legislatures. While some states like Maine have successfully passed bipartisan measures to bar medical debt from credit reports, similar bills have failed in more conservative states due to industry opposition. Advocates are concerned about the growing problem, especially as millions are expected to lose insurance coverage, making state-level action increasingly critical for patient financial security.</p>

          <p>The Keeneland September Yearling Sale achieved a record $531.7 million in sales, a surge attributed by breeders to tax incentives from President Trump's recent tax and spending bill. A key provision is the reinstatement of 100% "bonus depreciation," allowing buyers to write off the full purchase price of a racehorse in the first year. This significant tax advantage has made the speculative business of horse racing more attractive to investors, leading to highly competitive auctions and record-high prices for yearlings.

This shift is intended to transform the brand's image from a snack and soda stop into a destination for fresh meals, capitalizing on the growing American appetite for Asian food culture.</p>

Soliman, who fled Egypt in 2014, described his detention in an Ohio jail as traumatizing and dehumanizing, fearing he would be deported and tortured. His release is seen as a significant victory against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, and he hopes to have his asylum status fully restored and return to his work.</p>

          <p>The U.S. office real estate market is experiencing a significant recovery, with transaction volume rising 42% year-over-year to $25.9 billion in the first half of 2025, according to JLL data. Investor interest has shifted from "office curious" to "office serious," driven by lower interest rates and a flight to high-quality properties. With very little new office construction in the pipeline and companies stabilizing their space needs, both leasing metrics and property valuations are expected to rise in the coming years.

          <h2>Trump Administration Nears Deal to Transfer TikTok's U.S. Operations to American Investors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly close to finalizing a deal that would place TikTok's U.S. operations under the control of a consortium of American investors, including Oracle and potentially Fox Corporation. This move would resolve long-standing national security concerns over the app's Chinese ownership while preventing an outright ban, a reversal of President Trump's previous stance. The agreement would involve the new U.S. entity leasing TikTok's powerful algorithm from its parent company, ByteDance, effectively creating a separate American version of the popular social media platform.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that U.S. Latino immigrants contributed $1.6 trillion to the nation's GDP in 2023, part of an overall U.S. Latino purchasing power of $4.1 trillion. The study, conducted by Arizona State University economists, shows that the Latino GDP grew by 50% from 2015 to 2023, far outpacing the 17% growth for non-Latinos. This economic expansion is driven by increased education, entrepreneurship, and consumption, but experts warn that mass deportation policies could severely undermine this growth and negatively impact the broader U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>A notable internet trend has emerged where users willingly share embarrassing or foolish moments, a phenomenon dubbed "embarrassment porn." From travelers accidentally boarding flights to the wrong continent to people broadcasting their social faux pas, this content thrives on a shamelessness that contrasts with the curated perfection of previous social media eras. This article explores how this trend reflects a generational shift, where owning one's mistakes is seen as relatable and can even build social currency, blurring the lines of what is considered "cringe" in an increasingly chaotic digital world.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Guardians have made baseball history by overcoming a 15.5-game deficit to take sole possession of first place in the American League Central division. After defeating the Detroit Tigers 5-1, they became the first MLB team to erase such a large deficit to lead a division or league. The team's remarkable turnaround has been fueled by an 18-5 record in September and a dominant starting pitching rotation, which has allowed two or fewer runs in 19 consecutive games.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to unveil the "Pride in Place" program, which will provide extra funding to over 330 "overlooked" communities to rejuvenate high streets and local areas. The plan also aims to empower local councils to block the opening of unwanted betting and vape shops and make it easier for communities to buy and save local assets like pubs and libraries. The Labour government says this initiative will put power into the hands of local people, though the Conservative opposition argues the investment will be negated by tax hikes.</p>

          <p>A recent study found that nearly half of Americans lack a written financial plan, a gap that working with a financial advisor can help bridge. For those unsure where to start, experts recommend interviewing at least three different professionals to find a good personal and professional fit. Key steps include conducting background checks through regulatory bodies like FINRA, asking direct questions about their process and compensation, and ensuring they have relevant credentials, such as the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation, to handle one's specific circumstances.

          <p>A diplomatic spat between the U.S. and Norway over the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's divestment from Caterpillar seems to be easing, according to Norway's foreign minister. The $2 trillion fund sold its stake in the U.S. company due to its equipment being used by Israel for the destruction of Palestinian property in Gaza and the West Bank, a move that troubled Washington. Norwegian officials have since clarified to their U.S. counterparts that the decision was made independently by the central bank's ethics watchdog, not the government, which appears to have settled the issue.</p>
