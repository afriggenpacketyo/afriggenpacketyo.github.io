          <p>Former Obama speechwriter David Litt's new book, *It's Only Drowning*, explores his unlikely friendship with his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a truck driver and Joe Rogan fan, through surfing. Litt, a Yale-educated liberal, initially struggled to connect with Kappler due to their differing backgrounds and ideologies. However, learning to surf together provided a neutral ground for connection and understanding. Litt reflects on America's deep political and cultural divisions, arguing that shared activities can bridge divides and foster empathy. He suggests focusing on neutral topics rather than contentious political issues to build relationships with those holding different views.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates today are showing mixed movement, with longer-term rates slightly decreasing while shorter-term rates are increasing. According to Zillow, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate decreased by four basis points to 6.77%, while the 15-year fixed rate increased by nine basis points to 6.05%. The Federal Reserve's decision to hold off on a rate cut is contributing to the volatility in the market.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers initially faced criticism for their silence regarding immigration raids in Los Angeles, with some accusing the team of prioritizing profits over community support. After public pressure, the Dodgers announced a $1 million commitment to assist families impacted by the raids, partnering with the city and local organizations. The article highlights the team's complex relationship with its Latino fanbase, suggesting that the Dodgers have historically profited from their support without adequately addressing community concerns.

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is urging the House of Lords not to block a bill giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death, following its passage in the House of Commons. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the Lords' role is to scrutinize but not oppose the bill. Critics, including Lord Shinkwin, express concerns that the bill could lead to vulnerable individuals being coerced into ending their lives. The bill proposes strict safeguards, including multiple assessments and declarations, to ensure that only mentally competent, terminally ill adults with a life expectancy of less than six months are eligible.</p>

The club is interested in Villareal striker Thierno Barry, and Everton has taken steps to streamline their process, moving away from a director-of-football model following the departure of Kevin Thelwell to a sports leadership team headed by new chief executive Angus Kinnear.
