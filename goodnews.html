          <p>An inmate in Wisconsin has confessed to writing threatening letters to President Donald Trump in an attempt to frame Ramon Morales-Reyes, a migrant who was also incarcerated. The inmate, Demetric Deshawn Scott, aimed to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying against him in an upcoming trial for allegedly physically assaulting him. Scott admitted to investigators that he knew including Trump in the threat would involve the Secret Service and lead to Morales-Reyes' arrest and deportation. Morales-Reyes was initially accused by the Department of Homeland Security of making the threats, but a handwriting test cleared him. </p>

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warns that Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services can be detrimental to consumers, with some users described as 'playing with fire'. While BNPL firms like Klarna and Affirm are partnering with major retailers, concerns are rising about overspending and debt accumulation. Critics argue that these services normalize debt and target vulnerable consumers, potentially leading to financial instability. Financial experts advise that BNPL should be treated as debt and used responsibly, with consumers carefully considering their ability to repay on time to avoid fees and interest.

          <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a nationwide system used to measure air pollution severity and associated health risks, utilizing six color-coded categories ranging from 'good' to 'hazardous'. The Environmental Protection Agency calculates the AQI based on five major pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act, including ground-level ozone and particulate matter. Higher AQI values indicate greater health risks, with 'very unhealthy' levels posing risks to the general public and 'hazardous' levels indicating an air quality emergency. Real-time AQI data is available through the EPA's AirNow.gov site, providing information on pollutant levels, at-risk populations, and safe activity recommendations for specific areas. </p>

          <p>McDonald's is reintroducing snack wraps to its U.S. menu in July, aiming to boost sales after a slow start to the year, with U.S. same-store sales declining 3.6% in the first quarter. The snack wraps, discontinued in 2016, will feature McCrispy Strips in spicy and ranch flavors. This move is part of McDonald's broader strategy to expand its chicken offerings, capitalizing on the growing popularity of chicken-based fast-food chains. The return of snack wraps could intensify competition in the fast-food industry, particularly in the chicken segment. </p>

          <p>A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Pepto Bismol, commonly used to prevent travelers' diarrhea, showed no significant difference compared to a placebo in preventing loose stool or diarrhea symptoms.

While bismuth subsalicylate is FDA-approved for treating diarrhea, the study suggests it may not be effective for prevention, though further research is needed.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining higher interest rates to combat inflation, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have become a more attractive borrowing option, but variable rates make affordability a concern. Experts advise borrowers to be conservative when tapping into their home equity and to consider worst-case scenarios for rate increases. It's important to know how much you need and to decide if you can pay more than the minimum, as HELOCs typically only require interest payments during the draw period. By carefully planning for repayment and understanding the risks, borrowers can make informed decisions about HELOC affordability.  (not investment advice)</p>
