          <p>A plant-based gel called TRAUMAGEL, invented by Joe Landolina when he was 17, is now being used by first responders to save lives by stopping severe bleeding in seconds. Developed from polymers extracted from algae, the gel can be injected into traumatic wounds to quickly form a bond with tissue and control hemorrhaging. A fire department in Cobb County, Georgia, recently used the product to save one of its own firefighters who sustained a severe hand injury. The technology is also being studied by the U.S. Department of Defense for potential applications in treating traumatic brain injuries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing an executive order that will create a formal designation for "state sponsors of wrongful detention," enabling the U.S. to impose sanctions and other penalties on countries that illegally detain or take American citizens hostage. The measure, modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism list, aims to deter the practice of using detained Americans as political leverage. The move is supported by families of past victims, such as that of Robert Levinson, who died in Iranian custody. It follows several high-profile prisoner swaps with nations like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, 59, and undefeated champion Floyd Mayweather, 48, have announced they will face each other in a boxing match in the spring of 2026. While many details like the date, location, and specific rules are yet to be confirmed, Mayweather has referred to the bout as an exhibition, meaning it likely won't affect their professional records. The announcement has generated significant buzz, raising questions about the weight class and whether non-standard rules, such as shorter rounds, will be implemented given the fighters' ages. The event continues a trend of high-profile exhibition fights featuring retired boxing icons.</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock price jumped 15% after the company announced it had secured a new $10 billion order for custom artificial intelligence chips from a fourth major customer. While Broadcom did not name the client, analysts widely believe it to be OpenAI, following reports that the two companies co-designed a chip set to be released next year. This massive order significantly boosts Broadcom's AI revenue forecast and solidifies its position as a key player alongside Nvidia in the booming AI hardware market. The company's other major AI clients are thought to be Google, Meta, and ByteDance. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, current mortgage rates remain a significant factor in affordability. As of early September, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is approximately 6.58%, while a 15-year loan averages around 5.76%. Refinance rates are slightly higher. While these rates are elevated compared to recent years, experts suggest they may stabilize if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. To secure the best possible rate, borrowers are advised to maintain a strong credit score and compare offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's government has unveiled a new action plan aimed at bolstering its domestic electronics manufacturing industry and achieving greater self-sufficiency in its supply chains. The move is a direct response to tightening U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology. The plan, issued by two government ministries, emphasizes the strategic importance of the sector for national security and economic stability. It calls for the development of advanced core technologies and prioritizing the use of domestically produced equipment to fill critical gaps and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.</p>

          <h2>A Look at Current Interest Rates for Home Equity Loans and HELOCs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 09:21:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners looking to tap into their property's value are finding home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) to be relatively affordable borrowing options. As of early September, the average interest rate for a HELOC is 8.10%, while 10-year home equity loans average 8.37%. These rates are considerably lower than those for personal loans or credit cards, making them an attractive choice for financing large expenses. With home equity levels high, these products offer a viable financial tool, though homeowners must remember their property serves as collateral for the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a colossal new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be valued at up to $1 trillion over the next decade. The package would award Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion. The plan also includes targets for vehicle delivery, robotaxi production, and the manufacturing of its Optimus humanoid robot. This proposal follows a Delaware judge's decision to void his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 after a legal challenge from investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>European Markets Rise as Weak U.S. Jobs Report Bolsters Hopes for Fed Rate Cut</h2>

          <p>European stock markets climbed on Friday after a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report fueled investor speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. The data, which showed only 22,000 jobs were added in August, increased the market-perceived probability of a September rate cut to nearly 100%. This sentiment overshadowed negative corporate news, such as Danish wind farm developer Orsted lowering its earnings guidance. The market's positive reaction highlights how poor economic news can be interpreted as a bullish signal for equities if it prompts central bank stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>
