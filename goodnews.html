          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho, a record-winning sumo wrestler, is set to retire from the Japan Sumo Association on June 9, following approval at an extraordinary board meeting. The Mongolian-born Hakuho, now known as elder Miyagino, will hold a press conference upon his return from Mongolia. The Miyagino stable has been closed since April 2024 after a protege was found to have physically abused junior wrestlers, leading to the transfer of wrestlers and elders to the Isegahama stable indefinitely. Hakuho retired from competition in September 2021 after winning 1,187 matches, more than any other wrestler in sumo's history.</p>

          <p>Project:Camp, founded in 2018 by Mikey Latner, is providing free day camps in Southern California to help children cope with the stress and disruption caused by wildfires. The camps offer typical activities, such as arts and crafts, along with trauma-informed approaches, including mental health professionals who volunteer to address emotional issues. The disruption of routines and communities by the wildfires has taken a toll on children's mental health, with some experiencing increased anxiety, nightmares, and mood swings. Parents have expressed gratitude for the normalcy and support the camp provides to their children during a difficult time.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have engineered a new type of rice, dubbed "tea rice," that is enriched with catechin, the antioxidant compound found in green tea. This rice aims to provide the health benefits of tea without the caffeine-related side effects. Catechins are known for their antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardioprotective properties. Researchers suggest that this innovation could offer a convenient way to incorporate these beneficial micronutrients into the diet.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to create the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The initial focus will be on redesigning routes in and around London, allowing planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly. The plans also aim to reduce aviation's climate change impacts and pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis. Cagne, a community aviation and environment group for Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, has warned the plans could mean there would be new flight paths over houses that are not currently affected.</p>

          <p>Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh, a British-born Sikh princess, openly lived in a same-sex relationship in 1900s Germany and used her privilege and resources to help Jewish families flee Nazism. Her actions, often unacknowledged, involved writing letters of recommendation, providing financial support, and guaranteeing immigration documents. During the Nazi regime, Catherine helped several Jewish individuals and families escape persecution in Germany and start over in Britain. Her legacy is being recognized through a forthcoming Kensington Palace exhibition and a biography detailing her extraordinary contributions.</p>

          <p>A new book, The Family Dynamic, explores how sibling relationships influence life trajectories, considering factors like birth order and individual achievements. While eldest children may score higher on cognitive tests, sibling influence extends beyond simple archetypes, impacting personal choices and emotional development. Age gaps between siblings can further complicate these dynamics, with younger siblings learning from the experiences of their older siblings. Siblings act as vivid mirrors, reflecting both the best and worst traits, fostering self-awareness and challenging flaws.</p>

          <p>Germany's former foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, is nominated to become the new president of the United Nations General Assembly for one year in September. Baerbock's appointment ruffled feathers, as Germany had previously nominated diplomat Helga Schmid for the post. Baerbock's three years as foreign minister were marked by momentous international crises, which necessitated a tireless work rate. During her time in office, she showed herself a strong supporter of sending military supplies to Ukraine, a country she visited nine times.</p>

Mo'unga likened Leitch to a "big brother" whose influence was felt throughout the Toshiba-owned club, based in the western Tokyo city of Fuchu. Head coach Todd Blackadder said the joint leadership provided by Mo'unga and Leitch had been the bedrock for Brave Lupus as they became the first two-time champions in the League One era. Leitch described the star playmaker had embraced life in Fuchu among his new Brave Lupus teammates.</p>
