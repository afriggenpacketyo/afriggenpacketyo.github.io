          <p>Oracle's stock price jumped 13% to a record high after the company reported strong earnings and a positive forecast driven by growth in its cloud business. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year to $15.9 billion, surpassing analyst estimates, while adjusted earnings per share also exceeded expectations. Oracle's cloud infrastructure is expanding to compete with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, with Chairman Larry Ellison highlighting the astonishing growth rate in multi-cloud environments. The company faces the challenge of meeting client demand in cloud despite capacity constraints (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) revealed new details about its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, scheduled to ship next year, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressing excitement about the technology. The MI400 chips can be assembled into a full server rack called Helios, enabling thousands of chips to function as a unified "rack-scale" system. AMD is planning to compete against Nvidia on price, with executives citing lower power consumption and "aggressive" pricing for their chips. AMD's rack-scale technology also enables its latest chips to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell chips.</p>

          <p>Chime's shares jumped 37% in their Nasdaq debut after the online banking services provider priced its IPO above the expected range, valuing the company at $11.6 billion. The IPO raised about $700 million, with existing investors selling an additional $165 million worth of shares. While the valuation is lower than the $25 billion valuation from a 2021 fundraising round, Chime's offering signals a reopening of the fintech IPO market. CEO Chris Britt said Chime serves Americans earning $100,000 a year or less, offering services to help them avoid fees and build credit.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar index has hit a three-year low, prompting investors to consider the implications of the weakening greenback. A weaker dollar generally benefits U.S. companies' overseas business by increasing foreign buyers' purchasing power, though it may also increase costs for imported supplies. The travel industry could see a shift, with international travel becoming more expensive for U.S. citizens and relatively more affordable for foreign tourists visiting the U.S. While currency fluctuations are a factor, investment decisions are primarily driven by company-specific and industry-related considerations (not investment advice).</p>

The wreck is believed to be a merchant ship sailing from northern Italy loaded with ceramics and metal bars before it sunk.
