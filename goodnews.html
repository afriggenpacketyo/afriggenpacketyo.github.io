          <p>Train services on Tokyo's Yamanote Line resumed Friday morning after being suspended due to problems with pantographs, which connect carriages to overhead power lines. The suspension caused widespread disruption for commuters, with 141 trains canceled on the Yamanote Line and Keihin-Tohoku Line, affecting around 197,000 people. Services on the Keihin-Tohoku Line, which were suspended on a section running near the loop line, had fully resumed. Additionally, the Keiyo Line experienced temporary suspensions due to smoke seen on the tracks at Hatchobori Station.</p>

          <p>BYD has overtaken Tesla in European battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales for the first time in April, selling 7,231 units, a 169% year-on-year increase, while Tesla's sales fell by 49% to 7,165 units. This shift highlights BYD's growing influence in the European EV market, despite significant tariffs on cars imported from mainland China. Overall, BEV sales in Europe accounted for 17% of new car registrations in April, up from 13.4% the previous year, with Chinese carmakers driving much of this growth. The rise of Chinese EV manufacturers in Europe signals increasing competition and a changing landscape in the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>The term "DEI hire" is becoming a playground taunt, reigniting old grievances and creating a climate where previously unsayable sentiments can be confidently voiced. This phenomenon feeds into the lurking sense that someone has a job that could have been yours, fostering doubt even among outwardly confident individuals. The article underscores the risk of these prejudices spilling into real-life conversations and emphasizes the importance of ensuring equal treatment and opportunities for all, regardless of background. It is a reminder to make an effort to keep Britain different from America, where these sentiments are more widespread.</p>

However, FEMA later stated that a comprehensive review found that certain courses provide effective training, restoring in-person programs at the academy and other related institutions.
