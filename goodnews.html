          <p>A U.S. district judge has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants is unlawful. The decision allows approximately 1.1 million migrants from these nations to maintain their legal status to live and work in the U.S., citing dangerous conditions in their home countries. The Department of Homeland Security, which called the program a "de facto amnesty program," has indicated it will appeal the ruling from the "unelected activist judge."</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot approaches $1.8 billion, a new analysis shows significant disparities in lottery spending across the United States. Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 annually on tickets, while North Dakotans spend the least at just $50. The report suggests accessibility in urban areas contributes to higher spending, noting that lottery sales constitute a notable portion of state revenue, reaching up to 3% in states like Rhode Island.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially endorsed Representative Ashley Hinson in her 2026 campaign for the Iowa Senate seat being vacated by retiring Senator Joni Ernst. Hinson, who is in her third term, launched her campaign by positioning herself as "President Trump's top ally." The endorsement from Trump, along with support from Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, solidifies her status as the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in a state that has trended increasingly conservative.</p>

          <p>A new draft of a major cryptocurrency bill in the U.S. Senate includes a provision to prevent tokenized stocks and other traditional securities from being regulated as commodities. The update to the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 aims to establish clearer jurisdictional lines between the SEC and the CFTC for digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hope that the bill could reach the president's desk by the end of the year, though it still requires bipartisan support to pass. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching $1.8 billion, a certified public accountant advises potential winners on the crucial decision between a lump sum payment and a 29-year annuity. While the lump sum offers immediate control for investment, it can be "dangerous" due to overspending, whereas the annuity provides a "safe bet" against losing the fortune quickly. The expert strongly recommends that any winner should remain anonymous, assemble a team of legal and financial advisors, and prioritize paying off all debts before making major lifestyle changes.

The move follows several high-profile cases where Americans were detained in countries like Russia and Iran and later released through prisoner swaps, and was praised by families of former detainees.</p>
