          <p>The initial public offering (IPO) market shows signs of recovery, potentially benefiting Goldman Sachs' investment banking segment, which contributes significantly to its revenues. Recent successful IPOs, such as eToro's debut, have renewed optimism after a period of subdued activity due to factors like trade tensions and economic uncertainty. Cooling trade tensions and a pause on tariffs have emboldened companies to consider going public, with digital health companies also planning IPOs. The article suggests that continued market stabilization is necessary for a sustained rebound in IPOs, and while some experts remain cautious about the long-term trend of companies choosing to go public, Goldman Sachs is poised to benefit from increased dealmaking activity (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that appealing property taxes can lead to significant savings by ensuring accurate assessments. Properties are often over-assessed due to inaccuracies like incorrect square footage or outdated information about home features. Appealing involves demonstrating how the assessor incorrectly applied the assessment formula, which requires comparing your property to similar homes in the neighborhood and checking for eligibility for tax exemptions. The article provides steps to appeal, including verifying assessment accuracy, comparing with neighbors, understanding exemptions, and meeting appeal deadlines, offering homeowners a path to potentially reduce their property tax burden.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that flamingos' seemingly odd feeding behavior is a sophisticated application of fluid dynamics. The birds create vortices in the water with their head bobbing, chattering bills, and webbed feet, stirring up prey and trapping it for consumption. This allows them to effectively filter feed on shrimp and algae, turning what appears to be a clumsy process into a highly efficient technique. The findings could inspire improvements in human technologies like water filtration systems.</p>
