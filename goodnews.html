          <p>Former North Carolina basketball star Rashad McCants shared his insights on the NBA Finals, predicting Indiana will win in seven games due to their coach's strategic acumen and Oklahoma City's inexperience. McCants emphasized Tyrese Haliburton's team-oriented play over Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's individual prowess when building a team. He also recounted his experiences playing with Kevin Garnett, highlighting Garnett's work ethic and attention to detail, comparing him to Kobe Bryant. McCants touched on the transfer portal in college athletics, advocating for more structure and accountability for athletes receiving compensation, and also discussed Michael Jordan's presence around the UNC program during his time there.</p>

          <p>WWE's recent events in Los Angeles, including Worlds Collide and Money in the Bank, garnered significant attention but also sparked mixed reactions. Worlds Collide, featuring stars from AAA, broke viewership records and was celebrated as a successful integration of Mexican wrestling culture. However, Money in the Bank faced criticism for its ladder matches and controversial outcomes, particularly regarding the winners of the briefcases. The surprise return of R-Truth, now known as Ron Killings, during the main event provided a positive moment for fans, potentially salvaging the event's overall reception, although the company's initial decision to let him go was met with immense fan backlash.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2bn to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a "landmark decision" to kickstart economic growth and the "biggest nuclear building programme in a generation". However, the project faces opposition from groups like Stop Sizewell C, who believe it will prove costly and add to consumer bills. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband asserts nuclear energy will deliver a "golden age of clean energy abundance" and boost the UK's energy security, despite concerns over delays and cost overruns with similar projects.</p>

Additional contributions can go up to $5,000 annually, and the funds can be used for expenses like college or a down payment on a home when the children reach adulthood (not investment advice).</p>
