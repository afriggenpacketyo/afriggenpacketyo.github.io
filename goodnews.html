        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses the complexities of prostate cancer screening, prompted by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s recent diagnosis. Guidelines advise against screening after age 70 due to the risk of false positives and unnecessary treatment, but many men continue screening in consultation with their doctors. The article highlights that even with regular screening, aggressive prostate cancers can develop undetected. Experts emphasize that the PSA test is not perfect and fast-growing cancers can arise between screenings, making early detection challenging even with access to high-quality medical care.</p>

          <p>Google is introducing an "AI Mode" that integrates chatbot capabilities into its search engine, aiming to provide users with a conversational expert experience. Unveiled at the company's annual developers conference, this move is part of Google's effort to compete with ChatGPT and other AI services. Google also announced plans for augmented reality glasses and a subscription AI tool. Analysts suggest the chatbot will minimize the number of web pages users need to browse and enable more complex queries, potentially impacting Google's revenue model as it becomes more efficient at answering questions but less efficient at generating clicks.</p>

          <p>The FDA will approve updated COVID-19 vaccines this fall for seniors and high-risk groups but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials for broader use. This decision means many healthy Americans may not have access to updated shots. The FDA's new leadership aims to balance rapid access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence for those at average or low risk. Vaccine manufacturers are urged to run randomized studies, especially in adults aged 50-64 and children under 5, to provide reassurance about the benefits of repeat boosters.</p>

Before broader approval, the FDA anticipates new clinical trials with participants under 65, following them for at least six months.
