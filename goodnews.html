          <p>Researchers in China have developed an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles consisting of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are currently blurred due to light scattering, the lenses have shown promise in recognizing patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals. The developers suggest potential applications in surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations, although critics argue that existing night vision devices are more effective.</p>
