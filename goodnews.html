          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence is publicly advising President Donald Trump against raising the tax rate on wealthy Americans, cautioning that such a move would negatively impact small business owners. Pence argues that most individuals filing taxes of a million dollars reinvest the money back into their companies. He advocates for making the Trump-Pence tax cuts permanent to foster economic growth. Pence also credited Trump for his victory in the last election, securing the southern border, and restoring the military, while expressing concerns about straying from conservative principles.</p>

          <p>Fox News co-host Jeanine Pirro will leave the network after being appointed as interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., following the withdrawal of Ed Martin's nomination. Pirro, a former district attorney and judge, is a staunch supporter of President Trump and has been a vocal presence on Fox News. Her nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, comes with the complication of her being a defendant in the Smartmatic defamation lawsuit against Fox News. Once confirmed, Pirro will transition from her role in media to a high-profile position within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that he will replace his controversial pick for U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. Martin's nomination faced strong opposition in the Senate due to his connections to Nazi sympathizers and his legal defense of Jan. 6 Capitol rioters. Trump expressed disappointment over the situation but stated that he would find another position for Martin within the Justice Department. Senator Thom Tillis voiced concerns about Martin's involvement with the Capitol riot, influencing the decision to withdraw his nomination.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would nominate Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., after withdrawing his initial choice, Ed Martin. Pirro, a former district attorney, has been a staunch supporter of Trump and has earned his trust. Her nomination resolves a difficult situation for the president, as Martin's term was set to expire, and the position would have been filled by federal judges if a successor was not named. Pirro's appointment has been met with controversy due to her past false statements about the 2020 election, which were part of a lawsuit against Fox News.</p>

Biden blamed Trump for tanking a bipartisan border security bill and admitted he should have done more to promote his agenda. He also expressed that he could have defeated Trump if he had remained in the race, but he wasn't surprised by Kamala Harris's loss due to sexism and the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden criticized Trump's first 100 days and foreign policy views, dismissing Trump's claims about the validity of his pardons.</p>

          <p>Federal judges ruled that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents when it drew congressional lines, violating the Voting Rights Act. The court ordered the state to continue using a court-ordered map that led to the election of Alabama's second Black congressman. The judges stated that the map drawn by the Alabama Legislature in 2023 unlawfully dilutes Black voting strength. The decision comes after a February trial over the state map, with the judges criticizing Alabama's deliberate decision to ignore their order to draw a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing.</p>

          <p>The UK government is determined to project trade deals in real-world terms, focusing on workers and industry rather than charts and percentages. Sir Keir Starmer's deal with the US may offer better trading conditions for some than were available a few days ago, but they aren't necessarily better than six months ago. The American might, garnished with Trumpian brute force, has hurried along these negotiations. The UK hasn't had to dilute its Digital Services Tax, and questions about the NHS or food standards haven't become embroiled in the arrangement. For the Prime Minister, walking towards political headwinds international and domestic, he can chalk this up as good news, if limited good news.</p>

In contrast, Scotland's representation has increased to eight players, while Ireland leads with 15 players in the squad. This shift reflects the changing fortunes of the different nations in the rugby world, with Ireland providing the most players - with Andy Farrell opting for 15 of those he coaches in his usual role as Ireland head coach.</p>
