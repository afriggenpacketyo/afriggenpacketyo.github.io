          <h2>China to Resume Japanese Seafood Imports After Fukushima Wastewater Dispute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 23:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has agreed to lift its two-year ban on seafood imports from Japan, which was imposed due to concerns over the discharge of treated wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports set to resume once China completes its necessary procedures, which include participating in water sampling missions with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Japan will also register fishery processing facilities with Chinese authorities and provide inspection certifications confirming the absence of radioactive substances like caesium-137. China is expected to announce the resumption of exports from areas outside the Fukushima region soon. The ban was initially implemented in 2023, with China citing risks to its fishing industry and coastal communities. </p>

It took seven men and inflatable airbags to lift the boulder off him. Morris was hypothermic from the cold water but was rescued and spent two nights in the hospital for observation. </p>
