        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China Three Gorges Corporation has launched a pioneering thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, featuring two towers feeding a single turbine system, a global first. The plant utilizes nearly 27,000 mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto 200-meter towers, melting and storing salt at high temperatures to generate steam for turbines, ensuring continuous power even after sunset. This innovative dual-tower design is reportedly 25% more effective than single-tower systems, optimizing energy capture and reducing mirror requirements for significant cost savings. The development marks a significant advancement in renewable energy technology and efficiency.</p>

          <p>Citi's venture capital arm, Citi Ventures, has invested in BVNK, a stablecoin infrastructure company, as major U.S. banks increasingly engage with the cryptocurrency and digital asset sector. BVNK's technology facilitates global transactions using stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to fiat currencies and backed by real-world assets. The investment highlights stablecoins' potential for faster, cheaper, and 24/7 cross-border payments, with nearly $9 trillion in transactions over the past year. The U.S. GENIUS Act is seen as fostering a more favorable regulatory environment, encouraging banks like Citi and JPMorgan Chase to explore issuing their own stablecoins and tokenized deposits.

This initial phase entails the release of all hostages and Israel's withdrawal of troops to an agreed-upon line, with the Israeli government set to vote on the deal. While the agreement has been welcomed by hostage relatives and Gazans, crucial issues like Hamas disarmament and Gaza's future governance remain unresolved. Negotiations, brokered by U.S., Egyptian, Qatari, and Turkish mediators, aim to bring an end to the conflict and facilitate humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee is set to announce the Nobel Peace Prize winner, with exclusive BBC access revealing their secret deliberation process. This year, the decision is overshadowed by former U.S. President Donald Trump's persistent public claims that he deserves the award for his perceived peace efforts. Committee chairman Jorgen Watne Frydnes remains unfazed by external pressure, emphasizing the need for principled choices based on Nobel's 1895 will. While Trump has garnered support from some world leaders, experts suggest his administration's withdrawal from international institutions and other actions make his chances long, though a successful Gaza peace plan could change future prospects.</p>
