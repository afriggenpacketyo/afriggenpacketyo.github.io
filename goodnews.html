          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street forecasts, driven by a significant jump in revenue from its markets and banking divisions. The bank's net income rose 25% year-over-year, leading to a more than 3% increase in its stock price after the report. Despite the positive results fueled by market volatility, the company also noted a 16% increase in the cost of credit, citing a deteriorating economic outlook. The results come as CEO Jane Fraser continues her strategic turnaround plan for the financial institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, largely due to better-than-anticipated revenue from fixed income trading and investment banking. The bank's trading operations benefited from market turbulence, with fixed income revenue climbing 14% and equities trading revenue rising 15%. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the results but reiterated warnings about persistent economic risks, including trade uncertainty and geopolitical conflicts. The bank also raised its guidance for net interest income, a key indicator of profitability, suggesting confidence in its future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has received approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced artificial intelligence chips to China, a significant reversal of previous export restrictions. CEO Jensen Huang confirmed the decision, stating the U.S. government will grant licenses for the company to ship its H20 chips. The move follows intense lobbying from tech leaders who argued that limiting sales to the world's largest tech market hinders U.S. competitiveness and could push other nations toward China's AI technology. Washington had previously tightened controls on such technology, citing national security concerns over its potential military applications.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world's top-ranked golfer, offered a surprisingly philosophical perspective on his career, questioning the ultimate purpose and fulfillment derived from winning. Speaking before The Open, he described the joy of victory as lasting only a few minutes before the pressure of the next event begins. Scheffler emphasized that his family is his true priority and stated he would quit professional golf if it ever negatively affected his home life. While expressing love for the game's challenges, he asserted that professional golf is not a fulfilling life in the "deepest places of your heart."</p>

          <p>This week is pivotal for the cryptocurrency industry in Washington D.C., as the House of Representatives is set to vote on two key pieces of legislation. The GENUIS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, could become the first standalone crypto law if approved. However, the industry's main focus is the broader CLARITY Act, which establishes rules for whether a digital asset is a security or a commodity. While expected to pass the House, its future in the Senate is uncertain due to some lawmakers' concerns about potential conflicts of interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year, mortgage experts advise potential homebuyers to prepare now to take advantage of potentially lower borrowing costs. Key steps include researching the mortgage process, improving credit scores by paying down debt, and understanding different loan features beyond just the interest rate. Experts warn that when rates do drop, a surge of buyers could increase competition and drive up home prices, offsetting the benefit of a lower rate. Therefore, focusing on finding the right home and being financially prepared is more critical than trying to perfectly time the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed the largest-ever merger of two black holes, resulting in a new, single black hole approximately 225 times the mass of the sun. The discovery, made by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, pushes the boundaries of current understanding of how such massive celestial objects form. The two colliding black holes were themselves unusually large, suggesting they may have been the product of previous mergers. Researchers noted that the black holes were spinning near the maximum speed allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity, presenting a complex signal that will require years of study to fully comprehend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current economic climate, savers can secure strong returns on Certificates of Deposit (CDs), with top rates surpassing the national average and inflation. To get the best rates, experts advise looking beyond traditional brick-and-mortar banks to online banks, which typically offer higher yields due to lower overhead costs. Currently, an inverted yield curve means that short-term CDs, such as those with one-year terms, often provide higher interest rates than long-term ones. Financial planners suggest a strategy of "laddering" CDs with various maturity dates to balance high short-term rates with long-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>
