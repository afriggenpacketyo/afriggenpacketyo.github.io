          <h2>New Humanoid Robot Features Self-Swapping Battery for Continuous Operation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 15:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new humanoid robot, the Walker S2 by UBTech, can operate nearly 24/7 by autonomously swapping its own batteries. Designed for factory work, the 5-foot-3-inch robot walks to a station, replaces its depleted battery with a fresh one, and resumes its tasks in about three minutes. This innovation is part of China's significant investment in robotics and AI to advance its manufacturing sector and global competitiveness. The development signals a major step in automation, potentially transforming workplaces beyond factories into areas like warehouses and hospitals.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, averting a potential trade war ahead of an August 1 deadline. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a lower rate than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the American economy. The deal aims to bring stability and predictability to the major transatlantic trading relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bangladesh has placed an order for 25 aircraft from Boeing as part of a strategic effort to improve trade relations with the United States and ease the impact of tariffs. A senior commerce official said the move, along with increased imports of American goods like wheat and cotton, is intended to help narrow a $6 billion trade deficit with the U.S. The nation's key garments industry is particularly vulnerable to a potential 35% tariff hike from the Trump administration. This large aircraft purchase is seen as a significant step to defuse trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>
