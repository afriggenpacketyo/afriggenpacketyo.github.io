This decision comes after he led the team to a Europa League victory, their first trophy in 17 years, which he cited as a key factor in his choice.

The nomination is in recognition of his role in brokering a ceasefire agreement that ended a deadly border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol credited Trump's intervention, which included threats of trade repercussions, for successfully halting the fighting. This follows similar Nobel nomination suggestions from officials in Israel and Pakistan for Trump's other diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study led by Chinese scientists has uncovered the surprising evolutionary history of the potato, tracing its origins back to an ancient hybridization event. Researchers found that about nine million years ago, a forerunner of the modern tomato cross-bred with a tuberless, potato-like plant, leading to the development of the potato we know today. This discovery, detailed in the journal Cell, highlights that hybridization was a crucial driver for the evolution of tubers, the edible part that has made the potato a global food staple.</p>

          <p>In a Leagues Cup match, Los Angeles FC secured a 4-2 penalty shootout victory against Mexican club Pachuca after a 1-1 draw in regular time. Despite earning two points from the win, LAFC's chances of advancing in the tournament are minimal due to their overall point tally from two games. The match was eventful, featuring an early goal by LAFC's Dennis Bouanga and an equalizer from Pachuca's Elías Montiel. Both teams also had a player sent off after VAR reviews, adding to the drama of the contest at BMO Stadium.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court's decision to block U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting "roving patrols" in much of Southern California without reasonable suspicion. The ruling affirms a temporary restraining order that prevents agents from stopping individuals based solely on factors like race or location. The court rejected the government's claim that the injunction would irreparably harm its enforcement efforts. This decision is seen as a significant victory for civil rights groups and a blow to the Trump administration's deportation strategy.</p>

          <p>As wildfires affect popular holiday destinations in Greece, Turkey, and other parts of Europe, travel experts are offering advice to concerned tourists. Currently, the UK Foreign Office deems it safe to travel to these areas, which means standard travel insurance may not cover cancellations for those who simply prefer not to go. However, policies often cover disruptions if official advice changes or if a trip is directly curtailed by events like evacuations. Experts recommend travelers check their specific insurance coverage and communicate directly with airlines and hotels for potential bespoke solutions.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread online dating fatigue, new and existing dating apps are evolving their models to prioritize in-person meetings over prolonged digital conversations. Apps like Breeze are cutting out pre-date messaging, instead arranging a date at a partner venue once a match is made. This approach aims to reduce "ghosting" and the time wasted on talking stages that go nowhere. The trend reflects a broader shift in the industry, as major players like Tinder and Hinge also add new features to keep users engaged amid declining usage numbers.</p>

          <p>A truck carrying hot dogs spilled its entire load across a major highway in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, leading to significant traffic delays during the Friday morning commute. A mechanical issue caused the truck's trailer to be ripped open after scraping a concrete divider, scattering the sausages across the road. Cleanup crews faced a slippery challenge, with the fire chief noting the discarded hot dogs were considered garbage once they hit the pavement. A front-end loader was brought in to scoop the wieners into a dump truck for disposal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has attributed the pattern of increased summer flooding in northern China to the sun's decadal magnetic cycle. Researchers found that changes in solar activity influence the positioning of the monsoon rain belt, leading to a "south drought and north flooding" pattern across the country. The findings, published in the Journal of Climate, provide a new perspective on long-term climate patterns in the region. This understanding is crucial for improving climate predictions and managing flood risks in one of China's most populous areas.</p>

          <p>A new species of giant stick insect, measuring 15 inches long and weighing 1.6 ounces, has been discovered in a remote Australian rainforest, stunning researchers. The insect, named Acrophylla alta, is believed to be Australia's heaviest and is extremely elusive, likely living high in the forest canopy. The discovery highlights the vast undiscovered biodiversity in such habitats and raises concerns that some species may be lost before they are even identified. So far, only two examples of the massive insect have been found by scientists.</p>
