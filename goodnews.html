          <p>China has unveiled images of a new crewed tilt-rotor aircraft, its first of this type, which combines a helicopter's vertical takeoff capabilities with the higher speed and range of a fixed-wing airplane. The design suggests it is a manned vehicle, though this remains unconfirmed from the photos released. This development places China among the few nations developing such technology, which is noted for its significant mechanical complexity, high costs, and safety concerns, similar to the US V-22 Osprey.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive briefing on the White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy, which was attended by European leaders, aimed to shape U.S. policy regarding the war in Ukraine. The summit focused on establishing security guarantees for Ukraine and arranging future talks with Vladimir Putin, though Trump notably reversed his previous stance on needing a ceasefire first. The unified presence of the European delegation was a key factor in steering the discussions and presenting a coordinated front.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Open has reimagined its mixed doubles event, successfully attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu with a significant increase in prize money and a shorter format. While organizers aim to boost fan interest and create a primetime television spectacle, the changes have drawn sharp criticism from doubles specialists. Critics, including Jamie Murray, argue the new format devalues the Grand Slam title, functioning more like a lucrative exhibition that sidelines dedicated doubles players.</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized Artificial Intelligence to generate facial reconstructions of Welsh individuals who were convicted of crimes and transported to Australia in the 19th century. The project combined detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and, where possible, photographs of modern-day descendants to create profiles of what the convicts may have looked like. This application of AI offers a compelling visual connection to the past, illuminating the harsh justice system of the era where minor thefts often led to deportation.</p>

          <p>U.S. investors and private equity firms are increasingly channeling funds into Europe's top five soccer leagues, drawn by rapid revenue growth and soaring club valuations. This influx of American capital has fueled a rise in multi-club ownership models, which are now facing increased regulatory scrutiny from governing bodies like UEFA. To sustain growth, some leagues are exploring playing regular season games overseas to expand their commercial footprint and tap into new markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Travelers Increasingly Opt for Cooler 'Coolcations' Amid European Heatwaves</h2>

          <p>A travel trend known as "coolcations" is gaining momentum as tourists increasingly avoid traditional Mediterranean summer hotspots in favor of cooler destinations. This shift is driven by growing concerns over the blistering heatwaves and destructive wildfires sweeping across southern Europe, which are exacerbated by the climate crisis. While this trend may help alleviate overtourism in some areas, it poses significant economic challenges for southern European countries that are heavily reliant on peak-season tourism.</p>

          <p>Scientists have found that tiny flatworms called planaria could serve as a valuable replacement for lab rats in the development of treatments for schizophrenia and other mental health disorders. The research showed that the worms react to psychiatric drugs like haloperidol in a way that resembles the responses seen in mammals. This discovery could significantly reduce the number of rodents used in neuroscience research, offering a more ethical and efficient approach to studying brain conditions and testing new medications.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to the White House suggests it was a carefully managed diplomatic effort to project unity with President Trump and avoid the open conflict of their previous meeting. Zelenskyy's approach, which included wearing a suit and offering repeated thanks, appeared to successfully navigate the delicate situation. The primary outcome was not a concrete peace agreement but rather the strategic achievement of buying more time for Ukraine amid ongoing international negotiations.</p>

          <p>According to a new S&P report, China's exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with growth accelerating significantly following the U.S.-China trade war.

This trend indicates a strategic pivot by Chinese firms toward developing nations to mitigate risks from U.S. tariffs, potentially reshaping global commerce by increasing the importance of South-South trade.
