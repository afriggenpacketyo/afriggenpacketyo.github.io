        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent budget bill has significantly increased the flexibility of 529 college savings plans, which offer tax-deferred and tax-exempt growth for qualified educational expenses. The definition of "qualified expenses" has been expanded beyond traditional higher education to include costs for vocational programs, required continuing education, and professional licensing preparation. This change aims to alleviate parental concerns about unused funds, as the accounts now support a wider range of career paths and even allow a portion of leftover money to be rolled into an IRA. The article suggests considering state tax benefits, investment options, and fees when choosing a plan. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advocacy group The Senior Citizens League has projected a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026, based on the latest inflation data. This estimate is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase received in 2025, which raised the average retiree's monthly payment by about $49. The Social Security Administration will finalize the official COLA in October using inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively stable, some economists express concern that this moderate adjustment may not be sufficient to cover potential price increases later in the year, partly due to pressure from tariffs.

          <p>Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Bullish more than doubled in value during their New York Stock Exchange debut after the company raised approximately $1.1 billion in its initial public offering. The stock, which was priced at $37, opened at $90 and was later halted at over $102, reflecting strong institutional investor interest. Led by former NYSE President Tom Farley and backed by Peter Thiel, Bullish focuses on the institutional market, blending features of both centralized and decentralized finance. The successful IPO is part of a wave of crypto-related companies going public amid a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $50,000, choosing between a high-yield savings account and a money market account involves weighing their current interest rates and features. Both offer liquidity and higher returns than traditional savings, with top money market accounts currently offering a slightly better rate, potentially earning about $25 more over a year on a $50,000 deposit. However, since both have variable rates, these earnings could change if the Federal Reserve adjusts its benchmark rate. The article emphasizes that the difference in earnings is marginal, and the best choice depends on individual access to high-rate online banks and personal financial needs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis of an Incan khipu, a knotted cord device for record-keeping, reveals its primary strand is made of human hair, challenging previous assumptions about their creation. Researchers determined the hair's owner had a diet of common foods like legumes and tubers, rather than the meat and maize beer typical of the ruling class. This discovery suggests that khipu literacy and production were not exclusive to elites but were also practiced by lower-status commoners in the vast empire. The finding helps bridge the gap between ancient imperial khipus and more modern versions used by peasant laborers, providing a new perspective on Incan society independent of Spanish colonial accounts.</p>

          <p>A recent Siena poll shows Zohran Mamdani, the progressive Democratic nominee, widening his lead in the New York City mayoral race with a 19-point advantage over his closest rival, former Governor Andrew Cuomo. The poll places incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa far behind. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman endorsed by prominent left-wing figures, is now facing increased scrutiny over his credentials and personal finances, including his residency in a rent-stabilized apartment. In response, his campaign is shifting focus to a city-wide anti-Trump message, aiming to unify Democrats against what they frame as a common threat.</p>

          <p>A Certificate of Deposit (CD) remains an attractive option for savers, offering fixed interest rates that provide predictable, guaranteed returns even if market rates fall. For a substantial deposit of $75,000, the interest earned can be significant, ranging from approximately $1,650 on a 6-month CD to over $16,900 on a 5-year CD based on current top rates. Since CD rates are locked in upon opening, savers can secure today's high yields for the entire term, protecting them from anticipated future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The article highlights the safety and stability of CDs, which are FDIC-insured up to $250,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart is expanding its employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk and meat, as concerns about inflation are renewed by rising tariffs. The 10% discount, previously limited to produce and general merchandise, will now apply to 95% of items for its 1.6 million U.S. employees. In a memo, the company acknowledged that the expanded benefit was one of its most requested perks and makes a real difference for employees and their families. The move could also serve as a business strategy to boost employee spending at its own stores and aid in worker retention during a competitive labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while megacap technology stocks declined, signaling a market rotation. Investors are increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, a move that would particularly benefit smaller companies reliant on borrowing for operations and expansion. This optimism is fueled by recent economic data, including a cooler-than-expected inflation report and weaker job growth. The potential for lower capital costs is seen as a major catalyst for the small-cap sector, which has lagged behind the broader market over the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a record $1.21 trillion, many consumers are considering debt relief, but negotiating directly with creditors requires careful preparation. This article outlines three key considerations for those attempting a DIY approach: being persistent and prepared with documentation of financial hardship, understanding complex debt laws and negotiation strategies, and being aware of potential tax and credit score consequences. While handling negotiations personally can save on fees charged by professional services, a lack of knowledge can lead to unfavorable agreements or unexpected financial repercussions, such as a large tax bill on forgiven debt.</p>

The selected artists include actor Sylvester Stallone, rock band Kiss, country star George Strait, disco singer Gloria Gaynor, and actor Michael Crawford. This move caps a period of significant change at the cultural institution, where Trump recently appointed himself chairman of the board and replaced several board members. Having shunned the event during his first term, Trump's direct involvement and choice of honorees signal a new, more hands-on era for the prestigious awards.</p>
