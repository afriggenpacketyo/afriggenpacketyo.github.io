        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Greene King, Nick Mackenzie, has stated that coffee shops and food delivery services are emerging as new rivals to traditional pubs. He acknowledges that these businesses are competing for consumers' leisure time and money, especially as a growing portion of the population, particularly younger people, do not drink alcohol. To adapt, the pub chain is enhancing its non-alcoholic beverage options and improving its food and coffee offerings to create a more comfortable and inclusive environment. Mackenzie emphasized that while pubs must evolve with changing trends, their unique role as community hubs remains a key advantage.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 03:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indonesia is actively pursuing direct export channels to ship fresh durians to China, aiming to increase profits by bypassing intermediary countries like Malaysia and Thailand. Currently, these nations assist Indonesian growers with phytosanitary approvals and the cold-chain storage required by Chinese customs. By establishing a direct route, Indonesia hopes to capture a larger share of the massive Chinese market, which consumes over 90% of the world's durian supply. Analysts note that Indonesia has been improving its certification processes to meet China's stringent import requirements, which would make direct trade more feasible and economically beneficial.</p>

          <p>South Korea's main stock index, the Kospi, achieved a new record high for the third day in a row, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. The index reached an intraday peak of 3,794.87 before closing slightly up at 3,748.89, bucking a broader trend of losses across other Asia-Pacific markets. The regional downturn was influenced by concerns over the US banking sector and trade tensions, which led to declines in markets like Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and Japan's Nikkei 225. Singapore's exports, however, showed a surprise rebound, jumping 6.9% in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seventeen-year-old striker Francesco Camarda is generating significant excitement in Italian football after a series of record-breaking achievements for both his club and country. After becoming the youngest player to debut in Serie A for AC Milan at age 15, he has since scored his first top-flight goal while on loan at Lecce. This week, he also became the youngest Italian to score for the under-21 national team, converting a Panenka-style penalty. Coaches praise his composure, strength, and natural goal-scoring instinct, viewing him as a prodigious talent who could define the future of the Italian national team.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has expressed skepticism about Marcus Rashford's recent comments blaming an 'inconsistent environment' for his struggles at the club. Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona, suggested the conditions at United hindered his performance. However, Rooney countered that blaming the environment can be an easy excuse when a player is not performing well. He argued that a player's on-field application, such as their work rate, is a matter of personal responsibility and is not dictated by the surrounding environment. Rooney stated that while he likes Rashford personally, the claim is a convenient way to deflect criticism.</p>

          <p>Former members of the UK military are now able to apply for a digital version of their veteran identity card, which can be downloaded to a smartphone. This initiative is available to approximately 1.8 million veterans and is intended to provide easier proof of status for accessing public services like healthcare and housing support, as well as commercial discounts. While physical cards will still be issued, the government is promoting the digital ID as a case study for a planned national digital identity scheme for all citizens. Officials hope this rollout will demonstrate the technology's security and convenience to the public.</p>
