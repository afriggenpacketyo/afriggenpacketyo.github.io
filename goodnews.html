          <p>David Gaudu of Groupama-FDJ achieved a remarkable sprint victory on the uphill finish of the Vuelta a Espana's third stage, marking his first win in the race since 2020. Gaudu outmaneuvered rivals on the final corner, finishing ahead of Mads Pedersen and Jonas Vingegaard, with the latter retaining the overall lead based on finishing places despite being level on time. The stage also saw Vingegaard's team report multiple bike thefts overnight from their mechanics' truck, prompting a police investigation. Additionally, a teammate's bike went missing after a crash, only to be later found in the broom wagon.</p>

Internationally recognized as "the kindest judge in America" through his television show "Caught in Providence" and numerous viral social media clips, Caprio demonstrated that kindness could be central to the judicial process. His son, David Caprio, revealed his father's final, poignant message to his family: "Take care of each other. Keep the family close. And help people if you can."

          <p>For seven years, a one-eyed goose named Billy became an unexpected, cherished mascot in a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, neighborhood, known for his inability to fly and his friendly, daily visits to homes for food. Residents developed a unique bond with Billy, who even took on a caretaker role for local ducks and interacted freely with children, earning him the affectionate title of "Mother Goose." His presence fostered a strong sense of community, with many neighbors unaware he was "trick-or-treating" to every house. Billy's sudden death last month, likely from an alligator attack, deeply saddened the community, leading to an outpouring of memories online and a sunset toast and permanent memorial in his honor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals that great white sharks are spending considerably more time in the northern waters off New England and Canada's Atlantic coast, prompting increased awareness among boaters, beachgoers, and fishermen. Scientists link this surge in sightings to an increased availability of seals, which are a primary food source for the sharks. Maine, historically a rare location for these predators, has detected 93 unique white sharks since 2020, with 19 recorded in 2024 alone. While the number of sharks has increased, particularly off Nova Scotia, experts from the International Shark Attack File reiterate that fatal shark bites remain exceedingly rare, with Maine having only two confirmed unprovoked attacks since 1837.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is currently captivated by a widespread "blind box" craze, where customers buy mystery items, only discovering the specific variation upon opening. This phenomenon, which significantly grew during the pandemic as a budget-friendly pick-me-up, is driving immense success for companies such as Beijing-based Pop Mart, creators of the popular Labubu monster dolls. The allure of the gamble encourages repeat purchases and trading, with some individuals dedicating substantial monthly funds to these collectibles. The trend has permeated diverse sectors, from souvenir shops at Confucius temples to travel agencies offering "blind box" flight tickets. Despite its popularity, the Chinese government has expressed concerns about "irrational consumption" and potential "addiction," particularly among minors, advocating for stricter regulations.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is increasing its position in cybersecurity leader Palo Alto Networks, purchasing an additional 50 shares at approximately $184, thereby raising its portfolio weighting to about 2%. This strategic acquisition targets the stock's recent 10% dip, which occurred after reports surfaced of Palo Alto Networks' substantial $25 billion acquisition of Identity Security firm CyberArk. The Trust perceives this decline as an opportune moment, emphasizing Palo Alto Networks' robust quarterly results and the proven efficacy of its "platformization" strategy, which achieved a record in bundled service deals. Confidence in the CyberArk acquisition is rooted in CEO Nikesh Arora's strong deal-making background and the expected inflection in the identity security market driven by agentic AI within the next 12 to 24 months.

This warm spell contributes to what is already anticipated to be one of the UK's hottest summers on record, characterized by four declared heatwaves. However, the heat is expected to dissipate quickly as the remnants of Hurricane Erin approach, forecast to bring wet and windy conditions, with gusts up to 40mph, across most of the UK by Tuesday. This rain is largely welcomed, as the prolonged dry periods have led to significant water shortfalls and widespread hosepipe bans, impacting agricultural harvests.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is set to report its second-quarter earnings, with expectations of an $8 billion hit due to the Trump administration's shifting policies on China chip sales. While an initial ban on chip sales to China was revoked, Nvidia now faces a 15% government cut on sales to the country and potential 100% tariffs on semiconductor imports unless manufacturing is localized. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's shares have risen significantly, and the company became the first to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization in July. Analysts project strong Q2 earnings per share and revenue growth, driven by data center performance and new chip developments, but Q3 guidance remains a focus due to China sales uncertainty.

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) continue to offer a compelling option for savers seeking predictable returns, with current rates hovering around 4% despite a slight cooling from recent peaks. For a $5,000 deposit, CDs provide a guaranteed interest rate, shielding funds from stock market volatility and potential Federal Reserve rate reductions anticipated before the end of 2025. The interest earned varies significantly with the term length; for instance, a 3-month CD could yield approximately $53, whereas a 5-year commitment might accumulate over $1,000. Financial experts suggest that securing today's rates could be a prudent strategy for emergency funds or specific savings goals, provided one can avoid early withdrawal penalties.

CEO Jensen Huang has publicly stated that robotics represents Nvidia's most substantial growth opportunity beyond artificial intelligence, a field that has already seen the company's overall sales more than triple in the past two years. Based on Nvidia's current-generation Blackwell graphics processor, the Jetson Thor boasts 7.5 times faster performance, enabling it to run complex generative AI and visual models crucial for humanoid robots and self-driving cars.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) has revealed an $18 billion agreement to acquire the Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, a strategic move intended to revitalize KDP's underperforming coffee segment. Following the anticipated closure of the acquisition in the first half of 2026, Keurig Dr Pepper intends to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed companies. This decision effectively reverses the 2018 merger that originally formed Keurig Dr Pepper. While KDP shares experienced an 8% decline post-announcement, JDE Peet's stock surged 15%. The transaction is projected to yield $400 million in cost synergies over a three-year period, with the new coffee entity expected to generate $16 billion in annual sales. (not investment advice)</p>

Fulham's manager, Marco Silva, ingeniously exploited United's defensive setup by generating numerical superiority in midfield and compelling United's center-backs to step out of their back five, thereby creating exploitable spaces. Concurrently, Manchester City's evolving high-press strategy, influenced by new assistant coach Pep Lijnders, demonstrated weaknesses against Tottenham, who effectively launched attacks down both flanks. Spurs' coordinated movements between wingers and midfielders successfully exposed City's persistent left-flank defensive issues, indicating a need for rectification. These observations highlight the ongoing tactical evolution and challenges faced by top-tier clubs in the league.</p>
