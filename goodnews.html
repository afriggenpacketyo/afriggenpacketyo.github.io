          <p>Colombian police, in a coordinated operation with European authorities, have arrested an alleged leader of Italy's 'ndrangheta mafia in Bogotá. The suspect, identified as Giuseppe Palermo, was wanted under an Interpol red notice for his role in overseeing large cocaine shipments from South America to Europe. According to officials, Palermo managed trafficking routes and was part of one of the mafia's most secretive and powerful cells. The arrest highlights the 'ndrangheta's extensive global reach and the ongoing efforts to combat transnational organized crime.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek claimed her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 win against American Amanda Anisimova in a match lasting just 57 minutes. This marked the first "double bagel" victory in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911, showcasing Swiatek's mastery on grass, a surface previously considered her weakest. The win represents Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces. Anisimova's performance was hampered by nerves, but her journey to the final was celebrated as a remarkable comeback after taking a break for her mental health.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators gathered across Northern Ireland for the annual Twelfth of July parades, commemorating the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. The events, which celebrate Protestant traditions and Ulster-Scots heritage, took place in 18 locations, including a major parade in Belfast. Officials and participants described the day as peaceful and celebratory, with a positive atmosphere helped by sunny weather. While historically a point of tension, this year's parades, including a feeder parade in a sensitive area of north Belfast, proceeded without significant issue.</p>

          <p>Hartford Bakery, Inc. has issued a voluntary recall for about 883 loaves of its "Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf" bread sold across 12 states.

The affected bread was distributed through major retailers like Kroger and Walmart. While one customer reported digestive discomfort, no serious illnesses have been confirmed, and the company is urging consumers to return the product for a full refund.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face drug and weapons trafficking charges. Macias, head of the "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape that triggered a wave of extreme gang violence across Ecuador. His escape and the subsequent government crackdown highlighted the deep influence of drug cartels in the country. This will be the first extradition from Ecuador since a recent referendum approved the measure as part of the government's war on criminal gangs.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has identified the 10 U.S. state economies most resilient to a potential recession, with Florida, Texas, and North Carolina taking the top three spots. The ranking considered factors like GDP and job growth, fiscal health, and exposure to risks from federal budget cuts and international trade tariffs. States with diverse economies, strong fiscal management, and less dependence on federal spending or trade with China scored highest. The report suggests that while the national economy is solid, these states are particularly well-prepared to navigate future economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to rising tariff costs and trade uncertainty, companies are increasingly utilizing U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses. These designated areas allow businesses to import materials and assemble products without immediately paying duties, which are only collected when the finished goods enter U.S. commerce. This strategy, dating back to the 1930s, helps preserve cash flow and can reduce the tax burden. However, a recent executive order has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the final product, creating new challenges.

By focusing on slow, deep growth in existing markets rather than rapid expansion, the company maintained product quality and built a strong reputation.

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on the current cultural and political climate for transgender people, contrasting the "transgender tipping point" of 2014 with today's legislative backlash. The author, a trans woman who transitioned in adulthood, argues against forcing children to wait for gender-affirming care by countering the "survivorship bias" of those who, like her, made it through without it. The article likens skepticism about trans care to doubt-casting on climate change and emphasizes that social acceptance is a key part of care. It suggests listening to trans people's experiences is crucial to understanding the issue.</p>
