          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, ending the vehicle's 24-year career as a cornerstone of the nation's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite to monitor greenhouse gases. The H2A series, which began in 2001, achieved a 98% success rate over its lifetime, overcoming an early failure in 2003. Japan's space efforts will now be led by the more cost-effective H3 rocket, designed to compete in the global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered mysterious radio waves originating from a distant galaxy cluster, known as SpARCS1049, that took 10 billion years to reach Earth. These signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. The discovery, made using the LOFAR radio telescope, suggests that the energetic processes shaping galaxy clusters, such as activity from supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, were occurring much earlier in the universe's history than previously thought. This finding opens a new window into the evolution of the early universe.</p>

          <p>In his third start of the season, Shohei Ohtani delivered his most impressive pitching performance yet, despite the Dodgers ultimately losing to the Kansas City Royals 9-5. Ohtani pitched two sharp innings, throwing his fastest-ever MLB pitch at 101.7 mph and effectively mixing his pitches to keep hitters off balance. Although his workload is still being carefully managed as he returns from Tommy John surgery, his performance showcased his dominant potential on the mound. The Dodgers' bullpen struggled after his departure, and the offense couldn't overcome the early deficit.</p>

          <p>According to computer scientist Harry Shum, former head of AI at Microsoft, China is rapidly closing the gap with the United States in the field of AI algorithms, despite still lagging significantly in semiconductor technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the U.S. maintains a clear lead in AI chips, a gap that will take years to bridge. However, he highlighted Chinese firms like DeepSeek, which are achieving competitive results with top U.S. models using far less computing power. This suggests China's focus on algorithmic innovation is allowing it to remain highly competitive in the global AI race.</p>

The plaintiffs, who were wrongfully convicted of a 1989 assault and later exonerated, sued Trump for statements he made during a 2024 presidential debate, accusing him of falsely claiming they had killed someone and pled guilty. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. This decision allows the case against Trump to proceed.</p>

          <p>A new study of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of 칂atalh칬y칲k in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 skeletons and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to their family buildings. The findings, which also showed females received significantly more grave goods than males, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal societal structures in the ancient world.</p>
