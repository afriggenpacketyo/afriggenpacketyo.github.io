          <p>Professional golfer Rory McIlroy has responded to pre-tournament comments from U.S. player Bryson DeChambeau ahead of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black. McIlroy suggested that DeChambeau mentions other high-profile players like himself and Scottie Scheffler primarily to gain attention. The rivalry between the two has intensified following their showdown at the Masters and DeChambeau's victory at the U.S. Open. This exchange adds to the anticipation for the tournament, where Team Europe aims to defend its title on American soil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan to bring Gatwick Airport's northern runway into regular use, effectively creating a second runway. The project aims to boost economic growth and create jobs by increasing the airport's flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 annually. The decision has faced strong opposition from environmental groups concerned about increased air pollution, noise, and climate emissions. To address local concerns, Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and measures to manage potential road traffic congestion.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch and his father, Rupert Murdoch, are likely to be part of the American investor group in the deal for TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as probable participants in the acquisition. The statement comes as negotiations continue to finalize a deal that would allow the popular social media app, owned by China's ByteDance, to continue operating in the U.S. under new ownership. The White House has stated the new seven-member board will have six Americans and that the U.S. will control the app's algorithm.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team defeated Ireland by six wickets in the third T20 match to win the series 2-0. Jordan Cox, who was a late addition to the squad, played a pivotal role with a score of 55 runs, guiding the team to their target of 155 with 17 balls to spare. England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, had earlier restricted Ireland's scoring in the first innings. The victory in Malahide concluded the first-ever T20 series between the two nations, with the second match having been canceled due to rain.</p>

          <p>London held a one-day trial on Sunday to ban vehicle traffic from a major section of Oxford Street, a move Mayor Sadiq Khan hopes to make permanent. The event, called "This is Oxford Street," aimed to give a glimpse of a future where the famous shopping district is a pedestrian-friendly zone, which advocates say would increase footfall and business. The proposal involves banning vehicles between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. However, the plan has raised concerns from some local councillors and residents about accessibility for those with mobility issues and the potential for traffic congestion on smaller side streets.</p>

          <p>The Amur Tiger Center in Russia has shared dramatic footage of two rehabilitated Amur tigers being released back into their natural habitat. The video shows the massive predators, a brother and sister, reacting with intense fury, swatting and biting at their cage doors as they are opened. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are an endangered species, with only 500-600 estimated to be living in the wild. The footage highlights the raw power of these animals and underscores the importance of conservation efforts to protect them from poaching and habitat loss.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup Captain Luke Donald has suggested that the American team could face pressure from their own home crowd at Bethpage Black due to a new payment structure. For the first time, U.S. players will each receive $500,000 to participate, a move that contrasts with the European team, who play for free. Donald speculates that if the paid U.S. team underperforms, the New York audience, who are paying high ticket prices, might turn on them. He emphasized that the European players are motivated by purpose and the tradition of the event rather than monetary rewards.</p>

          <p>China's first domestically developed large passenger jet, the C919, is being built in a highly advanced "smart factory" designed to prevent production quality issues. The assembly line utilizes an integrated network of 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect every tool, robot, and worker, creating a unified system for sensing, communication, and control. This futuristic approach aims to eliminate errors like missing bolts or tools left inside aircraft, which have plagued other manufacturers. The system represents a significant step in China's ambitions to compete in the global aviation market with high standards of manufacturing.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 1927, hundreds of people participated in an organized swim in the Chicago River, marking a significant milestone in the waterway's transformation from a polluted sewer to a recreational asset. The event was the culmination of decades of environmental cleanup efforts, spurred by the 1972 Clean Water Act, which have restored the river's ecological health. Once known as "the stinking river," it is now home to dozens of fish species and enjoyed by boaters and riverside patrons. The swim symbolizes the remarkable progress made in rehabilitating one of America's major urban waterways.</p>

          <p>UCLA's interim football coach, Tim Skipper, is finalizing a deal to bring veteran assistant Kevin Coyle onto the defensive staff for the remainder of the season. The move aims to stabilize the team's defense following the departure of coordinator Ikaika Malloe and a difficult 0-3 start to the season. Coyle previously worked with Skipper at Fresno State, where he ran a successful defense. With extensive experience as a defensive coordinator in both college football and the NFL, Coyle is expected to help implement a more collaborative defensive strategy as the Bruins head into their Big Ten Conference schedule.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, some Wall Street strategists believe the stock market's record-breaking run could continue. They argue that the current S&P 500, heavily weighted with high-growth technology and communication companies, is fundamentally different from historical benchmarks, justifying higher valuations. The ongoing artificial intelligence boom is seen as a major driver of productivity and earnings growth that could further propel equities. However, some analysts caution that easier monetary policy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress speeds up this degradation. However, Epel notes that this damage can be mitigated through lifestyle changes. She recommends simple, daily practices to de-stress and promote cellular restoration, such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, incorporating Omega-3s into one's diet, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork.</p>
