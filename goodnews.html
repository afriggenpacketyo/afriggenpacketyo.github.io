        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American electricity companies are struggling to forecast the actual power demand that will result from the boom in artificial intelligence, creating a multibillion-dollar infrastructure challenge. Tech companies are proposing massive data centers, some requiring the power of entire cities, but are often pitching the same projects to multiple utilities, making it difficult to gauge real need. This uncertainty raises concerns about over-investing in power generation and grid upgrades, which could lead to higher consumer electricity prices. While experts agree a historic increase in consumption is coming, the exact scale remains a critical question for the energy sector.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Swiss running shoe company On is facing a class-action lawsuit from customers who allege that its popular CloudTec shoe design has a defect causing an "embarrassing" squeaking sound with each step. The complaint, filed in an Oregon district court, claims the noise is caused by rubber components in the shoe's sole rubbing together. The plaintiffs argue they would not have purchased the premium-priced footwear, which retails for $140 to $180, had they known about the issue. The lawsuit seeks damages for what it claims are thousands of affected consumers who were unable to get refunds under the company's warranty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut the federal funds rate at its upcoming October 29 meeting, there is a strong possibility that mortgage rates could fall even before the official announcement. Historical precedent shows that lenders often "price in" anticipated Fed cuts, leading to rate drops in the days or weeks prior to the meetings, as seen in September 2024 and September 2025. Homebuyers and those looking to refinance should prepare by improving their credit scores and monitoring daily rate fluctuations to capitalize on a potential, albeit possibly temporary, window of opportunity.

          <p>A recent overview of artificial intelligence developments highlights several key industry updates, led by OpenAI's announcement that it will soon allow ChatGPT to generate "erotica" for verified adult users. Other notable advancements include a national program designed to help senior citizens identify and avoid increasingly sophisticated scams, which have led to surging financial losses. Additionally, AI is being applied in healthcare to pinpoint hard-to-detect breast cancer, and in infrastructure to monitor road conditions using smart fabrics. The article also touches on Walmart's new partnership with OpenAI, allowing customers to purchase products directly through the chatbot.</p>

          <p>South Africa's cricket team secured a decisive 10-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in a Women's World Cup match shortened by rain. The Proteas successfully chased a revised target of 121 runs in just under 15 overs, with standout performances from captain Laura Wolvaardt and opener Tazmin Brits. This fourth consecutive win propels South Africa to second place in the tournament standings, just behind Australia. The loss significantly diminishes Sri Lanka's chances of advancing to the semi-finals, as they remain winless with only two games left to play in the tournament.</p>

          <h2>California Sues Plastic Bag Makers Over Deceptive Recyclability Claims</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed a lawsuit against three major plastic bag manufacturers, alleging they falsely marketed their products as recyclable in violation of state law. The lawsuit claims that the thicker plastic bags sold in stores since the state's 2014 ban on single-use bags are not, in fact, being recycled at California facilities. Alongside the lawsuit, Bonta announced a settlement with four other producers who will pay over $1.7 million and halt sales in the state. The legal actions aim to address the billions of plastic bags that end up in landfills and the environment despite their "recyclable" labels.</p>

          <p>The conventional 60/40 stock-bond investment portfolio is facing a significant challenge as strategists increasingly advocate for a 60/20/20 model that incorporates alternative assets. With gold and bitcoin reaching record highs, some investors are shifting 20% of their portfolio away from fixed income and into assets like precious metals and cryptocurrencies. This trend is driven by factors such as inflation, geopolitical risk, and the fact that stocks and bonds are often moving in tandem, reducing the diversification benefits of the traditional model. Gold ETFs have seen massive inflows, reflecting a growing acceptance of the metal as a core holding. (not investment advice)</p>

This direct-to-consumer model is being implemented through partnerships with pharmacies like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs and Alto Pharmacy.

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction thriller, "Gone Before Goodbye," with writer Harlan Coben, centering the story on a highly skilled female surgeon. Witherspoon explained her motivation was to create a female protagonist whose value comes from her talent and intelligence, rather than her sex appeal, contrasting it with the women she saw in James Bond films growing up. The novel's main character, a surgeon who has lost her medical license, reflects themes of career setbacks and resilience. Through her production company, Witherspoon has consistently championed complex female characters, a mission she continues with her literary debut.</p>

          <p>Apple has finalized a five-year media rights deal with Formula 1, making Apple TV the exclusive U.S. home for all F1 races starting in 2026. The agreement, valued at approximately $140 million per year, will provide subscribers with ad-free coverage of all practice, qualifying, and race sessions at no extra cost beyond the standard Apple TV subscription. This move displaces ESPN as the league's U.S. broadcast partner and signals Apple's strategy of acquiring exclusive rights to major sports to control the user experience. The partnership builds on the success of the Apple-produced F1 movie starring Brad Pitt.</p>

          <p>Recent aggressive Russian air incursions into NATO airspace appear to have backfired, strengthening the alliance's resolve rather than dividing it. NATO has responded by establishing a more coordinated defense on its eastern flank, with member states like Poland and Estonia actively intercepting Russian aircraft and drones. This unified stance comes as European leaders and President Trump show rare alignment on the need to pressure Vladimir Putin, who may be feeling compelled to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. European nations are also increasing their own defense spending and exploring new economic sanctions to cripple Russia's war machine.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent Democrat from San Francisco, is reportedly planning to run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously established an exploratory committee, he was expected to wait for the 85-year-old Pelosi to retire. His decision to run now is reportedly a response to another progressive candidate entering the race. Pelosi has not yet announced if she will seek another term, but her age could become a factor as a new generation of Democrats seeks leadership roles. Wiener is well-known for his pro-housing legislation.</p>
