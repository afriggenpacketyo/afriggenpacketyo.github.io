          <h2>Singapore's Economy Shows Unexpected Growth in Second Quarter</h2>

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing expert forecasts and accelerating from the previous quarter's growth. The manufacturing sector was the primary driver of this expansion, growing by 5.5%. Despite the positive results, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution for the second half of 2025, citing significant global economic uncertainty, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank had previously loosened monetary policy due to downside risks, but low inflation figures could support further rate cuts.</p>

          <p>Australia is deepening its strategic partnership with the Philippines through expanded maritime cooperation, including vessel donations, training, and an increased investment of A$11.5 million from 2025 to 2029. This move is part of a broader effort by Australia to navigate its complex geopolitical landscape, balancing its significant trade relationship with China against the need for regional security alliances. Analysts note that as the two nations approach 80 years of diplomatic relations, they are mutually motivated to enhance their partnership. This reflects a strategic alignment in response to regional tensions and a shared interest in maritime security.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Students Increasingly Prioritize Technology-Related University Majors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 20:00:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant shift is occurring in the academic priorities of Chinese students, with a strong preference for technology and engineering-focused university majors. Fields like information technology and vehicle engineering are now top choices, supplanting previously popular subjects like international trade and urban planning. This trend is heavily influenced by China's state-driven push to bolster its technological capabilities amid intensified competition with the United States. The government's strategic focus on tech advancement is funneling a new generation of students into disciplines deemed critical for the nation's future industrial development.</p>

          <p>Prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground have climbed to their highest level in six years, with Transport for London (TfL) taking legal action against 3,691 individuals in 2024-25. While prosecutions on the London Overground decreased, penalty notices on that service hit a record high. TfL describes fare evasion as a crime that deprives the transport system of vital investment, stating it lost an estimated 3.4% of fares across all services. The agency is expanding its enforcement teams to combat the issue and aims to reduce the evasion rate significantly by 2030.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is celebrating a significant milestone: 230 years of unbroken, continuous weather observation. This tradition, which began on July 14, 1795, constitutes the longest such sequence of handwritten meteorological data in the UK and Ireland. Unlike modern automated stations, observers in Armagh continue to manually record daily measurements, providing a unique and invaluable climate record. The data chronicles major weather events over centuries, including the infamous "Night of the Big Wind" in 1839, and has contributed to the development of meteorological science, such as the invention of the cup anemometer.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, following announcements of a plan to sell U.S. weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military aid by moving equipment from closer European nations, with those countries then purchasing replacements from the U.S. The meeting comes as the Trump administration also considers new sanctions to cripple Russia's oil industry and potentially authorize new funding for Ukraine from seized Russian assets. The moves signal a potential turning point in U.S. strategy to support Ukraine's defense against the ongoing Russian invasion.</p>

Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto has been a standout performer, while the bullpen, particularly closer Tanner Scott, has been a source of concern.

          <p>King Charles has invited Donald Trump for a second state visit to the UK in September, strategically scheduling it while Parliament is in recess for party conferences. This timing effectively removes the possibility of the U.S. president addressing Parliament, an honor that has been extended to past presidents but would have been controversial for Trump. A motion signed by several MPs had already called for him not to be given a speech, citing his past rhetoric. The visit is seen as a diplomatic move by Prime Minister Keir Starmer to strengthen ties and negotiate on trade issues, such as U.S. tariffs.</p>
