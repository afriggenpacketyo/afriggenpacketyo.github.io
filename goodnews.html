        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by unilaterally imposing global tariffs, deeming them "contrary to law." The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited power to levy tariffs without congressional approval. The judges emphasized that Congress holds the constitutional authority to impose tariffs under most circumstances, and Trump's actions did not meet the criteria for an "unusual and extraordinary threat." The Trump administration can appeal the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed reservations about a Boeing 747-8 gifted by the government of Qatar, stating that it is too large to serve as his personal aircraft. The aircraft, intended as a replacement for Air Force One, has drawn criticism and accusations of impropriety. Trump emphasized that he views the jet as a gift to the nation rather than a personal perk, stating that it is being refitted for military standard. He also criticized Boeing for delays in replacing the current Air Force One.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang voiced his displeasure with U.S. chip controls that have effectively closed off the $50 billion China market, resulting in a multibillion-dollar writeoff on inventory. Despite this, Nvidia reported strong quarterly results, exceeding analysts' estimates, driven by demand for its AI chips. The Trump administration's decision to require an export license for Nvidia's previously approved H20 processor for China has significantly impacted the company's sales in the region. Huang emphasized that shielding Chinese chipmakers from U.S. competition would only strengthen them.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon heating technology. This change, part of the Warm Homes Plan, is expected to make heat pump installations easier for millions of homes in England. However, consumer groups caution that the high upfront costs remain a significant barrier, especially for older housing stock requiring upgrades to pipework and insulation. The government aims to provide 300,000 households with energy efficiency upgrades through the Warm Homes Plan.</p>
