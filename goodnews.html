          <p>A U.S. federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by imposing global tariffs, a significant setback to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade stated that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country, as the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The court vacated the tariffs and permanently enjoined their operation, although the Trump administration has the option to appeal the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

He framed the jet as a "beautiful, big, magnificent, free airplane for the United States air force" instead. The original offer from Qatar drew criticism, with some calling it "the definition of corruption." Trump stated the aircraft is being refitted for military standard, criticizing Boeing for delays in replacing the current Air Force One.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing planning restrictions to make it easier for millions of homes in England to install heat pumps, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon heating technology. A key restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property has been lifted. Consumer groups, however, caution that the changes will not benefit renters or leaseholders, and the high upfront costs remain a significant barrier, especially for older properties requiring insulation upgrades. The change is part of the government's Warm Homes Plan to improve energy efficiency and lower bills.</p>
