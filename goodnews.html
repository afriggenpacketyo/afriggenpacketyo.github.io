          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 02:42:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger growth than anticipated in the first quarter of 2025, expanding by 0.7% compared to analysts' forecasts of 0.6%. The Office for National Statistics attributes this growth primarily to the robust performance of the UK services sector, along with a notable increase in production. March also saw a growth of 0.2%, exceeding expectations of stagnation, indicating positive momentum in the early months of the year. This economic expansion suggests a potential recovery and resilience in the face of ongoing global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Two British academics have identified a manuscript in Harvard Law School's library as an original 1300 version of the Magna Carta, a foundational document for modern liberties. The manuscript, purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, was previously believed to be a copy. This discovery makes it one of only seven originals from that date still in existence. The find was made by Professor David Carpenter while researching digital images and confirmed through spectral imaging, underscoring the document's historical significance and its potential value, estimated to be in the millions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's economic growth, driven by a significant surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, although potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not expected to be a major factor. The IMF projects Denmark's output to decrease from 3.7% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and 1.8% in 2026, due to anticipated weakness in export growth. The report notes that most Danish drug products are neither produced nor pass through the country, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs on the Danish economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>What was long thought to be a copy of the Magna Carta at Harvard Law School is actually an original from 1300, according to British experts. The "Great Charter" is considered a key document in the history of human rights and constitutional law. Experts based their conclusion on the document's size and handwriting, which are consistent with those in the six previously known originals. The experts noted that the discovery is timely as Harvard University has been barred from receiving new federal grants by the Trump administration, which many critics see as violating some of the key principles enshrined in the Magna Carta.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its decision to disband after 41 years of armed insurgency against the Turkish state. This move could significantly alter the political landscape in Turkey, requiring parties to adjust their programs and discourse. The future of jailed Kurdish politicians and the surrender of weapons remain uncertain, with resistance to the dissolution existing within the PKK. The pro-Kurdish movement expects some of their politicians will be freed, even as the fate of those prisoners remains unclear.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of its stockpiled rice to address soaring rice prices, which remain near record highs. The government plans to release 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months through July, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. This measure aims to compensate for a rice shortage caused by a poor harvest in the summer of 2023 and increased rice consumption in restaurants due to a surge in foreign tourists.</p>

Key elements include singing about personal liberation, preferably in English, and alluding to folk music without sending a pure folk song. A dramatic key change near the end was once essential for a Eurovision winner, but these are best avoided now. The act should go all-out on the staging, and fire is also an essential element. The article cautions against sending a novelty act, however.</p>

          <p>A Communist Party journal in China suggests that the country possesses the financial strength to establish a market stabilization fund, citing its robust economy and substantial foreign exchange reserves. The article emphasizes the necessity of stabilizing the market amidst economic uncertainties stemming from Trump-induced trade tensions. It highlights that a stabilization fund could help reduce market volatility, protect investors, and prevent systemic financial risks. The journal references successful interventions by other major economies, including Hong Kong, during times of stock market panic.</p>
