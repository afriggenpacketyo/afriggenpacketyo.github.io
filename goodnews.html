        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's power grid now utilizes a quantum-powered "diamond ring" to safeguard against catastrophic collapses by detecting grid instability in real time. Designed by the University of Science and Technology of China in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, the device embeds nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors, acting as a high-precision sentinel for power lines. This development follows incidents such as sweeping outages in Spain, Portugal, and France, as well as grid instability in China's Xinjiang region caused by solar and wind fluctuations. The "diamond ring" aims to address the challenge of weather-dependent unpredictability straining traditional monitoring systems as renewables increasingly dominate energy transitions.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump should maintain a tough stance on tariffs with the European Union to address the ballooning trade deficit. The author contends that the EU has historically engaged in protectionism, disadvantaging American products. They suggest that America deserves to be treated differently than other trading partners due to the security guarantees the U.S. has provided for decades. The piece predicts that the EU will likely avoid making substantial concessions, leading Trump to impose significant tariffs to force a fairer trade relationship (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is enabling individuals without formal training to write software through a process known as "vibe coding." This involves using AI chatbots and other AI tools to generate code, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for software development.  The rise of AI coding is expected to radically change the software industry, potentially leading to the emergence of AI coders, project managers, and designers. While some worry about job displacement for coders, others see AI as a tool that will enhance productivity and allow designers to explore more ideas quickly.</p>

          <p>Valerie, a mini dachshund, has returned home after surviving 529 days alone in the Australian bush. She disappeared during a camping trip in November 2023 on Kangaroo Island and was eventually found by a farmer over a year later. Wildlife rescuers spent nearly two months trying to capture her, and it is still unknown how she survived in the wild for so long.  Her owners express immense gratitude and hope that Valerie's story inspires others facing their own challenges.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to increase rice exports due to an expected long-term decline in domestic consumption. The annual white paper on food and agriculture recommends exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production. The government has identified China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan as target markets for exports. The goal is to increase rice exports nearly eightfold by 2030, with a focus on sales at Japanese restaurants and stores abroad.</p>

          <p>A Harris's hawk that terrorized the village of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, by dive-bombing residents has found a permanent home with a local falconer.  The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was responsible for attacks on about 50 people, with one person requiring hospital treatment.  Falconer Wayne Housden has trained the bird and reports that it has calmed down, adding that the hawk was likely a captive-bred bird that had lost its falconer and that it will now be cared for permanently.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, known for owning Tesla and X, and for his government work, has a history filled with surprising facts. At age 12, he created a video game called Blastar, and his first company, Zip2, was sold for $300 million when he was 24.  Musk also launched a perfume called Burnt Hair and co-founded X.com, which later became PayPal. His life inspired Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Iron Man, and while he didn't start Tesla, he propelled it to global success. After taking over social media platform X for $44bn in 2022, Musk became one step closer to achieving his goal of creating an "everything app".</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki won the Scripps National Spelling Bee, overcoming a shocking moment of overconfidence.

Despite the flub, he ultimately triumphed by correctly spelling "eclaircissement," becoming the champion. The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and Faizan may be the first champion who's remembered more for a word he got wrong than one he got right.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of the UK's saltmarshes as vital "sinks" that lock away climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud.  The charity is calling for these muddy, tidal habitats to be added to the official UK inventory of how much carbon is emitted and how much is removed from our atmosphere every year. Much of the UK's saltmarshes have been lost to agriculture, but they act as natural flood defenses and are unsung heroes in nature's fight against climate change. The mud here is just as important for climate mitigation as trees are.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has begun its first deliberations in 28 years on legislation that would give married couples the option of keeping different surnames. The passage of any of the three bills submitted separately by three opposition parties, however, looks unlikely during the current Diet session through late June. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains reluctant to allow the change, with some within the party concerned that it would hurt family cohesion and traditional values. In a Kyodo News poll, 71 percent of respondents supported the dual family-name system, while 27 percent were opposed.</p>
