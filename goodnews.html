          <p>Welsh winger Louis Rees-Zammit has announced his decision to end his pursuit of an NFL career and return to professional rugby. After spending 18 months in the NFL's International Player Pathway Program and being part of the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad, he has chosen to come back to his original sport. In a social media post, Rees-Zammit stated it was the right time to make the move to prepare for the upcoming rugby season. The news is seen as a significant boost for the Welsh national rugby team, which has recently struggled with a long losing streak.</p>

          <p>Nintendo has announced a significant surge in its fiscal first-quarter revenue, more than doubling year-over-year due to the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company reported sales of 5.82 million units for the new device within its first month, substantially boosting its video game platform business. Despite this strong performance, Nintendo has maintained its full-year financial guidance, a move some analysts consider conservative. The company also stated that potential impacts from new U.S. tariffs are not expected to significantly affect its current fiscal year earnings forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany has officially reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the northern Atlantic region, with numbers growing to approximately 1,600 individuals across 209 packs. This positive development has led the government to plan for the reintroduction of wolf hunting in that area, a move supported by farmers concerned about livestock protection. However, the conservation status for the rest of the country remains under review, delaying a nationwide decision on hunting. The article also notes a diplomatic visit by Germany's Foreign Minister to the West Bank to discuss rising tensions and the humanitarian situation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship program exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This initiative, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase representation from working-class families within Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move has drawn criticism from the Conservative opposition, who labeled it as "leftist social engineering," but the government insists it is necessary to harness a broader range of talent.</p>

          <p>British 800-meter runner Max Burgin is setting his sights on a World Championship podium finish in Tokyo after a strong start to his season. The 23-year-old, who broke numerous junior records, has faced significant hurdles in his senior career, including injuries and deep vein thrombosis that cost him major championship appearances. Now healthy, Burgin recently ran the fourth-fastest time in the world this year and is the third-fastest Briton in history, closing in on Sebastian Coe's national record. He hopes to finally translate his early potential into global success, starting with a strong performance at the UK Athletics Championships.</p>

          <p>A new UK law named after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old fatally stabbed in 2022, has come into effect, banning the sale, possession, and importation of so-called ninja swords. Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, who campaigned relentlessly for the legislation, called its passage a bittersweet moment, believing it would have saved her son's life. The law was enacted after it was revealed one of Ronan's killers, a teenager, had easily purchased the weapon online. The legislation also requires retailers to perform age-verification checks and report suspicious knife orders, aiming to curb youth violence and weapon accessibility.</p>

          <p>Scientists in South Africa have launched the Rhisotope Project, an innovative anti-poaching initiative that involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. The material, while safe for the animals, is easily detectable by radiation scanners at borders and airports, aiming to deter trafficking and lead to the arrest of poachers. The project, a collaboration between the University of the Witwatersrand and conservationists, has successfully completed pilot studies confirming its safety and effectiveness. With South Africa's rhino population under severe threat, this method provides a new technological tool to protect the species from extinction.</p>

          <p>The global space industry is increasingly viewing the Moon as a stepping stone for the more ambitious goal of sending humans to Mars. While NASA's Artemis program continues to plan for a sustained human presence on the Moon, rhetoric from figures like Elon Musk and President Trump has pivoted toward colonizing the red planet. This new space race involves multiple nations, with China and the European Space Agency setting timelines for manned missions to Mars in the 2030s and 2040s. This shift may result in national agencies focusing on Mars, leaving lunar projects increasingly to the burgeoning private space sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Veteran actor Brian Cox is returning to the Scottish stage in 'Make it Happen,' a new play about the 2008 collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). The production is a highlight of the Edinburgh International Festival, which is beginning alongside the Fringe festival, transforming the city into a global arts hub. Cox, known for his role in 'Succession,' plays the ghost of economist Adam Smith in the biting satire. At 79, he remains focused on using his platform to advocate for social justice, drawing from his own tough upbringing in Dundee and protesting what he sees as systemic inequality.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, is in a promising position to secure an automatic berth on the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team. After an impressive third round at the Junior PGA Championships, he is currently tied for second place. The top two finishers at the tournament earn automatic spots on the team, which will compete later this year. A rising junior, Woods has already won a major junior event this year and continues to build a formidable reputation in the golf world, separate from his father's iconic legacy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who were facing the loss of their legal status and deportation protections. In her order, the judge stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was racially motivated and did not fully consider ongoing crises in the designated countries. The planned terminations are now postponed until at least November pending further hearings.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's process for handling the increasing number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh noted that as presidents use executive orders more frequently to bypass a gridlocked Congress, legal challenges inevitably increase, requiring the court to intervene. He acknowledged criticism about the lack of detailed reasoning in some emergency rulings but stated the court has made internal changes to ensure proper process. He emphasized that the justices maintain strong collegiality despite differing views on difficult and high-profile issues.</p>
