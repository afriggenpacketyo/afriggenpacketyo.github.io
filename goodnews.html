          <p>U.S. soccer player Trinity Rodman has publicly requested that Wimbledon announcers refrain from mentioning her father, basketball hall-of-famer Dennis Rodman, during her boyfriend Ben Shelton's tennis matches. While attending Wimbledon to support Shelton, she expressed frustration on social media, stating that her father is not a part of her life and his name is irrelevant to Shelton's career. Rodman, an Olympic gold medalist and NWSL champion, has previously spoken about her complicated and distant relationship with her father. She emphasized that the focus should be on Shelton and his family's support system.</p>

          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, a prominent figure from the Netflix series "Tiger King," has been sentenced to one year in prison for wildlife trafficking and money laundering. Antle pleaded guilty to illegally buying and selling endangered animals, including cheetahs, lions, and a chimpanzee, for his Myrtle Beach zoo. Prosecutors stated he laundered over $500,000 to facilitate these black-market purchases, which fuel poaching and smuggling. Despite his lawyers' request for probation, the judge imposed the prison sentence, marking a significant legal conclusion for another central character from the popular documentary series.</p>

          <p>As forecasters predict an above-average hurricane season, homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are increasingly investing in climate-resilient construction. These designs, such as the round, aerodynamic homes built by Deltec Homes, are engineered to withstand extreme weather, including winds up to 190 mph. Features like specialized roof trusses, deep anchors, and flood vents significantly reduce storm damage, with some homeowners even saving on insurance costs. Research institutions like the IBHS are also testing and promoting storm-ready upgrades like reinforced garage doors and roofs to make all homes safer against more frequent and intense hurricanes.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance, to discuss American support for Israel's security and a Gaza ceasefire. The visit occurs as the Trump administration faces criticism for its recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which some lawmakers fear could drag the U.S. into a broader conflict. Following the meetings, Netanyahu praised the "unmatched" coordination with the U.S. and affirmed Israel's intent to destroy Hamas's capabilities while also pursuing new opportunities for peace in the region.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind capacity, adding 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of 2025, matching its total for all of 2024. A new report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will install over half of the world's new offshore wind capacity this year, with another 22 GW already under construction. This push is part of President Xi Jinping's strategy to advance the country's marine economy, with strong government support through subsidies and planning. The nation recently began operations at its farthest offshore wind project, highlighting its growing technological capabilities in the sector.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its policy that required travelers to remove their shoes during security screenings at U.S. airports. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the change is effective immediately, citing significant advancements in security technology over the past two decades. The rule was first implemented in 2006 after the "shoe bomber" incident in 2001. While shoes can now stay on, passengers must still remove belts, coats, and large electronics, though these rules are also under review to streamline the travel experience.</p>

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to conduct a feasibility study for a transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with Peru's Pacific coast. The proposed 4,500-kilometer railway would run from Ilhéus, Brazil, to the port of Chancay, Peru, potentially shortening shipping times to Asia by up to 12 days. The project, with cost estimates exceeding $70 billion, aims to reshape South American trade routes. The current agreement focuses on five years of technical, environmental, and economic studies to determine the viability of the ambitious infrastructure corridor.</p>
