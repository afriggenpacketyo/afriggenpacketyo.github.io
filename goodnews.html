Hugo Cuypers netted a second-half brace, complemented by a goal from Brian Gutiérrez, as the eighth-seeded Fire ended their longest playoff-victory drought in MLS history. Chicago displayed a strong offensive performance, outshooting the ninth-seeded Orlando City 25-7, with goalkeeper Chris Brady registering three saves.

          <p>After decades as a popular shopping destination, Westminster Mall in Orange County is preparing to close its doors, with most shops shutting down by October 29. The Westminster City Council approved a redevelopment plan in 2022 to transform the 100-acre property into a mixed-use site, featuring 3,000 housing units and 600,000 square feet of upscale retail, alongside over nine acres for parks. Community members recently gathered for farewell events, reminiscing about the mall's heyday as a vibrant gathering spot in the 1980s. While anchor stores like Best Buy and Target will remain open for a few more years, the demolition date for the mall is yet to be set due to a pending agreement among its four corporate owners.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank, the Bank of Korea, held its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.5%, extending a pause since May, primarily due to concerns over household debt. This decision aligns with expectations and follows new, stricter property rules in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing. The BOK cited stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook, driven by consumption and a strong semiconductor sector, but warned of increased uncertainties from ongoing trade talks with the U.S. Analysts suggest a rate cut might occur in November to bolster growth, contingent on progress in trade and housing policy, as the central bank navigates balancing economic recovery with financial stability.

          <h2>Former Adviser Urges China to Avoid Western "Discourse Traps" in Global Narratives</h2>

          <p>A former official policy adviser has cautioned China against falling into Western "discourse traps" when addressing critical issues such as state subsidies, democracy, and the global order. During an event at Fudan University in Shanghai, the adviser stressed the importance of confidently defending the Communist Party's rule and its national achievements. He warned that a reactive approach to Western provocations is unlikely to persuade Western societies and could potentially alienate countries in the Global South. This guidance reflects an internal strategic discussion on how China can effectively shape its international narrative and challenge perceived "double standards" surrounding its global ascent.</p>

          <p>A German soldier was mistakenly shot and sustained minor injuries during a large-scale Bundeswehr training exercise in Erding, Bavaria, after a misunderstanding with local police. Police had responded to reports of an armed man, believing it to be a real incident, while military police involved in the "Marshal Power" drills fired practice ammunition, thinking it was part of the military exercise. The police then returned fire with live ammunition, hitting the soldier, who has since been discharged from the hospital. An investigation by state criminal police is underway to determine the exact circumstances of the incident, which occurred during drills designed to rehearse for an attack on a NATO member state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine are making significant strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by targeting dormant "sleeper cells" that can later spread cancer throughout the body. In a clinical trial involving 51 women with aggressive triple-negative breast cancer, doctors administered drugs to attack these lurking cells in bone marrow, achieving remarkable success with only two recurrences over seven years, far below the expected rate. This innovative approach offers immense hope for patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, whose sleeper cells were successfully eliminated. The next steps involve larger trials to confirm these findings and explore their applicability to other types of cancer.</p>

          <p>A family of three was rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to a small island where they sheltered for nearly two days. The mother, father, and son were found on Naushon Island after the son used the boat's washed-up marine radio to make a mayday call, following a relative's report of their overdue return. The Coast Guard helicopter airlifted them to a hospital, with one family member in critical condition and two stable. Officials highlighted the family's quick thinking and the presence of quality equipment as crucial to their survival and successful rescue from the remote island.</p>

          <p>Starting in 2026, menopause screening will be officially incorporated into NHS health checks for women aged 40 to 74 in England, offered every five years. This initiative aims to identify women who could benefit from advice, support, and treatment options, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT), drugs for hot flushes, and counseling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized that this measure will bring menopause into the mainstream, addressing a long-standing issue of women suffering in silence. While campaigners welcome the move to reduce stigma and improve support, concerns remain about the currently low uptake of general health checks in some communities, potentially limiting the reach of this important new provision.</p>
