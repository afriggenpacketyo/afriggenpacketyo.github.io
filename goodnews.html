          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton advanced to the third round of Wimbledon after his match, which was suspended due to darkness, resumed for just one minute. Shelton was leading Rinky Hijikata and only needed to complete a single service game to clinch the victory. Despite his frustration with the previous night's suspension, Shelton expressed confidence in his serve and efficiently closed out the match. He will now face Marton Focsovics as he aims to continue his run in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that "discussions are ongoing" to form a new political party, following MP Zarah Sultana's departure from Labour to co-lead the new venture with him. Corbyn praised Sultana's decision and stated the new party aims to provide a "real alternative" for voters disillusioned with the current government and the two-party system. While some on the left of the Labour party have expressed support, no other MPs have yet committed to joining the new political formation.</p>

          <p>Christopher Killick has been sentenced to three years in prison for harassing Emily Hunt, a former government rape adviser. This sentence comes after a decade-long fight for justice by Ms. Hunt, who waived her anonymity to pursue the case. Killick had previously pleaded guilty to voyeurism for filming Hunt while she was unconscious in 2015 but avoided jail time. The judge imprisoned him for persistently breaching a restraining order, noting Killick's "unwavering persistence" and Ms. Hunt's courageous refusal to "give in."</p>

          <p>Scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. The comet, currently 416 million miles from the sun, poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach in October at a distance of 240 million kilometers. While its exact origin is unknown, it appears to have come from the direction of the Milky Way's center and is larger than the previous two interstellar visitors. The increasing frequency of such discoveries is attributed to more advanced telescope technology, which promises more sightings in the coming years.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease advises against feeding children certain common foods to prevent chronic illness in adulthood. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which contain harmful preservatives. The doctor also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation and train taste buds to crave unhealthy options, recommending healthier, home-prepared alternatives instead.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding whether to pay for professional movers involves weighing cost against convenience, time, and peace of mind. Financial planners suggest evaluating if you own valuable items that would be expensive to replace if damaged during a self-move. It is also useful to calculate the monetary value of the time saved by outsourcing the labor compared to the high cost of a moving service. Ultimately, the decision should not jeopardize your ability to pay essential bills or compromise long-term financial goals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new books reviewed by The Atlantic advocate for a philosophy that values women's bodies for their functionality rather than their appearance. Casey Johnston's memoir on weightlifting argues for building strength as a way to reject restrictive diet culture and see the body as a working object. Similarly, a biography of fashion designer Claire McCardell highlights her focus on creating practical, comfortable clothing that allowed women to be active, famously incorporating features like pockets. Both works suggest a refreshing shift from prioritizing aesthetics to celebrating what bodies can do.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz have proposed that the EU lead the formation of an alternative to the World Trade Organization (WTO). They argue the WTO's dispute resolution mechanism is broken, largely due to a long-standing U.S. blockade on appointing judges. The new organization would aim to liberalize trade among like-minded nations, potentially starting with a partnership with the CPTPP trade bloc, and would exclude countries not adhering to fair competition rules, such as China.

          <p>Archaeologists in northern England have discovered a collection of unusually large Roman-era shoes at the Magna Roman Fort near Hadrian's Wall. Several of the 2,000-year-old leather shoes are over 30cm long, equivalent to a modern US size 15, a size range that is exceptionally rare at other Roman sites. The discovery in a defensive ditch has puzzled researchers, who are now investigating which Roman regiments were stationed there. They speculate that the soldiers may have come from a region of the vast Roman Empire known for taller people.</p>
