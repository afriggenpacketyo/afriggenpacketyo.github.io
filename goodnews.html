          <h2>Increase in Turkish Citizens Seeking German Citizenship Driven by Political and Economic Factors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany has seen a significant increase in Turkish citizens seeking German citizenship, with the number more than doubling in 2024. This surge is attributed to several factors, including Germany's recent citizenship reforms allowing dual citizenship and the deteriorating political and economic situation in Turkey. Many Turkish immigrants are drawn to Germany for career opportunities and the benefits of a German passport, which offers visa-free travel to numerous countries. Despite integrating into German society, some Turkish citizens still feel a strong connection to their homeland and experience instances of discrimination in Germany.</p>

          <p>Decades after leaving high school to serve in the Vietnam War, Dennis Snyder and Richard Hill received their high school diplomas. Both men, now in their 80s, were honored alongside the graduating class of 2025 as part of Operation Recognition, a program by the Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs. Snyder, who obtained his GED but longed for a high school diploma, expressed feeling like "a million dollars" upon receiving it. He shared the honor with friends who did not return from the war and believes more veterans deserve such recognition.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The "miSignal" test kit can assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer simultaneously without requiring a blood test. A survey using the test kits in Hokkaido, Japan, detected changes in pre-malignant cells, leading to early treatment for some participants. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, in urine.</p>

          <h2>Ancient Chinese Wisdom Helps Decode Cell Life Cycles in Yeast</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. The study, led by Professor Li Lei, reorganizes the understanding of metabolic phases in yeast into four distinct yet interconnected phases. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke in traditional Chinese medicine. The researchers' model reflects a unique metabolic state in each of the four phases.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are introducing "property supermarkets" to support the country's housing market, which has seen declining prices and subdued buyer sentiment. These platforms, both online and offline, aim to make homebuying more transparent and efficient. Chengdu is the latest city to launch a homebuying platform, partnering with state-owned and private developers to feature projects on a mobile app. Similar initiatives have been rolled out in other cities, consolidating information and bundling services to improve transaction efficiency.</p>
