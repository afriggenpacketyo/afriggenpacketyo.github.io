          <p>Wayfarers Chapel, a historic landmark in Rancho Palos Verdes, is seeking a new location due to ongoing landslides that forced its disassembly. Chapel leaders have identified a prospective site next to Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall, on the old Battery Barnes military site, as an ideal location. The relocation plan includes rebuilding the chapel with a visitor's center, museum, cafe, and gardens, while maintaining the sweeping ocean views. The original chapel, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright Jr., was built in 1951, but was damaged by recent landslides with shattered windows and warped metal framing. Securing the new site and raising the estimated $20 million for rebuilding are the next steps for the chapel's leadership.</p>

Interfaith couples face challenges, such as backlash from their communities, while LGBTQ+ individuals may experience rejection from their families and religious groups. Former members of strict religious communities, like Jehovah's Witnesses, can be ostracized for leaving their faith.

The three-month outlook indicates that meteorological summer, spanning from June 1 to August 31, is twice as likely to be hotter than average in 2025. This prediction follows an unprecedented spring, which was recorded as the sunniest, as well as one of the driest and warmest on record.

          <p>Artists are increasingly using their work to address climate change and promote environmental awareness, seeking to influence policy and inspire action. Art can rekindle relationships with the environment, foster care, and encourage individuals to take responsibility, rather than relying solely on experts. Installations and sculptures aim to evoke the beauty of nature and remind people of what could be lost, bridging the gap between abstract climate concepts and tangible experiences. By intervening directly in ecological infrastructure, art offers tools of resistance and civic reparation, creating new imaginaries and temporary communities.</p>

The proposal follows a report by the UN nuclear watchdog stating Iran has further increased its production of enriched uranium.

The precise details of the deal are not yet clear, but the proposal is a response to concerns over Iran's uranium enrichment levels.</p>

          <p>A BBC article investigates the viral TikTok trend of using a "McMigraine Meal" (Coke and fries) to alleviate migraine symptoms. While some individuals find that the caffeine and sugar in Coke, or the salt in fries, can provide temporary relief, experts caution against relying on this as a regular treatment. Migraines are complex neurological conditions that cannot be cured by a fast-food meal, and excessive caffeine or processed foods can even trigger migraines in some people. Neurologists recommend focusing on lifestyle changes and medical treatments for managing migraines effectively.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience is partly due to his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself. This adaptability reassures swing voters that anything extreme is provisional, as Trump tests limits but is also generally willing to retreat. By checking himself and being checked by others, Trump meets the expectations of an important group of voters who approve of his presidency. This dynamic interaction, where he accepts counterpressure and retreats, is crucial to his continued viability.</p>

          <p>The skulls of 19 Black patients, once used in racist phrenology studies in Germany, have been repatriated to New Orleans and laid to rest. The remains were taken from a New Orleans hospital in the 1870s and sent to Germany for research based on the now-discredited pseudoscience of phrenology. The University of Leipzig returned the skulls, acknowledging their acquisition was unethical and in a colonial context. A multi-faith memorial service and jazz funeral honored the deceased, marking a significant act of international restitution.</p>
