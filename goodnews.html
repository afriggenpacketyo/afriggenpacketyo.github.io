        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's rugby team defeated Argentina 35-12 in their first Test match in La Plata, driven by a dominant second-half performance. Fly-half George Ford, earning his 100th cap, was instrumental, orchestrating the offense and contributing points through a drop goal and penalties. England overcame being reduced to 13 men in the first half to score four tries after the break, with Tom Roebuck scoring twice. Despite a brief comeback from the Pumas, England's composed play and strong defense secured a convincing win ahead of the second Test next week.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has declared the creation of a new political entity called the "America Party," following a poll he conducted on his social media platform, X. He suggested the party could gain significant influence by focusing on a small number of key congressional seats, thereby acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. This announcement comes after a public falling out between Musk and President Trump, largely over a major spending bill. Musk, a major political donor, has framed the new party as a response to what he calls excessive government spending.</p>

The star-studded event, dubbed the "heavy metal Live Aid," also featured performances from Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and other rock legends paying tribute to the influential band.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing a seemingly impossible target of 536 runs on the final day of the second Test against India, England's cricket team may be reconsidering its aggressive "Bazball" philosophy that shuns draws. To preserve their 1-0 series lead, England's most realistic option is to bat for a draw, a significant departure from their stated mantra under coach Brendon McCullum. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick acknowledged the team is not "stupid enough" to ignore the possibility of a draw when a win is out of reach. This situation presents the first major philosophical test for England's high-risk, high-reward approach.</p>

          <p>As per his own instructions, the full autobiography of Mark Twain has been published 100 years after his death, revealing his uncensored thoughts on his life and times. The work was compiled from years of daily dictations where he spoke freely, knowing the contents would not be revealed while those he criticized were still alive. Curators at UC Berkeley have worked for years to reconstruct the unconventional, non-linear narrative. The book contains sharp critiques of figures like President Theodore Roosevelt and raw heartbreak over his daughter's death, offering a new, unfiltered look at the iconic American author.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris anticipates a "great race" at the British Grand Prix, suggesting that as many as six cars from Red Bull, McLaren, Mercedes, and Ferrari have a realistic chance of winning. Qualifying was exceptionally tight, with the top six drivers separated by just 0.23 seconds. Teams have opted for different car setups, with Red Bull prioritizing straight-line speed while Ferrari and McLaren have focused more on cornering performance. This strategic diversity, combined with the close pace and potential for rain, sets the stage for a highly competitive and unpredictable race at Silverstone.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns emphasized that the American Revolution is the most important event in world history for creating the concept of a "citizen." He described the founding period as a violent civil war, arguing that understanding its complexity and the founders' flaws makes its achievements more inspiring. Burns believes that despite current political divisions, which he sees as a recurring feature of U.S. history, the nation's founding principles provide a path for unity. He stressed that citizenship is an active responsibility requiring lifelong learning and engagement with differing ideas.</p>
