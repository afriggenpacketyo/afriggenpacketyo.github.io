          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling a reinforcement of Canada's sovereignty and independence against perceived threats from US President Donald Trump. This move is viewed as a "theatrical display" meant to differentiate Canada from the US, especially after Trump's suggestions of Canada becoming a US state. The King's visit marks a rare occasion, with the last British monarch delivering Canada's throne speech in 1977. While the Canadian population's sentiment towards the monarchy varies, the invitation underscores the government's support for the Crown amidst political tensions.</p>
