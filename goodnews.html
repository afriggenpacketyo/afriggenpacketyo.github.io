          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake shook parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina on Saturday morning, with the epicenter located near Greenback, Tennessee. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling tremors, and the USGS received over 23,000 reports from the public within the first hour. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, the event served as a reminder of earthquake preparedness in a region more accustomed to tornadoes and floods. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is known to be one of the most active in the Southeast, with a 5% chance of a magnitude 4 or larger aftershock in the next week.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in creative and business decisions. Diller emphasizes that while data can provide insights into past events, it cannot predict future success, and over-reliance on data can hinder innovative thinking. He recounts his experiences at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week" and trusted his gut to identify compelling projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." Diller argues that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea, which should be evaluated based on its inherent merit and common sense.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating residents' data privacy rights. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, accusing the company of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data. While Google did not admit any wrongdoing, the settlement resolves claims related to the Chrome browser's incognito setting, location history disclosures on Google Maps, and biometric data use in Google Photos. Google stated that it has already implemented policy changes related to these allegations and will continue to build robust privacy controls into its services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Climate change is altering the migration patterns of birds, impacting their ability to feed and breed successfully. Rising sea levels are affecting coastal stopover locations, while ocean acidification is reducing the availability of small crustaceans, a key food source for migratory birds. Extreme weather events are also posing a threat, and warmer temperatures are causing some birds to shorten their routes or abandon migration altogether. The article suggests supporting migratory birds by expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly environments, such as reducing pollution and avoiding glass buildings.</p>

The article also defines "risk on" and "risk off" environments, describing how investor sentiment shifts between optimism and fear, impacting asset allocation. In a risk-off environment, investors tend to move away from riskier assets like tech stocks and into safer havens like cash, bonds, and defensive sectors.
