          <p>The UK government is set to reveal a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by lowering energy costs for over 7,000 businesses, potentially cutting bills by up to 25%. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will exempt manufacturers from certain green energy levies, reducing costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027. The strategy also includes plans to upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and increase research and development spending, with a focus on eight key sectors. Critics argue that the plan is an admission of the high costs of net zero, while supporters welcome the measures to address skills shortages, energy costs, and access to capital.</p>

Alcaraz expressed surprise at his quick adaptation to grass courts, exceeding his initial goal of simply playing a few matches to improve his movement. His victory has led former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash to declare him the "red-hot favorite" for the upcoming tournament. This win marks Alcaraz's fourth grass-court title, placing him second only to Novak Djokovic among active players in titles won on this surface.</p>

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki attended the service at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman, where the final stage of the battle was fought. Tamaki emphasized the importance of preserving the stories of war survivors and the enduring desire for peace, while Ishiba pledged to reduce the burden of U.S. bases on Okinawa. The Battle of Okinawa took a heavy toll on the local population, and the island continues to host the bulk of U.S. forces in Japan, leading to local discontent.</p>

          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy last summer. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. Advocates argue that ketamine can make patients more receptive to psychotherapy and should be more widely available, while caution is urged due to the drug's potential for misuse and serious health risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague will center on increasing defense spending, potentially requiring Germany to significantly boost its military capabilities. NATO aims for member states to spend 5% of their GDP on defense, a substantial increase from the current 2% target, with Germany supporting a plan to allocate 3.5% to defense and 1.5% to security-related infrastructure. This would necessitate a massive financial commitment from Germany, raising questions about resource allocation and political support. The summit will also address the need for additional troops in Europe, posing recruitment challenges for the German military, which may necessitate a reconsideration of compulsory military service.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending, a key demand of U.S. President Donald Trump, with the goal of deterring Russia and rebalancing the alliance. While this may give Trump a win, concerns remain about his potential early departure from the summit, as happened at the G7 meeting in Canada. The ambitious goal of spending 5% of GDP on defense could transform European societies, shifting priorities from social justice to military power, leading to resistance in some countries. The summit is also expected to address the situation in Ukraine, although its aspirations to join NATO are unlikely to take center stage.</p>

          <p>New York City is utilizing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate secures a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices, continuing until a winner emerges. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support and prevents fringe candidates from winning in crowded fields. While the system offers benefits like preventing wasted votes, it also presents challenges such as complexity, reduced transparency, and potential for delayed results.</p>
