          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has imposed a provisional fine of nearly £46 million on former fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm, Woodford Investment Management (WIM). The penalty relates to the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund, which locked in and caused losses for approximately 300,000 investors. The FCA found that WIM and Woodford made inappropriate investment decisions that increased the fund's holdings in illiquid assets, making it impossible to meet redemption requests. WIM has stated its intent to appeal the decision, arguing the true cause of investor losses was the subsequent liquidation of the fund.</p>

The sentencing follows a comprehensive investigation involving state and local law enforcement, during which Alexander or his associates sold drugs to an undercover officer or informant on twelve separate occasions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by Scott Anderson, "King of Kings," examines the 1979 Iranian Revolution, arguing that its outcome was not a historical inevitability but the result of specific miscalculations and circumstances. The book focuses on the hubris of the Shah, the strategic ignorance and inaction of the U.S. government, and the ability of Ayatollah Khomeini's camp to outmaneuver them. Anderson posits that a combination of factors, including the Shah's illness and the Carter administration's distraction with other global crises, created a power vacuum that the revolutionaries exploited. The analysis suggests the Islamic Republic's rise was more accidental than predestined.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals turning 70, purchasing an annuity can be a strategic move to secure a guaranteed income stream for life, but it requires careful consideration. Experts note that buying an immediate annuity at an older age typically results in higher monthly payments, which can be advantageous for healthy individuals with a long life expectancy. However, the trade-offs include a loss of liquidity, as the principal is tied up with the insurance company, and potentially high fees. The decision ultimately depends on an individual's health, other income sources, and financial goals, such as leaving an inheritance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Students across Scotland have received their exam results, showing a slight increase in pass rates for National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher qualifications compared to last year. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) also reported a narrowing of the attainment gap between students from the most and least deprived areas. Over 147,000 candidates received their marks, with a record number of young Scots being offered university or college placements.

          <p>As U.S. credit card debt remains at historically high levels, financial experts are advising consumers on how to qualify for debt settlement, also known as credit card debt forgiveness. To improve their chances of success, individuals should first organize their finances by reviewing credit reports and creating a detailed inventory of income, expenses, and debts. The next crucial step is to document financial hardship with evidence such as job termination letters or medical bills. Finally, individuals can either contact creditors directly or work with a reputable debt settlement firm, ensuring any final agreement is put in writing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer has increased its adjusted profit guidance for the full year, citing successful cost-cutting measures and strong business performance, which caused its shares to rise over 4%. The pharmaceutical giant also reported second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by better-than-anticipated revenue from its COVID-19 products and other key drugs like Vyndaqel. The company's updated outlook accounts for existing tariffs and potential drug price changes stemming from ongoing discussions with the Trump administration, which has been pushing for lower U.S. drug prices. The company is actively engaged in these discussions.</p>
