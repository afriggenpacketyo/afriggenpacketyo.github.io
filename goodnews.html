          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 14:40:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ron Howard's new film "Eden" portrays the true story of 1930s Europeans who sought utopia on a remote Galapagos island, only to descend into conflict and murder. The article reviews the film as a lurid and entertaining survival-of-the-fittest narrative, starring Jude Law, Sydney Sweeney, and Ana de Armas. While not deeply philosophical, the movie is described as a well-cast and fast-paced thriller, akin to an expensive reality show about mismatched survivalists. The performances are noted for their broad strokes of personality, contributing to a sticky, sweaty, and enjoyable watch.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has broadened an injunction preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from "sanctuary" cities and counties that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement. The ruling, which initially covered a handful of jurisdictions, now extends to dozens more, including major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. The judge previously deemed the president's executive order unconstitutional, siding with local governments who argue it violates the Tenth Amendment. The administration maintains that these policies hinder federal law enforcement, while cities contend they are crucial for building community trust.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "Relay," starring Riz Ahmed and directed by David Mackenzie, is reviewed as a compelling and intelligent paranoid thriller. Ahmed plays an off-the-grid fixer who helps whistleblowers disappear, communicating through a text-telephone relay service to maintain anonymity. The article praises the movie for its tense, clockwork-like plot as he guides a biotech scientist, played by Lily James, on the run from corporate pursuers. It updates the classic '70s conspiracy genre for the digital age, creating a dizzyingly enjoyable cat-and-mouse chase that explores themes of safety, loneliness, and cynicism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Virginia is at the forefront of efforts to protect and reintroduce endangered species. The facility houses over 20 at-risk species, including the Przewalski's horse and the black-footed ferret, studying their genetics, reproduction, and ecology to prevent extinction. Conservation biologists at the institute express concern over the accelerated rate of species loss, which is 10 to 1,000 times the normal background rate, causing cascading effects on ecosystems. The SCBI's work highlights both the critical threat of extinction and the dedicated scientific efforts being made to preserve global biodiversity.</p>

          <p>The UK is expected to experience a surge in temperature, with highs reaching 30C (86F) on the upcoming bank holiday Monday. This warm spell is attributed to the remnants of Hurricane Erin pushing tropical air towards the country. The pleasant weather is anticipated for major events like the Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festivals. However, the heat will be short-lived, as the storm is predicted to bring cooler, unsettled weather and rain from Tuesday onwards. This summer is already on track to be one of the hottest on record for the UK.</p>

          <p>A speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinting at potential interest rate cuts spurred a significant rally on Wall Street, particularly for cyclical, non-tech stocks. Powell's comments at the Jackson Hole symposium were well-received by investors, leading the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new all-time high. Companies like DuPont and Home Depot saw gains, as lower borrowing costs are expected to benefit economically sensitive sectors. While the broader market advanced, some major tech stocks saw smaller gains, as their performance is more closely tied to the AI boom than to interest rate fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a five-year legal battle, a central Berlin street formerly known as "Mohrenstrasse" (Moor Street) has been officially renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo. Amo was an 18th-century, Africa-born scholar who became the first Black person to receive a doctorate from a European university. Civil society groups had campaigned for decades to change the name, which has racist origins linked to the enslavement of Africans in Prussia. The renaming, finalized on the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade, is seen as a significant step in Germany's process of decolonization and confronting its colonial past.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted for the 31st time since December, with its latest display featuring lava fountains shooting 100 feet high within its summit crater. The eruption is contained and poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular show for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that the frequent episodes are part of the same ongoing eruption, caused by magma accumulating in a lower chamber and being forced to the surface. For Native Hawaiians, the eruptions are culturally significant, seen as the work of the volcano goddess Pele.</p>
