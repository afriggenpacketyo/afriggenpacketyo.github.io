          <h2>Researchers Make Progress in Restoring Bodily Functions After Spinal Cord Injuries</h2>

          <p>Researchers in Switzerland have developed a 'digital bridge' that wirelessly connects an implant on the brain to a spinal cord stimulator, showing promise in restoring movement and other bodily functions in paralyzed individuals. This technology bypasses the injury, sending signals from the brain to the intact part of the spinal cord to enable movement. While walking again is a top priority for some, many patients are more concerned with restoring functions like bladder control, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation. The researchers are also exploring the potential of spinal cord stimulation for individuals with Parkinson's disease, and are now focused on executing clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy.</p>

Hayes sustained non-life-threatening injuries and is currently recovering. The crash occurred when a Dodge Durango, driven by Hayes, collided with a Kia Soul making a left turn. Police have stated that there were no signs of impairment and alcohol is not believed to be a factor, but the investigation is ongoing to determine if speed played a role.

          <p>Marta Carsteanu-Dombi, paralyzed after a bike accident, has regained the ability to walk with the help of a 'digital bridge' connecting an implant on her brain to a spinal cord stimulator. This technology, developed by Swiss neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch and French neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine, allows patients to move paralyzed limbs using their own thoughts. Carsteanu-Dombi, who had no feeling below her waist, was able to take her first steps after training with the digital bridge, which she describes as gaining a superpower. Researchers hope to launch clinical trials in the United States in the next few years to make this technology more widely available.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to sign an executive order aimed at reducing prescription drug prices by 30% to 80%. Trump criticized pharmaceutical companies for charging Americans significantly higher prices than other nations, attributing it to research and development costs borne solely by American consumers. The executive order will institute a 'Most Favored Nation's Policy,' aligning U.S. drug prices with the lowest prices paid by any nation worldwide. Trump claims this will bring fairness to America and save trillions of dollars.</p>
