        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new article in Polar Record by Professor Jukka Tuhkuri challenges the long-held theory about the sinking of Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship, Endurance, in 1915. Tuhkuri argues the ship's loss stemmed from structural weaknesses and engineering flaws, rather than solely from the crushing pressure of the Antarctic ice. Designed for Arctic conditions, the vessel's engine room notably lacked cross-beams and diagonal bracing, rendering it vulnerable to side-to-side compression. This research, based on expedition diaries and structural analysis, offers a fresh perspective on the famous maritime mystery, suggesting Endurance's reputation for indestructibility was unwarranted.</p>

          <p>The head of Citic Securities emphasizes Hong Kong's evolving role as a financial hub, asserting it should connect the broader Asia-Pacific region, not just mainland China, with the global market. He highlights the city's deep fundraising pool, capital freedom, and unique advantages under the "one country, two systems" principle as crucial for attracting listings and raising capital from across Asia. This perspective emerges as mainland capital increasingly flows into Hong Kong amid US-China decoupling, with external direct investment from the mainland exceeding 1 trillion yuan last year. The article positions Hong Kong as poised to establish itself as Asia’s primary financing hub. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index reached a record high for the second consecutive day, buoyed by a tech rally on Wall Street following a significant deal between OpenAI and AMD. Chip stocks, including Advantest and Tokyo Electron, were major movers on the index, reflecting the positive market sentiment. This surge also follows the election of Sanae Takaichi as the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, positioning her as a potential first female prime minister. The article notes that AMD shares skyrocketed almost 24% after the company's deal with OpenAI, boosting U.S. indexes and contributing to the global tech optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a financial aid package exceeding $10 billion for U.S. farmers, particularly soybean growers impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans. Discussions involving the Treasury and Agriculture Departments are in early stages, with top economic adviser Kevin Hassett promising "big measures" soon to address the issue of unsold produce. This initiative aims to alleviate the financial strain on farmers, as China, which purchased $12.6 billion in U.S. soybeans in 2024, has made no purchases this year. The administration is also engaging with other global soybean customers as part of broader trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Renewable energy sources, including nuclear power, collectively surpassed coal as the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of the year, a historic first according to energy think tank Ember. This milestone was driven by strong growth in solar and wind power, which met all new electricity demand and slightly reduced fossil fuel use. While developing countries, especially China, led this clean energy charge, some richer nations like the US and EU increased reliance on fossil fuels. Despite these regional disparities, Ember calls this a "crucial turning point," with solar power providing the largest share of new electricity and seeing dramatic cost reductions globally.</p>

          <p>This article exposes a growing trend of modeling scams targeting older individuals, detailing how two victims, Judy Corker and Roland Parker, lost hundreds of pounds to fake agencies. Scammers capitalize on the fashion industry's embrace of older models, charging for phony portfolios and non-existent jobs. The article advises vigilance against requests for payments via "friends and family" options on platforms like PayPal, which lack buyer protection, unlike the "goods and services" option. It emphasizes the importance of understanding payment protections and urges individuals to report suspicious activities to authorities like Action Fraud to prevent further victimization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed a bullish outlook on Take-Two Interactive, citing its newfound "scarcity value" in the video game industry after major competitors Activision and Electronic Arts went private. With the upcoming release of "Grand Theft Auto VI," anticipated to be a massive success, Take-Two stands as the sole major publicly-traded American pure-play video game company. Cramer highlighted the company's strong recent quarter, growing player accounts for GTA Online, and success with other franchises like NBA 2K. He suggests any stock dip due to potential game delays could be a buying opportunity for investors, emphasizing the company's strong market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is set to increase parking meter prices by 50 cents per hour across its 35,000 paid spaces and extend paid parking hours, including Sundays and until midnight in nightlife areas. This move, the first rate increase in over a decade, aims to generate an estimated $14.4 million for the city's financially struggling coffers and encourage vehicle turnover for businesses. City transportation officials believe these changes will benefit the city, businesses, and motorists seeking parking. The article notes that this decision comes amidst a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall, driven by legal payouts and lackluster tax revenues, and follows similar rate increases in nearby cities.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes China's strategic decision to relinquish its "developing country" status at the WTO, arguing it gains more than it loses by removing a key talking point for the U.S. and EU. The move is framed through Mao Zedong's theory of protracted war, seen as a "strategic defensive" to conserve resources and reposition politically. By shedding the label, China aligns itself with the Global South, leveraging perceptions more than material advantages. This tactical retreat avoids direct clashes, yields minimal ground, and reframes the global trade battlefield in terms that favor China's long-term position, despite having already conceded some privileges in practice.

          <p>Investor Brad Gerstner cautions that OpenAI's deals with AMD and Nvidia are merely announcements, not deployments, emphasizing that "the best chips will win" in the competitive AI landscape. He highlights intensifying demand for AI services, predicting "absolute compute scarcity" despite efforts to increase supply. The article notes that the AI arms race is a key element in the geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China, citing concerns over Chinese rival DeepSeek's lower-cost models and national security implications. OpenAI's partnerships aim to boost production and build more complex AI models to meet this surging demand, underscoring the critical importance of industry collaboration. (not investment advice)</p>
