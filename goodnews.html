          <p>A new analysis reveals a vast difference in the amount of rental space a budget of $1,500 per month can secure in major U.S. cities. In Manhattan, that amount affords an average of just 216 square feet, whereas in Wichita, Kansas, renters can get an average of 1,329 square feet. The data highlights the extreme housing affordability crisis in large coastal cities like Boston and San Francisco, driven by high demand and limited supply. Conversely, cities in the Midwest and South offer significantly more space for the same price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains like Chipotle, Cava, and Wendy's are increasingly adding spicy items to their menus in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners. This trend is a cost-effective strategy to generate buzz and drive sales amidst slower consumer spending, as sauces and seasonings are easier to implement than new proteins. The preference for bold and adventurous flavors among younger generations, amplified by social media trends like taste tests and spicy challenges, is fueling this culinary shift across the fast-casual and quick-service industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unlike global trends of declining religious affiliation, India's Gen Z is actively engaging with spirituality, but in a personalized and modern way. Many young Indians differentiate between being religious and being spiritual, using faith and practices like meditation as a coping mechanism for mental health and life's uncertainties. This resurgence is visible online, with spiritual content creators and apps gaining popularity, and is also supported by a political climate that promotes Hindu traditions. They are embracing what resonates with them personally rather than blindly following traditional rituals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on the Trump administration's sweeping ban on asylum at the U.S. southern border. The D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled that the administration cannot use the president's proclamation to ignore laws requiring the U.S. to consider claims from migrants who would face persecution or torture if deported. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to discretionary asylum, it affirmed that mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal," must still be available to those who qualify. The ruling is a partial victory for advocates challenging the policy.</p>

          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how federal agents can conduct "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirms that agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like a person's race, their speaking Spanish, or their location, finding that such profiles do not constitute reasonable suspicion. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed after a series of controversial raids by ICE and CBP in Southern California that sparked protests and fear within the region's large Latino community.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a significant position in Equinix, a major data center REIT, following a stock price drop. The drop was triggered by investor concern over the company's increased capital expenditure plans and a downgraded forecast for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO). Elliott, with extensive experience in the data center sector, likely sees the spending as a necessary response to high demand from AI and hyperscalers, viewing it as a long-term growth opportunity. The firm may push for improved market communication and cost optimization to amplify returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders' recent bladder cancer diagnosis, this article explains the reconstructive surgery he underwent, known as neobladder reconstruction. The procedure involves removing the diseased bladder and creating a new one from a section of the patient's own small intestine. While the body adapts well without rejecting the new organ, patients must retrain themselves to use the bathroom as the neobladder cannot signal the brain. Sanders has been open about the challenges, including incontinence, helping to reduce the shame often associated with the condition.</p>
