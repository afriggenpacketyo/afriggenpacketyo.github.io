          <p>The burgeoning demand for data is rapidly transforming the commercial real estate sector, giving rise to new categories like "quantum real estate" and "powered land." The latter refers to land prepped with necessary permits, utility commitments, and infrastructure for data centers, with an estimated 40,000 acres needed globally in the next five years. Investment managers like Hines are pivoting to secure these power rights, recognizing them as a scarce and valuable asset class. This shift indicates that major real estate developers are becoming crucial power brokers in the AI infrastructure boom, moving beyond traditional building to enable computation. The article highlights significant opportunities in emerging markets but notes challenges in securing land and utility commitments. (not investment advice)</p>

These automatic protections, fully implemented by year-end, aim to ensure teens see age-appropriate content by default. Accounts will be placed under a 13+ setting, requiring parental permission to opt out, and will block search results for terms like "alcohol" or "gore." Additionally, teens will be prevented from following accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate content, with existing followers losing access. The article also notes that Meta's AI technology integrated into Instagram will adhere to these PG-13 guidelines for responses.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a partnership with OpenAI, enabling shoppers to make purchases directly through the ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot. This strategic move aims to adapt to evolving consumer shopping behaviors, where AI chatbots are increasingly used for product discovery and recommendations. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon stated the new AI feature will be "multi-media, personalized and contextual," promising a more enjoyable and convenient shopping future. While the launch date for Walmart purchases on ChatGPT is undisclosed, OpenAI previously introduced an Instant Checkout feature supporting single-item purchases from Etsy and soon, Shopify merchants. This collaboration marks a significant step in AI-driven e-commerce, with OpenAI charging a fee for transactions.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is hosting a three-day conference on Gaza's reconstruction, aiming to establish a role in the post-ceasefire peace process. Led by the UK's Middle East Minister, the event gathers representatives from various governments, businesses, and civil society, notably excluding the US and Israel. This initiative runs parallel to US President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan, which envisions a temporary "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" overseeing Gaza. Experts suggest the UN is the ideal forum for long-term reconstruction, which is estimated to cost $50 billion and span decades. The article emphasizes the need for concrete actions and inclusive discussions, even with opposing parties like Hamas.</p>

The bank's net income rose 15% to $3.8 billion, and overall revenues increased by 9% year-over-year. The services business recorded its best quarter ever, while banking revenues surged 34% and the markets segment delivered its strongest third quarter with a 15% jump in revenues. CEO Jane Fraser attributed this performance to investments in new products, digital assets, and AI, driving improved business performance and returns. The article notes that expenses rose due to the sale of a 25% stake in its Mexico business, Banamex, ahead of a public stock offer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conservative commentator Alex Jones, effectively upholding the $1.4 billion in damages he was ordered to pay to the families of victims from the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The court provided no explanation for its denial, signaling a definitive end to Jones's attempts to overturn the judgments. This legal outcome represents a significant victory for the Sandy Hook families, who endured years of harassment and false conspiracy theories propagated by Jones. The ruling reinforces accountability for defamation, particularly in cases involving tragic public events, allowing the families to move forward with collecting the awarded compensation for their suffering.</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates recently hit a three-year low and are projected to fall further, homebuyers can anticipate significant shifts in the housing market. Experts predict an increase in competition, potentially leading to bidding wars, as lower rates enhance affordability and draw more buyers. While lower rates could save money, this might be offset by rising home prices due to increased demand and relatively low inventory. Lenders are also experiencing a surge in mortgage and refinance applications, which could result in slower processing and closing times. The article advises prospective buyers to act if they find a suitable home, considering refinancing later if rates drop further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the New York City mayoral race, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, is emerging as a significant, albeit unlikely, factor. Despite having little chance of winning, Sliwa's presence could inadvertently aid democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's path to victory by siphoning votes from former Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent. Sliwa, known for his eccentric persona and defiance, has rejected calls from high-profile Republicans and billionaires to drop out, even alleging bribery attempts. The article highlights Sliwa's unwavering commitment to his campaign, suggesting his refusal to withdraw will likely have a substantial impact on the final election score.</p>

          <p>Jeep, under Stellantis, is overhauling its Grand Wagoneer lineup for the 2026 model year as part of a multi-year brand turnaround plan. The changes include updated styling, a new extended-range plug-in hybrid (EREV) powertrain, and a simplified, less expensive model lineup under a unified "Grand Wagoneer" name, dropping the standalone "Wagoneer" nameplate. Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf admitted the initial dual nameplates and high pricing confused consumers, stating the new strategy aims to reach a broader audience with a starting price under $65,000. This is a crucial move for Jeep, which seeks to reverse declining sales and regain market share, with the EREV model expected to be the first from Stellantis.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects the UK to be the second-fastest-growing G7 economy this year and next, with modest growth rates of 1.3%. This outlook surpasses most G7 nations, except the US, despite global trade and geopolitical tensions. However, the IMF also predicts the UK will face the highest inflation in the G7 for 2025 and 2026, primarily driven by energy and utility costs, though it expects inflation to fall to 2% by late next year. The article notes the IMF's slight upgrade for the UK is attributed to strong activity and an improved trade outlook, partly due to a US-UK deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills has announced her candidacy for the 2026 Senate race, aiming to unseat long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, the first woman elected governor of Maine, presents a significant challenge for national Democrats seeking to narrow the Republican Senate majority. While Mills has a strong electoral record in Maine, Collins has never lost a Senate race and won re-election in 2020 despite a Democratic presidential victory in the state. Mills' entry is already generating a contentious Democratic primary, with progressives, including Senator Bernie Sanders, rallying behind a younger candidate, highlighting internal party debates over generational change and future direction.</p>
