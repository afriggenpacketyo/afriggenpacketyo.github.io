          <h2>Understanding the Impact of Medical Debt on Credit Scores and Available Solutions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 14:21:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unpaid medical debt can negatively impact credit scores, but recent changes in credit reporting rules and available relief programs are easing the burden for many patients. Paid medical collections no longer appear on credit reports, and there is a one-year waiting period before medical bills sent to collections are added to credit reports. Smaller debts under $500 are excluded from credit reports altogether. Strategies for managing medical debt include reviewing and negotiating bills, applying for financial assistance, considering debt relief programs, and monitoring credit reports. Taking proactive steps can help individuals avoid collections and limit potential damage to their credit score.</p>

          <p>International stocks are outperforming U.S. stocks so far in 2025, with the MSCI ACWI ex-USA index returning 15.7% compared to the S&P 500's 1.5%. This shift is driven by concerns over market volatility in the U.S., uncertainty regarding policies, and relatively weaker performance compared to global counterparts. Financial professionals suggest diversifying portfolios with foreign stocks for exposure to different economic cycles, monetary policies, and growth drivers. Adding foreign stocks can also help diversify away from U.S.-specific risks. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Agriculture experts are casting doubt on the FBI's claim that a crop fungus smuggled by Chinese students poses a significant threat to U.S. agriculture. The fungus, Fusarium graminearum, is described by prosecutors as a potential agricultural terrorism weapon. However, experts say it is a common type of fungus already widespread in U.S. crop fields that likely poses little risk to food safety. They note that the fungus has been in the U.S. for over a century and can be prevented by spraying pesticides, only becoming dangerous if ingested regularly and in large quantities. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI have declined to comment.</p>

The analysts raised their price target to $220 per share from $200, maintaining a buy rating. Despite concerns about beef inflation, the warmer season is boosting business.

The company said a listing is expected to occur after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions. Gemini is the latest crypto firm to pursue a public listing as President Donald Trump's administration pushes more favorable regulations for the industry. In March, the company named former Affirm executive Dan Chen as its CFO in preparation for a public offering. (not investment advice)</p>

The event, a celebration of WorldPride, featured classical music, choral performances, and drag performances. The orchestra had hoped to play at the Kennedy Center, but the Trump administration, which took over leadership of the center, reportedly declined the offer. The Trump administration has issued executive orders limiting transgender rights and banning transgender people from serving in the armed forces.

          <p>Tesla stock climbed about 5% Friday after threats and insults between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump fueled a $152 billion rout for the company's market cap a day earlier. Analysts cited a Politico report that Trump had scheduled a call Friday with Musk to broker a truce. However, a senior White House official told NBC News Friday that Trump is "not interested" in a call with Musk. Musk spent several days attacking the president's signature tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination," after the Tesla chief's tenure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency came to an end last week.
