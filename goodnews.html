          <p>A recent survey indicates that millions of adults have sought chiropractic treatment in recent years, prompting experts to weigh in on the potential benefits and risks. Chiropractors focus on manual spinal adjustments and musculoskeletal issues, while spine doctors undergo medical school and specialized training. While chiropractic care may reduce tension, inflammation, and stress, experts caution that it may lead to complications if used for more serious underlying issues. Transparency and a clear treatment plan are crucial when selecting a chiropractic professional, and patients should feel comfortable throughout the process.</p>
