          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, became the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about shark conservation. Pugh swam 62 miles over 12 days in frigid waters, aiming to change perceptions of sharks maligned by the film "Jaws." He emphasizes the ecological importance of sharks and the unsustainable rate at which they are being killed. Despite the mental and physical challenges, Pugh hopes his swim will inspire greater respect and protection for these apex predators.</p>

The visit follows Trump's earlier remarks about acquiring Canada, which Carney firmly rejected. The King's presence reaffirms the constitutional bond and invites reflection on Canada's national identity.</p>

          <p>After 81 years, the remains of four U.S. airmen killed in a WWII bomber crash off New Guinea are being returned to their hometowns for burial. A family member's 12-year investigation led to the discovery of the crash site, and a Navy dive team recovered remains and personal effects. The bomber, nicknamed "Heaven Can Wait," was shot down in 1944, killing all 11 crew members. The recovery and burial ceremonies bring closure to the families of the fallen soldiers.</p>

The Dodgers' coaching staff is encouraging Scott to aim for more chase outside the zone, even if it means issuing more walks.
