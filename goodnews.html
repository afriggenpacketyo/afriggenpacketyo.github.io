          <p>Renowned painter Alex Katz, now 98, has curated an exhibition at Maine's Portland Museum of Art titled "Painting Energy," featuring over 100 paintings he gifted from his personal collection. After a seven-decade career focused on his own figurative art, Katz is now championing the work of other emerging and established artists, aiming to support those who face the same early-career difficulties he once did. The collection is defined not by a specific style but by the energetic impact of the art, reflecting Katz's belief in the immediate, visceral connection a painting can create. Katz continues to paint daily, embracing the fear and excitement of starting new work.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Six Phrases to Encourage Children to Listen</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 09:35:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests six key phrases to foster long-term cooperation rather than immediate obedience. The approach emphasizes creating emotional safety and connection, which helps calm a child's nervous system and makes them more receptive. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative, defusing shame and preventing power struggles. By validating feelings and ensuring children feel heard and supported, parents can build a foundation of trust where listening becomes a natural outcome rather than a forced behavior.</p>

          <p>As the Premier League's transfer window nears its Monday deadline, several major deals are creating significant intrigue and drama. Newcastle United's Alexander Isak is reportedly attempting to force a move to Liverpool, a saga that has dominated the summer transfer period. Meanwhile, Arsenal secured Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace in a last-minute £60 million deal, hijacking the move from rivals Tottenham. Other potential moves include Manchester clubs vying for PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and Crystal Palace negotiating the sale of defender Marc Guehi to Liverpool, setting the stage for a frantic final day of club roster changes.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking Britain's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move expected to support approximately 4,000 UK jobs into the 2030s. This strategic partnership will create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, significantly bolstering NATO's northern flank. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer praised the deal as a driver of growth and national security, highlighting the world-class expertise of the UK's shipbuilding industry.</p>

          <h2>An Argument for Hunting as an Ethical and Sustainable Form of Meat Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 09:00:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, a self-proclaimed liberal hunter argues that hunting is a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat compared to factory farming. The author recounts the emotional gravity of her first hunt, emphasizing a deep connection to the animal and the environment, a stark contrast to the detachment of buying plastic-wrapped meat. The article suggests that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation, with licensing fees and taxes on firearms directly funding wildlife management.

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," Dr. Sanjay Gupta details revolutionary advances in chronic pain treatment that focus on the brain. He highlights "reverse translational research," a patient-first approach where scientists study real-world pain experiences to identify objective biomarkers. This method has enabled researchers to map the unique neural signatures of an individual's pain, leading to treatments like deep brain stimulation (DBS) that can predict and interrupt pain signals. While still in early stages, these breakthroughs offer evidence that pain circuitry is measurable and treatable, promising a future with more effective, non-surgical pain management.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts Unclaimed Property Division is working to reunite families with items found in long-abandoned safe deposit boxes, including two Purple Heart medals from World War II veterans. The division holds over $4 billion in unclaimed property, most of which is money, but also includes a vast array of physical items ranging from gold bars and jewelry to more unusual finds like love letters and cremated remains. After eight years of nonpayment and failed contact attempts, the contents are turned over to the state. If owners cannot be located, the items are eventually sold at auction, with the full sale value remaining available for the original owner to claim indefinitely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using new chromosomal analysis techniques, scientists have resolved a long-standing debate by identifying the comb jelly as the first animal group to diverge from the common ancestor of all animals. For decades, researchers debated whether sea sponges or comb jellies held this distinction. By comparing the gene arrangements on chromosomes of both creatures to their closest single-celled relatives, the team found that comb jellies showed the least genetic reshuffling, indicating they split off earlier in evolutionary history. This discovery provides a crucial anchor point for understanding the subsequent evolution and diversification of the entire animal kingdom.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History explores the little-known origins of surfing on the U.S. mainland, introduced in 1885 by three teenage Hawaiian princes. The royal brothers, David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui, were studying at a military school nearby when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their feats, described in a local newspaper at the time, planted the seed for a culture that would eventually captivate the nation. The exhibit showcases replicas of their massive boards and tells the story of this pivotal moment in American sports history.</p>

          <p>As part of a broader effort to combat plastic pollution, the Australian state of South Australia has banned the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers. These iconic single-use plastics, popular in Asian restaurants and takeaways, will be prohibited starting Monday. Environment Minister Susan Close noted that the containers are used for mere seconds but can persist in the environment for centuries. Although made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process. The ban is the latest step in the state's legislation against single-use plastics, which already includes items like plastic straws and carrier bags.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Open's signature Honey Deuce cocktail is priced at $23 this year, a cost that has risen faster than the general rate of inflation. Since 2015, the price of the popular vodka-based drink has increased by approximately 53%, while the broader Consumer Price Index has risen by about 36% over the same period. If its price had matched inflation, the cocktail would cost around $20.33 today. Despite the steep cost, the event sold over 550,000 Honey Deuces last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue and demonstrating its immense popularity among tennis fans.

          <p>An essay by Avram Alpert addresses the common feeling of guilt or misery when experiencing personal success while the world faces numerous humanitarian and political crises. Drawing on ancient religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, the author argues that feeling the world's pain is a moral response. However, this connection should also extend to sharing in the world's joys, a concept known as sympathetic joy or "freudenfreude." The article suggests that embracing both horror and delight is a form of resistance against cynicism and despair, allowing for a more complete and resilient human experience.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh has ambitious goals for quarterback Justin Herbert, stating he wants to help him win Super Bowls and reach the Hall of Fame. Entering his sixth season, Herbert has yet to win a playoff game, and the challenge has intensified with a season-ending knee injury to star left tackle Rashawn Slater. Rookie Joe Alt will now protect Herbert's blind side as the team prepares to lean on a more physical running game under offensive coordinator Greg Roman. With a talented but crowded AFC quarterback field, this season will be a critical test of whether Herbert can elevate his game and lead the Chargers to postseason success.</p>
