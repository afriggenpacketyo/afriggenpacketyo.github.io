        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe have decreased for the fifth consecutive month, with a nearly 28% drop in May compared to the previous year. This decline is attributed to European customers increasingly choosing cheaper Chinese electric vehicles like those from BYD. Tesla's market share in Europe also fell from 1.8% to 1.2% during the same period, contributing to a year-to-date stock decrease of over 18%. While Tesla faces rising competition from traditional automakers, the company is also grappling with the negative impact of CEO Elon Musk's controversial rhetoric and political activities on its brand image in Europe. Optimism in the company's revamped Model Y SUV is tempered by broader market trends. </p>

Over 120 Labour backbenchers have signed an amendment to scrap the proposals, potentially leading to an embarrassing defeat for the government. Starmer insists the Labour party is united on reforming the welfare system, dismissing criticism as minor distractions. The government's Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill aims to change eligibility for disability and sickness benefits, intending to slow the increase in benefit claims. </p>

          <p>President Trump, during a news conference at the NATO summit in the Netherlands, celebrated increased defense spending commitments from allies, a long-standing goal of his administration. Trump announced that NATO allies have committed to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, which he called "The Hague Defense Commitment." He stated that this agreement would add over $1 trillion annually toward common defense. Trump emphasized that this commitment is a significant win for the United States and Europe, as it addresses the disproportionate share of defense burden previously carried by the U.S.</p>

For years, Netanyahu sought to attack Iran, but was deterred by the United States and his own security chiefs. However, after 12 days of strikes on Iran, he is now taking credit for a shift in the Middle East. While painting Iran as Israel's arch-enemy helped Netanyahu distract from the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians, the war on Iran also helped Netanyahu with political problems at home. </p>

          <p>Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) in China has announced the successful test flight of its Feitian 2 hypersonic vehicle. The test flight represents the first successful acquisition of real-flight data for a rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) engine using a kerosene-hydrogen peroxide propellant. The university stated that the test flight proved key capabilities, including variable-geometry intake operation, thrust-varying acceleration, and autonomous flight with variable angle of attack. NPU is subject to U.S. sanctions and requires specific approval to buy sensitive U.S.-made research equipment. </p>

Predibase will operate as a separate unit after the deal closes, and will continue allowing customers to connect data stored in third-party systems from Amazon , Databricks, Google and Snowflake , in order to customize models. Rubrik has nearly tripled in value since its initial public offering last year, as revenue has consistently surpassed Wall Street's projections. </p>

          <p>NATO allies have agreed to more than double their defense spending target from 2% of gross domestic product to 5% by 2035. The agreement was reached amid tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. The 5% figure includes at least 3.5% for "pure" defense, with the remainder going to security and defense-related "critical infrastructure." Allies will submit annual plans showing a credible path to reach the goal. </p>
