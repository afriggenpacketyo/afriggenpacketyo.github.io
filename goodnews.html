        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the European Union. This arrangement would allow young people to work abroad for up to two years, but specific details, such as age eligibility and number caps, are still under discussion. The BBC reports that the EU has been pushing for stays as long as four years, while the UK is not contemplating more than one or two. Starmer emphasized that the scheme would be reciprocal and would not represent a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, aiming to strengthen the partnership between the UK and the EU.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is entering its critical spring sales period, launching its Memorial Day outdoor sales event with discounts on gardening materials, grills, and patio furniture. The company's Q2, encompassing May, June, and July, is typically its highest revenue quarter, with expectations of a 5.3% year-over-year increase. However, investors remain focused on forward guidance, given tariff uncertainty and elevated mortgage rates impacting housing turnover. Home Depot's stock performance is closely tied to housing market dynamics, with analysts monitoring mortgage rates and contractor demand for larger projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old predator, Mosura fentoni, in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. Nicknamed the "sea moth," this creature possessed three eyes, a pencil sharpener-like mouth lined with teeth, and intimidating claws. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period, revealing a more complex body structure than previously observed in other radiodonts. Researchers believe the Mosura used its body flaps to swim, sharing the waters with other early apex predators.</p>

          <p>Erling Haaland's struggles at Wembley Stadium persisted during Manchester City's FA Cup final loss.

Rooney contrasted Haaland's behavior with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who would not have given the ball away in that situation.</p>

          <p>Federal courts have consistently pushed back against the Trump administration‚Äôs aggressive deportation policies, insisting on the fundamental principle of due process for immigrants. In numerous cases, the judiciary has emphasized that immigrants should have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, particularly as the administration claims novel powers to remove them. This legal stance was underscored by the Supreme Court's rebuke of the administration's attempt to provide Venezuelan immigrants with only a day's warning before deportation, deeming it insufficient to meet due process requirements.</p>

          <p>Opinion writer John McWhorter visits the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. in response to President Trump's criticism of the museum. The museum has so much to see, hear and read that the museum would require multiple visits to fully take in. The museum‚Äôs teachings are never strident or rhetorical. One example that struck me: an exhibition text that stated that starting in the 1950s, when Black people moved into previously white neighborhoods, white flight ‚Äúoften‚Äù ensued. Often, rather than always.</p>
