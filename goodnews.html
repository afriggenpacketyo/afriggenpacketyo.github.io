          <h2>Trump Administration Pauses Social Security Benefit Cuts for Student Loan Defaults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 20:26:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has temporarily halted its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision marks a reversal in policy, as the administration had previously announced the resumption of collection activities on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio after a nearly half-decade pause due to Covid-era policies. The government possesses the authority to seize borrowers' tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits, potentially reducing checks by up to 15%. This reprieve provides older student borrowers with additional time to rectify their debt and avoid reduced benefits, addressing concerns that such reductions could leave retirees without sufficient funds for basic necessities. </p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has pardoned two Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's longline. The divers had been ordered to pay restitution, and the felony convictions prevented them from voting, owning firearms, and traveling freely. The divers had spotted what they believed was an illegal fishing line and freed the marine animals, later reporting the incident to state wildlife officials. The article details the legal battle and the eventual pardon, restoring the divers' rights.</p>

          <p>A judge in California, appointed by President Trump, has blocked the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area. The judge ruled that the government has not provided adequate due process to those facing deportation under the act. This ruling adds to the legal challenges surrounding the administration's use of the wartime law to deport individuals accused of gang membership. The Supreme Court has also weighed in, stating that the government must provide individuals with an opportunity to challenge their deportation under the act.</p>
