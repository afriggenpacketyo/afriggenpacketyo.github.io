          <p>A collaborative research effort by scientists from South China University of Technology and Flinders University in Australia has identified two crucial protein enzymes that support prostate cancer cell growth, survival, and treatment resistance. Published in PNAS, this discovery uncovers a key mechanism regulating the androgen receptor (AR) protein, which fuels the disease. The findings offer a promising foundation for developing new therapeutic strategies to combat prostate cancer, a disease affecting many prominent figures globally.</p>

          <p>Chinese exporters attending the Canton Fair are reporting a notable increase in trade settlements conducted in yuan, particularly with clients from Southeast and Central Asian countries. One company indicated that yuan-settled orders now account for 10-20% of its total exports, a significant rise from single digits last year. This growing preference for the yuan is partly driven by the involvement of Chinese suppliers in major data center projects overseas and the demand for essential diesel-generator sets in developing nations with inadequate power infrastructure. This trend signals a strengthening international acceptance and utility of the Chinese currency in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has made history as Japan's first female prime minister, securing a majority in parliament after forming a coalition with the Japan Innovation Party. Her ascent follows the Liberal Democratic Party's loss of support and the Komeito party's exit from their previous alliance. Takaichi, a hardline conservative and "Abenomics" proponent, has pledged to strengthen Japan's economy and increase women's representation in government, while also advocating for a revised pacifist constitution and a firm stance on China. Her conservative views on social issues like married couples' surnames and same-sex marriage, however, raise concerns among some voters.</p>

          <p>Miami Beach is embarking on "Reefline," an ambitious seven-mile-long artificial reef project that integrates art installations with coral habitat restoration. This initiative aims to recreate the offshore reef lost in the 1970s, transforming underwater concrete sculptures, including 22 cars, into living coral ecosystems. Funded partly by a $5 million bond, the project also seeks to become an accessible ecotourism attraction, visible to snorkelers near the beach. Founders emphasize using resilient corals and plan for an onshore marine learning center, anticipating a decade-long completion for this unique blend of art and environmentalism.</p>
