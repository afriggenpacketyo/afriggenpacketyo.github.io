          <p>Rocket Lab has unveiled a new launch complex for its medium-lift Neutron rocket, a significant step in expanding the global launch vehicle market. The space industry has long faced a capacity shortage, with SpaceX currently dominating over half of all global orbital launches. This overreliance on a single provider presents risks, as highlighted by a past dispute between Elon Musk and the government, reinforcing the critical need for competitors like Rocket Lab, Relativity Space, and Firefly Aerospace to bring their new vehicles to market.

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.6% increase in July, surpassing analyst expectations, largely driven by sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported strong performance in clothing, footwear, and online retail sectors. However, the release of these figures was delayed due to concerns over data quality, and the ONS acknowledged past errors in its statistical methods. While July showed monthly growth, the broader trend for the three months to July indicated a 0.6% decline compared to the previous quarter.</p>

          <p>European stock markets advanced on Friday, with investors anticipating a U.S. jobs report that could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on an interest rate cut. Market sentiment improved after previous U.S. payroll data increased the probability of a September rate cut without signaling a severe economic downturn. In corporate news, Danish wind farm developer Orsted saw its shares fall after lowering its full-year earnings guidance due to lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds. The company is also facing political challenges with its projects in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of Millennial and Gen Z entrepreneurs are using an investment tool known as a "search fund" to acquire small businesses from retiring baby boomers. This model of "entrepreneurship through acquisition" allows individuals to raise capital from investors to buy, operate, and eventually sell an existing company for a profit. The approach is considered lower risk than starting a new venture, as the businesses already have established revenue and customers. With a record number of search funds launched in 2023, the strategy is revitalizing Main Street businesses while offering attractive returns for investors. (not investment advice)</p>
