          <p>Global lithium stocks experienced a significant surge following reports that a major Chinese mine, operated by battery giant CATL, has suspended production. The Yichun Project, which accounts for a notable portion of the world's projected 2025 lithium supply, ceased operations after its permit expired. This development tightens an already constrained supply market, with investors anticipating higher lithium prices due to the disruption. CATL has stated it is actively working to renew the permit and will resume production as soon as possible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an unconventional agreement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the federal government 15% of the revenue from their AI chip sales to China. This arrangement was a condition for receiving export licenses to sell specific advanced chips, such as Nvidia's H20, to the Chinese market after they were previously restricted. President Trump confirmed the deal, stating he negotiated the terms directly with Nvidia's CEO to benefit the country. The move secures market access for the companies while implementing a form of revenue sharing for the government on strategically important technology exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant rally, with Bitcoin's price climbing to nearly $120,000, approaching its all-time high. Ether also saw a substantial increase, reaching its highest price since 2021 after breaking the $4,000 resistance level. This surge has been partly attributed to strong buying activity during Asian trading hours, potentially fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt, which enhances the appeal of hard assets. The positive momentum also lifted crypto-related stocks, including Coinbase and various Bitcoin mining companies, as investors remain bullish on the market's trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a revival by replacing vacant anchor stores with a diverse mix of non-traditional tenants. Instead of department stores, landlords are bringing in entities like churches, bowling alleys, large bookstores, and entertainment complexes to draw in new demographics and increase foot traffic. This strategy of subdividing large retail spaces aims to create community hubs where visitors engage in various activities, leading to increased "cross-shopping" at remaining retail outlets. This shift marks a significant evolution from the traditional retail-focused model to a more experiential and community-oriented one.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower is set to reach its peak, offering a dazzling celestial display for stargazers. Known for its bright and fast-moving meteors, the shower originates from debris left by the comet Swift-Tuttle. The best viewing times are the nights of August 11-12 and 12-13, particularly in the hours just before sunrise. However, visibility this year may be hampered by the light from a bright Sturgeon Moon. For optimal viewing, experts recommend finding a location away from city lights with a clear, unobstructed view of the sky and allowing at least 20 minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness.</p>
