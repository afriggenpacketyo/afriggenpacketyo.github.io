          <p>Musician John Fogerty has released a new album, "Legacy," featuring re-recordings of his classic Creedence Clearwater Revival hits like "Proud Mary" and "Bad Moon Rising." After losing control of his songwriting catalog following the band's breakup in the 1970s, Fogerty recently regained the rights and embarked on this project with his sons, who are part of his touring band. He reflects on the legal and emotional battles over his music, a struggle famously mirrored by artists like Taylor Swift, and expresses the profound personal victory of finally owning and reinterpreting the songs that defined his career.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a student explains the decision to reject an offer from Yale University in favor of attending a small Bible college. The author argues that elite institutions like Yale have shifted from promoting intellectual rigor to enforcing ideological conformity, stifling dissenting opinions and unpopular views. By choosing a Bible college, the student sought an education focused on character, faith, and wrestling with eternal questions, which is presented as a more demanding and sacred challenge. The author contends this path offered greater freedom to think and believe without fear of ideological policing, trading prestige for personal conviction and spiritual formation.</p>

          <p>Neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," delves into the complexities of chronic pain, which affects about 20% of Americans. The article highlights new research suggesting that the brain, not just the site of injury, is often the source of persistent pain, as it can memorize and replay pain signals. It features the story of a musician with a rare pain syndrome who found relief through a groundbreaking clinical trial involving deep brain stimulation. This experimental treatment successfully mapped his pain signals in the brain and used electrical impulses to interrupt them before they reached conscious awareness.</p>

          <p>Renowned painter Alex Katz, now 98, is shifting his focus from creating his own art to championing the work of others by gifting a collection of over 100 paintings to Maine's Portland Museum of Art. The exhibition, titled "Painting Energy," features pieces by both emerging and established artists that Katz personally selected for their dynamism and impact. Having struggled for recognition early in his own seven-decade career, Katz stated his motivation is to help other artists who faced similar difficulties. The donation is a testament to his belief in supporting the artistic community and providing a platform for new talent.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Foster Connection and Cooperation with Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 09:35:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that building genuine, long-term cooperation with children relies on making them feel emotionally safe and connected. The article outlines six "magic phrases" designed to calm a child's nervous system and encourage listening without resorting to power struggles. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" validate a child's feelings and involve them in problem-solving.

          <p>The United Kingdom has secured a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The deal is expected to support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership will create a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates, significantly bolstering NATO's security capabilities on its northern flank. The agreement was hailed as a victory for the British defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a liberal woman recounts her journey to becoming a hunter in Montana, arguing that it is a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat compared to factory farming. She challenges the reflexive disdain for hunting often found on the political left, framing it as a practice that fosters a deep connection to nature, ecosystems, and the realities of life and death. The author emphasizes that hunting, when done responsibly, supports wildlife conservation through licensing fees and taxes on firearms, and that hunters are often among the most passionate advocates for preserving natural habitats.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White is portraying Bruce Springsteen in the new film "Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the period when the musician was battling depression while creating his stark 1982 album, "Nebraska." White describes the daunting task of playing such an iconic figure, noting the intimate connection Springsteen has with his fans. He reveals that Springsteen himself was significantly involved in the film, which the musician called an "antibiopic" due to its narrow focus. White found a connection with the role through the character's feelings of fraudulence and the challenge of forming genuine personal connections offstage.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing, making it the fifth-largest prize in the game's history. The last time the jackpot was won was on May 31, allowing the prize to accumulate over several months. The winner of the next drawing will have the option of receiving the full amount in payments spread over 30 years or choosing a lump sum of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. Despite the astronomical odds of winning, which stand at 1 in 292.2 million, the massive prize continues to attract players nationwide.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," describes a shift in pain research from the traditional "bench-to-bedside" model to a "bedside-to-bench" approach. This reverse translational research begins with a patient's real-world experience, using brain imaging and digital monitoring to identify objective biomarkers for their subjective pain. The article details a groundbreaking study where implanted electrodes mapped the unique neural signature of a patient's pain. This allowed scientists not only to predict pain bursts but also to use deep brain stimulation to interrupt the pain signals, offering new hope for treatment.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History highlights the little-known story of how surfing was introduced to the U.S. mainland in 1885. Three teenage Hawaiian princes, studying at a military school in California, fashioned surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the then-Hawaiian royal sport to locals at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. This act of "surf diplomacy" planted the seeds for the sport's popularity in America, which would later be globally popularized by Duke Kahanamoku. The exhibit features replicas of their large, heavy boards, illustrating the origins of a now-beloved coastal pastime.</p>

As OpenAI sells its powerful AI models directly to businesses like Moderna and Morgan Stanley, it increasingly competes with its primary partner and investor, Microsoft.

          <p>As part of a broader initiative to combat plastic pollution, the Australian state of South Australia is banning single-use, fish-shaped soy sauce containers. The iconic plastic fish, a staple in many Asian takeaway restaurants, will be prohibited from sale or distribution starting Monday. Although made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process properly. This ban builds on previous legislation targeting other single-use plastics and is part of the government's effort to reduce pollution and protect marine life, as officials warn the flow of plastic into the ocean is set to triple by 2040 without action.</p>

          <p>New Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh has set lofty goals for quarterback Justin Herbert, stating a primary aim is to get him to the Hall of Fame, which would require winning multiple Super Bowls. As Herbert enters his sixth season without a playoff victory, the pressure is on to translate his individual talent into team success. The challenge has been intensified by a season-ending injury to star left tackle Rashawn Slater, placing Herbert's protection in the hands of a rookie. The team plans to support Herbert with a more physical running game, a key component of the offensive strategy under coordinator Greg Roman.</p>
