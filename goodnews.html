        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of rocket launches to understand and mitigate the impact of noise pollution from frequent spaceflights. With companies like SpaceX increasing the pace of launches, the noise, including sonic booms, is becoming a growing concern for communities near launch sites. Researchers are focusing on understanding how sound waves travel and how to lessen disruptions. SpaceX is also testing Starship, the largest rocket ever, which is likely to be the loudest; therefore, it is imperative to address rocket noise before problems become pervasive and entrenched.</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla visited Canada, with the monarch opening Canada‚Äôs Parliament in a move interpreted as a subtle rebuke to President Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Charles to emphasize Canada‚Äôs distinct heritage amid Trump's suggestions of annexation. The visit, filled with diplomatic symbolism, highlighted Canada‚Äôs sovereignty and independent future, with citizens expressing a desire to distance themselves from the United States. This event follows Charles's diplomatic forays, including hosting President Volodymyr Zelensky and inviting President Trump to Britain.</p>

          <p>In a bizarre incident in Kentucky, a black bear was discovered inside a home after falling through the ceiling onto the kitchen stove. A game warden, assisted by a sheriff's deputy, responded to the scene and managed to guide the bear out of the house. Investigation revealed that the bear had climbed a ladder, entered the attic through an opening, and subsequently crashed through the ceiling. No injuries were reported, and the incident has sparked humorous reactions online.</p>
