          <h2>Cramer Optimistic About Apple's Future Amidst Expected iPhone 17 Launch and AI Strategy Questions</h2>

          <p>Jim Cramer remains highly optimistic about Apple's stock trajectory, despite its recent surge, citing significant potential from the upcoming iPhone 17 launch event on September 9th. He anticipates a new, slimmer iPhone model featuring Apple's first in-house modem chip could act as a major catalyst, drawing parallels to the successful MacBook Air introduction. Goldman Sachs analysts share this bullish outlook, forecasting an upside to iPhone revenues and reiterating a "buy" rating, driven by form factor updates and potential price increases for the Pro model. This positive sentiment follows Apple's substantial $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, helping to alleviate tariff concerns. Investors are also keenly awaiting further details on Apple's artificial intelligence strategy, which Cramer believes could involve a significant acquisition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia, through its sovereign wealth fund's AI and data center company Humain, is investing billions to become the world's third-largest AI provider, behind the U.S. and China. Humain, launched in May, plans to deliver full-stack AI capabilities across data centers, infrastructure, and advanced AI models, with ambitious targets for gigawatt capacity by 2034. The kingdom faces challenges, including intense competition from the UAE, high costs for cooling data centers in the desert, and a significant talent gap for AI engineers. Despite these hurdles, Humain has secured major partnerships with chipmaking giants like AMD and Nvidia, and has committed $23 billion to strategic tech partnerships and a $10 billion venture fund.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ryanair plans to increase the bonus for staff who intercept passengers with oversized cabin bags from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag, effective this November, as announced by CEO Michael O'Leary. This policy aims to discourage the minority of travelers who attempt to bring larger-than-allowed carry-on luggage, ensuring smoother boarding processes and fewer flight delays. Ryanair is scrapping an €80 cap on how much staff can earn each month for catching people with bags that are too large, further incentivizing adherence to bag rules. Separately, O'Leary expressed strong skepticism regarding the UK's sustainable aviation fuel mandate, deeming it unachievable due to insufficient supply and describing SAF as "nonsense."</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's stock jumped more than 8% after the company decided to scrap its controversial new logo and return to its original "Old Timer" branding. The reversal came amid significant public backlash on social media, with many users criticizing the redesign as "generic" and "soulless," and a direct call from President Donald Trump to reinstate the classic emblem. Trump later praised the company for listening to customer feedback, turning the rebranding into a cultural flashpoint. Cracker Barrel stated its commitment to its foundational values of "delicious food, warm welcomes, and country hospitality," emphasizing that the change reflected their dedication to customer satisfaction.</p>

The 2021 US Open champion showcased strong serving and consistently deep groundstrokes, which were key to her dominant performance. Despite a minor back niggle during the second set, the 22-year-old expressed great satisfaction with her play against a "super dangerous opponent."

          <p>A young couple, Greg and Maya, who recently purchased a $400,000 home with only a 5% down payment and a high 7.5% interest rate, now face a common financial dilemma after selling their old home. With $150,000 in liquid assets, they are weighing whether to aggressively pay down their $380,000 mortgage, which would save significant interest and eliminate private mortgage insurance faster, or invest the money in tax-advantaged retirement accounts for potentially higher returns. Financial experts often suggest a hybrid approach: establishing a robust emergency fund first, then splitting remaining funds between additional mortgage payments and investments to balance flexibility with debt reduction and equity growth.

          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest possible age, carries significant financial risks that can permanently impact retirement income. This decision results in a permanent reduction of monthly benefits, roughly 70% of the full amount, and also diminishes future cost-of-living adjustments. Furthermore, early claiming means missing out on delayed retirement credits, which offer an 8% annual increase for each year benefits are postponed until age 70, potentially leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost income over a 20-year retirement. It can also reduce survivor benefits for a spouse, making it crucial for higher earners to consider delaying. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's engagement to Travis Kelce has drawn attention to her estimated £500,000 to £4 million vintage-inspired diamond ring, reflecting a broader celebrity trend for oversized and uniquely cut stones. Industry experts note the 8-10 carat antique diamond's softer sparkle, characteristic of hand-cut pieces, aligns with Swift's romantic aesthetic. The article discusses how celebrities often opt for statement pieces, such as Zendaya's horizontally set diamond or Dua Lipa's round diamond on a chunky gold band, to distinguish themselves. It also touches upon the growing popularity of lab-grown diamonds, chosen for both affordability and ethical considerations, though the latter remains a complex debate.</p>

The chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, has seen explosive growth driven by its data center business and the demand for GPUs in the AI era. Key questions for the earnings call include the performance of its current-generation Blackwell chips, particularly the high-value GB200 rack computers, and the state of its business in China. Despite Trump administration export controls and China's push for homegrown chips, Nvidia is expected to project strong third-quarter sales, potentially excluding China from its guidance.

Kelce custom-designed Swift's ring, featuring an old mine brilliant cut diamond in a yellow gold bezel setting by New York goldsmith Kindred Lubeck. Their relationship famously began after Kelce's failed attempt to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number, a story Swift recounted on their "New Heights" podcast, playfully crediting the show for their romance.</p>

Beard emphasizes the significant differences between ancient Rome and modern societies, noting Rome's lack of statistics, budgets, and a clear understanding of its own geography or economy. The discussion cautions against simplistic historical analogies, stressing that while history offers lessons, modern problems require solutions tailored to their unique American context, rather than relying on flawed comparisons to Roman emperors or events.</p>

This 165-million-year-old species is the oldest known example of ankylosaurs, prompting a re-evaluation of their evolutionary timeline. Experts were particularly astonished by the spikes being fused directly onto the bone, a unique feature among all known animals. The discovery suggests that early ankylosaurs in the Jurassic period might have developed such elaborate armor primarily for display, with these structures later evolving into more functional body protection against the massive carnivorous predators that emerged in the Cretaceous period.</p>

While Apple faces a potential 7% drop in pre-tax profits if these deals are blocked, some analysts believe Google could benefit in the long run by being freed from costly payments that no longer drive demand. The Justice Department aims to foster competition, but rivals like Microsoft have struggled to challenge Google's dominance, which some economists liken to a natural monopoly.
