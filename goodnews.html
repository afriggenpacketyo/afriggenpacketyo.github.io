          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence is set to receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power by refusing to overturn the 2020 election results. Pence resisted pressure from then-President Trump to reject electoral votes cast for Joe Biden during the January 6, 2021, Congressional session. The award recognizes Pence's decision to prioritize his oath of office and the Constitution over party loyalty, despite facing criticism and threats from Trump's supporters. This article notes that since leaving office, Pence has faced some degree of ostracization within the Republican Party.</p>
