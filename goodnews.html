          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a ruling that allows Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her position while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her proceeds. The president sought to remove Cook based on allegations of misrepresentations on past mortgage agreements, but the judge found this was not a legally permissible cause for removal from her current role. This case has significant implications for the independence of the Federal Reserve, as it marks an unprecedented attempt by a president to remove a governor from the board.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Ketogenic Diet May Reduce Symptoms of Depression</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 12:26:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Ohio State University conducted a study finding that a well-formulated ketogenic diet may significantly reduce symptoms of depression. In a pilot trial involving 16 students already receiving treatment for major depressive disorder, participants experienced an average 70% decrease in depression symptoms after at least 10 weeks on the diet. The researchers suggest that achieving nutritional ketosis could serve as an adjunctive therapy for depression, possibly due to the anti-inflammatory properties of ketones and their impact on brain function, warranting a larger clinical trial.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has overturned the 60-year-old conviction of Choi Mal-ja, who was found guilty of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off part of her attacker's tongue during a sexual assault. Now 79, Choi was inspired by the #MeToo movement to seek a retrial, which has now ruled her actions constituted justifiable self-defense. The landmark decision corrects a contentious past ruling and has been celebrated by women's rights activists as a source of hope for other victims of sexual violence.</p>

          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI), a key measure of wholesale inflation, unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, defying economists' predictions of an increase. This marks the third time this year the PPI has shown deflation, with the core index also declining. The tame inflation data, particularly a drop in costs within the crucial services sector, has intensified market expectations that the Federal Reserve will implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting.

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered rocks on Mars that contain the most compelling potential signs of ancient microscopic life found to date. The samples, collected from a dry river channel, contain organic carbon alongside mineral compounds that on Earth are known byproducts of microbial activity. Scientists emphasize that while this is an exciting development, non-biological processes could also explain the findings, and conclusive proof will require analyzing the rock samples in labs on Earth.</p>

While university leaders state the merger will provide a strong financial foundation, the University and College Union has raised concerns about almost certain redundancies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has announced a new initiative to proactively inform students and their families about the "benefits and risks" of taking on federal student loans. This effort to improve financial literacy comes as outstanding federal student debt approaches $1.7 trillion, with delinquencies and defaults at record highs. However, some experts are skeptical about the program's potential impact, citing recent sweeping layoffs within the department that could hinder its ability to execute the new educational campaign effectively.</p>
