          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 12:32:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bristol Palin has provided an update on her experience with facial paralysis, stating the condition occurred suddenly without any prior warning signs or illness. In an online Q&A, she explained that she woke up one morning to find the left side of her face paralyzed. While doctors have not determined a definitive cause, they suggested it could be a case of Bell's palsy potentially triggered by stress. Palin noted that her face has regained about 70% of its normal function and that her doctor anticipates a full recovery could take another three months, though she admits she finds it difficult to look at photos of herself currently.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced criticism of the R&A's inconsistent enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open Championship. Both golfers were warned about their pace during the third round, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. DeChambeau described the pace in the first two rounds as "out of control," while Stenson expressed frustration after his group was warned for being just a few minutes over the allotted time. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player, arguing it would be fairer and more transparent for everyone involved in the tournament.</p>

          <p>This article details the efforts of Generation Life, a Christian youth organization, as its members attempt to promote chastity before marriage to young people at the Jersey shore. The activists engage in conversations about love, relationships, and the negative impacts of social media, framing chastity not as mere abstinence but as a way to foster deeper, more meaningful connections. The piece explores the challenges they face in a culture of hedonism and how they adapt their message for Gen Z, a generation that is having less sex but is also largely secular. It reflects on their mission as a "countercultural" stance against modern social norms.</p>

          <p>After being inspired by another traveler in 2019, 36-year-old Ashley Kaye quit her job, sold her home, and now lives and travels full-time in a customized Toyota Tacoma truck. She has journeyed along the Pan-American highway, spending an average of $1,305 per month on expenses like food and gas. Kaye spent over $50,000 renovating the truck to make it livable, including adding a camper and solar power. While she enjoys the freedom of setting her own pace, she notes the challenges of solo travel and the logistics of crossing borders.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise much quicker than originally expected. The injury, sustained in early July, was initially projected to sideline him for about six weeks, but he is already running, playing catch, and taking swings. Manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism, stating Muncy's return will be "a lot sooner than anticipated." Muncy himself feels he got lucky, as doctors told him a slight difference in the timing of the impact could have resulted in a season-ending surgery. His return is crucial for the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled in his absence.</p>

          <p>At the London Diamond League meeting, Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m relay team was finally presented with their world championship gold medals, 28 years after the event. The team was upgraded from silver after the U.S. team was disqualified due to Antonio Pettigrew's 2008 admission of doping during that period. The athletes—Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton—received a rousing welcome from the 60,000-strong crowd. The ceremony marked the end of a long process of investigation and reallocation, providing a long-overdue moment of recognition for the British runners.</p>

          <p>A combination of strong corporate earnings and moderating inflation data contributed to a positive week for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, despite a late-week dip caused by new tariff concerns. The June consumer price index showed core inflation slightly below expectations, though shelter costs remain elevated. Key earnings reports from companies like Goldman Sachs were strong, while others like Abbott Labs disappointed on guidance but maintained analyst support. The article suggests that early reactions to earnings can be misleading, as stocks like Wells Fargo and BlackRock recovered after initial sell-offs, indicating a complex but manageable economic environment.

          <p>Self-made millionaire and author Scott Galloway argues that "follow your passion" is the worst career advice, often given by those who are already wealthy. Instead, he advises people to find the intersection of what they are good at and what can be financially lucrative. Galloway, who came from a modest background, emphasizes that success comes from enduring rejection and pivoting based on one's actual skills and opportunities, not just blind passion. This sentiment is echoed by Mastercard's CEO, who suggests people should focus on what differentiates them and combine that with their passions to build a successful career.</p>

          <p>This article explores the resurgence of tanning, linking its comeback not just to aesthetics but to a broader ideology skeptical of mainstream health guidance. It notes the pro-sun stance of figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and wellness influencers who question the dangers of sun exposure and the benefits of sunscreen. This perspective aligns with a conspiracist mistrust of institutions like the FDA and "Big Pharma." The trend is visible in pop culture, with celebrities showcasing tans and social media trends glorifying sunburns, despite the well-documented risks of skin cancer and premature aging.</p>
