          <p>The 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is undertaking a massive restoration project to save 100,000 books from a severe beetle infestation. The drugstore beetles have burrowed into volumes, feeding on the starch-based adhesives in their bindings. To eradicate the pests, the books are being placed in an oxygen-free nitrogen environment for six weeks before being individually inspected and cleaned. Restorers believe that rising temperatures due to climate change may have contributed to the infestation by allowing the beetles more annual development cycles, posing a growing threat to historical collections.</p>

          <p>Australia is hosting its largest-ever Talisman Sabre military exercise, involving over 35,000 personnel from 19 nations, including the U.S., Japan, Germany, and the U.K. The biennial war-fighting drills, which began in 2005 as a joint U.S.-Australia exercise, have expanded significantly and are being held in Papua New Guinea for the first time. Australian officials anticipate that Chinese surveillance ships will monitor the exercise, a practice observed since 2017, but stated they will adjust their operations accordingly. The drills commenced as Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began a diplomatic visit to China, highlighting the complex regional dynamics.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Electric Vehicle Brands Gain Significant Market Share in Norway</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 01:10:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are making substantial gains in Norway, capturing approximately 10% of the market share and challenging established players like Tesla. Brands such as BYD, XPeng, and MG have grown popular due to competitive pricing and advanced technology. Norway, which has the world's highest EV adoption rate, does not impose tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, unlike the U.S. and the European Union. Analysts view Norway as a key entry point and a test market for Chinese brands looking to expand across Europe, benefiting from the country's lack of a domestic auto industry and its pro-EV regulations.</p>

          <p>An undercover investigation by BBC Panorama has uncovered questionable sales tactics at two of the UK's leading estate agencies, Connells and Purplebricks. The report reveals that Connells agents appeared to favor buyers who used in-house mortgage services, a practice that could disadvantage sellers. At Purplebricks, the investigation found evidence of properties being deliberately overvalued to secure listings, with staff later incentivized to persuade sellers to reduce prices. Both companies have responded, with Connells denying conditional selling and Purplebricks stating that price reduction incentives are no longer in place, though the findings raise serious consumer protection concerns.</p>

          <p>In a significant move amid the escalating AI talent war, Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior members of his team. The deal, valued at $2.4 billion, involves licensing fees and compensation, but is not a full acquisition, allowing Windsurf to continue operating and license its technology to others. This strategic hiring follows reports that Windsurf had been in acquisition talks with OpenAI. The move underscores the intense competition among tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft to secure top-tier AI researchers and developers to advance their own platforms.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June compared to the previous year, surpassing economists' expectations and showing resilience amid global trade tensions. This growth was supported by a temporary tariff truce with the United States, which slowed the decline in U.S.-bound shipments, and a significant surge in exports to Southeast Asian and European Union nations. Meanwhile, imports rose by 1.1%, marking the first import growth this year, although it still missed forecasts. The data reflects Chinese exporters' successful efforts to diversify markets as both Beijing and Washington work towards a durable trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>

Her insistence on a public trial and her powerful statements helped spur legal reform, leading to a new bill that includes a lack of consent in the criminal definition of sexual assault.

          <p>The Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is celebrating a major milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation, making it the longest such record in the UK and Ireland. Since July 14, 1795, observers have manually recorded data like temperature and air pressure in handwritten ledgers, a tradition that continues today alongside automated systems. This invaluable long-term data set has chronicled major weather events, including the infamous 'Night of the Big Wind' in 1839, and has contributed to meteorological science, such as the development of the cup anemometer. The unbroken sequence was notably maintained by Theresa Hardcastle, a director's widow, in 1917.</p>
