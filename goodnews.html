          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large military parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14, coinciding with the Army's 250th anniversary and President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade is expected to involve approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The Army emphasizes the event is to celebrate its 250th birthday, but the timing has raised speculation about Trump's involvement. The cost is unclear, but concerns have been raised about infrastructure damage from heavy vehicles, with city officials requiring reimbursement for any repairs.</p>

          <p>The London Marathon ballot highlights the increasing popularity of running in the UK, with over one million people entering the 2026 ballot, contrasting with just over 7,000 participants in the inaugural 1981 race. This surge mirrors a broader trend toward physical activity, as indicated by Sport England's Active Lives survey. Elite runner Phily Bowden emphasizes running's positive impact on mental health and its integration into people's routines. The growth in running clubs and social media sharing is expected to sustain this trend, solidifying running as a lasting component of British culture.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Qin Muji, a 15-year-old philosopher, argues that artificial intelligence possesses the ability to think and is therefore conscious, albeit without the capacity to feel pain due to the absence of a biological body. His essay, written for the International Philosophy Olympiad, won top place in the China trials. Benjamin believes the question of AI consciousness is crucial, given its significant implications. He is part of a generation that will be heavily impacted by AI and the ethical considerations surrounding conscious machines.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur manager Ange Postecoglou has voiced his frustration with the "negative narrative" surrounding the club, despite their success in the Europa League. Spurs defeated Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League semi-final, but are struggling in the Premier League, leading to pressure on Postecoglou and protests against chairman Daniel Levy. Postecoglou believes the club's history of near misses creates a nervous atmosphere among supporters. He is trying to instill a winning mentality in his players, emphasizing a focus on achieving victory rather than dwelling on potential setbacks.</p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, is adapting to economic uncertainty by noticing changes in customer behavior, such as increased sharing of meals and fewer leftovers. The diner, managed by Stanley Kallivrousis, has seen a decrease in foot traffic and a shift in eating habits. Rising costs and tariffs have led to paused expansion plans and difficulty retaining staff, with some workers leaving for the gig economy. Despite these challenges, Kallivrousis emphasizes the diner's role as a community gathering place and values the support of regular customers.</p>

Worldcoin also links to cryptocurrencies through the World App, a digital wallet for decentralized finance. The rollout is occurring in six U.S. cities, with expectations of looser crypto regulations under the Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>'Bonjour Tristesse' Remake Complicated by Chlo√´ Sevigny</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 17:06:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Durga Chew-Bose's remake of Fran√ßoise Sagan's "Bonjour Tristesse" mixes vintage glamour with modern details but suffers from over-intellectualization. The story follows C√©cile, who is having a golden summer with her dad and his girlfriend, until Anne's arrival disrupts their dynamic. While the film captures the essence of the original story, the dialogue feels too self-aware, undermining the recklessness and delusion of the characters. Sevigny's performance is a standout, embodying emotional vulnerability and intelligence.</p>
