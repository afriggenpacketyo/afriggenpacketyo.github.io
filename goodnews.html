          <p>Liam √ìg √ì hAnnaidh, a rapper from the Irish hip-hop group Kneecap, has been released on unconditional bail after appearing in a London court on a terror charge. The charge stems from an accusation that √ìg √ì hAnnaidh displayed a flag supporting the proscribed organization Hezbollah at a London gig. Supporters of the group gathered outside the court, displaying signs and flags in support of √ìg √ì hAnnaidh and free speech, while denouncing discriminatory phrases. √ìg √ì hAnnaidh is scheduled to appear in court for his next hearing in August, and Kneecap has denied the offense and pledged to defend themselves.</p>

          <p>The inter-Korean border has fallen silent after South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, ordered a halt to propaganda broadcasts via loudspeakers, a move reciprocated by North Korea. For a year, villagers near the border had endured unnerving noises day and night as both countries engaged in psychological warfare. Lee's decision marks a shift from his predecessor's policy of "peace through strength," aiming to alleviate military tensions and restore trust through dialogue. While some argue the broadcasts were effective in informing North Koreans, others highlight the detrimental impact on the health and well-being of South Korean villagers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's claims that undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles are a key voting bloc for Democrats have been refuted by Los Angeles County election officials.

County officials assert that safeguards are in place to ensure only eligible voters cast ballots and that all votes are accurately counted. Researchers have found that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent, and many instances of reported fraud are due to clerical or human errors.</p>

          <p>A US federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy of only recognizing two genders on passports, ordering the State Department to continue issuing passports with "X" as a gender designation. The judge ruled that the policy likely violated the constitutional rights of transgender US citizens by discriminating on the basis of sex. The ruling extends a previous injunction to include all transgender and non-binary US citizens needing passport services. The Trump administration argued that the policy did not violate equal protection guarantees, but the judge disagreed.</p>

          <p>Proposed changes to the child tax credit under Senate and House GOP spending bills are being debated. The Senate bill would permanently increase the credit to $2,200 starting in 2025, while the House bill would boost it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. Policy experts note that the changes may not benefit the lowest-earning families. The final provision is subject to change before being signed into law, and the impact on different income levels remains a key point of discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Sharks and Oysters Set to Thrive in Warmer UK Waters</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 05:15:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists predict that sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in warmer UK waters as species move habitats due to rising ocean temperatures. A study mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change, finding that many could find new homes in the North Sea. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. While new habitats may emerge, scientists emphasize the need to protect these species from other threats like fishing and pollution.</p>

          <p>Dozens of lesser-known Chinese firms from across the aviation supply chain have flocked to the Paris Air Show to showcase their products to Western buyers. The number of Chinese companies attending the show has more than doubled compared to the previous event, and they are vying for a place in the European market. Domestic profits are plateauing amid a broader economic slowdown and cutthroat rivalries between firms, making the European market an attractive opportunity.</p>
