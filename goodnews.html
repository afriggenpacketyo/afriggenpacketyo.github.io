          <p>Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker, has unveiled its first electric SUV, the YU7, setting its sights on Tesla's Model Y in the Chinese market. The YU7 boasts a claimed driving range of at least 760 kilometers on a single charge, surpassing the advertised range of Tesla's Model Y. Citi analysts predict that the YU7, expected to be priced competitively, could significantly erode Tesla's market share in China, with forecasted monthly sales of around 30,000 units and annual sales potentially reaching 300,000 to 360,000 units. The official launch, where the price will be announced, is planned for July.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to major retailers in an effort to reduce soaring rice prices. The move comes after public criticism of the government's previous ineffectiveness in preventing rice prices from rapidly increasing, and the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, aims to bring prices down to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice through these contracts, bypassing the auction system that farming cooperatives primarily used. The public seems optimistic about the new measures, as a recent poll indicated that nearly 60% of respondents believe Koizumi can successfully lower rice prices.</p>

          <p>Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the reality television show "Duck Dynasty" and founder of the Duck Commander duck-call business, has died at the age of 79. His death was confirmed by his son Jase Robertson, though a cause was not specified; Jase had previously mentioned his father's early-stage Alzheimer's and other health issues. Robertson's duck hunting gear business became the central premise for "Duck Dynasty," which ran for 11 seasons and gained a wide audience due to its humor and the family's Christian faith. The show courted controversy in 2013 when Robertson made comments deemed offensive to gay people, leading to a brief suspension.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are using a legal workaround known as the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs, which has been around since 1988 but is gaining renewed attention. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price from the overseas producer to an intermediary, rather than the inflated price from the vendor to the U.S. retailer. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving independent parties, proof that the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. While it requires trust and transparency between parties, the potential cost savings make it worthwhile, particularly for higher-value consumer goods and luxury products.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world‚Äôs first ship dedicated to salmon farming, the Su Hai No 1, in June, marking a significant step in the country's efforts to enhance its seafood supply through offshore aquaculture. The vessel, costing 600 million yuan (US$83.6 million), is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. Unlike traditional offshore net-pen systems, the Su Hai No 1 can relocate to safer waters to avoid adverse conditions, and it features an onboard processing facility for rapid delivery of fresh salmon. This initiative underscores China's focus on developing its ocean economy and ensuring food security amidst global challenges.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study published in Cell Metabolism has discovered that sleep helps the brain clear out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research elucidates how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a metabolic by-product, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. The study confirmed that when H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," prompting restorative sleep. Excess buildup of free radicals can disrupt sleep quality and spark inflammation, which offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases.</p>

Trump's decision to delay tariffs provided some relief to markets, but concerns remain about the ongoing trade tensions. However, Trump warned that a tariff ‚Äúof at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.‚Äù if it doesn‚Äôt move production of iPhones to the United States.</p>
