          <p>Senior U.S. officials detailed the intricate, months-long diplomatic efforts that culminated in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and the initial phase of President Trump's comprehensive 20-point peace plan. The process involved Hamas accepting a new proposal in August 2025, followed by extensive "wordsmithing" by U.S. envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff alongside Qatari officials to refine the agreement. A pivotal moment included Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's apology to Qatar for a September airstrike, which significantly eased tensions and fostered trust among parties. These negotiations successfully paved the way for a hostage release, prisoner exchange, and crucial aid delivery, with Israeli troops initiating withdrawal from parts of Gaza as the ceasefire began, marking a complex but hopeful de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has struck a deal with the Trump administration to offer discounted prescription drugs to Medicaid patients and list them on the upcoming "TrumpRx" website. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will provide drugs at "most-favored-nation" prices, meaning the company will charge no more than the lowest rate offered in other high-income countries. While the initiative aims to lower drug costs, experts caution that its impact on Medicaid patients may be modest due to the program's existing statutory "best price" protections. This article notes the deal's potential for uninsured patients or those with high deductibles, but questions its broader effectiveness in significantly reducing overall drug affordability across the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, has retired to a sanctuary after sustaining injuries during a dramatic runaway incident in central London. Quaker was one of five horses spooked by construction noise on 24 April last year, leading to a chaotic scene where service personnel were thrown and animals collided with vehicles, including a double-decker bus. While other horses, including Trojan and Vida, have since returned to duty, Quaker suffered bleeding and a small break, making him unable to resume military service. This article highlights Quaker's recovery at the Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire, which provides a peaceful retirement for former working horses, continuing its long tradition of care.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly in late-stage discussions to acquire key talent and technology from Prompt AI, a computer vision startup specializing in advanced home security camera capabilities. Prompt AI's flagship app, Seemour, uses AI to detect specific people, pets, and objects, providing alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answering questions about camera feeds. This article suggests the acquisition, though smaller than other tech giants' AI deals, aligns with Apple's historical strategy of quietly acquiring smaller teams to bolster its product lines, likely within its HomeKit smart home division. It highlights Apple's efforts to enhance its AI capabilities, especially in computer vision, despite critics noting its relatively slow progress in generative AI.</p>

          <p>The popular BBC show "The Traitors," including its celebrity edition, captivates audiences by exploring themes of lying, deception, and betrayal. Psychologists suggest the show's appeal lies in its reflection of everyday human behavior, where individuals constantly try to discern truth from falsehood. The article discusses how deception is inherent in human nature, evolving from childhood, and can both hold society together and be exploited for self-interest, particularly under pressure. Experts analyze contestants' strategies, noting that good liars tend to be intelligent and quiet, and that pre-existing celebrity personas add an extra layer of intrigue to the "impression management" at play, making it difficult to differentiate performance from reality.</p>

          <p>President Trump's unconventional diplomatic approach, leveraging strong ties with Israel and Arab nations, is credited with achieving a breakthrough in Israel-Hamas peace talks. Emissaries Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff mediated a 20-point plan for a ceasefire and prisoner swap, overcoming internal resistance, including from Israeli hardliners like Itamar Ben-Gvir. Trump's "bellicosity in service of peace" and his direct pressure on parties, exemplified by an apology from Netanyahu to Qatar, were pivotal. This article explores the unique dynamics of his negotiation style, which eschewed traditional diplomacy, and the "exhaustion factor" of both sides that ultimately contributed to the deal's success.</p>
