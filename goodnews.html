          <p>A federal judge in Boston temporarily halted the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, responding to a lawsuit filed by the school. The Department of Homeland Security had revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, alleging the school tolerated anti-American agitators. Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating Harvard would suffer immediate and irreparable injury without it. The ban affected over 7,000 current visa holders, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium, and the lawsuit claimed the revocation violated the First Amendment and Due Process Clause. The judge has scheduled a court hearing for Tuesday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury yields retreated from recent highs as investors grew concerned over President Trump's escalating trade war. Trump's social media posts recommending a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. sent investors flocking to the safety of bonds. This shift occurred after a week of Treasury sell-offs driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and the U.S. credit rating downgrade by Moody's. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 5 basis points to 4.505%.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued an order in Trump v. Wilcox, signaling it will not allow President Trump to fire members of the Federal Reserve, despite appearing eager to expand presidential authority over independent agencies. The order, while difficult to parse legally, reassures investors that the Fed's ability to make technocratic decisions about interest rates will not be disrupted. The case involves former members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, whom Trump fired, but the Court's Republican majority indicated they would not extend this authority to the Fed due to its 'uniquely structured, quasi-private entity' status.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett has settled a lawsuit filed by the city of Chicago by donating $50,000 to a local charity, Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts. The lawsuit sought restitution for the cost of investigating Smollett's claims of being the victim of a hate crime, which police determined was a hoax. Smollett's conviction on charges of staging the attack was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court on double jeopardy grounds. The city believes this settlement provides a fair resolution, allowing all parties to move forward, and Smollett expressed gratitude for the resources to defend himself and donated an additional $10,000 to the Chicago Torture Justice Center.</p>

Pinker highlights instances where heterodox opinions are voiced without issue and emphasizes that universities are committed to free speech, even speech that is disliked.

          <p>Wage garnishment by the IRS can be a stressful financial consequence for unpaid tax debt. Tax relief strategies like installment agreements, Offers in Compromise, and Currently Not Collectible status can help resolve the debt and halt garnishment. Immediate action is crucial, involving verifying the debt, reviewing IRS notices, and contacting the IRS or a tax relief specialist. Proving financial hardship and demonstrating a good-faith effort to pay can increase the chances of stopping or reducing the garnishment. (not investment advice)</p>
