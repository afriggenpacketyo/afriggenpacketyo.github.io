          <p>DoorDash CEO Tony Xu is aggressively pursuing acquisitions to consolidate the food delivery industry, recently acquiring Deliveroo and SevenRooms. Despite slim net profits more than four years after its IPO, DoorDash's stock has surged this year. Xu's strategy involves using cash and debt to expand DoorDash's global presence and product offerings. The company emphasizes a customer-first approach, with Xu himself actively involved in customer service and even taking advice from his daughter. DoorDash views acquisitions as opportunities to bring value to customers and empower local economies, though analysts caution about potential integration challenges.</p>

The review is expected to conclude that the UK faces a new era of threat from Russia and other countries, including China. As part of the review, the government announced it would spend ¬£1.5bn on new defence factories, creating 1,800 jobs across the UK, and support the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. The investment aims to address deficiencies in the West's ability to produce weapons and munitions, highlighted by the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A palliative care physician reflects on how facing mortality can bring clarity to how we truly wish to live. The author shares anecdotes of patients who, upon receiving a terminal diagnosis, prioritize reconciling the differences between the life they have and the one they longed for. Instead of pursuing outlandish bucket list activities, many people focus on more ordinary, meaningful goals, such as attending a family wedding or saying goodbye to loved ones. Living with an awareness of death can be terrifying, but it also offers the possibility of living freely.</p>

Despite the potential impact on its medal prospects, Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the restriction due to increasing injuries among younger children. While World Skate mandated a minimum age of 12 for other international tournaments, Japanese organizers kept recent domestic competitions open to younger participants. The International Olympic Committee started tightening age restrictions to protect child athletes after a doping scandal at the 2022 Winter Games.</p>
