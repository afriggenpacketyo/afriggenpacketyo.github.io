        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Firefighters in Ashcroft, British Columbia, have identified an unusual cause for a recent wildfire: a fish dropped by a bird. Investigators believe an osprey caught a fish from a nearby river and subsequently dropped it onto a power line, creating sparks that ignited the dry grass below. The department humorously speculated that the bird was either tired from the heat or perhaps wanted to try a cooked meal. While the fire required approximately 4,800 gallons of water to extinguish, the fire department confirmed that the fish was thoroughly cooked but the osprey was not injured in the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>McDonald's announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a 2.5% rise in U.S. same-store sales after two quarters of decline. The rebound was attributed to successful promotions like a "Minecraft" movie tie-in and the return of Snack Wraps, which helped the company outperform rivals in both sales and traffic. Despite the positive results, CEO Chris Kempczinski expressed ongoing concern about the economic health of low-income consumers, noting that their visits have declined by double digits. The company is exploring new affordability initiatives to re-engage this crucial customer base, signaling caution about near-term consumer stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of e-commerce platform Shopify surged 20% after the company reported second-quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates and provided strong guidance for the upcoming quarter. Revenue grew 31% year-over-year to $2.68 billion, and the company projects continued growth in the mid-to-high twenties for the third quarter. The company's CFO, Jeff Hoffmeister, noted that a feared negative impact from U.S. trade tariffs "did not materialize," contributing to the robust performance. The positive report suggests strong consumer spending and resilience among Shopify's merchants, who have successfully navigated macroeconomic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

A significant success was landing former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper to run for an open seat, which is seen as a top pickup opportunity. Party leaders are also reportedly urging former Senator Sherrod Brown to run in Ohio and have secured a strong candidate in New Hampshire with Rep. Chris Pappas. The strategy focuses on key battleground states like Georgia and Michigan, where Democrats aim to leverage strong candidates and favorable political dynamics to overcome the current Republican majority.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Iran and Pakistan have agreed to enhance bilateral relations, signing deals to boost trade to $10 billion and increase security cooperation. The visit by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to Pakistan comes as both nations face challenges from militant groups operating near their shared border. Despite historical cross-border tensions, the two countries maintain a largely amicable relationship, with Pakistan recently siding with Iran during its conflict with Israel. However, Pakistan's growing partnership with the United States, a key adversary of Iran, introduces a complex dynamic, though analysts believe Islamabad is unlikely to act as a military platform against Tehran.</p>

          <p>Despite recent news of cost-cutting measures, Manchester United is positioned to fund a potential £74 million transfer for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The club's ability to make such a significant signing is attributed to clever financing, including spreading payments for new players over the length of their contracts. Furthermore, the club has offloaded Marcus Rashford's large salary via a loan deal and generated income from sell-on clauses for former players. While co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has emphasized fiscal discipline, the club remains a commercial powerhouse, allowing for strategic investment in the squad. (not investment advice)</p>
