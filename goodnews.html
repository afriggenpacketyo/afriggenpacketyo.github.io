          <p>French scientists have discovered a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, naming it "Gwada negative." The discovery occurred 15 years after receiving the woman's blood sample for routine surgery tests. The French Blood Establishment (EFS) announced this as the 48th blood group system, officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. The woman, now 54 and living in Paris, inherited the mutated gene from both parents and is the only known person compatible with herself, with scientists hoping to find others with the same blood type to improve care for patients with rare blood types. The discovery of new blood groups, accelerated by DNA sequencing, enhances the level of care for patients with rare blood types. </p>

          <p>Jack Draper's bid for the Queen's title ended in a semi-final defeat against Jiri Lehecka, with Draper struggling with tonsillitis. Despite feeling unwell, Draper insisted on playing, driven by his childhood dream of reaching the final on home soil. After losing the first set, he battled back to win the second, but Lehecka secured a crucial break in the third, leading to Draper smashing his racquet in frustration. Draper, who was diagnosed with tonsillitis on Friday, will now rest before preparing for Wimbledon, which begins on June 30, as he remains determined despite his health setback.</p>

          <p>This week, the stock market experienced minimal fluctuations despite significant geopolitical events and Federal Reserve updates. The intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran caused investors to monitor safe-haven assets like gold and the dollar, as well as risk assets like oil. The Fed decided to keep interest rates unchanged, considering lackluster consumer and housing market data alongside lower-than-expected inflation. While the Fed anticipates two rate cuts in 2025, some officials suggest starting as early as July to prioritize labor market resilience, but investors are encouraged to focus on individual company fundamentals and industry trends rather than higher-level dynamics.

          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a Belarusian opposition leader, has been released from prison where he was held since 2020 after challenging President Alexander Lukashenko. Tsikhanouski, a blogger critical of the regime, was pardoned according to rights group Viasna, and his wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, expressed gratitude to the US for its efforts. His release coincided with a visit from US Special Envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, who was in Minsk for talks with Lukashenko to facilitate an end to the war in Ukraine. This event marks a significant development in Belarus's political landscape.</p>

Amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran, Japan deployed two Self-Defense Forces planes to Djibouti for potential evacuation of Japanese nationals.

Chinese coast guard ships were observed near the Senkaku Islands for a record-tying 215th day, and a joint venture was launched for a Japan-Britain-Italy fighter jet project.

          <h2>US Sunscreens Less Effective Than Those Abroad, Experts Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts say that US sunscreens are less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. The FDA's regulatory process, which classifies sunscreen as an over-the-counter drug, has slowed the approval of new UV-filtering ingredients, while countries like France, South Korea, and Japan have approved a wider range of ingredients. This regulatory gap has led to American sunscreens generally providing weaker UVA protection, and experts recommend wearing broad-spectrum sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher and considering mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide for the safest options.</p>

          <p>Eight women posed for photographer Miora Rajaonary to raise awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting an estimated 56 million women and girls, primarily in Africa. The waterborne infection, contracted through contact with infected water, can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and genital ulcers. The women wear traditional Malagasy face masks to emphasize their courage in breaking taboos and speaking about the disease, and the project, titled Sahy Rano, highlights the women's bravery in facing the challenges of the disease.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The court found that the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate students who are not Christian, and civil liberties groups hailed the ruling as a major victory. Louisiana's Attorney General plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court, as similar laws have been challenged in other states. The court's decision aligns with previous Supreme Court rulings against religious displays in public schools.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic discusses strategies for managing insults and offense, suggesting that feeling offended can make a person feel powerless. One simple method is to laugh off the insult, which allows the individual to control the severity of the offense rather than ceding that judgment to an outside arbitrator. The newsletter also includes articles on gaining strength by not taking offense, personal experiences with insults, and the challenges of changing one's personality. It touches on how to keep online trolls from affecting one's happiness.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples should take a compatibility test early in their relationship to avoid potential deal-breakers. The expert and her husband, both tenured professors, created a list of questions based on relationship science to openly communicate about critical issues. These questions, tailored to their specific needs, help determine whether they are truly compatible. The main themes to focus on include finances, family, and personal preferences, allowing couples to proactively address potential conflicts and build a stronger foundation for their relationship.</p>
