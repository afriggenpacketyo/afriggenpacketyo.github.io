          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 06:10:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant surge after the European satellite operator announced a substantial capital raise, primarily supported by the French state and other investors. The capital increase, amounting to 1.35 billion euros, aims to bolster Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. This move positions the French state as Eutelsat's largest shareholder, with nearly 30% of capital and voting rights, highlighting the company's strategic role in supporting sectors like military communications and cybersecurity, aligning with EU and NATO objectives. Eutelsat had also secured a 10-year deal with the French armed forces for priority access to its OneWeb LEO constellation. The surge reflects optimism regarding Eutelsat's potential as a European alternative to Starlink. </p>

          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully tested artillery-launched drones capable of surviving the immense forces within a 155mm cannon shell. After 12 years of technical challenges, five live-fire trials confirmed the drones could endure launch forces exceeding 3,000 times their own weight. The advance centers on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism, co-developed by the Shaanxi Applied Physics and Chemistry Research Institute, the Chinese air force, and defense contractor Norinco. These drones can reach distances exceeding 10 kilometers in seconds, multiplying flight range and extending loiter time. </p>

          <p>An independent commission is urging the California Legislature to establish a new local authority to oversee and coordinate rebuilding efforts after the destructive fires in Los Angeles County. The proposed Resilient Rebuilding Authority would streamline recovery efforts, prioritize the return of residents and businesses, and use tax-increment financing to guide the rebuilding process. The commission also proposes a ballot measure to create a new Los Angeles County Fire Control District to focus on wildfire prevention and vegetation management. These recommendations aim to prepare neighborhoods to better withstand future wildfires and address global warming by encouraging all-electric home construction. </p>

          <p>Amy Bloom‚Äôs novel ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Be Right Here‚Äù spans nearly a century, exploring the concept of family through a non-traditional lens. The novel opens with a tableau of siblings tending to their dying friend, setting the stage for a story that compresses time and shifts perspectives. Through a series of events, characters form a bespoke family that supports each other through life's challenges. Bloom's prose is finely wrought, and she returns to love as her primary subject, finding new depth and dimension, requiring readers to put aside their expectations and go where the pages take them. </p>

          <p>The musical 'Parade,' based on the true story of Leo Frank, who was wrongly convicted of murder in 1913, has been revived at the Ahmanson Theatre. The production, directed by Michael Arden, is both intimate and epic, seamlessly integrating historical background with the human figures caught in the snares of American bigotry. While the musical deals with serious themes such as antisemitism and systemic bias, it also tells the story of a marriage that grows in depth as external reality becomes more treacherous. The revival is timely due to its exploration of themes that resonate with contemporary issues. </p>
