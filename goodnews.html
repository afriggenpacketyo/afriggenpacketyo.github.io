          <p>A study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting reveals that music therapy is as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy in managing symptoms and anxieties associated with cancer. The therapy combines talk, music, and lyrical composition to help patients process their emotions. With millions of cancer survivors, there is a growing need for varied therapies to improve their quality of life. Music therapy, involving therapeutic collaboration and active creation, provides patients with another way to express and process their emotions, aiding in healing and stress regulation.</p>

          <p>A new drug, Vykat XR, has been approved for Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder causing insatiable hunger, offering hope to patients and insights into extreme appetite and binge eating. While the drug is a breakthrough, its high cost raises concerns about accessibility, and its discovery comes as federal funding for health research, including obesity studies, faces cuts under the Trump administration. Researchers fear that these cuts could disrupt progress in understanding and treating obesity's many causes and pathways, even with biotech partnerships in place.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amid increasing tensions with Beijing. The two leading Chinese chip firms are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to them. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and aims to tighten potential loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches. This decision highlights Taiwan's commitment to restricting the flow of advanced technology to Chinese companies involved in activities that raise national security concerns.</p>
