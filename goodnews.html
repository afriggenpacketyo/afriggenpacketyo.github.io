          <p>This article explores the historical advantage of left-handed tennis players, noting their past dominance at the US Open and their ability to confound right-handed opponents with unique ball trajectories and spins. After a long period of right-handed champions, a "lefty renaissance" appears underway with rising stars like Ben Shelton and Jack Draper showing strong form. Their powerful serves and all-around play could challenge the sport's current top players and potentially lead to a left-handed Grand Slam winner soon.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans' public education system has transformed into an almost entirely charter-based model, with significant improvements in test scores and graduation rates. Initially met with resistance, the shift granted schools like Mary McLeod Bethune Elementary greater autonomy, leading to better resource allocation. While data shows academic gains and increased parental satisfaction, challenges remain, including socioeconomic disparities in school access and the painful process of closing underperforming schools. The system continues to evolve, with discussions now exploring direct district-run schools alongside charters.</p>

          <h2>Weighted Vests: Fact-Checking Fitness Claims for Bones and Muscles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article fact-checks the popular fitness trend of weighted vests, which social media influencers claim offer benefits for posture, weight loss, and bone/muscle growth. While experts acknowledge potential cardiovascular benefits and increased calorie burn, research does not strongly support claims of improved bone density or significant muscle strength. Weight-bearing exercises like resistance training are cited as more effective for strength building. Ultimately, if a weighted vest motivates physical activity, it can be beneficial, but it should not replace proven strength-building methods.</p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka is expected to miss up to four weeks due to a hamstring injury sustained in a recent match, sidelining him from a crucial game against Liverpool and England's World Cup qualifiers. Captain Martin Odegaard is also doubtful for the Anfield match with a shoulder injury, though there's optimism neither will face long-term issues. Despite these setbacks, Arsenal has a deeper attacking squad this season, with new signings available to mitigate the absences of key players.</p>

          <p>Singapore's July inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, the lowest since January 2021, driven by falling retail, electricity, and gas prices. Core inflation also dipped, leading economists to suggest the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) may further loosen monetary policy in October. The central bank anticipates "moderate" inflation and slower economic growth in the near term due to easing global crude oil prices and trade tensions. This data supports a cautious approach, allowing MAS to preserve ammunition for future economic shocks. (not investment advice)</p>
