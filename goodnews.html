          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal app during a Cabinet meeting, a day before President Trump announced his replacement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The photo revealed Waltz was communicating with high-profile figures like Vice President JD Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. This incident follows previous scrutiny over Waltz's use of Signal, including inadvertently inviting a journalist to a group chat discussing sensitive military plans. Despite the administration's stance that Signal is an approved app, investigations into its use for official business and records retention are ongoing.</p>

          <p>Japan's average unemployment rate in fiscal year 2024 decreased to 2.5%, marking the first improvement in two years due to a persistent labor shortage. The number of employed individuals reached its highest level since 1953, while the number of unemployed people decreased. Despite a slight dip in job availability data, economists believe the labor market remains tight, with more jobs available than job seekers. The information and communication sector saw an increase in new jobs, while the retail and wholesale sector experienced a decline.</p>

          <p>President Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and nominated him to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace Waltz, while continuing in his role as top diplomat. Waltz faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed, which is expected to be a topic during his confirmation hearings. Sources suggest that Trump decided to nominate Waltz as UN ambassador just hours before the announcement, potentially due to the Signal situation and concerns about vetting National Security Council staff.</p>

          <p>Fires that have been raging in central Israel since Wednesday are largely under control, according to the country's Fire and Rescue Authority.

Several countries dispatched aircraft to assist in the emergency, and a major highway linking Jerusalem and Tel Aviv has reopened. While authorities provided conflicting accounts for the cause of the fire, the fires led to the cancellation of most official events celebrating Israel's Independence Day.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of couples are choosing a life without children, influenced by factors such as high costs, climate change fears, and career priorities. The U.S. fertility rate has plummeted in recent decades, with many young adults saying they simply don't want kids. Amy Blackstone, a sociology professor, notes that child-free individuals often value their relationship with their partner and do not want a child to change that dynamic. While some are confident in their decision, others wonder about the future and the absence of a large family during holidays.</p>
