          <h2>Economic Shifts May Explain the Growing Political Divide Between Men and Women</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 06:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economist argues that the increasing political divergence between young men and women is rooted in economic shifts over the past half-century. The decline of manufacturing, traditionally a male-dominated sector, has left men with fewer job opportunities and lower social trust, leading to more regressive gender norms. While women have found empowerment through feminist messages and new roles in the cognitive economy, men have struggled to adapt, creating a crisis of masculinity. The article suggests that redefining men's roles in caretaking and producing could help bridge this divide, emphasizing that most young men are not inherently misogynistic and are open to more inclusive roles. This economic perspective offers a nuanced understanding beyond culture war narratives.</p>

          <p>Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina, has voiced his support for Ukraine and echoed President Trump's sentiment that Vladimir Putin is "crazy." Wilson advocated for secondary sanctions and increased arms support for Ukraine, emphasizing that the civilized world will not stand by as Putin continues his invasion. This statement comes amid bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate for proposed sanctions against Russia, with Wilson co-sponsoring the House version. The article also notes Zelenskyy's call for stronger sanctions to compel Russia to cease fire and respect international norms, highlighting a unified front against Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Ten people sustained minor injuries following explosions at a construction site in eastern Tokyo, with dozens of buildings damaged. The explosions, possibly caused by a gas leak, occurred in Edogawa Ward, where a fragment of a gas cylinder was recovered. Police suspect workers may have struck the cylinder with a drill during piling work for a new apartment building, leading to the gas ignition. The incident prompted an emergency call, reporting the sound of explosions, and resulted in a service vehicle catching fire, while nearby residents and workers inhaled smoke and sustained other minor injuries. The article details the immediate aftermath and ongoing investigation into the cause.</p>

          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. have risen significantly, while shipments from China have fallen, as Apple accelerates its "made in India" plans to adapt to tariffs. Despite this growth, analysts expect it to slow down, as India's manufacturing capacity is not expected to grow fast enough to meet total U.S. demand. Analysts also suggest that protectionist measures from Washington and Beijing could curb India's ability to expand its iPhone capacity. The article notes that shipment numbers reflect final assembly but are not representative of the entire supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book, "Four Mothers," compares the experiences of mothers in Japan, Kenya, Finland, and the US, revealing how policy shapes parents' lives. The US is the only rich country without national paid leave, and childbirth costs are significantly higher than in other nations. The author, Abigail Leonard, argues that being 'pronatal' is not the same as being pro-woman, emphasizing that extensive external support like affordable maternity care and childcare are crucial. Leonard points out that resistance to government aid in childrearing in the US is linked to upholding a traditional view of the American family, with corporations having a vested interest in keeping childcare privatized.</p>

          <p>King Charles II is addressing Canada's Parliament, a rare gesture amid tensions with President Trump, who has mused about annexing Canada. The visit is seen as a form of pushback against Trump's comments, with some viewing it as an indication that the king takes Canada's sovereignty seriously. The speech will outline the new government's agenda, and while unlikely to mention Trump overtly, it could reference Canada's sovereignty and the U.S.-Canada trade relationship.

          <p>Japan views President Trump's tariffs as a 'national crisis' due to the threat they pose to its flagging economy, as the U.S. is Japan's most important export market. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces pressure for his handling of tariff negotiations, reflecting Japan's electoral cycle and the LDP's flagging poll numbers. Japan's limited room for maneuver in negotiations with the U.S., coupled with its strategic priority of preserving its security relationship with Washington, further complicates the situation. Despite the constraints, Japan has options, including increasing imports of U.S. agricultural goods and LNG, and leveraging its membership in mega trade blocs like CPTPP and RCEP.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in the United States, was likely carved rapidly 2.1 million years ago. This occurred when a shifting landscape in Idaho caused a giant lake to overflow, according to ancient river sediments found inside the canyon's caves. Geologists dated the canyon using these cave sediments, finding it younger than the Grand Canyon. The researchers believe the canyon emerged when a huge lake in Idaho drained away, leading to a 'fill and spill' episode that carved out Hells Canyon.</p>

He argues that an experienced administrator, appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature, would improve coordination and accountability in California's education system.

Symbols of Chicano identity, such as oversized streetwear, elaborate tattoos, and lowrider cars, have permeated mainstream culture, and this subculture is a way of defying traditional societal norms.

          <h2>Ministers Consider Scrapping Two-Child Benefit Cap</h2>

          <p>The government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, which prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that the policy has pushed people into poverty but warned that removing it would be costly. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, when it publishes its child poverty strategy. Phillipson stated that a Labour government would never have introduced the cap, emphasizing that their priorities are different.</p>
