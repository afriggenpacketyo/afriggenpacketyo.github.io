          <p>Ticket resale marketplace StubHub is preparing for its long-awaited initial public offering, aiming to raise up to $851 million. The company plans to sell over 34 million shares priced between $22 and $25 each, which would give it a total valuation as high as $9.2 billion. This move comes after previous IPO plans were paused due to market volatility, but a recent rebound in the IPO market has renewed the company's efforts. StubHub, which was reacquired by its co-founder in 2020, will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "STUB." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The organizers of the Great North Run have issued an apology after the finisher medals and T-shirts for the 2025 event mistakenly featured a map of the rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. The half marathon, which runs through Newcastle and along the River Tyne, was completed by approximately 60,000 participants. In a lighthearted response, the Great Run Company called the error a unique keepsake, joking "Wear [sic] sorry!" The event's founder, Sir Brendan Foster, admitted he also failed to spot the geographical mistake despite his deep local roots.</p>

          <p>Radio host Howard Stern has confirmed he is in ongoing discussions with SiriusXM regarding a new contract, dispelling rumors of his departure that were fueled by an on-air stunt. On Monday's show, listeners were initially greeted by fellow host Andy Cohen, who jokingly claimed to be taking over the time slot before Stern revealed it was a hoax. The 71-year-old shock jock, whose current five-year, $500 million deal expires at the end of the year, assured his audience that talks with the satellite radio company are proceeding as normal.</p>

Investors are also looking ahead to key U.S. inflation reports later in the week, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. The positive market sentiment was supported by weaker-than-expected U.S. hiring data, which increased hopes for a rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

Other relief measures include the Unemployment Deferment and Economic Hardship Deferment, which can temporarily pause payments. The article stresses the importance of proactively contacting lenders, as those with private loans may have fewer options but could still find assistance available upon request.</p>
