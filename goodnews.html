          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is defending the House budget bill, calling it the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years," despite a Congressional Budget Office analysis suggesting it could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Johnson claims the bill will stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing business expansion and U.S. manufacturing. Republican senators have expressed concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit and are planning to propose changes. Johnson disputes the CBO analysis, deeming their deficit forecasts "dramatically overstated." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, experts are questioning the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines that recommend against routine screening for men over 70. While the USPSTF advises men aged 55 to 69 to discuss the potential benefits and risks of PSA screening with their doctor, Dr. Marc Siegel argues that all men over 45 should be screened, regardless of age. Dr. Shawn Dason notes the importance of individual discussions with healthcare providers about the risks of over-treatment versus the potential benefits of early detection. The discussion is centered on the importance of patients making informed decisions about their health.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are advocating for a shift towards directly protecting ecosystems, rather than solely focusing on individual species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This approach aims to protect larger structural features and dynamic systems, especially as climate change prompts species to move. While the ESA has been effective, its focus on saving the most imperiled species is costly and reactive. A native ecosystem-protection act could ensure sufficient area is protected for each type of American ecosystem, fostering a more proactive and comprehensive approach to conservation.</p>

          <p>An expert outlines a new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting," which emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, and fostering trust through open communication. Unlike authoritative or gentle parenting, this approach focuses on emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing for parents. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without judgment, view challenging behavior as a signal for support, and take responsibility after conflicts. The goal is to create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves and big emotions.</p>
