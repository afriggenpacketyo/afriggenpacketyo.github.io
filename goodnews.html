          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to mark the signing of a Gaza peace plan. The summit, led by the US and Egypt, follows a ceasefire agreement brokered by former President Trump between Israel and Hamas. Downing Street stated Starmer will pay tribute to the diplomatic efforts of the US, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey in reaching this point. However, UK officials' claims of having played a "key role" have been disputed by both US and Israeli representatives.</p>

          <p>Brighton defender Maelys Mpome is reported to be "up and about" after a frightening incident during a Women's Super League match against Arsenal. Mpome was knocked unconscious and suffered a concussion after being struck in the face by the ball, leading to a 10-minute stoppage in play. Medics attended to her on the field before she was carried off on a stretcher as a precaution, receiving oxygen with her head in a brace. Brighton's manager later provided a positive update, confirming she was recovering with her teammates in the changing room after the game.</p>

          <p>The first phase of a comprehensive peace plan for Gaza involves a reciprocal exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, which is set to begin Monday. This initial step follows a ceasefire that took effect on Friday and has allowed increased humanitarian aid into the territory. The plan, brokered by the US, also outlines a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops and the deployment of a multinational monitoring force. Future phases, which include the demilitarization of Gaza and establishing a new governing body, present significant challenges that require further negotiation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the New York Jets 13-11 in London, largely thanks to a formidable defensive performance. The Broncos' defense sacked Jets quarterback Justin Fields nine times and held New York's offense to a mere 82 total yards for the entire game. Offensively, a first-quarter touchdown pass from Bo Nix to Nate Adkins was the decisive score for Denver. The victory improves the Broncos' season record to 4-2, while the struggling Jets remain winless at 0-6 after another anemic offensive showing.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has stated that Germany is prepared to provide immediate humanitarian aid and co-host a conference with Egypt on the reconstruction of Gaza. The initiative aims to establish a broader political framework for the region, with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution. While German coalition politicians support the plan, citing humanitarian and security reasons, Israel has criticized a related conference in Paris for its exclusion of Israeli officials. The effort underscores Europe's attempt to engage in the region's future, even as the US-led peace plan outlines a more limited initial role.</p>
