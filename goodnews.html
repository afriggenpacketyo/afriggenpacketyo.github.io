          <p>This article details the uncontrolled re-entry of Kosmos 482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972.  Experts predict the spacecraft will re-enter Earth's atmosphere, but the exact location is uncertain, though the risk to humans is considered low due to most of the Earth being covered by water.  The article also discusses the growing concern of space debris impacting aircraft. While the chance of hitting anything is small, the potential for damage if it remains intact is substantial.</p>
