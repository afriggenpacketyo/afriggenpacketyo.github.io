          <h2>Poll Finds Broad American Support for Returning to the Moon and Traveling to Mars</h2>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, are in favor of the U.S. space program returning to the moon and eventually undertaking a mission to Mars. This support is particularly strong among younger Americans and cuts across partisan lines. The survey also found that most people view the 1969 moon landing as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride and technological advancement. The poll reflects a sustained positive public sentiment towards space exploration.</p>

          <p>A complex prisoner exchange has resulted in the release of ten Americans held in Venezuela. The deal involved the U.S., Venezuela, and El Salvador, which repatriated 252 Venezuelan nationals who had been detained in a high-security Salvadoran prison. Among the freed Americans is former Navy SEAL Wilbert Joseph Castaneda. The swap highlights a warming relationship between the U.S. and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, whose cooperation was described by U.S. officials as critical to securing the release of the American citizens.</p>

          <p>The new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has publicly stated his opposition to privatizing the U.S. Postal Service, aiming to quell concerns raised due to his previous role at shipping competitor FedEx. In a video message to employees, Steiner affirmed his belief in the USPS's current structure as a self-financing, independent entity within the executive branch. While he plans to assess and modify the existing "Delivering for America" plan, his statement was met with cautious optimism from postal worker unions, who will be watching his actions closely.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's nearly $50 million lawsuit against journalist Bob Woodward and publisher Simon & Schuster. The lawsuit concerned the release of interview recordings as an audiobook, titled "The Trump Tapes." The judge's ruling sided with the defendants, who argued that a president cannot copyright interviews conducted as part of official duties and that the publication constituted fair use. Trump had claimed the interviews were intended only for Woodward's book "Rage" and not for a separate audiobook release.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, marking the first major piece of U.S. legislation to govern digital currency. The bill, which received bipartisan support, establishes a regulatory framework and consumer protections for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. At the signing ceremony, Trump hailed the act as a key step in a "revolution in financial technology," suggesting it strengthens the dollar and upgrades the financial system. The law allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own regulated stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix's recent strong quarterly performance, which showed significant revenue growth and raised future guidance, is being viewed as a positive indicator for Disney. The results demonstrate continued consumer willingness to pay for streaming content, even at higher prices, and the success of ad-supported tiers. This suggests that Disney's strategy of raising prices for Disney+ and its bundles while growing its own advertising revenue is on a solid footing. Analysts believe this bodes well for Disney's upcoming earnings report, particularly regarding its direct-to-consumer profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation following a favorable ruling from the International Chamber of Commerce. The ruling resolved a dispute with Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's significant oil assets in the Stabroek Block offshore of Guyana. The decision is a major victory for Chevron, securing its access to the highly valuable Guyana oil reserves and removing uncertainty that had weighed on its stock. Exxon stated that while it disagrees with the interpretation, it respects the arbitration process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking a new Washington state law that would have required Catholic priests to report child abuse or neglect disclosed during confession. The judge ruled that the law infringes upon the First Amendment right to religious freedom, forcing priests to choose between their sacred vows and state punishment. The law, which adds clergy to the list of mandatory reporters, can still be enforced for information learned outside of the confessional. The state's Attorney General's office noted the limited scope of the injunction.</p>

          <p>This feature article explores the history of queerness, highlighting its varied acceptance and persecution across different societies and time periods. It notes that while figures like Leonardo da Vinci faced scrutiny, same-sex relationships were common in antiquity and among Japanese samurai. The article contrasts this with the severe punishments enacted under the influence of Christian doctrine, which framed non-binary identities and same-sex love as sinful. It also touches on the existence of third-gender identities in various cultures, arguing for a more diverse historical understanding beyond a binary model.</p>

          <p>American Express announced that its typically affluent customers are continuing to spend, with total card transactions rising 7% in the second quarter. However, the company noted a specific weak spot in spending on domestic economy class airfare, which has remained flat compared to last year. In contrast, spending on premium cabin flights and luxury hotels saw healthy increases. Despite beating profit and revenue expectations, the company's stock fell slightly amid investor concerns over the costs of its rewards programs and competition in the premium card market.
