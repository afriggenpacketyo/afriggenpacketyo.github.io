          <p>A coordinated law enforcement effort in Texas, named "Operation Lightning Bug," has successfully rescued more than 30 missing children and dismantled several trafficking operations. The mission, involving U.S. Marshals and San Antonio police, also led to multiple arrests and the launch of new sex trafficking investigations. Experts warn that traffickers increasingly exploit vulnerable youth, often using technology to recruit and control victims, highlighting a growing crisis that extends beyond border regions.</p>

The 60th annual event, held in Northamptonshire, attracted heightened interest this year following a cheating scandal in the previous competition. Organizers overcame concerns about a shortage of quality conkers due to a dry summer, receiving donations from across Europe, including from the royal estate at Windsor Castle.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos secured a narrow 13-11 victory over the New York Jets in an offense-starved NFL game played in London, extending the Jets' winless streak to six games. The Jets' offense was particularly ineffective, managing a historically low total of minus-10 net passing yards and just 82 total yards. A late 27-yard field goal by Wil Lutz put the Broncos ahead, and their defense sealed the win by sacking Jets quarterback Justin Fields nine times throughout the contest.</p>

Australia successfully chased down a formidable target of 331, the highest successful run-chase ever recorded in a women's one-day international match. Despite a strong start from India, fueled by Smriti Mandhana's 80, Healy's masterful innings anchored the Australian response, securing the win with just six balls remaining.</p>

          <p>The first phase of the Gaza peace plan involves a complex exchange, with Hamas set to release all remaining living and deceased Israeli hostages in return for Israel freeing approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. This initial phase, which began with a ceasefire and increased aid, will be monitored by a multinational force. Subsequent phases outlined in the plan involve the demilitarization of Gaza, governance by a transitional committee, and eventual Israeli troop withdrawal, though significant sticking points remain regarding Hamas's future role and disarmament.</p>
