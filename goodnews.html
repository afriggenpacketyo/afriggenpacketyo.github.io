          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans in 2025 will allow older workers to make larger catch-up contributions, potentially boosting their retirement savings. Secure 2.0 increases the catch-up limit to $11,250 for those aged 60 to 63, bringing their maximum deferral to $34,750; however, this feature is not yet available in all plans. While this offers a tax deduction and can be a valuable tool, only a small percentage of eligible employees have historically taken advantage of catch-up contributions, indicating affordability remains a barrier for many.
