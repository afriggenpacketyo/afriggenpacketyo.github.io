          <p>Following reports of Chinese students facing unwarranted scrutiny at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, President Trump announced that the US will allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country. This would more than double the current number and signals a shift in US-China relations.  Trump stated his administration aims for improved relations with China, echoing Xi's invitation for a visit. The Chinese embassy's concerns about student harassment in Houston prompted this significant policy change.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge ruled the state's congressional map unlawfully gerrymandered in favor of Republicans, ordering the legislature to redraw it.  The judge found that the legislature had illegally weakened an independent commission designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering.  The legislature plans to appeal, potentially leading to further legal battles in the Utah and possibly US Supreme Courts. The ruling comes amid national debate surrounding gerrymandering and its impact on elections.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in a Brooklyn courtroom.  He admitted to his role in flooding the US with drugs and fueling violence in Mexico, expressing remorse for the harm caused.  The plea is considered a significant victory in the US government's anti-cartel efforts, with Attorney General Pam Bondi stating Zambada will spend the rest of his life in prison. Zambada's cooperation with investigators is not mandated by the plea agreement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding after a multi-state lawsuit.  The funds, initially withheld, support various educational programs, including after-school and summer learning, teacher training, and English-learner support.  The lawsuit challenged the legality of the administration's actions, citing the US Constitution and the Impoundment Control Act. The restoration of funding comes amidst ongoing controversies surrounding the Trump administration's approach to education policy.</p>
