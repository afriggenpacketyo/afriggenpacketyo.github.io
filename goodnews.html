          <p>Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney and genetic genealogist, has become instrumental in solving cold cases, including identifying the notorious Golden State Killer. Her innovative technique, investigative genetic genealogy, involves building extensive family trees using DNA samples to pinpoint relatives of unknown suspects. The article details her pivotal role in the Golden State Killer case, responsible for numerous murders and sexual assaults, and her subsequent success in identifying "John Doe #147," a sexual predator from a 1997 case. Rae-Venter's groundbreaking efforts have led to approximately 60 solved cases, revolutionizing forensic investigations while also prompting discussions about privacy implications concerning public DNA databases used by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination attempt on former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has significantly bolstered its security protocols and technology. CBS News was given a tour of their training center, showcasing new military-grade drones designed for aerial reconnaissance and improved detection and mitigation of unauthorized unmanned aircraft systems. Additionally, the agency has established a system of mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, to enable direct radio communication between Secret Service agents and local law enforcement, addressing a critical failure from the Butler incident. These substantial changes aim to prevent future security breaches and enhance overall protective capabilities, reflecting lessons learned from the tragic event.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Make Electric Cars More Affordable for Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:20:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will implement measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers. While she would not confirm specific taxpayer-funded grants, she hinted at forthcoming announcements later this week. The plan includes a £25 million package for "cross-pavement gullies" to aid charging for homes without driveways, alongside £63 million for broader charging infrastructure. This initiative aims to boost EV sales, which currently lag behind mandated targets despite a ban on new petrol and diesel cars approaching in 2030. The government seeks to address both the high upfront costs and "range anxiety" as primary barriers to widespread EV adoption across the country.</p>

          <p>Financial planners increasingly emphasize passive income streams, such as rental properties, dividends, or royalties, as a crucial component for a comfortable retirement. These diverse streams provide predictable cash flow, effectively supplementing traditional savings and Social Security, thereby reducing reliance on investment withdrawals during potentially volatile market downturns. Passive income also acts as a vital replacement for a regular paycheck from full-time work, fostering significant financial stability and peace of mind for retirees. Experts note that these reliable income sources can often grow with inflation, adding a critical layer of resilience to retirement portfolios and helping retirees preserve their principal investments over the long term.

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, a 72-year-old French woman, has been awarded France's highest honor, the Legion of Honour, for her exceptional courage in publicly testifying at her mass sexual assault trial last year. Pelicot waived her right to anonymity during the high-profile case against her husband, who drugged her and invited dozens of strangers to sexually assault her while she was comatose over nearly a decade. Her bravery, which French President Emmanuel Macron praised as having "moved and inspired France and the world," aimed to shift the "shame" from victims to perpetrators. Her husband received a maximum 20-year jail sentence for aggravated sexual assault, and Pelicot's memoir detailing her story is set for release next year.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies five crucial weekday habits that contribute significantly to happier relationships, often neglected by busy individuals. These include building a "mini morning routine" for shared moments, sending thoughtful check-ins during the day to foster emotional intimacy, and prioritizing individual "me time" to de-stress and clear mental clutter before reconnecting. Additionally, happy couples intentionally carve out daily "us time" free from distractions, whether it's dinner or a quick game, and conclude the day with a quiet check-in to prevent unresolved issues from accumulating. These small, intentional actions help maintain connection and intimacy amidst hectic schedules, ensuring emotional alignment and mutual support.</p>

          <p>A high-resolution sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River, initially aimed at mapping known cultural sites, led to the accidental discovery of a previously unrecorded shipwreck. Researchers from the Wisconsin Historical Society and Underwater Archaeology Association found the partially buried hull, approximately 90 feet long, amidst significant river debris. This newly identified wreck is believed to be that of the L.W. Crane, a wooden paddle wheel steamer built in 1865, which caught fire and sank in Oshkosh in 1880. The discovery highlights the excitement and unexpected nature of archaeological finds, with ongoing investigations continuing to uncover more information about this and other historical wrecks in the debris-filled river section.</p>

Historically, women's pain in medicine has often been minimized, but widespread social media discussions have brought this issue to the forefront. Recent recommendations from the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now urge doctors to openly discuss comprehensive pain management options with patients beforehand, including pre-procedure ibuprofen, topical creams, or anesthetic shots during the insertion itself. This important shift aims to make the process more palatable and empower patients to actively advocate for their comfort during this common procedure.</p>
