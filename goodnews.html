          <p>Following the demolition of the White House's East Wing for a new ballroom, a reporter embarked on a quest to locate the historic rubble. The investigation led to East Potomac Golf Links, where trucks were depositing White House dirt, potentially to create a new golf hole. Despite confirmations from some workers, official sources remained tight-lipped about the final destination of the debris. The journalist's search for more substantial remnants like concrete and wood at an industrial park in Maryland proved fruitless, highlighting the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the historic structure's remains.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is poised to become the next president of Ireland following the concession of her opponent, Heather Humphreys of Fine Gael. Although vote counting is still in progress, polls consistently showed strong support for Connolly for the largely ceremonial role. Connolly, an independent lawmaker known for her criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza, secured backing from several left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two seven-year terms, becoming the nation's tenth president and the third woman to hold the office.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has emphasized President Xi Jinping's personal and decisive role in crafting the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan. According to reports from Xinhua and People's Daily, Xi personally led the drafting team, pouring significant effort into the document that will guide China's economic and social development. The plan was reportedly based on extensive investigations conducted during Xi's national tours throughout the year. This high-profile involvement underscores Xi's centralized authority and personal stamp on the nation's long-term strategic direction, which was deliberated at the party's recent fourth plenum.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated that her political career is "not done" and suggested she is considering another run for the presidency in 2028. While she has not made a final decision, Harris dismissed unfavorable poll numbers, stating that she has defied polls throughout her career. During the interview, she criticized former President Donald Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" who has weaponized the justice system and to whom many business leaders have capitulated. The interview is part of an international tour for her book "107 Days," which recounts her 2024 presidential campaign.</p>

The Amazon founder had originally purchased the property overlooking Lake Washington in 2019 for $37.5 million, realizing a significant profit from the sale. This transaction comes as Bezos's ownership stake in Amazon has fallen below 10% for the first time, following the sale of over 100 million shares in the past year. The sale also occurs amidst an ongoing legal dispute where Bezos is seeking legal fees from his wife's brother over a defamation lawsuit.</p>

While the result was not a landslide, it places Powell back in a senior, directly elected role within the party. Powell has indicated that she intends to articulate her critiques of the party's direction privately, aiming to help rescue its political fortunes.</p>

This distance allows them to develop self-starting behaviors, which are crucial for becoming successful adults. Wambach also suggests that when parents do attend games, they should de-emphasize winning and instead focus on praising acts of leadership and good sportsmanship, asking their children about positive team interactions rather than the final score.</p>
