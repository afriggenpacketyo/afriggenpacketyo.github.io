        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A professional women's golf tournament in northern Japan was forced to cancel its opening day after a bear was spotted near the course. This marks the second time in two months that a JLPGA Tour event has been disrupted by a bear, highlighting a growing issue of human-bear encounters in the country. Last year, Japan saw a record number of bear attacks on humans, a trend attributed to factors like climate change impacting food sources and shrinking rural populations allowing bears to expand their habitat. In response, the Japanese government has approved measures allowing hunters to shoot bears in populated areas.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong international performance. However, the company continues to face challenges in its home market, with sales volume declining again for its food and beverage divisions in North America. Despite the domestic softness, CEO Ramon Laguarta stated that the U.S. business is showing signs of improvement as the company focuses on new strategies, such as promoting protein-based products and multicultural brands. PepsiCo reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook, expecting organic revenue to grow by a low-single-digit percentage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 61% year-on-year increase in its second-quarter profit, significantly beating market estimates. This surge is fueled by sustained, strong demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division, which includes AI applications, accounted for 60% of its revenue. Despite this success, TSMC faces potential headwinds from President Trump's trade policies, including threatened tariffs on semiconductors, which could impact future performance.

          <p>Researchers are studying the unique defense mechanism of the squirting cucumber, a toxic relative of the common cucumber that explosively ejects its seeds when disturbed. A recent study detailed how the fruit builds up internal fluid pressure, and upon the slightest touch, bursts open to launch its seeds at speeds up to 30 miles per hour and distances of nearly 40 feet. Scientists used micro-CT scans and high-speed video to analyze the process, noting the fruit orients itself at a perfect ballistic angle for maximum distance. The seeds are also coated in an incredibly strong adhesive, suggesting applications in material science.</p>

          <h2>California Urged to Counter Trump's Federal EV Policy Changes with State-Level Action</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that California must step up to support the electric vehicle (EV) industry following the Trump administration's decision to end most federal support for EV manufacturing. The author claims this federal shift hobbles the U.S. auto industry's ability to compete with China, which dominates the global EV market. To fill the void, the article proposes that California should implement its own consumer credits, fund the installation of chargers in multifamily housing, and streamline the permitting process for new fast-charging stations. These actions are presented as crucial for maintaining American competitiveness and supporting thousands of jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering a bill that would require public schools and colleges to print the contact information for an LGBTQ-specific crisis hotline on student ID cards. The bill, AB 727, is championed by the mother of a trans teen who died by suicide and aims to provide a vital resource for queer youth. This legislative push comes as the federal government has cut funding for LGBTQ+ counselors through the national 9-8-8 crisis lifeline. Supporters, including Governor Gavin Newsom, argue the state must create a safety net to ensure young queer Californians have access to relatable and life-saving mental health support.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ari Aster's new film "Eddington" is reviewed as a superb and bitterly funny modern western that satirizes contemporary American society. Set in a small New Mexico town during the early COVID-19 pandemic, the movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as a troubled sheriff and Pedro Pascal as the town's mayor, embodying the deep political and social divisions of the era. The review praises the film's sharp script, which captures the paranoia, misinformation, and social media-fueled brain sickness that defined the period. While described as bleak and at times overwhelming, "Eddington" is ultimately seen as a hysterical, self-aware critique of our times.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is currently engaged in a three-way ideological struggle to define its future direction following the Biden era. The party establishment is attempting to rebrand with a new policy agenda, known as Project 2029. This establishment is being challenged from two sides: the "Abundance" faction, which prioritizes pragmatic, pro-growth policies like housing and clean energy development, and the reinvigorated left, championed by figures like Zohran Mamdani, who advocate for sweeping social programs. This debate over policy, electoral strategy, and influence will likely shape the party's platform leading into the 2028 presidential election.</p>
