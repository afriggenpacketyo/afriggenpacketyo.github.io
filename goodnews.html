Concurrently, Berkshire continues to expand its holdings in Japanese "trading house" stocks, with its stake in Mitsui and Mitsubishi now exceeding 10%. This article details Berkshire's strategic shift from a major Chinese investment to increased presence in the Japanese market, signaling a rebalancing of its international portfolio.

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the swing vote on landmark cases. Kennedy expresses deep concern over the current state of American discourse and the tone of some Supreme Court opinions, fearing for democracy's survival. The article highlights his evolution on issues like same-sex marriage, influenced by the impact on children, and abortion, where his personal moral views diverged from his legal interpretation.

          <p>This article investigates the scientific efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, exploring oral, topical, and injectable methods. While some users report positive results, dermatologists express skepticism about oral supplements reaching the skin effectively, as collagen is a large molecule. Industry-funded studies suggest benefits, but independent research often finds no significant effect. The article advises that marine collagen is generally preferred over bovine or vegan options for oral intake. Experts ultimately recommend sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as far more impactful strategies for skin health than expensive supplements.</p>

          <p>This article examines China's remarkable technological trajectory over the past 50 years, contrasting its current advanced state with a 1975 assessment that placed it two decades behind Europe. The piece coincides with the 50th anniversary of formal diplomatic relations between China and the European Union, and the 25th anniversary of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. It explores how China, following its reform and opening-up policy, has rapidly closed the gap and potentially surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future. This significant shift in technological prowess underscores the dynamic and evolving relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has pledged to commence construction on three new towns before the next general election, with Tempsford, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill identified as initial promising sites. This initiative is central to Labour's vision for economic growth, aiming to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The New Towns Taskforce has recommended 12 locations, with the goal for each new town to contain at least 10,000 homes and 40% affordable housing. Development corporations, mirroring the Stratford regeneration model, will manage funding and planning, drawing inspiration from post-war Labour housing booms.</p>
