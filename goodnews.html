The home improvement retailer slightly missed Wall Street's expectations for quarterly sales but exceeded earnings estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison attributed the positive outlook to investments in stores, technology, and customer service. The company expects full-year total sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, with comparable sales projected to be flat to up 1% year over year.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer's government has reversed its decision to means test the winter fuel allowance for pensioners, seeking to alleviate concerns within the Labour party. The original policy, announced almost a year ago, was intended to demonstrate the government's commitment to fiscal responsibility and address the economic inheritance from the previous administration. The U-turn follows criticism that the policy contributed to poor local election results and a by-election defeat. The decision highlights internal debates about the policy's effectiveness and the government's communication strategy.</p>

          <p>UK health officials have confirmed the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes. The risk to the public is considered "very low," and there is no evidence of the virus spreading within the UK. Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023. The UK Health Security Agency noted that the detection was not unexpected, as the virus is already widespread in Europe, and that climate change is contributing to the expansion of mosquito-borne diseases.</p>

          <p>Members of an Armenian organized crime ring have been charged with stealing over $83 million worth of cargo from Amazon by posing as legitimate truck drivers. The scheme, which operated across California since at least 2021, involved stealing truckloads of merchandise, including smart TVs and appliances. The groups would divert from their designated routes, take a portion of the goods off the trucks and resell them or gift them to associates. Amazon cooperated with DOJ officials in the investigation, sharing information about the stolen goods and the alleged fraudsters' accounts.</p>

          <p>This article explores the influence of multi-level-marketing schemes (MLMs) on the American workforce, highlighting how they have shaped corporate practices. The piece examines how corporations have adopted methods similar to MLMs, such as hiring contingent workforces and encouraging employees to think like entrepreneurs. The author argues that MLMs have become closely aligned with the center of corporate life, with their reliance on temporary workers and low-paid work defining the current labor market. The article further suggests that the decline of middle-class stability has made people more vulnerable to these schemes, which promise security, freedom, and dignity.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the challenges of understanding how large language models (LLMs) work and the progress being made in AI interpretability. Researchers are beginning to identify patterns of neuron activation within LLMs that correlate with specific concepts and user characteristics. LLMs not only contain relationships among words and concepts, but also many stereotypes, both helpful and harmful, from the materials on which they‚Äôve been trained, and they actively make use of them. It argues that it's important to empower users to recognize how models stereotype them and to provide a sphere of protection between LLMs and their users.</p>
