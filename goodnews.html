          <h2>England Mounts Strong Comeback in Second Test, but India Maintains Control</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 14:25:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, England staged a remarkable recovery led by Jamie Smith's incredible unbeaten 184 and Harry Brook's 158. The pair formed a massive 303-run partnership for the sixth wicket after England had collapsed to 85-5 early on the third day. Their efforts propelled England to a total of 407. However, India's bowlers, particularly Mohammed Siraj who took six wickets, fought back to dismiss the lower order quickly. This gave India a substantial first-innings lead of 180, and they extended their overall advantage to 244 by the close of play, leaving them in a dominant position heading into the final two days.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 14:13:12 EDT</div>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton conveyed a positive outlook for the British Grand Prix after a strong showing in Friday's practice sessions, where he closely challenged the McLaren team. Hamilton's Ferrari was third fastest, just behind McLaren's Lando Norris and his teammate Charles Leclerc, while championship leader Oscar Piastri was fourth. The performance was notable as both McLaren and Red Bull introduced upgrades for the Silverstone race. Hamilton, who has a record nine wins at his home race, stated he feels more comfortable with the car and believes he can dream of a strong weekend, though he acknowledged the challenge of potential rain on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

          <h2>Speculation Grows Over Potential New UK Political Party Led by Jeremy Corbyn</h2>

          <p>The prospect of a new left-wing political party in the UK is gaining attention after MP Zarah Sultana announced she was leaving Labour to launch a new movement with former leader Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn expressed support, he indicated that discussions are still ongoing and the foundations are not yet set. Polling suggests such a party could capture around 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters, potentially impacting Labour's standing. While some key figures from Corbyn's past leadership have stated they will remain with Labour, the move reflects a perceived gap to the left of Keir Starmer's current platform.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks outlines five types of food he avoids giving his children to promote better long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli slices because of their links to heart disease. He also advises against sugary cereals, drinks, and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives such as air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and meals prepared with methods like air frying to achieve a healthy lifestyle.</p>

In the women's event, reigning champion Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs and buns. While Chestnut fell short of his 2021 world record of 76, his dominant performance solidified his status as the sport's top competitor, earning him the coveted Mustard Yellow Belt.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing role as a foundational layer for institutional finance. Major financial players are increasingly building on Ethereum, with Robinhood announcing it will offer tokenized U.S. stocks via an Ethereum-based network. This trend is reinforced by Deutsche Bank's development of a tokenization platform and BlackRock's on-chain money market fund. While still lagging behind Bitcoin in market cap, Ethereum's stability, security, and two straight months of net inflows into its ETFs signal a shift toward utility and long-term infrastructure over speculative hype.

          <p>In an interview ahead of the nation's 250th birthday, acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history. He argued that its primary significance was the creation of the "citizen," a new concept that replaced the role of the "subject" under monarchical rule. This shift, he stated, turned the world upside down and inspired revolutionary movements globally for centuries. Burns, whose new film on the topic is forthcoming, also emphasized the importance of embracing America's complex and often contradictory history, noting that the aspirational words of the Declaration of Independence have empowered marginalized groups over time.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering effort to combat the effects of climate change, scientists are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a Miami reef that was devastated by bleaching. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami, the Florida Aquarium, and Tela Coral, involves crossbreeding resilient Elkhorn corals from the warmer waters of Honduras with local Florida corals. The goal is to create a more thermally tolerant coral population capable of surviving rising ocean temperatures. This marks the first time international crossbreeding of corals has been permitted for restoration on wild reefs, offering a potential blueprint for reef conservation across the Caribbean.</p>

Delgado recounted the meticulous forensic and oceanographic work required to locate wrecks, as well as the profound experience of exploring sites like the Titanic. He shared an eerie moment when, looking into a porthole 2.5 miles deep, he saw his own reflection, a stark reminder of the human element within the silent, deep-sea tomb.</p>

          <p>As Germany commits to a massive increase in defense spending to modernize its armed forces, economists are questioning the potential for broad economic growth. While the defense industry, including major contractor Rheinmetall, is experiencing a surge in orders and stock value, some studies suggest the overall economic stimulus will be moderate. Research indicates that for every euro of government spending on defense, the economy may only see a 50-cent return, far less than investments in infrastructure or education. Critics warn that the spending spree could primarily inflate arms companies' profits rather than significantly boosting Germany's defense capabilities or overall GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The island nation of Cape Verde is celebrating 50 years of independence, a half-century marked by significant social and economic progress. Since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, the country has made remarkable strides, particularly in education and healthcare, drastically reducing illiteracy and increasing life expectancy to one of the highest on the continent. Despite ongoing challenges like youth unemployment and migration, Cape Verde is now considered one of Africa's most stable and developed nations. Political leaders attribute this success to the resilience of the Cape Verdean people, shaped by a long history of overcoming drought and poverty, and strong ties with its large diaspora.</p>
