          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecasted to potentially make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., even as far south as northern California and Alabama. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center detected a solar flare associated with the storm. The storm is being spurred by a coronal mass ejection, which can disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. Space weather officials said that even though the coronal mass ejection is weakening, elevated solar wind conditions could still produce a significant cosmic event.</p>

Delegates expressed concerns about the impact of California's progressive policies on voters in battleground states, while others argued for the state to remain at the forefront of such matters.</p>

          <p>New US-China tariff war will significantly impact the Chinese technology sector and competition between the two countries on artificial intelligence. Higher tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, potentially shutting them out if tariffs rise dramatically. However, Chinese companies are responding by cutting costs, scaling up, and open-sourcing AI models to continue developing advanced technologies. These firms are also aggressively seeking new markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and deepening trade with Europe by offering technology transfers for market access. Chinese firms will face serious challenges under the Trump administration.</p>
