          <p>Deutsche Bank announced a second-quarter net profit of 1.485 billion euros, surpassing analyst expectations despite challenges from a strong euro and mixed results in its investment banking division. The German lender confirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets for 2025, with its profit before tax rising 34% year-on-year. While its fixed income and currencies division saw a revenue increase, the origination and advisory unit experienced a significant decline due to market uncertainty. The bank is navigating a lower interest rate environment in Europe but sees opportunities in increased defense spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a program offering monthly electronic subsidy coupons to its senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly care services and stimulate consumption. The policy targets seniors assessed as moderately to severely disabled, providing them with allowances between 500 and 800 yuan per month. This move represents a rare form of direct fiscal support from Beijing, which has typically avoided cash-like handouts. Economists believe strengthening the social safety net in this way could help reduce precautionary savings and address the financial strain on households from a rapidly aging population.</p>

          <p>The final of the Women's Euro 2025 will feature a highly anticipated rematch between England and Spain, the same two teams that competed in the 2023 World Cup final. Spain emerged victorious in that previous encounter, but Spanish midfielder Mariona Caldentey acknowledged that England is a dangerous opponent capable of winning the title. Reigning champions England reached the final after a difficult tournament, including a penalty shootout win and an extra-time victory. Meanwhile, world champions Spain will be competing in their first-ever Euros final after defeating Germany in the semi-finals, setting the stage for a dramatic conclusion.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell has selected his team for the crucial second Test against the Wallabies in Melbourne, featuring a strong contingent of nine Irish players in the starting lineup. The selection includes an all-Irish front-row and a new midfield partnership of Bundee Aki and Huw Jones, who replaces the injured Garry Ringrose. The team aims to secure the series after a damaging victory in the first Test. In response, Australia has bolstered its side by bringing back key players Will Skelton and Rob Valetini, setting up a highly competitive match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate quashed by a UK court. The ruling raises questions about the prosecution of individuals following the 2008 financial crisis and may open the door for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their sentences. Both Hayes and Palombo have called for a public inquiry into their cases and the conduct of the Serious Fraud Office. The decision follows a similar move in the U.S., where convictions were also overturned, leading to settlements with former employers.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, stating that the order's attempt to deny citizenship to many people born in the United States violates the 14th Amendment. The ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration agenda. The case, brought by several states, argued that the Constitution's Citizenship Clause guarantees citizenship to all persons born on U.S. soil and subject to its jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>The annual MLS All-Star game, which saw the MLS team defeat a Liga MX selection 3-1, continues to spark debate about its purpose and format in modern soccer. While the event provides entertainment and a benchmark against Mexico's top league, the absence of superstar Lionel Messi has highlighted its perceived lack of importance. Messi's decision to skip the festivities to rest for meaningful club matches suggests a growing sentiment that the exhibition game is a distraction. This has led MLS Commissioner Don Garber to admit that the league may need to rethink the event's structure to maintain player engagement and relevance.</p>

          <p>A major new study indicates that walking just 7,000 steps a day, rather than the commonly cited 10,000, can be sufficient to lower the risk of serious health issues like dementia, heart disease, and cancer. The research, published in The Lancet Public Health, analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found that achieving this more realistic target was linked to substantial health benefits compared to lower activity levels. Researchers suggest that while official guidelines often focus on time, a step-based recommendation could encourage more people to integrate physical activity throughout their day, promoting better overall health.</p>

          <p>A researcher from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography made a rare discovery on a La Jolla beach: a vibrant violet sea snail, Janthina janthina. These pelagic snails, which float on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft, are not typically found on Southern California shores. Their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore waters, leading to speculation about a potential link to climate change. The sighting is the first by Scripps researchers in a decade, and they are urging the public to report any further discoveries to help study the potential shift in the species' range.</p>

          <p>New regulations under the UK's Online Safety Act now require websites with pornographic content to implement robust age-verification systems for their users. The rules, which took effect Friday, mandate that platforms use methods like credit card checks, photo ID matching, or age estimation via selfie to prevent minors from accessing explicit material. Companies that fail to comply face substantial fines of up to £18 million or 10% of their global revenue. However, critics and users have raised concerns about data privacy and the potential for people to circumvent the checks using tools like VPNs.</p>

This contrasts sharply with his previous stance at the Boston Red Sox, where he was adamant about exclusively handling DH duties. Devers explained that playing on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. The position change was necessitated by an injury to the team's primary first baseman, and Devers contributed two hits in the Giants' 9-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>
