          <p>Intel's new chief executive is reportedly exploring a significant strategic change for its contract manufacturing business, potentially shifting focus away from its 18A chipmaking process for external customers. The proposed strategy would concentrate resources on the next-generation 14A process, where Intel believes it can better compete with rivals like TSMC. This move is part of a broader effort to revive the company's fortunes after it lost its manufacturing edge and posted its first unprofitable year since 1986. The decision, which could involve a substantial financial write-off, is under review by the company's board. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's effort to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants before its scheduled expiration. The ruling stated that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reconsidering the TPS designation. This decision provides temporary relief for hundreds of thousands of Haitians, allowing them to continue living and working in the U.S. The judge found that the potential harm to the immigrants far outweighed any harm to the government.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that the number of migrants apprehended for crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally reached a new historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 apprehensions. This continues an extraordinary decline in illegal immigration that the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive deportation efforts and deterrence policies. For the second consecutive month, Border Patrol reportedly did not release any migrants into the U.S. The current figures stand in stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration, which often exceeded 6,000 apprehensions per day.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the terms of a 60-day ceasefire proposal for its war with Hamas in Gaza. The deal, which aims to end the 21-month conflict, will now be presented to Hamas by mediators from Qatar and Egypt. While details of the proposal were not disclosed, it represents a significant potential step toward de-escalation, although previous efforts have failed. Neither Israel nor Hamas has publicly commented on the announcement, and the outcome now hinges on whether Hamas will accept the terms offered.</p>

The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of all nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's powerful testimony about the public health crisis in her community, where industrial waste contaminated groundwater, was a key inspiration for lawmakers to act.</p>
