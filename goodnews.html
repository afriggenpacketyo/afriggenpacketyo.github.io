          <p>A social media account called the Pentagon Pizza Report, which previously claimed to have accurately predicted Israel's initial strikes on Iran, posted about "HIGH" pizza traffic near the Pentagon shortly before the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. The account also noted abnormally low activity levels at Freddie's Beach Bar, a restaurant near the Pentagon, suggesting potential overtime at the Pentagon. The account echoed President Trump's wording in its post following the announcement of the strikes. Additionally, the account noted a "HUGE traffic surge" at the Domino's closest to MacDill Air Force Base, home of CENTCOM, shortly before Trump's address to the nation. </p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted in 2001 for the murder of her husband Bob, has had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original findings. Dorotik maintained her innocence throughout her incarceration and worked with the Loyola Project for the Innocent to re-examine the evidence. The appellate team says that several blood-like stains on items including a pillow sham, the nightstand, a lampshade, turned out not to be blood, casting doubt on the prosecution's case. The case raises questions about the reliability of the evidence presented at trial and the thoroughness of the initial investigation.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong faces the risk of splitting into two distinct economies, with the financial, professional, and business services sectors thriving due to China's resurgent economy and the shifting global power balance. The city's stock market is benefiting from its position as a platform for Chinese tech companies to raise funds and connect with global markets. Government policies aimed at maximizing the use of Hong Kong's financial markets have also contributed to the sector's growth. However, other sectors, such as food and retail, are not experiencing the same level of success. (not investment advice)</p>
