          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby publicly predicted that budget carrier Spirit Airlines is on a path to go out of business, stating that its discount model is no longer sustainable. Kirby's comments come after Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in a year, struggling with weak demand and high operational costs. He criticized the ultra-low-cost model for relying on fees and creating a negative customer experience. Spirit Airlines has recently cut numerous destinations as it faces increased competition from other carriers in the challenging airline industry.</p>

          <p>Angel Studios, the company behind the successful film "Sound of Freedom," has gone public, with its shares now trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Utah-based firm focuses on producing and distributing "values-based storytelling," using a unique model where its 1.5 million guild members vote on which projects to greenlight. The company evolved from VidAngel, a service that filtered explicit content from movies, before rebranding to focus on content production and crowdfunding. The public offering marks a significant step for the studio as it aims to expand its streaming service and international reach.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in prison for her central role in a federal bribery case. She was convicted of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars, a luxury car, and other benefits in exchange for her husband's political influence. Citing her ongoing cancer treatments, the judge handed down a sentence significantly below federal guidelines and set a surrender date for July 2026. Her husband, Bob Menendez, is currently serving an 11-year sentence for his part in the same corruption scheme.</p>

          <p>With the latest government report showing U.S. inflation ticking up to 2.9% in August, the article examines the viability of traditional savings accounts for wealth preservation. At the current national average interest rate of just 0.39%, a $10,000 deposit would earn less than $40 in one year, meaning its real value and purchasing power would significantly decrease. The article advises savers to consider alternatives with much higher returns, such as high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs), to better protect their money from inflationary pressures.

          <p>The U.S. inflation rate rose to 2.9% in August, creating renewed uncertainty for investors ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates. In this economic climate, the article suggests that investing in gold could be a sensible strategy to hedge against the eroding purchasing power of the dollar. Gold historically tends to maintain or increase its value during inflationary periods, offering a potential safe-haven asset to protect a portion of one's portfolio. However, it is recommended to limit such an allocation to 5-10% of total investments. (not investment advice)</p>

After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes, witnesses reported seeing two individuals run off with his ball just before play was suspended for weather. When play resumed, the situation allowed him to take a penalty drop rather than play his more difficult provisional ball. Fitzpatrick believes the unusual event saved him at least one shot, contributing to his six-under-par round.</p>
