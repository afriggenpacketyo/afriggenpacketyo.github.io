          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a partnership to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho.

The announcement, which underscores the close military alliance between the U.S. and Qatar, drew criticism from some right-wing activists. Hegseth later clarified that Qatar would not have its own base, but would operate within the existing U.S.-controlled facility.</p>

          <p>Maiwand Banayee, a former Taliban supporter who was radicalized as a teenager in a Pakistani refugee camp, has shared his story of leaving extremism behind. Now living in the UK, he has written a book detailing how he was drawn to the promise of martyrdom and a "pure Islamic society" in the 1990s. He describes a gradual process of disillusionment, citing the Taliban's cruelty and rigid enforcement of laws as key factors that led him to question their ideology. He hopes his experience can serve as a warning to young people who are vulnerable to radicalization.</p>
