          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris claimed a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the field by over half a second. Norris described the lap as near-perfect and expressed relief at rediscovering his top form after a season marked by qualifying errors. The performance was aided by recent car upgrades, which have improved his confidence and feel for the vehicle. His championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri will start in third, while rival Max Verstappen of Red Bull had a difficult session, qualifying only seventh after being impeded on his final lap.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Opener Smriti Mandhana scored a brilliant maiden T20 international century, leading India to a dominant 97-run victory over England at Trent Bridge. Mandhana's explosive 112 from 62 balls propelled India to a formidable total of 210-5, their second-highest in the format. England's response faltered early, as they collapsed to 113 all out, unable to counter India's bowling attack, particularly debutante Shree Charani who took four wickets. The result marks England's heaviest-ever T20 defeat by runs and highlights areas for improvement early in their series against a strong Indian side.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban in one of the largest LGBTQ+ demonstrations in Hungary's history. The event proceeded after the city's mayor declared it a municipal event, challenging a new law from Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's government that prohibits events promoting homosexuality to minors. The march was seen not only as a stand for LGBTQ+ rights but also as a broader protest against what many see as an erosion of democratic freedoms. The massive turnout represented a significant public rebuke of Orb√°n's policies.</p>

          <p>The Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, California, has reopened its doors for the first time since the destructive Palisades fire in January forced its closure. While the museum building was undamaged, the surrounding grounds required nearly six months of repair work. To mark its reopening, the Villa debuted a new exhibit titled "The Kingdom of Pylos," which showcases over 230 ancient Messenian art pieces and artifacts. Many of the featured works are being displayed in the United States for the first time, drawing expected crowds to the celebrated cultural institution.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Company has announced its plan to remove all artificial colors from its food products, including its sugar-free jams and Hostess brands like Twinkies, by the end of 2027. This move aligns Smucker with other major food corporations like Nestle and Kraft Heinz, which have made similar commitments. The decision comes amid increasing consumer demand for natural ingredients and heightened regulatory scrutiny of synthetic dyes by the U.S. government. The company noted that the majority of its portfolio, including its popular Uncrustables sandwiches, is already free from these additives.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their tour of Australia with a decisive victory over the Western Force, but the win was overshadowed by an injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams. The Welsh player, who scored two tries, left the field with a tight hamstring, creating a potential selection issue for coach Andy Farrell. The match analysis also highlighted the Lions' high penalty count in the first half as an area needing improvement. However, the team's aggressive, offloading style of play and the strong performance of lock Joe McCarthy were noted as significant positives.</p>

The drugs, with an estimated street value of ¬£96 million, were discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The Home Office reported that specialist Border Force officers detected the shipment and coordinated a complex operation to access the stash. This significant bust highlights the ongoing efforts by UK law enforcement to disrupt international drug trafficking operations that use container ships as a primary smuggling method.</p>

          <p>A recent large-scale Ukrainian drone attack, dubbed "Operation Spider Web," successfully destroyed or damaged numerous strategic bombers deep inside Russia, fundamentally challenging traditional military doctrine. The operation utilized small, smuggled drones launched by covert teams near the airbases, demonstrating a highly cost-effective method for neutralizing high-value assets. This analysis suggests the strike not only dealt a significant blow to Russia's long-range capabilities but also provides a blueprint for how smaller militaries can counter larger powers. The attack effectively turns previously secure rear areas into a new front line in modern warfare.</p>

The elusive creature, the world's largest invertebrate, has never before been observed alive in the deep sea.

While experts are still reviewing the footage to confirm the species, the recording is considered a significant achievement for marine biology, providing rare insight into the mysterious ecosystem of the Southern Ocean.</p>
