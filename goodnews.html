          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, examines the divisive legacy of the Plattenbau, the prefabricated concrete tower blocks common in the former East Germany. Initially hailed as a solution to post-war housing shortages and a symbol of socialist utopianism, these buildings later became associated with the painful economic and social transformations following German reunification. The exhibition uses art to explore the collective memories, social changes, and architectural significance of these structures, which once housed nearly a quarter of the GDR's population. It aims to foster a nuanced understanding of this architectural heritage beyond simple nostalgia or condemnation.</p>

          <p>The new one-woman show "Am I Roxie?" at the Geffen Playhouse features actress Roxana Ortega recounting her personal story of becoming the primary caregiver for her mother, who was suffering from memory loss. The performance delves into the guilt, exhaustion, and cultural pressures Ortega faced as a Latina daughter navigating the complexities of assisted living and her mother's declining health. The review describes the show as a relatable and wryly conversational personal essay performed with significant ebullience. It highlights the play's focus on the poignant, challenging, and sometimes absurd moments of the mother-daughter relationship under duress.</p>

          <p>Demand for German language courses is surging in Turkey, as a growing number of young people view proficiency in the language as a key to better educational and career opportunities in Germany. Driven by a difficult economic situation and stressful working conditions at home, many Turkish students are now aiming to attend German universities, with some elite high schools sending nearly all their graduates abroad. This trend has created a shortage of German language teachers in Turkey. The popularity of German, second only to English, reflects the close historical ties between the two nations and a desire for greater academic and professional freedom.</p>

The quake's epicenter was located approximately 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 39 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the sparsely populated region. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a threat but later rescinded it, while Japan's meteorological agency noted only a slight change in sea levels was possible, minimizing the likelihood of damage.</p>

          <p>Child development and education experts are urging parents to proactively discuss the use of generative artificial intelligence with their children. As teens increasingly use AI tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support, often without guidance, it is crucial for adults to explain the technology's benefits and significant risks. Experts recommend starting conversations early, exploring AI tools together, and teaching critical thinking skills like fact-checking AI-generated information. They also warn that while AI can be a helpful learning aid, it can also provide unsafe responses related to serious issues like self-harm and mental health crises.</p>

          <h2>Colleges Add Football Programs in an Effort to Boost Male Enrollment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Roanoke College in Virginia is one of over a dozen schools that have recently added football, hoping to attract more students, particularly men, whose college enrollment rates have been declining. Administrators believe the sport, along with new marching bands and cheerleading teams, will enhance campus spirit and provide a sense of belonging. While the strategy has shown initial success in balancing Roanoke's student body, research indicates that any enrollment spike from adding football is often short-lived. The trend reflects a broader effort by small liberal arts colleges to find creative solutions to the looming demographic cliff of fewer high school graduates.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that the company removed her account without a clear justification and applied its content moderation policies inconsistently, as similar accounts remained active. The ruling affirms that social media posts are constitutionally protected in Colombia and orders Meta to make its moderation and appeals processes more transparent. It represents a significant check on the power of major tech platforms to regulate user content without due process.</p>

          <p>Boxing analysts are divided ahead of the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence Crawford, a bout that pits Crawford's technical mastery against Álvarez's size and power advantage. Crawford, an undisputed champion at welterweight, is moving up two weight classes to challenge the undisputed super-middleweight champion, creating a classic boxer-versus-puncher dynamic. One expert argues Crawford's superior adaptability, timing, and defensive skills will allow him to outpoint a slowing Álvarez. Another contends that Canelo's experience, strength, and ability to control distance will ultimately prove too much for the smaller man, leading to a victory for the Mexican star.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the government, Nepal has sworn in former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its first female interim prime minister. The appointment, negotiated between the army and protest representatives, has helped restore calm to the capital, Kathmandu, where curfews have been eased. The "GenZ" protests erupted over economic woes and a social media ban, culminating in the dissolution of parliament. Karki, known for her strong anti-graft stance, will lead the country until new elections are held in March, representing a significant political shift for the Himalayan nation.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both its declining birth rate and the need to retain scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy program for female researchers returning to work after having a child. The initiative will initially provide 20 new mothers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences with a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010). This program targets a key challenge where women often face career setbacks in demanding scientific fields after childbirth. While the initial scope is limited, it is seen as a positive step toward creating a more supportive environment for women in STEM.</p>
