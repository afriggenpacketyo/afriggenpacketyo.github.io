          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a Marine Corps veteran, has been released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after being held for two months. She was detained in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, despite having two young children, one of whom she was still breastfeeding. Her case drew attention due to her husband's military service and an old, unknown deportation order issued against her and her estranged mother. Her release is conditional, and she still faces a lengthy immigration court process to secure her legal status.</p>

Ledecky's win was particularly notable as she maintained her undefeated streak in the 800-meter freestyle at major competitions, a record dating back to the 2012 Olympics.

The scheme allegedly involved signing state contracts with suppliers at prices inflated by as much as 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the arrests and emphasized a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption. The development follows a recent controversy where Zelensky's government restored the independence of anti-corruption bodies after public and international backlash against a bill that would have curtailed their power.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has evolved from a niche experiment into a foundational technology being integrated into global finance. Initially conceived as a platform for "programmable money," Ethereum now underpins trillions of dollars in transactions through stablecoins and is being adopted by major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank for tokenized assets. While co-founder Vitalik Buterin celebrates its success, he also cautions against the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption grows. The platform's journey from a sparse Berlin loft to the backbone of emerging financial systems highlights its significant impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals. The ruling stems from a lawsuit challenging sweeps by the Trump administration that appeared to target people based on race or for speaking Spanish. The court agreed that factors like ethnicity, language, or location alone do not constitute grounds for a stop, as they violate the Fourth Amendment. While advocates praised the decision for protecting civil rights, the administration criticized the ruling as judicial overreach undermining immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>NBA superstar Luka Doncic has officially signed a contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, ending speculation about his future with the team. The 26-year-old guard, who was acquired from the Dallas Mavericks in a trade last season, announced the signing himself, stating his commitment to bringing championships to the franchise. Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka praised Doncic as a "transcendent" player and the future of the team in the post-LeBron James era. As part of the announcement, Doncic also pledged a $5 million donation to help 77 young athletes pursue their dreams.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is launching a new left-wing political party in the UK alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, but it currently has no name. The founders are asking their supporters, who reportedly number over 600,000, to help choose a title that reflects the party's values. While names like "The Left" have been suggested, the process is open and must adhere to Electoral Commission rules to avoid confusion with existing parties. This unconventional approach aims to build a brand from the ground up, moving away from traditional party names that may no longer resonate with modern voters.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have formally committed to Luka Doncic as the franchise's future by signing him to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. This move solidifies the 26-year-old as the new centerpiece of the team, a role once envisioned for Anthony Davis. However, this shift in focus raises significant questions about the future of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. The article analyzes the new dynamic, noting that James is accustomed to being the focal point of any team he plays for and has not clearly communicated his long-term plans with the franchise.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in entertainment. Hill, who qualified as a doctor, felt unsuited for the profession and recalled feeling emotionally overwhelmed when breaking bad news to patients. His stepfather's death from cancer at age 54 made him realize he didn't want to spend his life in a career he wasn't passionate about. This pivotal moment set him on the path to comedy, where he eventually found widespread success with shows like "Harry Hill's TV Burp."</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more careful with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts sharply with China, where a vibrant and competitive open-source AI ecosystem is rapidly advancing, with companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI recently releasing powerful new models. Stanford professor Andrew Ng has praised China's "Darwinian" environment, suggesting it could be the path for the country to surpass the U.S. in AI development. The divergence highlights a strategic split in how the world's tech giants are approaching AI's future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II died en route to the UK. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift from Australia in 1943, but perished in the final days of its voyage. While wartime rumors blamed the animal's death on shell-shock from a nearby German U-boat, newly analyzed records suggest a different cause. Logbooks from the platypus's attendant show that as the ship crossed the equator, water and air temperatures soared well above the safe threshold for the species, indicating the creature likely died from heat stress.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of large-scale theme parks to stimulate its economy and fuel consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest addition to a rapidly growing attractions industry, which is forecast to expand by 19% annually over the next three years. According to the global theme park association IAAPA, these attractions act as significant economic drivers for local economies. The trend reflects a broader strategy to encourage domestic tourism and consumption as a pillar of economic growth in the post-pandemic era. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who use the internet to advertise or facilitate illegal Channel crossings. The proposed law, part of a broader immigration bill, could lead to up to five years in prison for those creating online material that promotes illegal immigration services, such as selling fake documents or promising passage on small boats. Home Office analysis suggests that around 80% of migrants arriving by boat used social media to contact smugglers. The measure aims to give law enforcement more power to disrupt the business models of criminal gangs.</p>
