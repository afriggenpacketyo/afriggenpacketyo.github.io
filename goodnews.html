          <p>Netflix announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 16% year-over-year to $11.08 billion. The streaming giant raised its full-year revenue forecast, citing healthy membership growth, increased advertising sales, and a weaker U.S. dollar. The company highlighted a significant increase in free cash flow and operating margin but cautioned that the margin would be lower in the second half of 2025 due to higher content costs for major releases like "Stranger Things" and "Wednesday." This is the second quarter Netflix has not released specific subscriber data.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency following medical tests prompted by mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described the condition as benign, common in individuals over 70, and stated that it does not cause the president any discomfort. The evaluation also found no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis, and an echocardiogram showed normal heart function. Bruising on Trump's hand was attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has overturned the fraud conviction of former HSBC trader Mark Johnson, who was jailed in 2017 for allegedly manipulating foreign exchange rates. Johnson was accused of 'front-running' a $3.5 billion currency trade for a client, a practice his defense and industry bodies argued was a standard risk-management technique known as 'pre-hedging'. After a nine-year legal battle, which included serving time in U.S. and U.K. prisons, Johnson has been fully acquitted. His lawyer stated the case never should have been brought forward in the first place.</p>

          <p>Model Brooks Nader and Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn both encountered wardrobe malfunctions while attending the 2025 ESPY Awards. Nader's silk dress shifted, causing a brief unwanted exposure, which she quickly adjusted before continuing along the red carpet with confidence. Vonn's strapless gown was caught by a gust of wind, exposing more than intended until her sister assisted in holding the dress down. Both celebrities are known for their daring fashion choices and handled the incidents with poise, with Vonn later changing into a second revealing gown for the event.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to introduce legislation that would lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for all U.K. elections. The proposal is part of a broader package of democratic reforms and, if passed, would enfranchise approximately 1.6 million teenagers. Proponents argue that 16-year-olds who can work and pay taxes should have a say in government, while critics question their maturity and political knowledge. The move aligns the entire UK with Scotland and Wales, which already permit younger voting in some local elections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the GENIUS Act, the first major cryptocurrency legislation approved by Congress, which establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The bill's passage followed a period of uncertainty after a group of right-wing Republicans initially blocked its advancement before a deal was reached. The legislation, which saw bipartisan support, now heads to the president's desk. Proponents argue that establishing rules for the digital asset market is long overdue, while some critics worry it lacks sufficient consumer protections and legitimizes a volatile industry.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives have settled a shareholder lawsuit that sought over $8 billion in damages related to the company's handling of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The lawsuit, filed in 2018, alleged that the board's actions led to massive fines and legal costs for the company due to repeated privacy breaches. The settlement was reached just as the trial entered its second day, preventing defendants like Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg from having to testify.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act, which would allow states to receive federal emergency funding from FEMA. Currently, events like hurricanes and floods are eligible, but extreme heat waves, which kill more Americans than any other weather event, are not explicitly listed. The push comes after a June heat dome broke temperature records across the country. Proponents argue the change is necessary to fund cooling centers and heat adaptation projects, while some, including a former FEMA head, say the existing law already allows for such requests.</p>

This unprecedented early sale highlights the immense anticipation for the film, which boasts a star-studded cast including Matt Damon, Zendaya, and Charlize Theron.

          <p>NBCUniversal has agreed to a proposed $3.6 million settlement with Los Angeles County to resolve a lawsuit alleging its Peacock streaming service made it difficult for consumers to cancel subscriptions. The lawsuit claimed Peacock's practices violated state and federal laws by not clearly disclosing auto-renewal terms and by obstructing the cancellation process. As part of the settlement, the company will pay civil penalties and fund consumer protection enforcement. Peacock must also make its renewal and cancellation policies more transparent and provide an easy, immediate method for subscribers to terminate the service.</p>
