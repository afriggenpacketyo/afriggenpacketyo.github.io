          <p>England defeated the West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, securing the series victory with one game to spare. Jos Buttler and Harry Brook contributed significantly before Jacob Bethell and Tom Banton guided England to a four-wicket win. West Indies posted a total of 197 after a late surge of runs, but Adil Rashid's expensive over proved costly for England. The series will conclude at Southampton.</p>
