          <h2>US and UK Reach Agreement to Reduce Tariffs on Cars and Metals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 16:54:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have reached an agreement to reduce tariffs on certain imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum, marking the first trade deal since President Trump increased tariffs in April. The deal aims to strengthen the economic relationship between the two countries, with leaders from both sides expressing optimism, though details are still being finalized. The agreement reduces the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year and slashes tariffs on steel and aluminum, while also including reciprocal access for beef exports. Kemi Badenoch, Conservative Party leader, criticized the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain have announced an initial trade agreement to reduce tariffs on certain imports, including steel, cars, and ethanol, though the deal still requires further negotiation. While leaders from both countries hailed the agreement as a success, uncertainties remain regarding the final details and implementation timeline. The agreement will provide relief for Britain's auto industry, but broader tariff reductions are still under negotiation. Despite the agreement, British goods exports still face higher tariffs than before, and the deal's impact on Britain's service-heavy economy is limited.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by positive market sentiment following trade deal announcements between the U.S. and the United Kingdom.

The recent market uncertainty and pro-crypto Trump administration have bolstered bitcoin's appeal, with investors viewing it as a safe-haven asset. Rising tensions between India and Pakistan, coupled with the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts, are expected to further test bitcoin's resilience.</p>
