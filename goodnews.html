          <p>Sophie Ingle, despite recovering from an ACL injury sustained last September, has been selected for Wales' 23-player squad for the 2025 Women's European Championship. The 33-year-old midfielder's inclusion demonstrates the confidence head coach Rhian Wilkinson has in her, even though Ingle hasn't played a competitive game this season. Angharad James will captain the squad, which also features Jess Fishlock, Wales' record cap-holder and goalscorer. The squad includes other veteran players, setting the stage for an experienced and determined Welsh team in the upcoming tournament.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents discovered and disabled a nearly 3,000-foot-long narcotics smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel, found in early April, was under construction and equipped with lighting, ventilation, and a track system. Authorities found the entrance point inside a house in Tijuana and plan to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use. Since 1993, over 95 tunnels have been decommissioned in the San Diego area, highlighting ongoing efforts to combat cross-border drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp.'s executive Eiji Hashimoto stated that the U.S. government's role under the $14.1 billion buyout of United States Steel Corp. will not hinder the U.S. unit's business. Hashimoto highlighted the significant investment in U.S. Steel operations and the golden share issued to the U.S. government as rational, despite concerns from analysts. The agreement ensures that Nippon Steel can maintain and expand production capacity at U.S. Steel, creating jobs and reducing the U.S. deficit. The acquisition makes Nippon Steel the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, approaching its goal of 100 million tons in annual capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from 2,000-year-old wall plaster discovered in central London, revealing details of a luxurious Roman villa. The fragments depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, offering insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The art suggests that Roman painters incorporated local elements into classical designs. The villa, dating to the first or second century AD, may have been home to a wealthy family or a hotel for rich travelers.</p>

Xie argued that these restrictions hinder the reduction of the U.S. goods deficit. These remarks come as the U.S. and China have recently agreed to a framework to ease trade tensions, including reduced tariffs and increased exports of critical minerals.</p>
