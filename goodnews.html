          <p>Antonio McDowell, 49, has been exonerated after spending 28 years in prison for a wrongful conviction linked to former Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was sentenced to 103 years in prison after Guevara allegedly framed him for murder. McDowell walked into CPD headquarters in 1997 after being shot, but was then framed as the perpetrator in an unrelated murder after refusing to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect. McDowell is the 51st person to be exonerated in a case investigated by Guevara, and he was granted clemency in 2020. In 2023, DNA evidence excluded McDowell as the source of DNA found on the murder victim's clothes, leading to the dismissal of the murder charges and, subsequently, the carjacking conviction.</p>
