          <p>A New York sportscaster made a subtle jab at Caitlin Clark after a controversial no-foul call during the Indiana Fever's loss to the New York Liberty. With seconds remaining, Natasha Cloud stole the ball from Clark without a foul being called, leading to mixed reactions. The sportscaster suggested Clark exaggerated the contact, saying Cloud got "all ball." Fever coach Stephanie White criticized the officiating, calling one non-call "egregious," highlighting the need for consistency in officiating. The coach stated she felt the officiating was disrespectful and the system for voicing concerns is not working.</p>

          <p>Newcastle secured a Champions League spot, despite an anti-climactic performance. The achievement marks a superb season for Newcastle and manager Howe, overcoming financial uncertainty and securing an estimated ¬£100m in revenue. Amid initial transfer concerns, Howe managed the instability superbly, leading his side to a long-awaited trophy and Champions League qualification.
