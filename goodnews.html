          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete, competed in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) track-and-field finals, winning first-place medals in high jump and triple jump and second in long jump. The U.S. Department of Justice launched a Title IX investigation over transgender athlete participation in California high school sports after the CIF announced a policy change allowing an additional athlete to compete and earn a medal in events where a transgender athlete also qualified. Protests took place outside the event, with some denouncing Hernandez's participation. Despite the controversy, the events proceeded without disruption, with some high school coaches offering support for Hernandez. </p>
