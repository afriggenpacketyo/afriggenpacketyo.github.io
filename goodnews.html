          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers 103-91 in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, securing their first NBA championship since relocating from Seattle. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 29 points and 12 assists, capping off his MVP season. The Pacers struggled after losing Tyrese Haliburton to a leg injury early in the game, and despite Bennedict Mathurin's 24 points, they couldn't overcome the Thunder's strong second-half performance. This victory marks a significant milestone for the Thunder, who finished the season with 84 wins, tying the 1996-97 Chicago Bulls for the third-most in any season.</p>

          <p>French police are investigating a staged wedding at Disneyland Paris after staff suspected the "bride" was a 9-year-old Ukrainian girl. A man reportedly hired the park for a large sum, bringing in hundreds of extras to act as guests for the event. The girl's mother claimed the event was organized to make her daughter feel like a Disney princess for the day. Four people, including the organizer, the mother, and two others, were taken into custody as police investigate the circumstances surrounding the staged event.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department initially posted condolences on social media for the "tragic" U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, which later was amended and deleted. The original post sparked controversy, with some accusing the department of expressing sympathy for a successful military operation. The U.S. military conducted strikes targeting nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan in Operation Midnight Hammer. The Trump administration described the strikes as a success in degrading Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, facing human smuggling charges, can be released on bail, determining the government failed to prove he was a flight risk. However, Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order, may be taken into ICE custody instead. The defense argues the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in Abrego Garcia's case. Another hearing is scheduled to set conditions for his release.</p>

Foreign visitors favored temples, shrines, and historic sites, while Japanese visitors expressed more disappointment due to crowds and public transportation issues. Kyoto plans to implement a lodging tax increase to address overtourism, using the revenue to strengthen related measures.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan approaches its first zero giant panda moment in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. rivalry intensifying, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo. Experts speculate a new loan could be announced during a potential visit by a Chinese leader to Japan, though its diplomatic weight may be diminished. China has historically used pandas as a symbol of friendship, but the current political climate adds complexity to these gestures.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence is increasingly used, researchers are uncovering more cases of potentially harmful responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements. The emergence of these issues is compounded by a lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models.

They also suggest adopting standardized "AI flaw" reports and disseminating information on these flaws to improve the understanding of risks posed by AI tools.</p>

          <p>Reem Raouda, a conscious parenting expert, identifies five phrases that parents should avoid to foster cooperation with their children. These include phrases that shut down communication, create defiance, dismiss emotions, assume intentional difficulty, and shame the child. Instead, Raouda suggests using language that respects the child's autonomy, acknowledges their feelings, invites problem-solving, and encourages self-reflection. The key is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural, emphasizing respect, emotional safety, and involvement.</p>

Some practices are warning patients not meeting the criteria not to book appointments, and pharmacy organizations are concerned demand will outstrip supply.

          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. This dominance is attributed to a long-term plan by the Chinese government, vast subsidies, and the development of a comprehensive EV ecosystem. The government's support has enabled Chinese companies like BYD and CATL to become global leaders in EV production and battery technology. The Chinese government is doing the same thing you see in Europe and in the US - providing policy support, consumer encouragement and infrastructure.</p>
