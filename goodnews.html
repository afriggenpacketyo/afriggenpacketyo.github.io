          <p>Despite a new dress code banning nudity and excessively voluminous outfits, celebrities like Halle Berry, Angelina Jolie, and Heidi Klum made striking appearances at the Cannes Film Festival. Berry had to change her original gown due to its long train, while Jolie turned heads in a sequined nude gown. Klum wore a floral dress with a thigh-high slit, and other stars like Natalie Portman and Eva Longoria also made memorable fashion statements. The new rules aim to maintain decency and ensure smooth traffic flow on the red carpet.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court rebuked the administration for providing inadequate notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation, while other courts have insisted on warning periods before deportations to countries where immigrants fear persecution. Legal scholars have hailed the courts' support of due process but expressed concern that such support was even necessary. The cases underscore the constitutional right to due process before deprivation of life, liberty, or property.</p>

          <p>Romania faces a crucial presidential runoff between hard-right George Simion and pro-EU Nicusor Dan. Simion, a "sovereignist" and admirer of Trump and Orban, won the first round, while Dan is a pro-European mathematician. The election is pivotal for Romania and Europe, given Romania's strategic importance. Simion's victory could destabilize the EU, while Dan represents the rule of law and support for Ukraine. Polls show Simion ahead, though forecasts are unreliable. Simion has shifted his rhetoric, but his lack of experience remains a concern.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria took senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. The announcement lacked specifics, leading to internal discussions to determine the extent and speed of the rollback. The Syrian transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief, blaming them for economic struggles. Relief may come in the form of waivers under the "Caesar Act." The move follows pressure from Turkey and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Syria's new government.</p>

This expansion is part of a broader plan to diversify the UAE's economy and increase its influence over global supply chains. While the U.S. has maintained close security ties, the UAE's growing commercial partnership with China is also a key factor in its strategy.</p>

He argues for a balanced approach to Black history that acknowledges tragedy and celebrates triumph.</p>
