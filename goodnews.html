          <p>Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark has taken a significant step toward returning to the court after being sidelined with a groin injury since mid-July. She was observed participating in low-intensity, non-contact drills during a team shootaround, which her coach described as a positive development in her recovery process. Clark's potential return is crucial for the Fever, who are fighting for a playoff spot while dealing with season-ending injuries to several other key players. Her presence would provide a much-needed boost as the team navigates the final stretch of the regular season.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Monday, following a positive trend from Wall Street. The rally was spurred by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who indicated that the central bank might begin to ease its monetary policy and cut interest rates as early as next month. Major indexes in Japan, South Korea, and Australia all climbed, reflecting investor optimism about a less restrictive financial environment. This potential shift in Fed policy is seen as a positive catalyst for global markets, which have been closely watching for signs of relief from high interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has begun working to facilitate the evacuation of nine Palestinian students from Gaza who have been awarded prestigious scholarships to study at British universities. This development follows months of campaigning on behalf of dozens of Gazan students with offers from UK institutions. For the scholars, like a doctor who received the news in a shelter after a hospital shift, the opportunity is a lifeline of hope amid the devastation of war. However, the joy is mixed with the painful prospect of leaving their families behind in a perilous and uncertain environment.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France remains a site of pilgrimage and mystery, with the Catholic Church having officially recognized 72 medical miracles linked to it over 163 years. A dedicated medical office, staffed by doctors and researchers, rigorously investigates claims of miraculous cures, applying strict criteria to separate explainable recoveries from those that defy current scientific understanding. To be considered, a cure must be sudden, complete, lasting, and have no possible medical explanation. Despite skepticism, independent analysis has found the office's conclusions to be credible based on available evidence.</p>

          <p>Defense technology company Anduril has provided a first look at its unmanned fighter jet, named "Fury." The aircraft is a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) designed to fly autonomously, without a pilot, and work in coordination with manned fighter jets. It is intended to fly ahead of piloted planes, detecting and engaging enemies to protect the human pilots behind it. Anduril, which beat out several established defense contractors for an Air Force development contract, aims to make the jet easier and cheaper to mass-produce by using commercial components.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh has set a new MLB single-season record for home runs by a player at his position, hitting his 48th and 49th homers of the year. His record-breaking blast surpassed the previous mark of 48 set by Salvador Perez in 2021. The switch-hitting All-Star also set a new record for the most multi-homer games in a season by a switch-hitter, passing Mickey Mantle's 1961 mark. Raleigh's historic power surge continues a remarkable season for the 28-year-old, who also won the All-Star Home Run Derby in July.</p>
