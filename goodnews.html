          <p>On the anniversary of Labour's election victory, the government is attempting to deflect blame for current challenges onto the previous Conservative administration, a strategy that may have diminishing returns as Labour's own tenure lengthens. The government is highlighting the Chagos Islands deal and the sentencing review as examples of Conservative failures. One proposed idea is to explore mandatory chemical castration for sex offenders. The article also mentions upcoming net migration figures, data on asylum seeker housing, and public sector pay deals, as ministers seek to demonstrate their achievements amidst economic difficulties and declining poll numbers.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. The price increase occurs despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, potentially reflecting investors seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt has also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a previous bitcoin skeptic, announced the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has called on the European Union to ensure a 'fair' playing field for businesses after Brussels proposed a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, many of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson emphasized the importance of an open and inclusive trade environment for all parties. The European Commission's proposal includes a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas, with a lower fee for parcels stored in European warehouses.</p>

          <p>Shares in Xpeng are experiencing a significant rally, with analysts predicting further gains as the Chinese electric-vehicle maker introduces new models and progresses toward profitability. The company's Hong Kong shares surged following upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Xpeng's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust sales, narrowing its net loss and improving its gross margin. Analysts anticipate Xpeng to become profitable in the fourth quarter of this year, supported by strong sales momentum and upcoming new models.</p>
