          <p>Shohei Ohtani led the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with a legendary two-way performance in their National League Championship Series-clinching 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Ohtani hit three home runs and recorded 10 strikeouts while pitching into the seventh inning, a feat hailed as one of the greatest in postseason history. His dominant display on both offense and defense secured a four-game sweep for the Dodgers and earned him the NLCS MVP award, sending the team to the Fall Classic for the fifth time in nine seasons.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test can successfully detect more than 50 types of cancer, many of which currently lack screening programs. The trial, involving 25,000 adults in North America, found that the test identified cancer in nearly 1% of participants, with over half of these cases caught at an early, more treatable stage. While researchers are optimistic about its potential to revolutionize cancer screening, further evidence from larger trials, including one by the NHS in England, is needed to confirm if it reduces cancer mortality rates.</p>

          <p>Turkish Cypriots are heading to the polls to elect a new leader in what is seen as a referendum on the future of the divided island. The main contenders are incumbent Ersin Tatar, who supports a two-state solution in alignment with Turkey, and Tufan Erhurman, who advocates for a bizonal, bicommunal federation based on UN resolutions. The election's outcome will not only shape negotiations on the Cyprus issue but also address concerns within the community about its secular identity and the increasing demographic influence from Turkey.</p>

A CT scan to check for internal damage unexpectedly revealed the tumor, leading to a diagnosis of a rare kidney cancer and the subsequent removal of her kidney, a procedure that has left her cancer-free.</p>
