          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to be sworn in as Germany's Chancellor, leading a coalition government facing significant challenges including economic slump, strained international relations, and the rise of the far-right AfD. Merz has tapped several individuals from the private sector for cabinet positions, a rare move in German politics, including Karsten Wildberger as digitization minister and Katherina Reiche as Economy Minister. Despite these unorthodox choices, analysts believe the parties are trying to deliver on promises of political change, balancing new faces with loyalty to party leaders, in this article.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's garment industry, a cornerstone of the nation's economy, faces potential disruption due to proposed U.S. tariffs. While President Trump paused the tariffs, the possibility of reinstatement worries the millions of workers dependent on the industry. The garment sector has transformed since the Rana Plaza collapse, improving working conditions and consolidating operations, yet a 10 percent tariff could still impact the low-margin business. This article examines the potential economic consequences and the resilience of Bangladesh's garment factories, highlighting the reliance of the country on its labor force.</p>

          <p>The UK government is investing ¬£102m to upgrade and expand over 1,000 GP surgeries, aiming to tackle long waiting times and improve patient services. This investment, the largest in facilities for five years, is intended to create additional space for doctors to see more patients and address the "08:00 scramble" for same-day appointments. The initiative comes as patient satisfaction with NHS GP services has significantly declined, driven by fewer in-person appointments, with the hope that improved facilities will shift care from hospitals to the community, as described in the article.</p>

          <p>Fujitsu Ltd. and Japan's Riken research institute have jointly developed a superconducting quantum computer that uses 256 quantum bits or qubits and aim to launch a more advanced 1,000-qubit computer within two years. Building on its 64-qubit predecessor released in 2023, the new system will be available to others in June, Fujitsu and Riken said late last month. The article states that competition over development is intensifying among countries, as quantum computing is expected to be used for a wide range of applications in the financial, pharmaceutical and other sectors.</p>
