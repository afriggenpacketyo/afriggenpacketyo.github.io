          <p>Former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn discussed the U.S. economy, noting the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut. He explained that this move lowers the overnight bank lending rate but does not directly impact consumer borrowing costs for mortgages or auto loans, which are determined by the open market. Cohn also highlighted a cooling labor market, attributing it to companies reducing labor expenses to protect their profit margins amidst rising input costs. He further commented that a new executive order imposing a significant fee on H-1B visas could effectively reserve the program for highly skilled foreign workers who are genuinely needed.

Hocker was in 11th place at the bell but unleashed a devastating kick to overtake his competitors and secure the gold medal. He expressed a sense of vindication following his controversial disqualification from the 1,500-meter event earlier in the competition, stating he felt "robbed" and wanted to end the championships on his own terms. The final night also saw the U.S. women's and men's teams win gold in their respective 4x100m relays.</p>

The smart factory utilizes an integrated network combining 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect all sensors, robots, tools, and personnel. This unified system for data collection, communication, and control aims to eliminate oversights like missing bolts that can occur with manual checks. The advanced manufacturing process represents a significant step in ensuring the safety and reliability of China's entry into the large passenger aircraft market.</p>

In a television interview, Trump also mentioned Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as other prominent American figures expected to participate in the arrangement. He characterized the potential investors as "American patriots" who would do a good job managing the popular social media platform. The specific details of the deal, which requires approval from both Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, are still being finalized.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially announced their recognition of a Palestinian state. The leaders of all three nations framed the decision as a necessary step to revive the two-state solution and build momentum for lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that this recognition is not a reward for Hamas but rather an action that undermines the terror group's vision by supporting a viable state where Hamas has no role. The move has been condemned by the Israeli government and the U.S., who argue it rewards terrorism.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of swimmers participated in the first officially organized swim in the Chicago River in almost 100 years, an event that highlights decades of successful environmental cleanup efforts. The river, once notoriously polluted with sewage and industrial waste from slaughterhouses, has been transformed into a recreational waterway. This change was made possible by the 1972 Clean Water Act and dedicated local restoration work, which have allowed dozens of fish species and other wildlife to return. The event symbolizes a significant shift in the public's perception of the river, from a toxic channel to a cherished civic asset.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the body's aging process at a cellular level. Epel explains that stress shortens telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes, which naturally shrink as we age. This accelerated shortening can be mitigated by adopting daily practices to manage stress and promote cellular restoration. She recommends creating an anti-inflammatory lifestyle by eating more fruits and vegetables, practicing short daily meditations, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork. These small, sustainable changes can help counter the negative biological effects of constant stress.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats in the UK are debating whether to abandon their long-held opposition to national identity cards, a policy they helped scrap in 2010. Party leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and suggested the party should not have a "knee-jerk" reaction, especially with the Labour government reportedly planning a digital ID scheme. While some members fear the potential for government overreach and data security issues, Davey noted that a system focused on empowering individuals to access public services could align with liberal values. The discussion reflects a potential major policy shift for the party on a key civil liberties issue.</p>

          <p>Actor Dwayne Johnson is taking on his most ambitious acting role yet, playing real-life mixed martial arts champion Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." Johnson stated that for years he had been seeking a dramatic role he could truly immerse himself in, moving beyond his box-office-driven action films. To portray Kerr, who battled drug addiction, Johnson endured hours of prosthetics and drew upon his own childhood trauma of being evicted at age 15 to access raw emotions. He described the experience as transformative, opening up a "whole new book" for his career by embracing vulnerability.</p>

The circular toys pose a significant danger to young, curious seals, which can get the rings stuck around their necks, leading to severe injury, infection, and often death. The ban is voluntary and does not include fines, but the council hopes it will encourage public support and discourage the use of these harmful toys. The move follows similar actions by other coastal councils and retailers, and is part of a wider campaign for a UK-wide legislative ban.</p>

This process of repentance, or "Teshuvah," is a return to our better selves. Rabbi Buchdahl suggests that the entire nation could benefit from this practice by collectively acknowledging failings such as ignoring the vulnerable and normalizing violence, in order to return to the compassion and generosity that define the country at its best.</p>

These practices focus on creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection at home.

Other crucial habits involve treating mistakes as learning opportunities, teaching children how to repair relationships after conflict, and listening more than lecturing, thereby demonstrating respectful communication for the child to emulate.</p>

          <p>As premium travel credit cards increase their annual fees, a credit expert advises consumers on how to maximize their value. Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy, warns against three common mistakes: opting for no-fee cards which typically offer poor rewards, hoarding points which can be devalued by issuers at any time, and failing to negotiate with the card company. He suggests that even a modest annual fee is often worthwhile for better perks and that users should regularly reassess if their card still fits their lifestyle. Before canceling a card over its fee, he recommends calling the retention department to ask for discounts or bonus points.</p>

          <p>Scientists have analyzed the DNA of two 7,000-year-old mummies discovered in a Libyan rock shelter and found they belong to a previously unknown genetic lineage. The remains are of female herders who lived during the "Green Sahara" period, when the region was a humid savannah. Their ancestry diverged from Sub-Saharan African populations around the same time as modern non-Africans, and they remained largely isolated for most of their existence. This finding challenges the theory that farming practices spread through the region via migration, suggesting instead that it was transmitted through cultural diffusion among distinct, isolated groups.</p>

Environmental journalist Laura Trethewey notes that the ocean floor contains undiscovered mountains, canyons, and ecosystems that could hold crucial data, particularly regarding past sea-level rise. However, the project faces significant hurdles, including immense costs, geopolitical tensions that discourage data sharing, and a lack of necessary equipment.
