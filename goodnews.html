Following the news, shares for both companies saw a significant jump in extended trading, a common reaction as index funds must purchase shares to reflect the updated composition. Both companies went public in 2021 and their inclusion marks a notable milestone, especially after previous exclusions from the large-cap U.S. index. The move further increases the technology sector's concentration within the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>

This victory marks another significant achievement for the 2022 champion, who will now face either Jannik Sinner or Felix Auger-Aliassime in the upcoming final.

The decision sets aside the administration's move to revoke legal protections and work permits, arguing that the Department of Homeland Security Secretary acted hastily and without proper authority. The DHS criticized the ruling, vowing to use every legal option to end what it describes as an abuse of the TPS program.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has unequivocally stated he will not withdraw from his re-election campaign, following a report that President Trump's advisors considered offering him an ambassadorship to clear the mayoral field.

President Trump later commented that a one-on-one race would be more competitive, implicitly acknowledging the strategic thinking behind the reported plan.</p>

          <p>A Boy Scout troop from Santa Barbara successfully rescued a 78-year-old hiker who was lost, dehydrated, and without supplies in the Emigrant Wilderness. The troop's scoutmaster, who has search-and-rescue training, recognized the man was in serious distress and used a satellite device to coordinate a helicopter evacuation. The hiker, an experienced outdoorsman and former scoutmaster himself, had lost his pack and become disoriented. The incident provided the young scouts with a powerful real-world lesson on the critical importance of preparedness and staying with essential survival gear.</p>

          <p>After nearly a year as England's manager, Thomas Tuchel has overseen just four games, leaving his tactical vision for the national team largely uncertain. This article analyzes his limited time in charge, noting a preference for a more physically imposing and ball-dominant style of play, but questions remain about the team's identity. Compared to his predecessors, Tuchel has had significantly fewer matches to implement his strategy. Upcoming World Cup qualifiers are seen as a crucial test to demonstrate the direction and strategy he intends for the Three Lions.</p>

Furthermore, Chicago's overall violent crime rate has been declining and was lower in 2024 than in other major cities like New York and Los Angeles.
