          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged that the UK will meet a new NATO target of spending 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035. This commitment includes allocating 3.5% to core defense and 1.5% to defense-related areas like resilience and security, aiming to satisfy both NATO demands and provide flexibility for EU countries. However, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel criticized the announcement for lacking immediate funding plans, emphasizing the urgency due to current geopolitical threats. Starmer defended the plan, highlighting the link between economic and national security and its potential to create jobs and growth.</p>

          <p>Google may face alterations to its online search services in the UK following concerns raised by regulators about its market dominance. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering designating Google with "strategic market status" under new competition rules. This designation, granted by the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, empowers the CMA to enforce consumer protections on tech giants and impose substantial fines for breaches. The legislation aims to address the entrenched power of dominant tech firms in specific markets.</p>

          <p>The law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, which worked to maintain San Jose State's transgender volleyball player Blaire Fleming's eligibility, also cleared her of conspiring to injure a teammate. Attorney Tim Heaphy, from the same firm, led the investigation into allegations that Fleming planned with an opponent to spike teammate Brooke Slusser in the face during a game. Slusser had previously expressed concerns about potential long-term brain damage from a second concussion, but the investigation found insufficient evidence to corroborate the allegations. The firm's involvement highlights the complex legal and ethical considerations surrounding transgender athletes in sports.</p>
