          <p>Ben Duckett's impressive innings of 149 runs guided England to a remarkable victory against India in the first Test at Headingley, successfully chasing a target of 371. Duckett's performance, supported by Zak Crawley's 65, set a strong foundation for England, although quick wickets caused some concern. Joe Root and Jamie Smith steadied the innings, securing the win with 14 overs to spare, adding another chapter to Headingley's rich cricket history.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growth in home prices is slowing down faster than expected due to rising supply and decreasing demand in the housing market. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index indicates a 2.7% national increase in April compared to the previous year, marking the smallest gain in nearly two years. While New York, Chicago, and Detroit saw the biggest increases, prices in previously hot markets like Tampa and Dallas are now declining. Higher mortgage rates and increased housing supply are contributing to this slowdown, although prices are not at risk of major declines as seen during the Great Recession. The optimism score reflects a cautious outlook on the housing market.</p>

          <p>As NATO leaders gather to discuss increasing defense spending, nine member countries have failed to meet the existing target of 2% of GDP. While the 2% target is not legally binding, political pressure, particularly from President Trump, has been a significant factor. Spain, the lowest spender, plans to reach 2% by 2025, but Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez has expressed reservations about increasing spending to the proposed 5% target. Several other countries, including Canada, Belgium, Portugal, and Italy, have also pledged to meet the 2% target in the near future.
