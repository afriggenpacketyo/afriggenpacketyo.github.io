          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a pivotal figure in shaping the cultural landscape of Los Angeles, has passed away at the age of 105. A decorated WWII veteran, attorney, and real estate developer, he was instrumental in the creation of landmarks like the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Beyond the arts, Nicholas founded Public Counsel in 1970, which grew to become the largest pro bono law firm in the U.S., providing legal aid to the vulnerable. He is remembered for his immense energy and profound impact on the city's arts and public service sectors.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants before its scheduled expiration. The Brooklyn-based judge ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reconsidering Haiti's TPS designation. The ruling states that the interests of the Haitian immigrants, who face potential deportation to a country in turmoil, far outweigh the potential harm to the government. The administration has criticized the ruling, vowing to appeal.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the conditions for a proposed 60-day ceasefire in its war with Hamas. In a social media post, the president urged Hamas to accept the deal, which he stated would be delivered by mediators from Qatar and Egypt. Details of the proposal were not released, and neither Israel nor Hamas has publicly commented on the specific terms. This development follows previous stalled negotiations and comes as the 21-month conflict continues with significant casualties on both sides.</p>

          <p>A new medical technology using magnetic extractors is saving the lives of soldiers in Ukraine, where shrapnel wounds now account for up to 80% of battlefield trauma. Developed by a volunteer-led effort, these tools allow surgeons to remove metal fragments, even from a beating heart, with minimally invasive procedures. The magnets make operations faster and more precise, a critical advantage for medics working in field conditions. This innovation, born from necessity on the front lines, is now being rolled out to hospitals across the country.</p>

Beijing has successfully diversified its trade partners to offset declining shipments to the United States, keeping it on track to meet its annual GDP growth target of around 5 percent. However, experts warn that significant challenges lie ahead, with some analysts forecasting that export growth will slow or even contract in the second half of the year due to a potential slowdown in U.S. consumer spending.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has enacted a major reform of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a move intended to spur housing construction across the state. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, largely waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas already zoned for multifamily use. This eliminates a significant barrier that opponents often used to delay or block new developments through lengthy environmental reviews and lawsuits. While other hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, the reform marks a seismic shift in the state's approach to development.</p>
