          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture near Tokyo as part of its restructuring efforts, according to a company source. This move comes after the automaker announced plans to shut down seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally following a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The plants under consideration are the Oppama plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka. The company clarified that this news is speculative and not based on official information, but the potential closures would mark the first plant shutdowns in Japan since 2001.</p>

Pharmaceutical companies extract a large portion of their profits from the United States, and the administration aims to end this imbalance.

          <p>Experts warn that long-term care costs, which can exceed $100,000, pose a significant financial challenge for many Americans. Many households are unprepared to manage these expenses, as health insurance and Medicare often do not cover custodial care. Medicaid is the largest payer of long-term care, but eligibility requirements can be stringent. Proactive planning, including considering long-term care insurance and discussing needs with family, is crucial to mitigate the financial burden of long-term care.</p>
