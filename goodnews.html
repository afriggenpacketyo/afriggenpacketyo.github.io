          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone, discussing the intricacies of their recently agreed-upon trade deal, a conversation that Trump described as resulting in a "very positive conclusion" for both countries. The call, lasting approximately one and a half hours, led to plans for U.S. and Chinese negotiating teams to meet soon at a location yet to be determined. During the call, Xi invited Trump and the First Lady to visit China, and Trump reciprocated with an invitation for Xi and his wife to visit the U.S. The conversation marks a significant development amid trade tensions, occurring after Trump accused China of violating an earlier agreement to roll back tariff rates. The article highlights the ongoing efforts to navigate complex trade relations between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>US Trade Deficit Narrows Amid Trump's Tariff Escalation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit significantly narrowed in April as President Trump escalated tariffs, causing a plunge in imports, according to U.S. Commerce Department data. The trade gap fell by more than half, registering at about $61 billion compared to $140 billion the previous month, with imports dropping by 16% as trade barriers took effect. Trump has touted tariffs as a means to reduce the nation's trade deficit, viewing it as a threat to economic prosperity, although many economists disagree. Consumer attitudes have soured amid the tariff implementations, yet key economic indicators like unemployment and job growth have largely defied downturn fears, while inflation has cooled. The uncertain policy environment continues to create anxiety for businesses and consumers alike (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A privately-built Japanese lunar lander, the Resilience, is set to attempt a touchdown on the moon after a four-and-a-half-month journey. Carrying cameras, scientific instruments, and a tiny rover, the lander aims to explore the lunar surface and deploy a customer payload, a tiny model of a Swedish house. The mission is part of a growing effort by private companies to provide transportation services to the moon, but faces challenges, as evidenced by previous failed landing attempts. Only one company has successfully touched down and carried out its mission prior to this attempt, demonstrating the difficulty of achieving low-cost lunar landings.

          <p>The original Herm√®s Birkin bag, once owned by the late Jane Birkin, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's this summer, representing a significant piece of fashion history. The bag, which inspired one of the world's most coveted accessories, differs slightly from the models sold today. The auction house has not yet indicated how much the bag could fetch, but it is expected to be a highly sought-after item. Birkin, known for her artistry and style, inspired the creation of the bag after a chance encounter with Herm√®s' then-head Jean-Louis Dumas.

          <p>The government has announced that any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, saving parents ¬£500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. Sir Keir Starmer described the measure as a "down payment" on a broader child poverty strategy, while Education Bridget Phillipson emphasized that the plan would lead to higher educational outcomes.

          <p>Stellantis is bringing back its V-8 Hemi engine for Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a decision made last year to discontinue it amid tightening fuel economy regulations. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis admitted that canceling the Hemi engine was a mistake and that its return is part of a new product turnaround plan. The Hemi is expected to represent 25% to 40% of Ram 1500 pickup truck sales. The announcement is part of a broader trend of automakers reevaluating their EV strategies amid slower-than-expected adoption rates and the Trump administration's efforts to unwind Biden-era climate initiatives.
