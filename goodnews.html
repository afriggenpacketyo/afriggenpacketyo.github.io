          <p>Boston University has released a statement following allegations by Alex Cooper, host of the "Call Her Daddy" podcast, that her former soccer coach, Nancy Feldman, sexually harassed her. Cooper claimed that Feldman made inappropriate comments about her body and sex life, and sought to spend time alone with her. The university stated it has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment and encourages anyone with concerns to report them through their Equal Opportunity Office. Cooper played soccer at Boston University from 2013 to 2015 before rising to podcast fame.</p>

          <p>Rachel Elizabeth Seed's documentary, ‚ÄúA Photographic Memory,‚Äù explores the life and legacy of her mother, Sheila Turner-Seed, a journalist who died when Rachel was an infant. The film uses a rich archive of Turner-Seed's work, including photos, journals, and interviews with renowned photographers, to reveal a woman who balanced personal fulfillment with traditional values. Seed interweaves her own introspective voice-over and contemporary footage with recreations of her mother's interviews, creating a poignant exploration of the parent-child connection.

          <p>Melissa Febos's new memoir, "The Dry Season," explores the benefits of voluntary celibacy and refusal. The book examines how saying no to one thing can open up possibilities for something else. Febos describes her year of celibacy as a way to widen her aperture and discover things that had previously escaped her notice. The author uses a metaphor to explain why she took a break from sex, dating, and even flirtation: "it made sense to keep the channel of one‚Äôs heart narrowed the width of a single person, to peer through the keyhole at a single room rather than turn to face the world."</p>

South Africa needs 69 runs to secure the win, which would end their long wait for a major men's final victory.

Users can adjust settings on the app to protect their privacy. To start, click on your profile photo on the top right corner of the screen and scroll down to data and privacy. Then head to the "suggesting your prompts on other apps" tab. This should include Facebook and Instagram.

Researchers are exploring methods such as genetically modifying red blood cells, neutralizing blood type with gut bacteria enzymes, and creating microscopic artificial blood cells. The US military is also backing research to enhance red blood cell performance. While promising, these approaches still require years of development before safe and scalable production is possible. Human blood donations remain essential for transfusions.</p>
