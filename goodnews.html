          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly finalizing a deal to take over the Apple Card portfolio, a move that would see Goldman Sachs exit the high-profile partnership. For JPMorgan, the nation's largest credit card issuer, acquiring the business would further solidify its dominance in the financial sector. The transition follows a challenging period for Goldman Sachs, which faced profitability issues and regulatory scrutiny with the Apple Card since its 2019 launch. The deal would provide Apple with a more stable and experienced partner for its popular credit card service. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue. However, the company issued a cautious outlook for its 2026 fiscal year, warning that new tariffs would create a $1 billion pretax headwind. In response, P&G plans to implement mid-single-digit price increases on about a quarter of its products, including brands like Tide and Charmin. The guidance reflects ongoing economic volatility and a more selective, value-seeking consumer, creating uncertainty for the year ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single-company transcontinental railroad in United States history. The merger aims to streamline national shipping by eliminating handoff delays between the western-focused Union Pacific and the eastern-based Norfolk Southern networks. While the companies argue this will improve efficiency and delivery times, the proposal faces significant scrutiny from antitrust regulators. The deal could also pressure the remaining major U.S. railroads, BNSF and CSX, to pursue a similar merger to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>Germany's national railway, Deutsche Bahn, is actively working to make its infrastructure more resilient against the increasing threats posed by climate change. Following destructive events like the 2021 floods, the company is redesigning bridges to better withstand high water and debris. To combat drought-related fire risks, it has stopped using controversial herbicides and is testing special trains to water embankments. Additionally, the railway is upgrading signaling technology and train components to better handle extreme heat, reflecting a comprehensive strategy to adapt to a more volatile climate.</p>

          <p>Boeing reported a significant improvement in its second-quarter financial results, slashing its losses as revenue jumped 35% year-over-year. The aerospace giant delivered 150 airplanes, its highest number for a second quarter since 2018, signaling a potential turnaround after years of crises. CEO Kelly Ortberg stated that the company is beginning to see a difference in performance and aims to make 2025 its "turnaround year." Despite the progress, challenges remain, including the delayed certification of its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models, which is now expected in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's public calls for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, economists widely predict the central bank will hold its benchmark rate steady at its upcoming meeting. The Fed has maintained its current rate since late 2024 to combat inflation, and Chair Jerome Powell has consistently stated that decisions are based on economic data, not political pressure. While the economy shows signs of slowing, solid labor market data and persistent inflation concerns give the Fed reason to remain cautious. Most analysts believe a rate cut is more likely at the September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, partially attributing the improved outlook to a softening of some U.S. tariffs on imported goods. The organization now projects global growth of 3% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, an increase from its April predictions. The IMF noted a recent surge in U.S. imports as firms rushed to get ahead of impending taxes, which provided a short-term boost. However, the report also warned that prolonged trade uncertainty and higher tariffs could still lead to weaker economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have found compelling evidence that the ancient Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in modern-day Turkey was a society centered around women. DNA analysis of skeletons buried under homes revealed that households were formed on a matrilineal basis, with men moving in with the woman's family. This genetic evidence supports earlier archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. Further analysis showed that grave goods were found five times more frequently with female bodies than male ones, indicating women held an elevated societal status in the 9,000-year-old community.</p>

          <p>India, home to 75% of the world's wild tigers, has seen its population of the endangered animal rise to over 3,600, according to the latest census. This conservation success is tempered by significant ongoing risks, primarily the fragmentation of tiger habitats due to deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects. These divisions isolate tiger populations, affecting their movement, breeding, and access to prey. While modern monitoring techniques have been adopted, conservationists warn that protecting the quality and connectivity of these habitats is crucial to securing the long-term survival of the species.</p>

The cubs were born to an 11-year-old mother, Terima, as part of a carefully managed European endangered species breeding program.
