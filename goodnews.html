        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate surged to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level since January 2023, driven by rising rice prices and other factors. The Bank of Japan is closely monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs while considering potential rate hikes. Rice prices have doubled over the past year, prompting the Prime Minister to pledge to lower them. Economists anticipate a potential easing of core inflation in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. The Japanese yen strengthened slightly against the U.S. dollar following the inflation data release. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass‚Äô public safety initiatives to prevent the layoff of 1,000 city workers. The budget reduces funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in fewer officers than since 1995, and scales back new hires for the Fire Department. Council members expressed concerns over cost-cutting efforts at public safety agencies, while others defended the budget for promoting equity and inclusivity. The council aims to find additional savings to potentially increase funding for LAPD recruitment later in the year.</p>
