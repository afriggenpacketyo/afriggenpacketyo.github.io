The deal, however, does not initially include any dolls modeled after the players, instead focusing on merchandise like t-shirts and hoodies. As part of the partnership, Barbie's parent company Mattel will donate £20,000 to the Rugby Football Union to increase girls' access to the sport. The collaboration comes as the Red Roses are favorites to win the upcoming Rugby World Cup on home soil.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to exit the stock market despite signs of "froth," such as the explosive gains of some recent IPOs and speculative companies. He argues that the current market is different from the dot-com bubble because there are enough rational, strong companies to balance out the irrational exuberance. Cramer pointed to substantive positive developments at companies like Amazon, which recently launched a disruptive same-day fresh food delivery service, and Eli Lilly as examples of legitimate market strength. He suggests that while some speculative rallies exist, they shouldn't deter investment in fundamentally sound businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford is undertaking a major overhaul of its manufacturing process to compete with the growing threat of affordable, high-tech electric vehicles from China. The company announced plans to produce a new $30,000 electric pickup truck by 2027, built on a redesigned assembly line that uses 20% fewer parts and a more efficient "assembly tree" system. This strategic shift, led by former Tesla and Apple engineers, is an admission that its current method of adapting gas-powered models for EVs is too costly and inefficient. Ford's CEO views this competition with Chinese automakers as an existential challenge for the company's future.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has agreed to a club-record deal worth up to £42.5 million to sign forward Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth. The 23-year-old Burkina Faso international is scheduled for a medical in London after expressing a desire to leave his current club, where he felt he did not have a prominent role. Ouattara had a productive season last year, scoring nine goals in 37 appearances for Bournemouth. The move comes after Brentford had a previous £35 million bid for another winger, Omari Hutchinson, rejected by Ipswich earlier in the transfer window.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration directives aimed at eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions with DEI initiatives. Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, determined that the department's memos constituted a major policy shift that required proper procedure, rejecting the government's claim that they were simple reminders against discrimination. This decision marks a significant victory for educational and civil rights groups challenging the administration's broad anti-DEI campaign.</p>

          <p>While the consumer launch of OpenAI's GPT-5 model was met with criticism, it is rapidly gaining adoption in the more lucrative enterprise sector. Companies are reportedly choosing GPT-5 for its lower cost, faster performance, and improved capabilities in complex tasks like coding and logical reasoning, challenging rival Anthropic's dominance in this space. Enterprise customers like Box have praised the model as a "breakthrough" for its advanced reasoning on complex documents. This strategic pivot highlights OpenAI's focus on building a sustainable business by securing high-value corporate clients, even as it continues to navigate the expensive economics of AI development.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has withdrawn its effort to use expedited removal proceedings against Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul, a Guatemalan woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years. Her lawyers filed a lawsuit arguing the attempt was illegal, as expedited removal is legally restricted to immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years. After a judge temporarily paused the deportation, the government agreed to move her to regular proceedings, where she will have the right to a court hearing. The case highlighted concerns that the administration is testing new policies to speed up deportations.</p>

The King and Queen, along with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, will attend a remembrance service at the National Memorial Arboretum.

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares worth approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter. The investment is notable given that the health insurer's stock has been down nearly 50% this year amid a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook. The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in troubled but fundamentally strong companies. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's shares rose 6% in extended trading, as the investment is seen as a significant vote of confidence in the beleaguered company's future.

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge since its 2020 public listing, with its stock growing over 1,700% and its market valuation exceeding $430 billion. A significant portion of this growth is fueled by large government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. While its U.S. commercial revenue is also growing rapidly, the company's valuation is exceptionally high compared to its peers, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio surpassing 280. This indicates that investors are paying a substantial premium based on high expectations for its future in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Louis Rees-Zammit, the 24-year-old Welsh rugby star, is returning to the sport after signing with the Bristol Bears. In January 2024, he announced a surprising move to American football, joining the NFL's international player pathway program and signing with the Kansas City Chiefs and later the Jacksonville Jaguars. After failing to secure a breakthrough in the NFL, the winger has opted to return to rugby union. Rees-Zammit is a world-class player with 14 tries in 32 appearances for Wales, and his return is seen as a major acquisition for the Premiership club.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that while retirees can own multiple annuities, the strategy requires careful planning to be effective. Using different types of annuities, such as fixed and variable, can help balance guaranteed income with growth potential and diversify risk across different insurance companies. However, this approach increases complexity, fees, and paperwork. Key considerations include coordinating liquidity by staggering surrender periods, managing different contract terms, and navigating nuanced tax implications for each annuity. The strategy is generally best suited for those with substantial assets who can manage the added complexity to achieve specific retirement goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have released new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending more aggressive and earlier intervention. Under the new advice, individuals with systolic blood pressure in the 130-139 range should first be treated with lifestyle changes, followed by medication if levels do not decrease. A significant change from previous recommendations is the suggestion to abstain from alcohol entirely, citing growing evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure. The guidelines also place a greater emphasis on lowering blood pressure to reduce the risk of dementia.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and HELOCs have seen another minor decrease, continuing a recent downward trend. This week, the median rate for a HELOC fell to 8.12%, while the average home equity loan rate dropped to 8.23%, making them attractive options for homeowners looking to borrow. With home equity levels at a record high, many are considering applying now. However, potential borrowers of fixed-rate home equity loans may want to weigh whether waiting for anticipated future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could secure them a better long-term rate, while HELOC borrowers would see rates adjust automatically.
