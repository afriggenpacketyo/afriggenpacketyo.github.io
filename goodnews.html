          <p>The Philippines held midterm elections which are largely viewed as a proxy battle between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte, former allies now feuding over political and economic agendas. The election results will determine over 18,000 positions, including seats in the House of Representatives and key senate seats crucial for a potential impeachment trial against Duterte. Security was tightened across the country due to the history of election-related violence, with police and military deployed to protect polling stations. Former President Rodrigo Duterte, detained by the ICC in The Hague, is still on the ballot for mayor in his hometown, highlighting the complex political landscape in the Philippines.</p>

          <p>BBC News reports that UK immigration has consistently exceeded emigration for the past 30 years, marking a significant demographic shift. Despite political promises to reduce net migration to the levels of the 1990s, numbers have remained historically high, becoming a key issue in the 2016 EU referendum. Brexit aimed to grant the government more control over immigration, but net migration figures surged, highlighting the challenges in managing immigration policies. Recent data suggests a potential fall in net migration for 2024 due to a decline in visas granted, but the overall trend remains a subject of intense political debate.</p>

          <p>The BBC reports that the United States and China have indicated that they made substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation in their trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as productive, while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the talks were in-depth and candid. These meetings were the first formal negotiations since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese goods, leading to retaliatory levies from Beijing. Experts suggest the announcement may include tariff cuts, though some remain cautious about the extent of the agreement, as the trade war has caused turmoil in financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.</p>

          <p>The BBC reports that the White House is in discussions with Qatar about the possible transfer of a luxury jumbo jet for use as Air Force One. Qatar has offered the plane for temporary use and at no cost, but White House officials emphasize that any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. Critics are sure to raise legal and ethical questions. The potential transfer comes as President Trump is set to visit Qatar as part of his first major foreign trip of his second term, and as the delivery of new planes from Boeing is delayed.</p>

The recall was initiated after a routine inspection revealed listeria monocytogenes on a piece of equipment, which was linked to an outbreak from 2024.
