          <p>Zijin Gold International, the offshore unit of China's largest miner Zijin Mining Group, is poised for a US$3 billion initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong. The company claims to be the world's fastest-growing gold producer, having achieved an average annual gold output growth of 21.4% between 2022 and 2024, becoming the 11th largest producer last year. With 26.1 million ounces of reserves, the Hong Kong-based entity, established in 2007, expanded its operations through global acquisitions across several continents. The upcoming IPO, expected to launch by Friday, could be the city's second-biggest sale this year, valuing Zijin Gold at US$30 billion.</p>

          <p>Central Asia is experiencing a notable surge in Chinese tourism, as visitors are increasingly drawn to the region's rich culture and historical significance along the ancient Silk Road. This growing interest is significantly bolstered by China's Belt and Road Initiative, which actively revitalizes economic and cultural ties across the five Central Asian republics: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Chinese executive Lillian Zhu's decision to book a 15-day tour after an exhibition exemplifies this trend, reflecting a desire to explore the "crossroads of civilizations." This development underscores the initiative's success in fostering renewed engagement and cultural exchange between East and West.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 54th home run of the season, tying Mickey Mantle's 1961 record for most home runs by a switch hitter in a single MLB season. This achievement contributed to the Mariners' 11-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels, propelling them into sole possession of first place in the American League West. Raleigh, who remains focused on the team's playoff aspirations, expressed humility about the personal milestone. His manager, Dan Wilson, praised Raleigh's offensive and defensive contributions, highlighting his dedication to winning as the primary driver behind his remarkable accomplishments.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, citing his shared commitment to a safe, affordable, and opportunity-rich New York City. Despite past disagreements, Hochul expressed confidence in Mamdani's courage and urgency, particularly in confronting Donald Trump's agenda. The endorsement from the moderate governor is significant for Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has recently softened some past stances, including apologizing for calling the NYPD "racist." This move aims to unify the Democratic party ahead of the election, where Mamdani faces incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, both running as independents.</p>

While supported by community leaders, law enforcement groups like the California Statewide Law Enforcement Association oppose it, citing officer safety and operational realities.

          <p>Brain fog, characterized by difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common cognitive symptom rather than a medical condition, often triggered by stress or busyness. Medical expert Dr. Tharaka offers four practical tips, encapsulated in a special acronym, to help individuals cut through this mental haze. The article emphasizes that brain fog is usually temporary and not a sign of personal failing, encouraging self-compassion and delegation. It also advises scheduling short "firebreaks" between activities to allow the brain to reset and process information, thereby reducing stress and improving focus.</p>
