          <p>Tim Friede, who has been bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, has developed a unique immunity that may hold the key to creating a universal antivenom. The World Health Organization estimates that millions of people are bitten by venomous snakes annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Researchers studying Friede's blood aim to synthesize a treatment effective against multiple types of venomous snake bites. Current antivenoms are produced by injecting animals with small amounts of specific venoms to generate antibodies, but a universal antivenom could provide a more accessible and effective solution for snakebite victims worldwide.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, has sparked varied reactions, particularly from Maga Catholics who view him with skepticism due to his perceived progressive leanings. Pope Leo's choice of name signals a confrontation with Trumpian nationalism, reminiscent of Leo XIII's challenge to laissez-faire economics and early communist movements. The new pope's agenda includes addressing wars, climate change, inequality, and migration, issues that clash with the Maga worldview's nationalistic and insular approach. While Maga Catholics share concerns about the neglect of working-class interests, their right-wing populism diverges from the Catholic commitment to universality and compassion for the stranger.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer in an effort to encourage residents to use air conditioning and stay cool amid increasingly extreme heat. The supplementary budget bill, allocating 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) for the initiative, will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly in June. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stated that the measure aims to protect residents' lives and daily living in the face of declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit, saving approximately 5,000 yen on their water bills over the four months.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing criticism for stating that he had never bought rice because his supporters gifted it to him, a remark that resonated poorly with the public facing soaring rice prices. The comment exacerbated public frustration over the government's handling of the rice shortage, which has driven up prices despite the release of emergency stockpiles. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular former environment minister, as Eto's replacement to mitigate the political fallout. The resignation underscores the political sensitivity of food prices and the importance of addressing consumer concerns in Japan.</p>

The G7 finance leaders aim to maintain stability despite trade tensions, while Japan plans to offer fast-track entry for South Koreans in June to mark the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties.

Kashiwara expressed concerns about Japan's university entrance exams and the perception of math as a memorization subject, potentially discouraging students from pursuing careers in the field.</p>

          <p>A blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease will be available in the US from late June following regulatory clearance. The test, developed by Fujirebio Holdings, detects amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brain and is a hallmark of Alzheimer's. The test will initially be available at approximately 50 American research institutes and hospitals specializing in Alzheimer's disease, costing significantly less than a PET scan. This new test is expected to improve access to diagnosis and treatment for the millions of Americans affected by Alzheimer's disease.</p>
