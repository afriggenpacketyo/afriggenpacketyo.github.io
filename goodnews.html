          <p>Negotiating teams from the U.S. and China concluded two days of trade talks in Switzerland, reporting "substantial progress" amid ongoing economic tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng both highlighted the positive atmosphere and the creation of a new consultation mechanism. While sources of friction remain, both sides emphasized the importance of resolving differences through dialogue. Investors are likely to react positively to this development, although businesses are awaiting further details before making any decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy found that Mounjaro is more effective, leading to a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% over 72 weeks. The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer Eli Lilly, involved 750 obese individuals and showed that 32% of people lost a quarter of their body weight on Mounjaro compared to 16% on Wegovy. Researchers suggest both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may be more suitable for those needing to lose more weight. In the UK, Mounjaro sales privately are now well ahead of Wegovy, suggesting that this paper will accelerate that trend.</p>

          <h2>Japan PM Cautious on Consumption Tax Cut for Inflation Relief</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 20:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed caution regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to combat inflation, citing concerns about the impact on state coffers. This stance comes as his administration considers an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election. Senior officials have been dismissive of cutting the consumption tax, which is currently at 8 percent for food and beverages and 10 percent for other items. The government is looking for other ways to provide economic relief to its citizens.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in October 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that strained bilateral relations. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea. The statue is expected to be stored at a museum following a ceremony at the temple. The return follows a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership after a legal battle with a South Korean temple that claimed the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago.</p>
