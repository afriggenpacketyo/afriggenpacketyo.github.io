          <p>Digital physical therapy company Hinge Health saw its stock increase by 6% after releasing its first quarterly report since going public in May. The company reported second-quarter revenue of $139 million, significantly exceeding the $125 million expected by analysts and marking a 55% increase from the previous year. While Hinge posted a substantial net loss due to stock-based compensation expenses, its strong revenue growth and optimistic forecast for the upcoming quarter and full year were well-received by investors. The company focuses on using software and hardware for remote musculoskeletal care.</p>

          <p>An industrial accident at a cement plant in the small Northern California city of Yreka created a large dust cloud, leading officials to issue a temporary shelter-in-place order for residents. The Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office advised people to stay indoors and turn off air conditioning units as a precaution due to potentially hazardous airborne cement particles. The order was lifted in less than an hour after the cloud dissipated. Officials stated the alert was issued out of an abundance of caution and that any settled particles were safe to wash away.</p>

          <p>Prediction markets have identified Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh as front-runners to become the next Federal Reserve chair following comments from President Donald Trump. In a recent interview, Trump spoke highly of both men, causing their odds on the Kalshi prediction market to rise to 35% each. Hassett and Warsh have both advocated for lower interest rates, a stance favored by Trump, who has frequently criticized current Chair Jerome Powell. The speculation comes as a vacancy on the Fed's Board of Governors opens, allowing Trump to appoint a new member who could later be elevated to chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Compares Interest Earnings of a $10,000 Deposit in a 3-Month CD vs. a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 16:15:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings for a $10,000 deposit in either a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. With current rates, a high-yield savings account at 4.30% APY would narrowly outperform a 3-month CD at 4.25% APY over the same period, though the difference is minimal. The key distinction is that the CD rate is fixed and guaranteed, whereas the savings account rate is variable and could fall if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as anticipated. Savers must weigh the guaranteed return of a CD against the flexibility of a savings account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles started their title defense in The Hundred cricket tournament with a decisive six-wicket victory over the London Spirit at Lord's. The Spirit, after choosing to bat first, were bowled out for just 80 runs, the second-lowest men's team score in the competition's history. Invincibles' bowler Rashid Khan was instrumental, taking three wickets for 11 runs, while teammate Sam Curran also claimed three wickets.

          <p>This article advises homeowners considering a $100,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to ask critical questions before borrowing. With HELOC interest rates being variable, homeowners should assess the likelihood and impact of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which may not significantly lower payments in the short term. It also suggests comparing a HELOC with a fixed-rate home equity loan, as their average rates are currently similar. The choice depends on whether a borrower prefers the flexibility of a credit line or the stability of a fixed-rate lump sum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, has become a notable incubator for chief executives across the restaurant industry. Many current leaders at rival chains, including the CEOs of Starbucks, Brinker International, and Cracker Barrel, have roots at Yum. The company's success in developing top talent is attributed to its massive global footprint, a strong focus on leadership development, and a 'people first' culture established by past CEOs. The intense internal competition for top roles often leads high-performing executives to seek CEO positions at other companies.</p>

          <p>In one of the country's largest wildlife trafficking seizures in recent years, Nigerian customs officials have intercepted a shipment of over 1,600 exotic birds at Lagos international airport. The protected species, including ring-necked parakeets and canaries, were being transported to Kuwait without the required permits under the CITES convention. Conservation groups have praised the seizure as a positive step in combating illegal wildlife trade in Nigeria, a known hub for trafficking. The birds are set to be rehabilitated and released, while an investigation is underway to find those responsible.</p>
