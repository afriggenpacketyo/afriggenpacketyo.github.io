          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence by stating that it retains authority over personnel decisions, seemingly rejecting President Trump's attempt to fire National Portrait Gallery Director Kim Sajet. The institution emphasized that its secretary, Lonnie G. Bunch, has the support of the Board of Regents in his management of the Smithsonian. This announcement follows a White House proposal to reduce the Smithsonian's funding and an executive order demanding an end to federal funding for exhibitions based on racial themes. The Smithsonian's statement underscored its commitment to being a nonpartisan institution and a welcoming place for all Americans, free from political influence.</p>

          <p>Top officials from the United States and China are engaged in a second day of negotiations in London, aiming to de-escalate trade and technology tensions that have impacted the global economy. No official statements were released after the initial round of talks, but both sides have signaled their expectations for potential agreements. The U.S. is seeking eased export controls and the restoration of critical mineral flows from China. President Trump has reportedly authorized his delegation to negotiate away restrictions on advanced technology sales to China, including jet engines and chip design software.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies founder Ren Zhengfei stated that the company's Ascend chips still lag behind those from the U.S. by a generation, but state-of-the-art performance can be achieved through tactics like stacking and clustering. Ren's comments, made in an interview with People's Daily, highlight China's advantages in developing AI, including a large youth population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. He noted that China's power generation and communication networks are well-developed and that open-source software will meet societal needs. Ren's remarks come as Washington increases restrictions on China, with the U.S. Department of Commerce indicating that using Ascend chips anywhere could violate export controls.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to curb elevated prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the move, which will leave the country with a rice reserve of 100,000 tons. The released rice will be directed to smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers. Rice prices have doubled compared to last year, prompting the government to take this rare step of sales through direct contracts to bring down overall prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The Treasury stated that Sizewell C will create 10,000 direct jobs and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment is necessary for a "golden age of clean energy." However, critics like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C argue that ministers have not been transparent about the project's cost, given incomplete negotiations with private investors.</p>

          <p>A group of cross-party MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world" with "fundamental flaws," stating that paternity leave rules "entrench outdated gender stereotypes." The report calls for "bold" action, including increased paternity pay and leave, though it warns that any changes would require significant investment. The current system allows new fathers to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks, highlighting that other countries offer more generous parental leave benefits.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up marking and write letters home to parents. Training materials say teachers can use AI to "help automate routine tasks" and focus on "quality face-to-face time." The Department for Education emphasizes transparency and the need for teachers to check AI-generated results. The guidance specifies that AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking and writing routine letters, while teachers must ensure the accuracy of the information.</p>
