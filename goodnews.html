          <p>Director Emerald Fennell discussed her highly anticipated new film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights," aiming to capture the "primal, sexual" essence she felt when first reading the novel as a teenager. Starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, the film promises a heightened and highly stylized gothic approach, as hinted by its provocative trailer. Fennell, an Oscar-winner known for "Promising Young Woman" and "Saltburn," expressed a profound personal connection to Brontë's complex and devastating romance. Despite taking some creative liberties, she has diligently retained much of Brontë's original dialogue, with the film slated for release on Valentine's Day next year.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI startup DeepSeek and tech giant Huawei are leading China's push for technological self-sufficiency, aiming to break reliance on U.S. chips amidst ongoing trade restrictions. DeepSeek's recent shift towards supporting domestically produced chips and Huawei's unveiling of its advanced Ascend chip series demonstrate a significant surge in innovation within China's AI industry. Beijing is actively encouraging its tech giants to cease purchasing Nvidia's China-tailored chips, viewing U.S. trade curbs as a catalyst for domestic growth. This strategic endeavor seeks to bolster China's position in the global tech rivalry with Washington, with Huawei playing a pivotal national champion role.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking new gene therapy for Huntington's disease has demonstrated significant promise, reportedly slowing its progression by 75%, offering immense hope for countless patients and their families. Gemma Botting, whose husband Matt has Huntington's, described the news as "like winning the lottery 10 times over," transforming their outlook from despair to profound optimism. While the therapy, involving complex brain surgery, is still in early stages and years from potential NHS approval, it represents a monumental breakthrough for a previously untreatable, devastating neurodegenerative disease.

          <p>King Charles's urban planning philosophies, once controversial, are now significantly influencing the design of England's upcoming wave of new towns, expected to be announced soon. These 12 new towns will prioritize walkability, environmental friendliness, and "gentle density" through designs like terraced housing, echoing the King's traditional town-building approach seen in Poundbury and Nansledan. Experts like TV architect George Clarke note a shift in mainstream architectural thinking, with a greater emphasis on fostering community, creating public spaces, and promoting sustainable, high-quality design. This initiative aims to deliver 1.5 million new homes that genuinely cultivate thriving communities.</p>

          <p>Oberlin High School in Ohio has launched "Men's Work," a program led by Johnny Cole and David Reese, offering teen boys a unique and safe space to openly discuss their struggles and critically examine "manosphere" messaging. This initiative addresses findings that fewer teen boys are comfortable discussing mental health and many feel pressure to be physically strong, as highlighted by a Pew Research Center survey. Students appreciate the opportunity to challenge online influences, such as the promotion of steroid use. The program aims to provide a "more loving way to move forward" for boys navigating complex emotions and societal expectations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records concerning Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, a mystery that has captivated millions for decades. While her crash due to fuel exhaustion is widely accepted, various theories persist, including one suggesting she was captured by the Japanese on a spy mission. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands pushed for declassification, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of her presence on Saipan. However, previous FBI reviews of Navy files dismissed spy mission theories, and experts largely consider the capture theory "nonsense," favoring a simpler explanation of a crash.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Comic Con is launching the Stan Lee Experience, an AI-powered holographic avatar of the late comic book legend, allowing fans to interact and ask questions. Developed by Proto Inc. and Hyperreal, the avatar is fed decades of Lee's content, including his "Soapbox" writings, with "guardrails" to keep responses within the "Stan Lee Universe." This technology, described as an "avatar presence" rather than a true hologram, is seen as a way to maintain and expand Lee's legacy for new generations of fans. Proto Inc. founder David Nussbaum envisions broader applications for the technology, including medical consultations.</p>
