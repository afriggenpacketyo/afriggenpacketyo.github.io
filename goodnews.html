          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 08:04:07 EDT</div>

          <p>Kohl's shares experienced a significant surge, climbing over 20% after the retailer announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's projections. Despite an overall decline in sales, the company's improved financial outlook included a narrowed full-year sales guidance and an adjusted earnings per share forecast, reflecting a cautious but positive trajectory. This performance is notable given recent leadership challenges and a history of slumping revenues, with the company having seen three CEOs in as many years. The retailer is actively pursuing a turnaround strategy, which involves expanding departments like petites and fine jewelry, focusing on exclusive merchandise, and enhancing promotions, alongside the successful integration of Sephora shops into all its locations, aiming to drive customer engagement and long-term growth and improve its market value.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a slowdown in sales growth for its namesake brand during the fiscal second quarter, with sales declining by 5% and comparable sales by 11%. Despite this, the company's overall performance was bolstered by a significant 19% surge in its Hollister brand, marking its best-ever second-quarter net sales growth. This strong showing enabled Abercrombie to narrowly exceed Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and earnings, prompting an upward revision of its full-year sales and earnings per share guidance. The retailer is actively pursuing strategies to stimulate growth, including expanding into new categories like dresses and athleisure, focusing on international expansion, and engaging in high-profile partnerships such as becoming the NFL's first "official fashion partner," aiming to remain relevant with consumers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. mortgage demand demonstrated minimal movement last week, with total application volume decreasing by a slight 0.5%, mirroring the stability in interest rates. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances edged up to 6.69%. Although applications to refinance a home loan fell by 4%, applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose by 2%, marking the strongest week for purchase demand in a month, albeit from a low baseline. An MBA economist suggested that prospective buyers are becoming less sensitive to current rates, encouraged by increasing inventory and moderating home-price growth in various regions. This article also briefly notes President Trump's firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and the potential for a successor to support more aggressive interest rate cuts.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As energy prices are set to rise again in October, increasing a typical household's annual bill by about £35, this article outlines four key strategies for consumers to manage costs. It advises considering fixed-rate energy deals, which are currently 15-17% cheaper than variable rates, but cautions to check for exit fees. Paying by direct debit is recommended for accessing better deals and ensuring accurate billing with smart meters. The article also highlights available financial support, such as the £150 Warm Home Discount for means-tested benefits recipients and hardship grants from suppliers, while warning against scams. Finally, it suggests practical energy-saving measures at home, like turning down flow rates on boilers, using efficient cooking methods, and washing clothes at lower temperatures.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the "Science of Siblings" series, delving into the unique inheritance practice of "chiro bash," or junior right, prevalent in Pakistan's mountainous Chitral district, where the youngest son inherits the family home. This tradition, which ensures parents receive care in their old age and maintains family roots in the village, contrasts sharply with the Western practice of primogeniture. While older siblings are often supported in establishing their own independent lives, the system can still generate family friction, with the youngest sometimes burdened or older siblings feeling overlooked. However, the article notes that cultural shifts, increasing educational opportunities, and the rising precedence of Shariah-based inheritance laws are gradually eroding the practice, indicating its uncertain future in modern times.</p>

          <p>Kenzi Madhoun, a 6-year-old girl from Gaza who lost her right arm in an Israeli air strike, is receiving complex reconstructive surgery in Beirut, Lebanon, through the Ghassan Abu-Sittah Children's Fund. Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a plastic surgeon specializing in conflict medicine, is leading her treatment, which includes a "distraction" procedure to lengthen her upper arm bone for a myoelectric prosthesis. Kenzi's story highlights the devastating impact of the Gaza war on children, with UNICEF estimating over 50,000 Palestinian children killed or injured. The fund, supported by NGOs and individuals, provides holistic care, including mental health and education, for children injured in the conflict, as Abu-Sittah continues his mission to heal one child at a time.</p>

          <p>Missouri GOP Rep. Mark Alford is notably embracing town halls, hosting 15 events over four days, a stark contrast to many Republican colleagues who are shying away from such public forums. Alford, a former broadcast journalist, views these sessions as essential listening opportunities to connect with constituents and refine his own beliefs, even amidst contentious discussions. He addresses a range of local and national issues, including the impact of President Trump's policies on solar energy funding and VA hospital services, and explains his vote on the "one big, beautiful bill" (H.R. 1). The article highlights Alford's strategy of deescalating anger by thanking attendees for their "passion," navigating complex political realities, and his cautious stance on deploying the National Guard to cities, all while facing the looming prospect of mid-decade redistricting.</p>

          <p>New York-listed shares of Canada Goose surged over 7.6% in premarket trading following reports that its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received bids to take the winter-clothing maker private. Boyu Capital and Advent International have reportedly made verbal offers, valuing Canada Goose at approximately $1.35 billion, which is eight times its 12-month average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Bain Capital, advised by Goldman Sachs, is currently awaiting more offers before making a decision. This potential deal highlights a significant shift for the company, whose valuation has dropped considerably from its 2018 peak of $7.7 billion, yet still represents substantial returns for Bain since acquiring control in 2013.

          <p>Grrlspot, a monthly pop-up event for queer women in New Orleans, emerged after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to rebuild community connections among lesbians who returned to the city. Founded by Jenna Jordan, the initiative grew from small meetups to large dance parties, filling a void left by the dwindling number of lesbian bars nationwide and the closure of New Orleans' last lesbian bar in 2012. The events, held at various venues, provide a safe and joyful space for queer and trans women, fostering camaraderie and celebration, especially during festivals like Southern Decadence. This article highlights how Grrlspot has become a vital avenue for community gathering and resilience in the face of post-disaster challenges and changing social landscapes.</p>

          <p>Argentine police have raided a villa in Mar del Plata, searching for "Portrait of a Lady" by Italian Baroque artist Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, a 17th-century painting believed to have been looted by Nazis. The artwork, originally owned by Dutch Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker, was reportedly seen in a real estate advertisement for a property linked to the descendants of Nazi fugitive Friedrich Kadgien, a financial aide to Hermann Göring who fled to Argentina after World War II. This investigation reopens a somber chapter in Argentina's history, which sheltered numerous Nazis and their plundered assets. The ongoing pursuit for restitution, decades after the war, underscores the persistent efforts to recover stolen cultural heritage and address historical injustices.</p>
