        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy reversal driven by a potential new Trump presidency and the war in Ukraine, Germany is planning to build the largest military in Europe. The government intends to amend its constitution and dedicate 3.5% of its GDP to defense, a move that will inject hundreds of billions into its armed forces without cutting social programs. This historic shift aims to meet NATO commitments and reflects a profound change in Germany's post-war identity, though transforming the nation's military culture is expected to take a generation.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the spirit of the LGBTQ+ Pride movement is rooted in diversity and progress, not in "respectability politics" that seeks to sideline more flamboyant or non-conforming members of the community. The author criticizes conservative figures who attempt to create internal wedges by suggesting what constitutes a "normal gay." Citing historical examples like the Stonewall Riots, the piece contends that the movement's strength has always come from its broad and inclusive coalition, which is what makes it worthy of celebration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant local political development, voters in traditionally conservative Huntington Beach, California, have overwhelmingly rejected two controversial ballot measures. These measures, backed by the city's MAGA-aligned council majority, would have created a parent review board to censor children's books and allowed for the privatization of the public library system. The result is being hailed by opponents as a powerful grassroots rebuke of extremist politics and an inspiring example of successful nonpartisan community organizing.</p>

The Wakayama zoo had a notably successful joint breeding program with China, having raised 17 cubs since 1994, making this event a significant moment in the history of panda conservation efforts in Japan.</p>

          <p>A chief economist at a major Chinese investment bank has argued that China's mature third-party payment platforms, such as WeChat and Alipay, provide the nation with a significant comparative advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins. The reasoning is that these platforms already function much like stablecoins, being pegged 1:1 to fiat currency and operating within a relatively mature regulatory framework. This analysis comes as Chinese state media urges policymakers to remain at the forefront of digital currency innovation. (not investment advice)</p>
