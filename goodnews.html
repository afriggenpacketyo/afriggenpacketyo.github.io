          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is primarily fueled by robust global demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips, with the high-performance computing division accounting for 60% of revenue. The company also provided a strong forecast for the upcoming quarter and the full year, projecting continued growth despite potential headwinds from U.S. tariff policies and global macroeconomic conditions. The positive results boosted TSMC's share price, reflecting investor confidence in the sustained AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Andre Correa do Lago, the diplomat leading the upcoming UN climate talks, acknowledges the difficulty of keeping climate change on the global agenda amid conflicts, trade wars, and political shifts. He emphasizes that despite these immediate crises, the threat of climate change continues to escalate, as evidenced by recent extreme weather events worldwide. The article explores the pressure on Brazil's presidency to advance the transition from fossil fuels, even as the country's own oil exploration policies face scrutiny. Correa do Lago remains optimistic that integrating climate action into economic policy can drive growth, a key objective for the next summit.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sweden's Volvo Cars surged over 10% after the company reported second-quarter operating profits that beat analyst forecasts, despite a sharp year-on-year drop. The automaker, owned by China's Geely, attributed the decline to a challenging industry environment and a one-off impairment charge. In response to U.S. tariffs, Volvo is shifting its U.S. strategy by adding production of its popular XC60 SUV to its South Carolina plant while discontinuing some sedans and wagons. The company's CEO affirmed its commitment to the U.S. market, emphasizing the need to better utilize its American factory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New US-China Trade Agreement Likely to Mirror Previous 'Phase One' Deal, Says Former Official</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 04:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential new trade deal between the United States and China is likely to be structured similarly to the 'phase one' agreement from Donald Trump's first term, according to former Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun. The core of such a deal would involve a substantial commitment from China to purchase American agricultural and industrial goods. The original 2020 agreement, which was only partially fulfilled, is being viewed as a 'road map' for the current negotiations led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Biegun noted that Chinese officials seem to recognize the need to make concessions to achieve a temporary balance in the trade relationship.</p>

          <p>After years of delays, Elon Musk's business interests in India are advancing, with Tesla opening its first showroom in Mumbai and Starlink receiving regulatory approval for commercial services. The article suggests this pivot is part of a broader global strategy for Musk, offering a new growth market as his relationships in the U.S. and China become more complex. While Tesla's initial entry targets the premium vehicle segment, Starlink aims to provide satellite internet to underserved rural areas. These moves signal growing investor confidence in India's long-term economic story, though challenges like charging infrastructure and service costs remain.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has put forward a proposal for a €2 trillion, seven-year budget for the European Union, featuring a significant fivefold increase in defense and space investment. The framework, which must be unanimously approved by member states, allocates €131 billion to a new European Competitiveness Fund to bolster these sectors. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the budget addresses 'the realities of today,' also dedicating 35% to climate projects and €100 billion in support for Ukraine. The proposal faces potential opposition, with some member states like the Netherlands already deeming it 'too high.' (not investment advice)</p>

His comments came after Nvidia confirmed it would resume sales of the H20 chip to China, reversing a previous ban. Huang argued that as technology progresses, it is sensible for the chips available to the Chinese market to improve over time as well. The company has been navigating complex U.S.-China trade tensions, and Huang has consistently advocated for access to the large Chinese AI market to avoid ceding ground to local competitors.</p>

As a patron of the Halo Trust, the prince met with families and children living near a minefield and observed lessons on how to avoid the unexploded ordnance. He emphasized that the remnants of war continue to threaten civilian lives daily in the country. This visit follows a similar one in 2019 and included a meeting with Angola's president to discuss renewed government support for the demining charity's work.</p>
