          <p>Rupert Lowe, formerly a Reform UK MP for Great Yarmouth, will not face criminal charges regarding allegations of threats made towards the party's chairman, Zia Yusuf, according to the Crown Prosecution Service. The CPS determined there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction after reviewing witness statements related to an incident at the Palace of Westminster in December 2024. Lowe, who now sits as an independent MP, accused Reform of a smear campaign and attacked Nigel Farage, the party's leader. The CPS emphasized its role is to assess whether charges are appropriate for a criminal court to consider.</p>

          <p>A court has ruled that the European Union should not have denied a New York Times journalist's request for text messages exchanged between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The case centered on the commission's argument that text messages are "short-lived" and do not contain important information. The court rejected this argument, stating that the commission must provide credible explanations for why the documents could not be found. The ruling is seen as a victory for transparency and accountability within the European Union, raising questions about public access to government negotiations.</p>

CEO Joshua Schulman's strategy includes cost-cutting across procurement and real estate, following ¬£40 million in measures announced in November, bringing the total estimated cost savings to ¬£100 million.

          <p>Research indicates that people often assume mothers are the primary caregivers, even when fathers are actively involved. Studies show school principals are more likely to call mothers than fathers, even when fathers indicate greater availability. This bias can disrupt mothers' work and create frustration for fathers seeking equal parenting roles. Outdated software systems in schools and doctors' offices also contribute to this issue, as they may prioritize mothers' contact information. This phenomenon highlights persistent societal expectations and the need for institutions to adapt to modern family dynamics.</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock criticizes Republican proposals to implement work requirements for Medicaid, arguing they would disproportionately harm hardworking individuals by adding bureaucratic hurdles. Warnock cites reports from Arkansas and Georgia as evidence of the disastrous effects of such policies, which he says do not incentivize work but rather kick people off healthcare. He argues that providing healthcare coverage encourages work and strengthens the economy. A Republican House budget resolution includes substantial Medicaid spending cuts, with work requirements among the eligibility policies under consideration.</p>

          <p>Co-op anticipates its shelves will be more fully stocked this weekend after switching its online ordering system back on following a cyber-attack. The attack caused payment problems, widespread shortages, and compromised customer and staff data. Cyber criminals infiltrated Co-op's IT networks, attempting to extort money from the grocery chain, which responded by shutting down some IT systems. Experts caution the cyber attack will have long-term effects on the Co-op, including reputational damage and increased caution from customers regarding personal information.</p>
