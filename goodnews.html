          <p>Luka Doncic has officially signed a contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, solidifying his role as the franchise's future cornerstone. The 26-year-old superstar, acquired in a trade from the Dallas Mavericks last season, announced the deal himself, expressing excitement to pursue championships in Los Angeles. While the exact terms were not disclosed, the signing ends speculation about his potential departure and signals the team's transition to a post-LeBron James era. In a related gesture, Doncic also pledged a $5 million donation to support 77 young athletes globally in pursuing their dreams.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, is establishing a new left-wing political party alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana but has yet to decide on a name. Rather than choosing a name themselves, they are inviting their reported 600,000 registered supporters to contribute ideas. This approach is part of a broader effort to define the new party's platform and values through grassroots involvement. The party cannot field candidates in elections until it officially registers a name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have officially committed to Luka Doncic as the face of their franchise by signing him to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. This move, celebrated with a major press event, firmly positions the 26-year-old as the team's centerpiece for the future. However, this strategic decision intensifies speculation about the role and future of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. The article explores the potential for an uneasy dynamic as James, long the focal point of any team he plays for, must now navigate a new era centered around a younger star.</p>

          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather was the catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who qualified as a physician in 1988, felt unsuited for the medical profession and recalled feeling emotionally overwhelmed when breaking bad news to patients. His stepfather's death at age 54 made him realize he did not want to spend his life in a job he wasn't passionate about. This pivotal moment set him on a new path in the early 1990s, leading to a successful career in entertainment.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a prominent advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has signaled it will be more cautious with its open-source approach in the future. This shift comes as Chinese companies are rapidly advancing in the field, with firms like Alibaba and Zhipu AI recently launching powerful new open-source models. Some experts, like computer scientist Andrew Ng, suggest that China's competitive and vibrant open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the US in AI development. This dynamic highlights a strategic divergence in AI development between the two tech superpowers.</p>

          <p>Staff at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado collected 780 pounds of trash and lost items during their annual mountain cleanup event. The effort, involving 150 employees, turned up a variety of unusual objects dropped from ski lifts, including an iPod Nano, a Canadian coin, and an inexplicable hamburger flipper. One of the strangest finds was a message in a bottle that turned out to contain an old COVID-19 vaccination card. The resort noted that while many items were trash, most of the weight came from larger objects that were recycled or upcycled.</p>

Her detention stemmed from a previously unknown 2018 deportation order issued after her mother, who had abandoned her as a teen, missed a court hearing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus named 'Winston,' a gift to UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill from Australia in 1943, died during its voyage. For decades, it was rumored the creature died from shell-shock caused by a nearby German U-boat attack. However, recent analysis of the platypus attendant's logbook by university researchers revealed the real cause was likely extreme heat. As the ship crossed the equator, recorded water and air temperatures soared well above the safe threshold for the species, essentially cooking the animal alive before it could reach England.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using theme parks as a tool to drive economic growth and boost consumer spending, with the recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort being a prime example. The country already has over 4,400 amusement facilities, a number projected to grow significantly in the coming years. According to industry associations, attractions like these have a substantial ripple effect on local economies, generating further revenue in surrounding sectors. This strategy is part of a broader effort by Beijing to stimulate domestic consumption and create new drivers for its economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start since returning from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his return was spoiled by two home runs from Tampa Bay's Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite Snell showing flashes of his Cy Young-winning form and not issuing any walks, the Dodgers' offense was shut out in a 4-0 loss. The outing was still seen as a promising step for the pitcher and the team's late-season rotation depth.</p>
