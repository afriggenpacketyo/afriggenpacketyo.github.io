          <p>Top European business leaders are encouraging Europe to capitalize on recent market volatility, expressing hopes that the era of U.S. economic exceptionalism is waning. They suggest that Europe can leverage this situation to its advantage, citing data showing increased capital inflows into European markets. Factors contributing to this shift include converging growth rates between the U.S. and Europe, cheaper capital, and lower valuations in Europe. However, trade tensions between the EU and the U.S. remain a concern, with potential trade deals proving difficult to finalize.</p>

          <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is reportedly considering a move for some of BP's liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets, adding fuel to speculation about a potential takeover of the energy major. ADNOC is thought to be weighing up a move for some of the London-listed firm's assets, should the oil major break up or seek to divest more units, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. BP has been underperforming relative to its peers, making it a target for potential suitors like Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron.
