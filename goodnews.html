          <p>A growing number of people with terminal illnesses are creating personal music playlists to provide comfort and connection during their final days, a practice with recognized therapeutic benefits. The article highlights the story of a former DJ curating the soundtrack of his life to help him and his family navigate his palliative care journey. Experts explain that music can access multiple brain regions simultaneously, reducing anxiety and creating shared experiences even when a person is unresponsive. This practice also offers a source of lasting comfort and connection for loved ones after a person has passed away.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region opened higher, following gains on Wall Street, as investors anticipated China's decision on its loan prime rates. The consensus, according to a Reuters poll, is that China will hold its key lending rates steady, a move that follows the central bank's decision to maintain another interest rate after the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent cut. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all saw early gains. The positive sentiment was buoyed by a strong week in U.S. markets, where the Dow and S&P 500 reached new record highs.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. The article outlines nine key practices, including talking openly about emotions, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than focusing on memorized phrases, these methods build a foundation of emotional safety and connection. Other crucial habits include teaching conflict resolution, validating a child's feelings, and listening more than lecturing, which helps children become emotionally intelligent and resilient adults.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has affirmed the government's commitment to reforming the welfare system to address rising costs and better support people returning to work. This comes after the government abandoned a controversial policy aimed at cutting disability and health-related benefits. McFadden stated that reform is essential, as the current system is creating an "unhealthy" binary between those deemed fit for work and those not. The government plans to offer voluntary skills and employment support to tens of thousands on sickness benefits, aiming to help them re-enter the workforce amid forecasts of the benefits bill reaching £100 billion by 2030.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Genetically Engineer Lyme-Immune Mice to Combat Disease Transmission</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:02:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the island of Nantucket, scientists are pioneering a project to combat Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local white-footed mouse population, the primary carriers of the bacteria. The goal of the "Mice Against Ticks" project is to introduce a gene that provides heritable immunity to Lyme, meaning offspring will also be born immune. By making the mice resistant, ticks that feed on them will not become infected, thereby breaking the transmission cycle to humans without harming the mice or their role in the ecosystem. The project, led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, is being developed in close consultation with the local community to ensure public buy-in before any potential release.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened its doors to an inaugural class of 92 students, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing ideological openness and the "fearless pursuit of truth." Founded by figures like historian Niall Ferguson and journalist Bari Weiss, the university aims to counteract what they see as a culture of self-censorship and lack of intellectual diversity on other campuses. UATX offers free tuition for now, funded by nearly $200 million from private donors, and emphasizes small, seminar-style classes based in Western civilization. Critics have labeled it a right-wing project, a charge its leadership denies, stating their goal is to remove politics as the university's operating system.</p>

          <p>The article explores the remarkable annual migration of monarch butterflies, focusing on the "super generation" that travels up to 3,000 miles from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. This unique generation lives up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, allowing them to complete the arduous journey. However, the monarch population has declined by 70% in the last 30 years due to threats like illegal logging in their wintering grounds and the eradication of milkweed plants in the U.S., which are essential for their caterpillars. Conservation efforts, including tagging butterflies and planting milkweed waystations, are underway to protect this iconic species and its mysterious, multi-generational pilgrimage.</p>

          <p>Apple has redesigned its custom silicon with the new A19 Pro chip, which features a significant architectural change to prioritize artificial intelligence workloads by adding neural accelerators to each GPU core. This development, along with a new custom wireless chip and modem, gives Apple control over all core processors in its latest iPhones, including the new iPhone Air. The move is seen as a strategy to enhance on-device AI capabilities, which Apple says improves efficiency, responsiveness, and user privacy. Analysts suggest this new architecture could bring MacBook Pro-level machine learning performance to the iPhone, positioning the device as a premier platform for AI developers.</p>

          <p>Dong Yu, a key figure in drafting several of China's five-year plans, explains that the core objective of these economic blueprints ultimately boils down to raising national income. As the executive vice-president of a development planning institute at Tsinghua University, he provides insight into the thinking behind the nation's strategic direction. He notes that while early plans focused on building a foundational economy from scratch, the documents have evolved since the reform and opening-up period. Dong Yu discusses the potential direction of the upcoming 15th five-year plan and the strategies required for China to maintain a path of sustainable economic progress and prosperity.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the stock market reveals how three growth stocks—Palantir Technologies, AppLovin, and Carvana—have generated massive returns since the beginning of 2023. These companies, which were unprofitable just a few years ago, have executed successful turnarounds driven by factors like the AI boom and strategic restructuring. A hypothetical combined investment of $21,000 ($7,000 in each) at the start of 2023 would now be worth over $1.1 million. While their performance has been explosive, the article notes that their current valuations are significantly inflated, posing potential risks for new investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that proved decisive in a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young made a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch with his foot to rob Brett Baty of extra bases after the ball was jarred from his glove at the wall. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab at the top of the fence to take away a potential game-tying home run from Francisco Álvarez. The loss was costly for the Mets, dropping them into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final National League wildcard spot.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has indicated he would support a potential deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that involves freezing North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an interim step. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described a production freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the long-term goal of complete denuclearization, given that Pyongyang is currently producing numerous new weapons annually. This pragmatic stance reflects a shift in policy aimed at reducing immediate tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Lee expressed hope that Trump and Kim could resume talks, citing a degree of mutual trust between the two leaders.</p>
