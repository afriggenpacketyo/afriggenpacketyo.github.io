        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly increased inflation, with recent consumer and producer price readings remaining benign. Several factors are keeping inflation in check, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff implementation, the time lag for tariffs to impact the economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economists believe the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months as pre-tariff stockpiles diminish and the tariffs are fully passed on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by LendingTree reveals that New Hampshire residents tip the most in the U.S., averaging 16.07% of their spending on food away from home. Tipping rates tend to be higher in states where people eat out more frequently, with the East Coast generally showing higher rates and the South and West showing lower rates. D.C. residents spend the most on dining out, averaging $10,291 in 2023, and dining out now represents 56% of Americans' food budgets. The study also notes the ongoing discussion about tipping in the service industry, with some proposals to eliminate federal taxes on tips.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson, the mastermind behind the Beach Boys, has died at age 82, leaving behind a legacy of meticulous sound design and collective feelings. His early work, like "Surfer Girl," demonstrated his singular control and veneration of collective emotions, and his album "Pet Sounds" is considered one of the greatest albums ever. Wilson's music explored themes of love, loss, and existential questions, and his struggles with mental health added a tragic resonance to his work. His influence on modern music is undeniable, with many musicians now embracing his approach to production and sound design.</p>

          <p>The dollar has fallen to its lowest level in more than three years, while the FTSE 100 reached a record high, driven by Donald Trump's trade threats and a weakening U.S. economy.

The FTSE 100's rally indicates a shift in global equity markets as investors diversify away from U.S. assets. Concerns about rising U.S. government debts and trade disputes are also contributing to the dollar's weakness. (not investment advice)</p>
