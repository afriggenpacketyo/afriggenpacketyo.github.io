          <p>Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, a prominent Venezuelan opposition leader, has publicly thanked US President Donald Trump for his efforts "around the world for peace." During a congratulatory phone call, Machado, honored for her unwavering struggle against President Nicolás Maduro Moros's regime, conveyed the Venezuelan people's appreciation for his commitment to peace, freedom, and democracy. This article highlights Trump's long-standing desire for the Nobel Prize and the White House's subsequent criticism of the committee. Machado views her award as a vital "injection" of energy for her political movement, believing international support, including actions to disrupt illicit financial flows, is crucial to weakening the current regime.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called upon President Trump to mediate a peace agreement in Ukraine, following what he characterized as a "productive" phone conversation. Zelenskyy expressed his conviction that if Trump could successfully halt a conflict in one region, he could similarly bring an end to the ongoing war with Russia, particularly in light of Trump's reported diplomatic success in the Middle East. During their discussion, the Ukrainian president updated Trump on Russia's recent assaults on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and acknowledged Trump's expressed willingness to bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities. This article underscores the notably improved relationship between the two leaders, with Trump now publicly supporting Ukraine's goal of reclaiming all its territory from Russia.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of five British army horses that bolted through the streets of London last year after being spooked by construction noise, has been granted a well-deserved retirement at The Horse Trust sanctuary. The 15-year-old black horse sustained a broken bone and serious bleeding during the April 2024 incident, which saw the horses collide with taxis and a tour bus, resulting in injuries to four pedestrians and five soldiers. This article reports that despite ongoing veterinary care, Quaker was deemed unable to return to active duties, and the decision was made prioritizing his welfare. The horses were integral members of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, primarily used for parades and other ceremonial responsibilities.</p>

          <p>SNP members have formally endorsed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to pursue a mandate for a second Scottish independence referendum, contingent on the party winning a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election. Swinney advocated for this approach as the most pragmatic route, drawing parallels to the precedent that facilitated the 2014 referendum. This article highlights that his proposal was favored over an amendment suggesting the 2026 ballot itself be treated as a de-facto independence vote based on the aggregate pro-independence party list votes. Despite firm opposition from UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Swinney reiterated his unwavering commitment to achieving independence for Scotland.</p>

          <p>Gen Z consumers are increasingly rejecting the concept of "fast furniture" in favor of secondhand and sustainable home decor options, motivated by growing environmental awareness and a desire for items with unique stories. This article highlights the alarming statistic that over 95% of the estimated 51 million tons of furniture consumed globally each year is discarded, largely due to cheap, mass-produced items not designed for longevity or recyclability. Young consumers, exemplified by Daniel Santos who restores antique pieces, are finding emotional connections with their furnishings, while social media trends indicate a significant surge in searches for "secondhand kitchens" and "secondhand decor." This cultural shift poses a direct challenge to the furniture industry's reliance on new, often unsustainable materials and rapid seasonal trends.</p>
