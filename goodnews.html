          <h2>Uber's Revenue Falls Short of Expectations Despite Rise in Trips</h2>

          <p>Uber reported its first-quarter earnings, surpassing expectations for earnings per share but falling short on revenue growth. Despite this, revenue at the ride-hailing company grew by 14% compared to the same period last year, and net income saw a significant increase. Uber anticipates gross bookings to increase in the current quarter and is pushing forward with autonomous vehicle technology, viewing it as a major opportunity. The company is also facing a lawsuit from the FTC over alleged deceptive billing practices related to its Uber One subscription service.</p>

          <p>Shares of Nvidia experienced a rise following a report that the Trump administration is considering revising chip trade restrictions known as the "AI diffusion" rule. The rule, proposed during the Biden administration, categorizes countries into tiers with varying restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration plans to rescind the rule, which was scheduled to take effect soon. Nvidia had no comment on the reported move.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to prevent the closure of the Community Relations Service, a civil rights-era office known as the "peacemakers program." This office, created as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, aims to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions and civil disorders. Democrats argue that the Community Relations Service combats violence and maintains safety, citing its work after high-profile attacks on places of worship. The Justice Department confirmed receipt of the letter but declined to comment further.</p>

          <p>Hilaria Baldwin addresses the controversy surrounding her Spanish accent in her new memoir, "Manual Not Included." Baldwin describes being ‚Äúcanceled‚Äù over claims that she was faking a Spanish accent, defending her speech as a result of "code-switching" common among bilingual speakers. She also attributes her fluctuating accent to medical conditions like ADHD and dyslexia. The memoir is her latest public endeavor since the accent accusations and her husband's involvement in a fatal on-set shooting.</p>

CEO George Kurtz stated that AI is "reshaping every industry" and flattening the company's hiring curve.
