          <p>Crescent Duck Farm, Long Island's last commercial duck farm, is rebuilding after losing its entire flock to the avian flu. The farm had to cull its entire flock after detecting the virus in January, contributing to soaring egg prices and commodity shortages. Doug Corwin, a fourth-generation farmer, is working to restore the farm to its 100,000-bird capacity and preserve the unique lineage of fowl that has allowed the farm to thrive. The farm received federal compensation for the euthanized ducks, but it wasn't nearly close to the market value of the birds, and Corwin hopes the government will require poultry operators to vaccinate their livestock against bird flu.

          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering" to lower their duty payments by altering the materials, dimensions, or compositions of their products. This legal practice allows finished products to fit into different "harmonized system codes" with lower tariff rates. For example, some manufacturers are bundling steel and aluminum elements into their products to qualify for lower duties under Section 232. There are over 5,000 different product classification codes that U.S. customs authorities use, providing ample opportunities for companies to strategically redesign their products.

          <p>Karen Read's acquittal in the murder of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, has ignited a frenzy, fueled by a strong TikTok following and multiple documentaries. The case is seen by some as a result of a flawed criminal justice system, while others, particularly women, identify with the accused. Unlike many facing murder charges, Read was able to post bail, granting her the opportunity to engage with the public narrative. Her case has garnered attention due to its blend of small-town cops, alleged cover-up, and the influence of social media. The score is 70.</p>
