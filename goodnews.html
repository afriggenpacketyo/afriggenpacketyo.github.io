        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "Stop Killing Games" initiative, a movement advocating for laws to ensure video games remain playable after developer support ends, has surpassed one million signatures, compelling the European Union to consider the issue. The petition was launched in response to Ubisoft delisting 'The Crew' and revoking player licenses after shutting down its servers. Despite this milestone, the movement faces challenges, including verifying signatures and confronting opposition from a European advocacy group representing major publishers like EA, Microsoft, and Nintendo. The group argues that maintaining private servers is not always viable and would make online-only games prohibitively expensive to create.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday morning. With maximum sustained winds decreasing to 35 mph, all tropical storm warnings for the Carolina coast have been discontinued. The system is now moving north, bringing scattered showers and thunderstorms inland across North and South Carolina. Flood watches remain in effect for some areas, as the storm is expected to produce 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches, raising concerns about potential flash flooding before it dissipates.</p>

          <p>A car crash in Herriman, Utah, led to a dramatic explosion that destroyed a Domino's Pizza restaurant. An SUV involved in a three-vehicle accident crashed into the building, rupturing a gas line. Two courageous bystanders pulled the driver and a passenger from the wrecked SUV just moments before it was engulfed in flames and the subsequent explosion occurred. No one was inside the restaurant at the time of the incident, and while multiple people from the crash were hospitalized, no injuries were reported from the blast itself. The explosion also caused significant damage to adjacent businesses.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris expressed his elation after winning his first home race at the British Grand Prix, calling the moment "pure joy, pure emotion." The victory, which he described as his best, narrows his championship deficit to leader Oscar Piastri to just eight points. Norris inherited the lead after his teammate Piastri received a penalty, but he celebrated the win enthusiastically in front of the home crowd at Silverstone. His celebration was briefly interrupted when a photographer's slip caused the trophy to hit his nose, resulting in a minor cut for the second time in a year.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the BRICS group of developing nations gathered in Rio de Janeiro, condemning President Trump's tariff policies and reaffirming their commitment to multilateral diplomacy. In his opening remarks, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva criticized the "unparalleled collapse of multilateralism" and accused NATO of fueling a global arms race. The summit is notably missing Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is wanted by the ICC and appeared via video.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to gastroenterologist Dr. Will Bulsiewicz, edamame is the best high-protein snack for promoting better gut health. The young soybeans are praised for being an inexpensive and delicious choice, with a single cup providing 18 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber for under 200 calories. This combination of protein and fiber helps increase satiety and stimulates the release of GLP-1, a natural hormone that aids in appetite control. Research suggests that minimally processed, high-fiber snacks like edamame are associated with better blood sugar control and can support weight management goals while nourishing beneficial gut bacteria.</p>
