          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has framed the upcoming summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin as a crucial test of Putin's seriousness in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking to ABC News, Rutte emphasized that the meeting will focus on security guarantees and Ukraine's sovereign right to determine its own future, a position he believes Trump supports. The NATO chief also acknowledged the reality of Russian-controlled territory, indicating that negotiations will need to address a path forward from a potential ceasefire and what that entails for Ukraine's long-term security.</p>

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 over five years to take a 13-month sabbatical in Taiwan with their young son, Forrest. Their primary motivation was to allow Forrest to bond with his paternal grandparents and for the family to experience a different lifestyle, free from a demanding work culture. During their time abroad, Jason focused on his mental and physical health, leading to a realization that their family could be happier with less income and more flexibility. The transformative journey also included the birth of their second child, solidifying their decision to prioritize family and well-being.</p>

Now 65, LeBrock enjoys a simple life caring for animals and her grandchildren, stating she feels more beautiful and confident now than she did during her youth.

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with more sophisticated tools, corporations are increasingly integrating autonomous AI agents into their cybersecurity defense systems. These AI "teammates" are designed to handle routine and time-consuming tasks like analyzing alerts and investigating potential threats, freeing up human analysts to focus on more complex issues and helping to mitigate worker burnout. While experts see this as an essential augmentation rather than a replacement for human workers, the adoption of AI agents is seen as a necessary step for defenders to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape created by AI-powered attacks.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Cam Little successfully made a 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a kick that would have shattered the current NFL record of 66 yards. However, because the kick occurred during a preseason game, it will not be officially recognized in the NFL record books. Despite this, the kick, which appeared to have enough distance to be good from nearly 75 yards, caused a massive celebration among his teammates. Little, a rookie, expressed a desire to replicate the feat during the regular season, while his teammates hailed him as a significant "weapon" for the team.</p>

          <h2>Expat Expert Names Albania as an Overlooked Destination for Americans Moving to Europe</h2>

          <p>Albania is emerging as a top, yet often overlooked, destination for Americans seeking to move abroad, according to an expert who helps women relocate to Europe. The country's appeal lies in its surprising affordability, with low costs for rent and healthcare, and its stunning natural beauty, from the Alps to the Ionian coast. A significant advantage is that Americans can live in Albania visa-free for up to a year, making it an ideal place to "test drive" life overseas. With a welcoming local culture and a growing expatriate community, Albania offers a high quality of life that is increasingly unattainable in the U.S.</p>

With nearly 500 private AI "unicorns" valued at a collective $2.7 trillion, the wealth creation is outpacing previous tech booms. This surge is heavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, which now has more billionaires than New York City and is seeing a revival in its high-end real estate market.

          <p>A schoolboy jogging on a beach in the Orkney Islands of Scotland discovered the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship following a storm. After the community rallied to preserve the 12-ton oak hull, researchers identified the vessel as the former HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy ship built in 1749. The ship had been deployed by the British during the American Revolution before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship named the Earl of Chatham. It ultimately sank in the North Sea in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving the wreck.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the University of Georgia have confirmed that a meteorite fragment that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than our planet. The object, a type of stony meteorite called a chondrite, created a fireball and a loud boom as it entered the atmosphere in June, with hundreds of sightings reported. This is the 27th meteorite recovered from Georgia, and researchers note that modern technology and an attentive public are increasing the frequency of such discoveries, which aid in understanding potential asteroid threats.</p>

          <p>Miami's historic Freedom Tower, which processed over half a million Cuban refugees in the 1960s and 70s, is set to reopen with a new exhibition focusing on the personal stories of those who passed through its doors. The exhibition, "Libertad," incorporates oral histories, including that of Jorge Malagón Márquez, who arrived as a traumatized five-year-old after soldiers in Havana destroyed his teddy bear. The refurbished landmark, owned by Miami-Dade College, aims to create an immersive experience that tells the story of seeking freedom and opportunity, preserving the human tales of survival, hope, and the challenges faced by the exiles who helped shape modern Miami.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley explores her life in the "middle place" of eating disorder recovery, a space between acute illness and a complete cure. Tarpley, who was diagnosed with anorexia at 13, argues against the perfectionist, all-or-nothing approach to recovery that she once pursued. Instead, she advocates for a more realistic mindset that normalizes and accepts occasional slips, allowing for forward momentum and a full life without the shame of not being "fully recovered." This perspective is particularly relevant as diet culture re-emerges, and many people with eating disorders find themselves in this long-term, imperfect state of recovery.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy move, the Trump administration has directed NASA to develop and place a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the moon by the end of the decade. This initiative is seen as essential for establishing a permanent human settlement on the lunar surface, as nuclear power would be necessary to sustain a base through the 14-day lunar nights. The push is also framed as a matter of national security, aiming to counter a joint Chinese-Russian plan for a more powerful lunar reactor. This renewed focus on the moon could enable a more accessible form of space exploration and grander scientific projects.</p>

Common themes include the need for a shared regional identity, wiser and more sustainable building practices, and addressing the severe housing and homelessness crises to make the city livable for all. Many contributors emphasize creating a more equitable city by fostering local leadership, empowering communities through art and culture, and reimagining government to be more responsive.
