          <p>Elon Musk has announced the end of his tenure as a Special Government Employee, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), established by President Trump to reduce wasteful spending. Musk expressed gratitude to Trump for the opportunity to restructure the federal government and believes DOGE's mission will continue to strengthen. The decision for Musk's departure was made at the "senior staff" level, and he did not have a conversation with the president before announcing his exit, according to a Reuters report citing a White House official. Musk is expected to return to his businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX, after his 130-day term expired around May 30.</p>

          <p>German tank parts manufacturer Renk is tapping into the struggling automotive sector for talent as it scales up operations amid rising geopolitical tensions and increased military spending. With Germany's historic fiscal package enabling higher defense spending, Renk is collaborating with the automotive industry, which faces challenges from a sluggish economy and competition from China and the U.S. Renk's CEO Alexander Sagel and COO Emmerich Schiller, both with automotive backgrounds, are capitalizing on this cross-industry collaboration by hiring engineers from the automotive sector. The company is looking for engineers who can adapt to the defense industry and bring in methods like continuous improvement to increase efficiency and quality.</p>

          <p>Consumers in Japan will be able to purchase rice released from government stockpiles for around $12 per 5 kilograms at smaller supermarkets by the second week of June, according to Japan's farm minister. The ministry is limiting potential buyers to small supermarkets and rice shops to ensure broad distribution after stopping orders from major retailers due to robust demand. In related news, Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested purchases of U.S. defense equipment may help reduce the trade deficit. Toyota reported a 10% increase in global sales in April ahead of the impact of higher U.S. tariffs, while Nissan is soliciting early retirements in the U.S. as part of turnaround efforts.</p>

Leaving behind a good salary, he aimed to prove his ability to be fast again.

          <p>Investors and analysts are scrutinizing Nippon Steel's $15 billion bid for U.S. Steel, questioning its near-term benefits despite potential long-term gains from strong U.S. demand. The merger would create the world's third-largest steel producer, but concerns linger over potential new share issuances to fund the takeover. Analysts also point to the high offer price and additional investment commitments as deterrents, especially given U.S. Steel's recent net loss. Strategic goals include expanding overseas amid weak domestic demand and potentially shutting down some blast furnaces in Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to a key component of his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal. If the White House is unsuccessful, businesses who paid tariffs will receive refunds with interest. (not investment advice)</p>

Avocado consumption has boomed in the U.S., with the amount of fruit available per person tripling between 2000 and 2021. The Hass Avocado Board's marketing efforts have also played a significant role in making the fruit ubiquitous. Farmers are replanting avocado trees with the belief that Americans' hunger for the fruit will continue to grow, making avocados a relatively successful crop in California.</p>
