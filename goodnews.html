          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO), planning to trade on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG." The company reported a 46% increase in revenue for the first quarter and has seen significant growth in high-value customers. The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory issues, resulting in a $1 billion fee paid to Figma. CEO Dylan Field stated the decision to go public is intended to allow the company's community to share in its ownership and to facilitate "big swings," including future acquisitions.</p>

          <p>The dating app Tinder is now requiring all its users in California to undergo a mandatory face verification process to enhance safety and combat fraud. The "Face Check" feature uses a short video selfie to confirm a user's identity against their profile photos and to detect duplicate or impersonated accounts. This move is part of a broader effort by parent company Match Group to build trust on its platforms amidst rising concerns over romance scams. The initiative comes as federal legislation, the Romance Scam Prevention Act, aims to increase accountability for dating apps.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has signed a four-year, $285 million super maximum contract extension, securing the highest annual salary in NBA history at $71.25 million per year. This article analyzes how his deal compares to other massive contracts across major American sports like MLB and the NFL. While MLB players like Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto have larger total contract values due to longer terms, top NBA players consistently earn higher average annual salaries. The report highlights the financial landscape of professional sports, where NBA contracts often lead in per-year earnings due to smaller roster sizes.</p>

          <p>Stocks for clean energy companies, including NextEra Energy and AES, saw a significant increase after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the major Republican spending bill. The tax, which targeted projects using components from foreign entities like China, would have added a substantial financial burden to the industry. While the removal was a relief for the sector, industry associations like SEIA cautioned that the overall bill is still detrimental to renewable energy, as it phases out key investment and production tax credits that have been crucial for the industry's growth in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After years of debate and planning, the FBI has announced it will relocate its headquarters to the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C. The move addresses long-standing structural issues at the current J. Edgar Hoover building.

This decision follows previous, abandoned plans under both the Trump and Biden administrations to move the headquarters to suburban Maryland or Virginia, making it a significant resolution to a nearly two-decade-long problem for the federal law enforcement agency.</p>

          <p>A startup named ZymoChem is tackling the environmental impact of disposable diapers by creating a biodegradable alternative to the fossil-based plastics they contain. The company uses a fermentation process, similar to brewing beer, to convert sugar from corn into a bio-based super absorbent polymer. This new material can be integrated into existing diaper manufacturing, offering a "drop-in" solution that is nearly cost-competitive with petroleum-based options. With investments from major firms and a partnership with Lululemon for bio-based nylon, ZymoChem's technology shows promise for reducing plastic waste in multiple industries.</p>

          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a deal to acquire British bank TSB from its current owner, Sabadell, for ¬£2.65 billion. If the deal is approved by shareholders, Santander intends to fully integrate TSB into its UK operations, which would likely mean the end of the TSB brand name on UK High Streets. The acquisition would create the third-largest bank in Britain by share of personal current accounts. While the companies state it is "business as usual for now," the deal is expected to lead to job cuts and branch closures due to overlapping operations.</p>

          <p>During a deployment in the Philippines that drew condemnation from China, U.S. Army soldiers made on-the-ground modifications to the new Mid-Range Capability (MRC) missile system, also known as Typhon. According to a Government Accountability Office report, soldiers provided direct feedback that led to design changes, such as moving access points to reduce reload times and stress on components. This instance of iterative, soldier-driven development highlights a modern approach to military innovation. The deployment of the versatile missile system, capable of firing Tomahawk missiles, was described by China as a grave threat to regional security.</p>

As the top-ranked British player, Draper carries the home nation's hopes, especially in the first Wimbledon since Andy Murray's retirement.
