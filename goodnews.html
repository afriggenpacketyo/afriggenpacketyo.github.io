          <h2>Block's First Quarter Earnings Miss Expectations, Company Cites Challenging Economic Outlook</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block's first-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street's expectations, leading to a 15% drop in the stock price during extended trading. The company reported adjusted earnings per share that may not be comparable to estimates and revenue of $5.77 billion, which was below the expected $6.2 billion. Block also provided weaker-than-expected profit guidance for the second quarter and full year, attributing this to a dynamic macro environment and caution due to President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. Despite these challenges, CFO Amrita Ahuja highlighted that Block delivered its most profitable quarter ever, reflecting business discipline and efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has acknowledged that it is considering overtures from the U.S. to begin trade negotiations, which could potentially lead to a resolution of the ongoing trade war. Senior U.S. officials have reportedly reached out multiple times, expressing a desire to start talks on tariffs. However, China insists that the U.S. must first demonstrate sincerity by removing all unilateral tariffs before negotiations can proceed. The trade war has seen both countries impose tariffs on each other's goods, impacting financial markets and global economic activity.</p>

          <p>Japan and the U.S. engaged in their second round of tariff talks, with discussions primarily centered on Japan's proposals to increase imports of American agricultural products. The Japanese delegation sought to gain further clarity on U.S. priorities and narrow the scope of the negotiations. Japan is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice and simplifying the screening process for imported cars. In return, Japan expected the Trump administration to eliminate auto and other tariffs it has imposed in recent months, rocking the global trading order and sparking fears of a significant economic slowdown.</p>

          <p>Governor Kathy Hochul of New York has proposed an increase in the film tax credit to keep the state competitive with New Jersey and other states. New York has spent more than $5.5 billion in incentives since 2017 to attract film and television productions. Each household in New York has contributed an average of $16 in taxes towards the production of "Billions" since 2017.

Hasbro aims to shift 40% of its global sourcing out of China by the end of 2026, with manufacturing moving to countries including the U.S., Turkey, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. While China will remain an important sourcing location, Hasbro expects to diversify production even in specialized categories over time.
