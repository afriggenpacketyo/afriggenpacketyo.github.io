        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles reported its busiest month in its 117-year history, processing over one million container units in July. This surge was driven by companies "front-loading" imports of Chinese goods to get ahead of anticipated tariff deadlines imposed by the Trump administration. While this created a short-term boom, industry experts note that the peak season started and slowed earlier than usual. The uncertainty around tariffs is particularly impacting retailers and importers of lower-cost items, leading to concerns about future trade volumes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, 45, is set to make a record-extending 25th appearance at the US Open after receiving a wildcard entry into the main singles draw. This will make her the oldest singles player to compete at the tournament since 1981. Williams returned to the sport in July after a 16-month absence, securing a WTA Tour victory in Washington. Her inclusion has sparked debate, but it provides the seven-time Grand Slam champion another opportunity to compete at her home major, where she is a two-time winner.</p>

          <p>European leaders from Germany, France, and the UK held a virtual meeting with President Trump to present a united front on the path to peace in Ukraine. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that any agreement must begin with a ceasefire and that legal recognition of Russian-occupied land is out of the question. The leaders emphasized that Ukraine must be supported with robust security guarantees. Trump reportedly suggested a potential trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy could follow if his initial summit in Alaska is successful.</p>

          <p>The odds of Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos becoming the next Federal Reserve chair have risen to 15% on the prediction market Kalshi. This shift in betting followed a CNBC report that Zervos is one of 11 candidates being considered by the Trump administration to succeed Jerome Powell. While Fed Governor Chris Waller remains the front-runner with 31% odds, the news has shuffled the perceived likelihood of other candidates, including former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, reflecting market speculation on who will lead U.S. monetary policy.

          <p>The grocery chain Wegmans has issued a recall for its brand of medium camembert cheese and several products containing it due to a potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

The new regulations require sites to implement stricter checks to prevent minors from accessing explicit material. The data also shows a corresponding rise in the use of VPNs, which can circumvent the checks.</p>

However, this analysis suggests that warehouse club Costco should not be significantly impacted by the move. The argument is that Costco's business model is fundamentally different, relying on in-person, bulk-purchase value rather than on delivery convenience. Amazon's push further solidifies the value of its Prime membership, continuing to disrupt the traditional grocery and retail landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
