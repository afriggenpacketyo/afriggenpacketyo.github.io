          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May increased by 2.4% annually, slightly below the anticipated 2.5%, indicating a cooler-than-expected rise in inflation. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.8%. The lower inflation rate is attributed to a sharp decline in gasoline prices, offsetting price increases in groceries and housing costs. Wall Street anticipates the Federal Reserve will maintain steady interest rates at its upcoming meeting, while economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on future inflation data.

          <p>Germany, like other European countries, is expanding its infrastructure to accommodate increased imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as it seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian gas.

Tusk called the vote to rally support for his coalition and reassert his authority, emphasizing his commitment to key reforms despite challenges.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers argue that generative AI models struggle to match human creativity because they lack the sensory and motor experiences that enrich human understanding. According to a new study, AI models are poor at representing concepts with sensory components, such as the smell or touch of a flower. This limitation stems from AI's lack of a body and organic human experience. Experts suggest that AI's creativity is "hollow and shallow" because it cannot replicate the depth of human sensory perception. </p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders is reiterating his concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and who will benefit from its rapid growth. Sanders emphasized that increased worker productivity from AI should benefit working people, not just wealthy stockholders on Wall Street. He cited predictions that AI could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs in the next five years. Sanders has previously warned that technology like AI should work for everyone, not just a few billionaires. </p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spacecraft has transmitted the first-ever images of the Sun's south pole back to Earth. These images will help scientists understand the Sun's cycle between raging storms and quiet periods. Understanding the sun's activity is crucial because intense solar activity can affect satellite communication and power grids on Earth. The new images show a shimmering bright atmosphere, with temperatures reaching a million degrees Celsius in some parts. </p>

          <h2>EU Assessing Whether Chinese Export Surge Requires Emergency Measures</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is evaluating whether a recent surge in Chinese exports could prompt emergency measures, following the implementation of high US tariffs on Chinese goods. Despite a significant drop in Chinese shipments to the US and a rise in exports to the EU, the European Commission says it is too early to conclude whether trade diversion is occurring. The EU is monitoring trade trends to determine if the increase in Chinese exports is causing harm to EU industries. Further analysis is needed to establish a clear trend and assess the potential impact. </p>
