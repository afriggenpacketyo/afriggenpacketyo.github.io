          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart is intensifying its global expansion, aiming to become a worldwide brand rather than just China's version of Disney. The company's CEO, Wang Ning, highlighted a strategy of incubating international artists using China's manufacturing capabilities and then promoting their creations globally. Propelled by the massive popularity of its Labubu dolls, Pop Mart's overseas revenue has surged dramatically. The company anticipates that its international sales will soon surpass domestic sales, with significant growth expected in North America.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a free trade agreement projected to boost their annual bilateral trade by over $34 billion in the long term. The deal significantly reduces or eliminates tariffs on a wide range of goods, including textiles, automobiles, and alcohol. Under the agreement, 99% of Indian goods will enter the UK tariff-free, while 92% of UK exports to India will see reduced duties. Leaders from both nations have praised the pact as a historic move that will enhance economic prosperity, lower consumer prices, and create jobs in both countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Examining Key Narratives and the Current State of the WNBA</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 04:00:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes several prevailing narratives surrounding the WNBA, particularly in the era of Caitlin Clark's rising stardom. It addresses the debate over her ranking in All-Star voting, concluding that while fan votes were high, player votes were more critical, reflecting her high turnover rate despite her impressive assist numbers. The article argues that the league is not overly dependent on Clark, citing its overall attendance growth and the rise of other young stars. It also dismisses the ideas that a lack of dunking holds the league back and that refereeing is uniquely substandard, pointing to the WNBA's strong fundamentals.</p>

          <h2>UK Retail Sales Rise in June, Driven by Warm Weather</h2>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.9% increase in June, a rebound attributed largely to a period of hot weather. According to the Office for National Statistics, the sunny conditions spurred consumer spending on fuel, supermarket drinks, and summer clothing. This rise followed a significant 2.8% drop in May, and while a rebound was expected, some economists found the increase to be smaller than anticipated. The data suggests that overall retail spending momentum has slowed, with only a 0.2% increase in the second quarter compared to the first three months of the year.</p>

          <p>As England prepares to face Spain in the Euro 2025 final, this analysis explores the key tactical battles that could decide the match. A central challenge for England will be exploiting Spain's high defensive line, a weakness Germany exposed in the semi-final. The performance of England's forwards, particularly Alessia Russo, in drawing pressure and creating space will be crucial. To counter Spain's formidable midfield, featuring stars like Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmati, England must stay compact and disrupt the supply to their key playmakers. The article suggests England may be more effective playing in transition rather than trying to dominate possession.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is visiting his golf resorts in Scotland, a trip that includes an informal meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to refine their recent trade agreement. While a baseline deal is in place, key elements remain unresolved, including the removal of a 25% U.S. tariff on UK steel and aluminum and disagreements over the UK's digital services tax. Analysts suggest these issues could be points of negotiation during the meeting. The visit is seen as an opportunity for the UK to solidify its trade relationship with the U.S. ahead of a looming August 1 deadline for a wider EU trade deal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest India is not fazed by the approaching August 1 deadline to secure a trade deal with the United States, after which U.S. tariffs are set to rise. India's confidence is partly rooted in its strategic importance to the U.S. as a counterbalance to China, creating a potential alternative for global manufacturing supply chains. Furthermore, India's recent trade agreement with the UK demonstrated its ability to protect sensitive sectors like agriculture, a key sticking point in U.S. negotiations. India's "multi-alignment" strategy of pursuing various trade deals gives it leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is scheduled to fight Reinier de Ridder in Abu Dhabi, nine months after suffering a severe jaw injury that saw his bottom teeth caved in. The unsettling injury occurred during a submission loss to Khamzat Chimaev, requiring surgery to remove several teeth and install implants. Whittaker says the new implants have improved his quality of life and that he is now motivated by setting an example for his children more than just regaining the title. His opponent is a former two-division champion in the ONE Championship promotion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The English Football Association's chief executive, Mark Bullingham, has stated there is "no need" to expand the powers of the video assistant referee (VAR) system in football. His comments come amid reports that the sport's law-making body, IFAB, might consider proposals to use VAR for decisions on corner kicks and second yellow cards. Bullingham argued that the current model already causes "enough interruptions to the game" and that the FA's position is that the system is in a "good place now." As a member of IFAB, the FA's opposition would be a significant factor in any potential rule change.</p>

          <p>In a UK first, individuals in Wales with conditions like celiac disease will receive pre-loaded debit cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system, launching later this year, offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining specific food items on prescription from a pharmacy. The card will be accepted at most retailers selling gluten-free products, aiming to "de-medicalise" the process and provide more choice. While advocates welcome the move, some participants from a pilot program noted that the provided funds only "scratch the surface" of the higher costs associated with a necessary gluten-free diet.</p>
