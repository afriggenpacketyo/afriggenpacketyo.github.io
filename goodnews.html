          <p>A new fitness trend, clear whey protein isolate, is gaining significant popularity as a lighter, juice-like alternative to traditional creamy protein shakes. This product, which turns water into a colorful, fruit-flavored beverage, appeals to consumers seeking high protein content without the heavy feel of typical supplements. While it offers benefits like being lower in fat, carbs, and lactose, experts note it is not inherently healthier than whey concentrate. Consumers should also be aware that clear protein often contains artificial flavorings and can be more expensive than its traditional counterparts.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter has released her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which explores themes of disappointment and frustration with men in her romantic life, despite her recent career success. The album follows her chart-topping "Short n’ Sweet" and continues her collaboration with producer Jack Antonoff, blending '70s-inspired pop with modern dance and country influences. The article reviews the album as a witty and sharp commentary on the social power dynamics of dating, even if it doesn't quite reach the consistent highs of its predecessor.</p>

          <p>Manchester United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory against Burnley thanks to a stoppage-time penalty, but the win failed to mask ongoing problems, particularly with their goalkeepers. Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir made a critical error that led to Burnley's second goal, continuing a pattern of costly mistakes from United's keepers this season. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledged the pressure on his goalkeepers but stressed that the entire team needs to improve. The recurring issue has fueled speculation that the club may sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer deadline closes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing debate, child development experts have established general guidelines for children's screen time, emphasizing that less is better, especially in early years. The consensus suggests no screen time for children under three, as this period is crucial for exploring the physical world and developing self-controlled attention. For preschool-aged children, a maximum of 30 minutes of supervised viewing is recommended to allow time for imaginative play, while elementary schoolers should be limited to 45-60 minutes. Parents are advised to focus on the quality of content and maintain open communication with their children about their digital activities.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish has experienced a remarkable resurgence since joining Everton on a season-long loan, quickly becoming a key player after being sidelined for much of last season at Manchester City. He delivered another man-of-the-match performance with two assists in Everton's 3-2 win at Wolves, marking consecutive games with multiple assists. His stellar form has reignited discussions about his place in the England national team, which he has been excluded from recently. Everton's manager David Moyes praised Grealish's immediate impact, attributing his success to the player's own mentality and desire to prove his quality.</p>

          <p>American tennis star Coco Gauff secured a confident 6-3, 6-1 victory over Magdalena Frech, advancing to the fourth round of the US Open for the fourth consecutive year. After two tense opening matches and recent struggles with her serve that led to a coaching change, Gauff appeared more settled and in control throughout the match. Her improved performance, particularly on her serve, sets up a highly anticipated fourth-round clash with two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka. Gauff expressed that she felt mentally lighter and that her game is moving in the right direction.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly for the first time since viral rumors of his death circulated on social media platforms. He was photographed at the White House preparing for a family golf outing in Virginia, effectively ending the online speculation. The rumors appeared to have been fueled by recent comments from Vice President J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in if a tragedy occurred, which raised concerns about the 79-year-old's health. The White House has recently addressed other health concerns, such as bruising on his hand.</p>

          <p>Health officials in New York City have officially declared an end to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem, as no new cases have been reported for three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths since it began. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, the mayor's office has proposed new regulations to enhance the detection and prevention of future outbreaks, including more frequent testing of cooling towers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three serious heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—within seconds. A UK-based study involving over 12,000 patients demonstrated that the AI tool significantly increased the detection rates of these conditions compared to traditional methods. The device analyzes subtle heartbeat sounds undetectable by the human ear and compares them to a vast patient database. This innovation could be a "game-changer" for early diagnosis in primary care, allowing patients to receive treatment sooner and potentially saving lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult film "The Toxic Avenger" stars Peter Dinklage as the monstrous hero forged from chemical waste. This updated version is described as a well-made and diverting homage that, unlike the Troma original, doesn't look intentionally cheap, featuring stars like Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood. The film maintains the original's rude, violent, and goofy tone while adding a more overt environmental message and a surprising amount of emotional sincerity. It satirizes corporate greed and superhero tropes, delivering a gruesome but accessible tribute to its low-budget predecessor.</p>
