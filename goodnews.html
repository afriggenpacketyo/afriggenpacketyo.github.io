          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June Amid Declining Rice Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 19:50:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, decreased to 3.3% in June, aligning with economists' expectations. This marks a cooling from a 29-month high, largely driven by an easing in the rapid rise of rice prices. Despite this, the "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy, edged slightly higher to 3.4%. The data comes as the Bank of Japan faces pressure to consider raising interest rates, although analysts believe a hike is unlikely until 2026, citing inflation expectations that remain below the central bank's 2% target.

          <p>A class-action lawsuit filed by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives has been settled. The lawsuit alleged that company leaders failed to disclose the risks associated with the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, leading to significant financial losses for the company, including a $5.1 billion FTC fine. Shareholders were seeking to have the executives personally reimburse Meta for these costs. The terms of the settlement, reached just before the second day of the trial, have not been publicly disclosed by either party.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the "Genius Act," a landmark bipartisan bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation, which now heads to the President's desk, aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules for the $250 billion market, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. This move is part of a broader push to support the cryptocurrency industry and is expected to encourage wider adoption of stablecoins for faster, lower-cost financial transactions.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has formally responded to accusations from the White House regarding the renovation of the Fed's headquarters. In his reply, Powell defended the project's oversight and refuted claims of luxurious amenities, directing critics to a new transparency page on the Fed's website. This exchange is part of a sustained pressure campaign from the Trump administration, which is frustrated with the Fed's independent stance on interest rates. Powell's calm, formal response contrasts with the confrontational tone of the White House's initial accusations.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the package due to concerns about a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports. After receiving guarantees from the EU regarding its future energy security and gas prices, Slovakia has agreed to approve the new measures. The sanctions, which require unanimous consent from all 27 member states, target Russia's energy and banking sectors to further isolate Moscow financially.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noticing mild swelling in his legs. A letter from the president's physician described the condition as "benign" and common, particularly in older adults. CVI is a circulatory issue where veins in the legs have difficulty sending blood back to the heart, which can cause swelling and varicose veins. The condition is typically managed with non-surgical treatments like compression stockings and lifestyle adjustments such as regular walking to improve circulation.</p>

          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's exports of rare earth compounds to China increased threefold, signaling a potential realignment of global supply chains for strategic minerals. This surge coincides with record-high Chinese imports of these materials, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing. Analysts suggest this trend reflects both China's efforts to diversify its sources and the ripple effects of U.S.-China trade tensions. As the two superpowers erect trade barriers, emerging economies like Brazil appear to be playing an increasingly important role in strategic resource trade.</p>
