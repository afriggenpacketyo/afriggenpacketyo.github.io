          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence expands rapidly, concerns about potentially harmful responses are growing. Researchers emphasize the need for more regulations and thorough testing of AI models to address issues like hate speech and copyright infringements. Red teaming, a practice involving individuals testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, is suggested as a way to evaluate risks. Experts advocate for standardized AI flaw reports and incentives to disseminate information on these flaws. Marrying user-centered practices with governance and policy is crucial for understanding the risks posed by AI tools and users.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of Turkish citizens obtaining German citizenship doubled in 2024, driven by factors such as career opportunities, political repression in Turkey, and Germany's citizenship reforms. Dual citizenship, allowed since June 2024, has become a major incentive for migrants. Germany's strong passport ranking and the desire to participate politically also contribute to the trend. Despite integration, many Turks maintain strong ties to their culture and continue to consider Turkey their home. Some also report experiencing discrimination in Germany, even after obtaining citizenship.</p>
