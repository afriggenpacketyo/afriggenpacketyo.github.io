        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Secretary announced that over a thousand inmates serving one to four year sentences, who were recalled for breaching their licenses, will be released after 28 days to alleviate overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales. The move aims to free up around 1,400 prison places and provide ministers with time to address systemic issues, although it excludes those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk. While a ¬£4.7bn investment will fund more prisons, officials warn that without this action, the government would run out of prison spaces by November. The interim permanent secretary of the Ministry of Justice noted that the number of recalled prisoners has significantly increased, contributing to the overcrowding crisis.</p>

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace secured a $96 billion agreement to sell Qatar Airways up to 210 aircraft during President Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The deal, for 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines, is Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order, expected to support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually. Trump highlighted the agreement as the largest order of jets in Boeing's history, potentially boosting the company's financial recovery. However, the deal may also increase scrutiny of Trump's acceptance of a luxury 747 jet from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release on bail of Georgetown scholar Dr. Badar Khan Suri, who had been detained by immigration authorities. The judge sided with the ACLU's argument that Suri was detained based on his protected First Amendment speech in support of Palestine and his wife's and father-in-law's associations. The judge concluded that Suri is not a flight risk and not a danger to the community, emphasizing that his continued detention would cause irreparable harm and a "chilling effect" on free speech. The government is prohibited from redetaining him without a 48-hour notice.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward on President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," a major budget package addressing defense, energy, and tax priorities. The Ways and Means Committee advanced its portion of the legislation after an 18-hour markup, but the state and local tax deduction cap remains a key sticking point. The Energy and Commerce Committee is tasked with finding $880 billion in cuts, implicating Medicaid, while the Agriculture Committee is working to find $230 billion in cuts, primarily impacting the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Senate Republicans have expressed concerns, prompting discussions about potential changes in the upper chamber.</p>

Reinstated personnel include those in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support, and the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory.

Salonen, who recently announced he would not renew his contract as music director of the San Francisco Symphony, has a history-making relationship with the L.A. Phil. The orchestra is currently without a music director, and many musicians and audience members would welcome Salonen back to guide the orchestra through a transition period. However, it remains to be seen whether Salonen would accept such an offer, as he has expressed a desire for a reprieve from institutional demands.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Australia have found that Barbie's foot posture has changed over time, correlating with her designated career or hobby. The study examined 2,750 dolls produced from 1959 to 2024 and found that early Barbies had arched feet, while more recent "employed" dolls are more likely to have flat feet. The researchers suggest that Barbie's empowerment is tied to the structure of her feet, reflecting societal shifts in women's roles. Mattel confirmed that foot design was a deliberate part of Barbie's evolution to support her "bold steps forward."</p>

          <p>U.S. drug overdose deaths fell by an estimated 27% in 2024, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded, with 30,000 fewer deaths than the previous year. Experts attribute the reduction to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, and shifts in drug use patterns. While annual overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, the decline offers optimism, though concerns remain about potential reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce. The number of at-risk Americans is shrinking, after waves of deaths in older adults and a shift in teens and younger adults away from the drugs that cause most deaths.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will work to pull fluoride supplements for children from the market, citing potential health risks that are not based in rigorous research. This decision coincides with a wave of bills aimed at restricting fluoride use, including in public water supplies. The FDA stated it will review the safety of ingestible fluoride products for children by Oct. 31. While dentists often recommend fluoride supplements to prevent cavities, the FDA pointed to concerns about the gut microbiome, I.Q. levels, and thyroid issues, although the evidence for these risks is debated among researchers.</p>
