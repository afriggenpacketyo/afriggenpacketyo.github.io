        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from corn syrup to cane sugar for its beverages sold in the United States. This change follows public health concerns voiced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. regarding the health effects of corn syrup. In a social media post, Trump praised the decision as a positive move for the company and consumers, suggesting it would result in a better product. The shift marks a significant change in the company's U.S. production formula, aligning it with versions of the product sold in other countries that already use cane sugar.</p>

          <h2>Mitochondrial Donation Technique Allows for Birth of Healthy Children, Sparking Ethical Debate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 17:00:44 EDT</div>

          <p>A landmark study has demonstrated the success of a genetic technique, often called mitochondrial donation, in preventing the transmission of devastating inherited disorders. British researchers utilized the method to help families have eight healthy children, who are now developing normally. The procedure involves transferring the nuclear DNA from a mother's egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, creating an embryo with genetic material from three individuals. While hailed as a breakthrough by many scientists and families, the technique has also reignited ethical debates over potential long-term risks and fears of creating so-called "designer babies."</p>

          <p>Doctors in the United Kingdom have confirmed the birth of eight babies using a pioneering fertility technique that incorporates DNA from three people to prevent incurable mitochondrial diseases. The method, developed in Newcastle, combines the parents' genetic material with healthy mitochondria from a female donor, ensuring the children are born free from these often-fatal conditions. The children, including a set of twins, are reportedly meeting all developmental milestones, marking a major success for the treatment which has been legal in the UK for a decade. The families involved have expressed immense gratitude for the procedure that has lifted the burden of inherited disease.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expressed satisfaction with China's efforts to control the flow of fentanyl into the United States, stating that Beijing is making "big steps" to address the issue. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump's positive assessment marks a significant shift from his previous rhetoric, where he used the fentanyl crisis as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. This change in tone occurs amidst ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the two countries, suggesting that cooperation on the opioid crisis may be a point of progress in their broader diplomatic and economic discussions.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering legislation, known as the Genius Act, that could establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill, which has bipartisan support in the Senate, aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules for the $250 billion market, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Proponents argue this would facilitate faster, cheaper payments, while critics worry about risks like the digital currency de-pegging from its asset. The legislative push aligns with the Trump administration's goal of supporting the broader cryptocurrency industry.</p>

The optimism is centered on the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill, and the CLARITY Act for broader market structure.

Huang consistently argued that restricting access to the Chinese market would ultimately harm U.S. tech leadership, a message that appears to have resonated with the Trump administration. His ability to lobby Washington while maintaining positive relations in Beijing has been described as a diplomatic masterclass by market analysts. The reversal is seen as a major victory for Nvidia, reinforcing Huang's reputation as a uniquely effective business statesman. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), based at the Peace Palace in The Hague, serves as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Comprised of 15 judges from different nations, its primary function is to settle legal disputes submitted to it by states. The court's jurisdiction applies when states have agreed to it, either through a blanket declaration, mutual consent for a specific case, or by being signatories to treaties like the Genocide Convention that designate the ICJ as the arbiter. However, the ICJ has no enforcement mechanism, meaning its binding rulings ultimately depend on the cooperation of the involved parties.</p>
