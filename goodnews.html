          <h2>The Focus Should Shift from Rich Lists to 'Extreme Wealth' and its Societal Impact</h2>

          <p>The annual Sunday Times rich list highlights the extreme wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, with the gap between the rich and the average person tripling since 1989. The article argues that wealth accumulation, often through passive returns on existing assets, exacerbates inequality. It proposes establishing an 'extreme wealth line' to define the point at which wealth becomes harmful to society, influencing politics, the environment, and economic competition. The author suggests that policymakers should consider measures such as higher taxes or mandatory charitable donations for wealth exceeding this line to curb the excesses of wealth inequality.</p>

After a season of inconsistent play and injuries, the Knicks have found their identity as Eastern Conference finalists, showcasing resilience and explosive offensive capabilities. Under the leadership of team president Leon Rose, the Knicks have transitioned from an NBA laughing stock to legitimate title contenders through strategic trades and free-agent signings. The team now faces the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals, with hopes of securing their first title since 1973.</p>

          <p>Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz has voiced reservations about banning the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), despite the party being classified as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor" by the country's domestic intelligence agency. Merz emphasized the need for concrete proof that the AfD is actively working against Germany's liberal and democratic order, placing the burden of proof on the state. While most Germans and major political parties oppose the AfD's agenda, differing opinions on how to address the party's rise are creating divisions within German society.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. This research provides insights into the population history, migration patterns, and adaptation of Indigenous groups over thousands of years.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a complex and evolving set of tariffs on various countries and industries, with many initially proposed tariffs being either paused or modified. Tariffs currently in effect include a 10% universal tariff, 25% on cars and auto parts (with exceptions), 30% on Chinese imports (with exceptions), and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered in the USMCA. Tariffs that have been paused include 'reciprocal' tariffs and higher tariffs on Chinese goods. Key exemptions have been made for goods covered in the USMCA and certain electronics imported from China. Trump continues to threaten additional tariffs on specific industries, but the future of these measures remains uncertain.</p>
