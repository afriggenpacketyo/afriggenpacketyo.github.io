          <p>Key European leaders, including those from Germany, France, the U.K., and Poland, are insisting that Ukraine must be directly involved in any peace negotiations with Russia. While they expressed support for President Trump's efforts to broker a deal with Vladimir Putin in an upcoming Alaska summit, they co-signed a statement emphasizing that a path to peace cannot be determined without Ukraine's participation. The leaders also stressed the need for robust security guarantees for Ukraine. This comes as Vice President JD Vance described the planned summit as a major diplomatic breakthrough aimed at finding a negotiated settlement.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul stated she has found "areas of alignment" with Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist frontrunner for New York City mayor, particularly on the issue of affordability. While acknowledging their many political differences, Hochul noted that Mamdani's campaign has "touched a nerve" with voters who feel left behind by economic policies. Hochul, who once served as Lieutenant Governor under Andrew Cuomo, affirmed her commitment to working with whomever voters choose as mayor. Cuomo is also running in the general election as an independent candidate after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani.</p>

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress on the Canyon Fire burning near the Los Angeles and Ventura County lines, achieving 62% containment as of Sunday morning. The blaze, which has burned 5,370 acres and destroyed seven structures since it began during a heatwave, has stopped spreading. A firefighter sustained serious injuries when his truck rolled over in steep terrain. Although evacuation orders for 2,700 residents were lifted, crews remain vigilant due to continued hot temperatures and potential wind gusts. Favorable weather conditions overnight allowed firefighting teams to strengthen containment lines around the fire's perimeter.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has framed the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin as a crucial test of the Russian leader's seriousness about ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rutte suggested that President Trump is the only one who can determine Putin's sincerity and that the summit is an important next step in pressuring Moscow. He defended the bilateral format of the meeting but asserted that Ukraine and European allies will need to be involved in any substantive negotiations that follow. Rutte also praised Trump's strategy, including increased defense spending commitments from NATO members and allowing weapons deliveries to Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's stock experienced a remarkable 13% weekly advance, which this analysis attributes to a massive "short squeeze" rather than fundamental market optimism. Short-sellers had targeted Apple, betting on its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential financial hits from antitrust rulings and tariffs. However, positive developments, including an apparent exemption from certain tariffs after pledging further U.S. investment, caused the stock to rally, forcing shorts to buy back shares and accelerate the price increase. The article suggests this single stock's dramatic movement has distorted the appearance of the broader market, masking underlying negative trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid a heartfelt tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, who died at the age of 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," described him as a man who dared to lead others to places most would not go on their own. Lovell commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, which famously overcame an in-flight explosion to return the crew safely to Earth. Hanks noted that Lovell's voyages were fueled by the challenge of being alive, not a desire for riches or celebrity, and wished him godspeed on his next voyage to the cosmos.</p>

          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that building a personal brand is a crucial career tool, especially for introverted professionals who are often underestimated. She defines a personal brand as simply what people know you for at work and suggests it allows individuals to shape their own professional narrative. Chan advises starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or participating in hobby groups, to build confidence and visibility. This approach helps introverts showcase their talents and create opportunities without feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of self-promotion.</p>
