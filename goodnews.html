          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended the court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, stating the ruling did not outlaw abortion but returned the issue to the states' democratic processes. In her first televised interview since joining the court, she also addressed criticism that the conservative majority is politically motivated, asserting that the court's role is to decide legal questions without an agenda. Barrett spoke about personal threats she and her family have faced, highlighting the personal costs and need for a "stiff spine" in public service to withstand criticism from all sides.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,600 per ounce, driven by investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst global economic uncertainty. Despite the significant climb of over 38% since the start of the year, some financial analysts believe there is still room for growth. Major investment banks like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan forecast prices could reach $4,000 by mid-2026, citing factors like a weakening labor market and potential interest rate cuts. The article suggests gold remains a strategic asset for portfolio diversification and protection against market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued an apology after finisher medals and T-shirts mistakenly featured an image of the city of Sunderland and the River Wear. The half marathon route runs through Newcastle and along the River Tyne, a region with a fierce football rivalry with Sunderland. Approximately 60,000 runners participated in the event and received the incorrect memorabilia. In a lighthearted statement, the Great Run Company called the items unique keepsakes and humorously promised to "brush up on our geography" for the next event, acknowledging the error was missed by many during the design approval process.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the Department of Education will soon release new guidance to protect the right to prayer in public schools, aiming to provide "total protection." Speaking at the Bible Museum, he criticized what he described as anti-religious propaganda in schools and the punishment of students for their beliefs. The president did not specify the details of the new guidance but framed the initiative as part of a broader effort to strengthen religious liberty. During the event, Trump also highlighted his administration's support for school choice and donated his family Bible to the museum.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld the $83.3 million judgment against former President Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court rejected Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he was protected by presidential immunity, ruling the jury's award was "fair and reasonable." The panel affirmed that a previous jury's finding that Trump sexually abused Carroll was relevant and that he was not shielded from liability for his defamatory statements.

This article outlines several common strategies, including debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan, often with a lower interest rate. Other methods discussed are credit counseling, which involves creating a structured debt management plan with professional guidance, and debt settlement, a more aggressive approach of negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed. The most drastic measure, bankruptcy, legally restructures or eliminates debts but severely impacts credit. (not investment advice)</p>

The show's famous line, "Immigrants, we get the job done," resonates strongly amid ongoing immigration debates and government efforts to scale back diversity initiatives.
