          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have issued apologies following accusations of cultural appropriation over their "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe. The design was inspired by traditional Mexican huaraches without consulting or crediting the Indigenous communities who originated them, prompting criticism from Mexican officials, including the president. In response to the backlash, Adidas has removed promotional images and expressed a commitment to engage in a respectful dialogue with the affected Oaxacan community to repair the damage.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey offered rare advice to take on new debt, suggesting a divorced caller use a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to pay his ex-wife her $150,000 share of their home's equity. While acknowledging the caller's exceptionally low 2.25% mortgage rate, Ramsey questioned the emotional reasons for keeping the house, particularly for the sake of his very young children. He advised that while the financial math works, the caller should consider that starting fresh in a new home might be a wiser long-term decision for his future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interview, historian Rana Mitter asserts that the immense destruction China suffered during World War II profoundly shaped its modern development and underscores its current strategic interest in maintaining a peaceful Asia-Pacific region. Mitter, a specialist in modern Chinese politics at Harvard, explains that the war obliterated much of the nation's infrastructure from the 1920s and 30s. This historical context of having to rebuild from scratch is a crucial, though often underestimated, factor in understanding China's contemporary political and societal motivations.</p>

          <h2>Federal Court Reinstates Commercial Fishing Ban in Pacific Marine Monument</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has reinstated a ban on commercial fishing within the Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument, overturning a Trump administration directive that had allowed it. The ruling blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that sought to open up protected waters around Johnston Atoll, Jarvis Island, and Wake Island to fishing. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, represented by Earthjustice, successfully argued that the administration violated federal law by attempting to change the rules without the required public notice and comment period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool's new-look team under manager Arne Slot displayed both promising attacking flair and concerning defensive vulnerabilities in their 2-2 draw and subsequent penalty shootout loss to Crystal Palace in the Community Shield. The match featured competitive debuts for four new signings, including goalscorers Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong, showcasing potent offensive chemistry. However, the team twice surrendered a lead and appeared disorganized at the back, indicating that while the potential for spectacular results exists, there are still significant bugs to fix as the new players adapt to the system.</p>

          <p>Actor James van der Beek, who was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer, revealed that his only early symptom was a change in bowel movements, which he dismissed at the time. The "Dawson’s Creek" star emphasized that he felt healthy and had no glaring red flags before his diagnosis, which came after a colonoscopy. His experience highlights the importance of screening, as the recommended age has dropped to 45, and of paying attention to subtle bodily changes, even in those who feel healthy.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot stated he does not believe Crystal Palace fans had any "bad intention" when a minute's silence for deceased former player Diogo Jota and his brother was disrupted at the Community Shield match. The referee cut the remembrance short after shouting was heard from the Palace supporters' end of Wembley Stadium. Slot suggested the noise likely came from an over-excited fan who was unaware of the silence, and that other fans were attempting to quiet them, inadvertently creating more noise that was then misinterpreted.</p>
