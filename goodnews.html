          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, intends to divide his estimated $13.9 billion fortune among his over 100 children. Durov, who acknowledges being the "official father" to six children with three partners, has fathered over 100 children through sperm donations to a fertility clinic. He stipulated that his children would not have access to their inheritance for 30 years, wanting them to develop self-reliance and independence. Durov cited the risks associated with defending freedoms as the reason for writing his will now, as his work has earned him numerous enemies, including those within powerful states, making him aware of his mortality. The app, Telegram, is known for its focus on privacy and encrypted messaging, and has more than a billion monthly active users.</p>

          <p>The Associated Press has released its predictions for the top summer songs of 2025, covering various categories and musical tastes. Among the picks are Bad Bunny's "NUEVAYoL" for songs unexpectedly released in January, PinkPantheress's "Tonight" for those chronically online, and Lorde's "What Was That" as the summer's breakup anthem. Other selections include KATSEYE's "Gnarly" for girl-power anthems, Young Miko's "WASSUP" for singles ready to mingle, and Alex Warren's "Ordinary" for British-boy ballads performed by an American. Drake's "Nokia" is highlighted for those who lost the fight but still want to battle, while 803Fresh's "Boots on the Ground" is the TikTok-approved hit, Addison Rae's "Fame Is A Gun" is the song for trendy girls, and Sabrina Carpenter's "Manchild" is the revenge anthem, with Kendrick Lamar and SZA's "Luther" being the biggest song of the year and therefore the song of the summer by default, Morgan Wallen and Tate McRae's "What I Want" being the crossover country song of the summer, Charli xcx's "party 4 you" being the song of the summer released half a decade ago, and Leon Thomas's "Mutt" being the song of the summer with a dog-themed title. The article also references past summer hits in each category, offering a nostalgic look back at previous years.</p>

          <p>Temperatures in the UK are expected to reach above 30C for a second consecutive day as an early summer heatwave persists. Central England could see temperatures as high as 32C, with Saturday potentially reaching 34C before some relief arrives on Sunday. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of significant impacts on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. Many regions are expected to meet the criteria for a heatwave, defined as a sustained temperature threshold for three consecutive days.</p>

          <p>China's ruling Communist Party is urging local governments to carefully implement austerity measures on lavish banquets, amid concerns from the food and beverage industry. The party's theoretical journal, Qiushi, stated that recent rules are meant to limit extravagance, not ordinary dining. Some local governments have been scrutinizing every meal gathering and intervening in banquets, leading to agencies canceling official receptions and cadres avoiding normal working meals. These oversimplified measures have complicated understanding of the regulations and brought unnecessary shocks to the catering industry.</p>

Early detection and treatment, ideally before age seven, are crucial for correcting the condition.

          <p>Scientists in China have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits. The coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, extending the time before rot by almost a week or more. It was tested across 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes. The low-cost coating, costing about 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit, is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and potential toxicity.</p>

Julie Andersen, founder of Shark Angels, attributes the rise in sightings to more people in the water, better technology, and shifting ocean conditions. Shark Angels promotes shark conservation by transforming fear into fascination and dispelling myths about sharks. An endurance athlete is also paying tribute to "Jaws" by swimming around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about shark protection.</p>
