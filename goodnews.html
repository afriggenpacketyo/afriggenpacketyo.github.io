          <p>The Co-op grocery chain anticipates that its shelves will be more fully stocked this weekend after resolving issues stemming from a recent cyberattack. The attack, claimed by a group called DragonForce, disrupted the company's online ordering system, leading to payment problems and shortages. The Co-op is gradually restoring its systems and working with suppliers to restock both in-store and online. Cyber security experts suggest that the attack will erode public trust in online services, leading to consumers being more cautious when sharing personal and financial information.</p>

Two new government campuses will open in Manchester and Aberdeen, with additional roles created in other cities.

          <p>Climate data from oyster fossils challenges the belief that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period, indicating seasonal temperature changes and polar ice presence.

          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers will lead to labor shortages. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for migrants, aiming to prioritize British workers. However, businesses fear that Brits may not be able or willing to fill the gaps, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on migrant staff like health and social care. The government aims to reduce migration and boost training among British workers.</p>
