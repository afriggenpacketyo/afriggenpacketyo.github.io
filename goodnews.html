          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks defeated the Connecticut Sun 92-88 in a closely contested game, largely due to a dominant offensive performance from their frontcourt.

          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter of 2025, expanding by 4.3% year-over-year and beating economists' expectations. This acceleration was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the strong performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies. The positive GDP figures arrive ahead of an anticipated monetary policy decision, with recent low inflation numbers potentially supporting a rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia is enhancing its strategic partnership with the Philippines through increased investment in civil maritime cooperation, including vessel donations and operational training. This move is part of a broader effort to strengthen defense ties between the two nations, which are set to mark 80 years of diplomatic relations in 2026. Analysts note that this deepening security relationship occurs as Australia continues to navigate its complex and vital trade relationship with China. The initiatives reflect a strategic balancing act in the Indo-Pacific region, prioritizing both security partnerships and economic necessities.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly choosing technology and engineering-focused majors over previously popular subjects like international trade. This trend is driven by a state-led push to bolster the nation's technological capabilities amid intensified competition with the United States. Fields such as information and communications technology and vehicle engineering are now top choices for students entering university. The shift reflects a strategic alignment of educational priorities with national goals for future industrial and technological development, reshaping the academic landscape.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's Armagh Observatory is marking a major scientific milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observations. This unbroken, handwritten record, which began on July 14, 1795, is the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland, providing an invaluable dataset for climate science. Unlike modern automated stations, the tradition of human observation continues in Armagh, with observers noting significant changes in weather patterns over the decades. The history of the observatory also includes key contributions to meteorology, such as the development of the cup anemometer.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, a meeting that comes as the administration signals a new plan to help arm Ukraine. The proposal involves selling weapons to NATO allies, who could then transfer their existing U.S.-made equipment to Ukraine more quickly. This strategy aims to expedite military aid as Ukraine faces intense Russian assaults. The discussions also coincide with bipartisan pressure in Congress for legislation that would impose heavy sanctions and tariffs on Russia and countries supporting its war effort.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the first half of the season with a 5-2 extra-innings victory against the San Francisco Giants, securing a 5.5-game lead in the NL West. Despite roster limitations and inconsistent performances from some veteran players, the team holds the best record in the National League. Sunday's game reflected their season's duality, with a stellar performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto but a blown save by the bullpen before the offense rallied late. While not as dominant as some expected, the team remains in a strong position for a postseason run.</p>
