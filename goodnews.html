          <p>The Kimi K2 AI model, developed by Alibaba-backed Moonshot AI, has seen a surge in user adoption following its recent launch. Experts praise its mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture, which significantly reduces training and inference costs compared to competitors like OpenAI. The model, which is currently free to use, highlights a potential shift in AI development strategy toward more resource-efficient approaches. This development underscores China's growing innovation in the competitive artificial intelligence landscape.</p>

          <p>China has initiated the world's largest hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, a development with an estimated investment of 1.2 trillion yuan (US$167 billion). The project, announced by Premier Li Qiang, will feature five cascade hydropower stations and is expected to have three times the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam. The announcement triggered a significant surge in the stock prices of Chinese infrastructure and hydropower companies. Shares of involved firms like Power Construction Corporation of China jumped by the daily limit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The pursuit of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining new momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota targeting mass production before 2030. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging times compared to current lithium-ion technology. Recent progress, including the launch of semi-solid-state EVs by Chinese firms, has renewed optimism. However, challenges such as high production costs and competition from rapidly improving conventional batteries remain significant hurdles for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins, largely thanks to their power hitting. Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run home run in the first inning, his 35th of the season, shortly after giving up a leadoff homer while pitching. Catcher Will Smith contributed two solo home runs, continuing his recent hot streak and raising his National League-leading batting average. The win provided a much-needed offensive spark for the team, though it was marred by an injury to closer Tanner Scott.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a writer from the Balkans reflects on the narrow expectations of the Anglophone publishing industry. She argues that writers from her region are often pressured to produce stories centered on historical trauma, war, and tragedy to appeal to Western readers. This unspoken condition, she contends, rests on a perception of the Balkans as a "lesser place" and limits the scope of narratives that get translated. The author calls for publishers to embrace a wider diversity of stories that challenge stereotypes and reflect the region's full complexity.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed to "substantial changes" for the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected an estimated 30,000 people. The move follows a highly critical report from the public inquiry chair, who described the payment process as "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a family member's estate if they die before their claim is settled. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the news, they expressed disappointment that some issues remain subject to further consultation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's universal tariffs, while widely criticized, may have a "silver lining." The author suggests the tariffs expose the hypocrisy of other countries and trading blocs, like Canada, China, and the EU, which maintain their own self-defeating internal trade barriers. The economic pressure from U.S. tariffs is forcing these nations to confront and potentially dismantle long-standing domestic regulations and protectionist policies. This could lead to a net positive outcome by spurring them to free up their own economies. (not investment advice)</p>
