          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a formal deportation order. The emergency ruling came just as planes were reportedly being prepared to remove hundreds of children from the country over a holiday weekend. Lawyers for the minors argued the deportations would violate legal protections established by Congress, potentially returning them to dangerous situations of abuse or neglect. The Justice Department contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families, a claim disputed by the children's attorneys.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has revealed he was diagnosed with skin cancer and recently underwent surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from his face. Ramsay shared the news on Instagram, posting photos of a large bandage and stitches below his ear, while urging his followers to wear sunscreen. This is not the first time he has used a personal health scare to offer public advice, having previously advocated for helmet use after a serious bicycle accident. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer and has a very high cure rate when detected and treated early.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, recorded his second hole-in-one in the past year during a tournament on Sunday. The ace occurred at the Junior Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Woods accomplished the feat on the par-three third hole from a distance of 177 yards. His first recorded hole-in-one came last December at the 2024 PNC Championship while playing alongside his father. This latest achievement brings him closer to his father's impressive record of 10 career holes-in-one.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that Europe is developing "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. In an interview with the Financial Times, she said the deployment would include tens of thousands of European-led troops and would be supported by U.S. capabilities, including intelligence and command systems. Von der Leyen mentioned that President Trump had reassured European leaders of an American presence in this backstop role. High-level discussions on the matter are expected to continue among European leaders in Paris.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to provide the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support approximately 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates. The decision represents a significant win for the British defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. While the grand prize remains elusive, four tickets sold in Massachusetts won smaller but significant prizes, including one for $1 million and three for $50,000. The $1 million ticket was purchased at a store in Worcester. The next drawing on Monday will be the fortieth since the jackpot was last won on May 31st. This jackpot is now the largest since a $1.326 billion prize was won in Oregon in April 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At an informal meeting, European Union foreign ministers brainstormed new ways to support Ukraine as the war with Russia continues without a clear end in sight. Among the ideas discussed were the potential for secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and inviting Ukrainian arms companies to begin production on EU soil as a "safe haven." The ministers also held a heated debate on seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction, a move some members fear could be illegal and destabilize financial markets. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops onto Ukrainian soil after a ceasefire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital underwater ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over the past 13 years, a team led by the non-profit Bay Foundation has smashed nearly 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins across 80 acres, allowing the once-decimated kelp forests to regrow. The proliferation of urchins, caused by the decline of natural predators like sea otters and sea stars, had created vast underwater "barrens." The restoration has not only brought back the kelp but also improved the habitat for hundreds of marine species and boosted the local fishing economy.</p>
