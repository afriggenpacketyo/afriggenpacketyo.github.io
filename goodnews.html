          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of 2025, with temperatures reaching as high as 33.1°C in England and setting new annual records in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Amber heat health alerts remain active for several regions in England, warning of potential health risks, particularly for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The intense heat has also led to hosepipe bans and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland. A cooler weather pattern is expected to arrive on Monday, bringing rain and more average seasonal temperatures to most of the country.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its decades-long armed conflict with Turkey, initiating a disarmament process with a ceremonial destruction of weapons. This move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and has been cautiously welcomed by the Turkish government as an opportunity for reconciliation. The success of the peace process hinges on concessions from Ankara, including the potential release of Ocalan and other political prisoners, and legal reforms. While significant obstacles remain, analysts are optimistic that this attempt at peace could improve Turkey's regional standing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While installing a water pipeline in the historic Old Town harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia, workers made a significant archaeological find: the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was discovered embedded in the seabed about 30 inches below the ocean floor in the medieval city, famously used as a filming location for "Game of Thrones." A marine archaeologist confirmed the wreck dates to the late 1700s based on radiocarbon analysis. The remains are now being protected for further examination, adding to a series of recent historical shipwreck discoveries across Europe.</p>

          <p>On the 40th anniversary of the Live Aid concert, the event is remembered as a landmark moment in global broadcasting and fundraising, but its legacy is also being viewed through a more critical lens. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure in 1985 to combat famine in Ethiopia, the concert united billions of viewers and featured a star-studded lineup. However, retrospective analyses highlight significant flaws, such as the lack of African performers and female artists, which critics argue reinforced a "white savior" narrative. While Geldof defends the event's impact on raising awareness and funds, others contend it perpetuated a patronizing image of Africa, sparking ongoing debate about its true influence.</p>

          <p>A campaign in the UK is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English rather than the standard Latin or scientific names, arguing the current system puts people with allergies at risk. Labour MP Becky Gittins, who has a severe nut allergy, highlights that most people cannot recognize allergens like peanut oil when listed as "Arachis Hypogaea." Parents and makeup influencers have shared stories of allergic reactions caused by the confusing labels, advocating for standards similar to food packaging. The industry's trade association defends the Latin-based INCI system, stating it provides a globally harmonized language for consumers and companies.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing data from existing dams on the Brahmaputra River offers insights into the potential impact of China's planned mega-dam in Tibet. Contrary to fears in India that the project could cause droughts, the research suggests it might actually increase water availability during the dry season. By examining the Zangmu and Jiacha dams upstream, the study found that low-flow water levels downstream rose by over 50% in February. This indicates that dam operations could regulate the river's flow, augmenting water supplies for downstream nations like India and Bangladesh during their driest months.</p>
