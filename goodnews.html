          <p>Oliver Widger, an Oregon man known as "sailing_with_phoenix" online, completed a weeks-long sailing journey from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix, after quitting his job and using his retirement savings. Widger, who has Klippel-Feil syndrome, gained over a million followers on social media documenting his trip, and was greeted by cheering fans and Hawaii Governor Josh Green upon arrival. He taught himself to sail via YouTube and refitted a $50,000 boat, and said his story resonated with people feeling stuck in their jobs. He plans to make repairs to his boat and may travel to French Polynesia next.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions and increase salaries for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions due to growing global popularity of Japanese cuisine. The annual salary will increase to over 6 million yen ($41,000), and chefs can opt for government-covered rented accommodation. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasizes the significant role chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food, aiming to fill vacancies in about a dozen outposts. The new system includes two-year contracts with possible extensions and funds for spouses to visit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government. The government hails the move as a "new dawn for rail," focusing on service improvements and reinvesting profits in infrastructure. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander could not promise lower fares but assured passengers of "great value for money". SWR trains will now be managed by DfT Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval, with unions expressing concerns over outsourcing to private companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap if elected. This announcement puts pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced criticism from Labour MPs to adjust his stance on these policies. Reform UK plans to fund these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The move highlights policy divisions within the Labour party, as more than 10 million pensioners lost winter fuel payments when the pension top-up became restricted.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author and activist, passed away at the age of 90. Her book, "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape," published in 1975, redefined the understanding of sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, influencing the women's movement and legal reforms. The book provided a comprehensive history of sexual assault and challenged myths surrounding the issue, leading to the establishment of rape-crisis centers and changes in laws. Despite facing criticism for some of her views, Brownmiller remained a significant figure in feminist history.</p>

This move is seen as an affirmation of Canada's unique traditions and its separation from the United States. The invitation comes at a time when Carney has heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump, who has undermined Canada's sovereignty and imposed tariffs threatening its economic stability. The visit marks a rare occasion, as a British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977.</p>
