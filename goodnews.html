        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, briefly exceeding $112,000, buoyed by a strong rally in the technology sector led by Nvidia. This movement underscores Bitcoin's continued correlation with risk-on assets, where positive sentiment in equity markets often spills over into cryptocurrency. Despite recent weeks of trading within a narrow range, institutional interest and corporate purchasing have sustained underlying momentum for the digital asset. Analysts suggest that upcoming crypto-related legislative discussions and continued bullish market sentiment could potentially drive prices even higher in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Passengers on a Delta Air Lines flight from Madrid to New York experienced a significant travel disruption after an engine issue forced an emergency landing on the small island of Terceira in the Azores. The 282 customers and 13 crew members spent approximately 29 hours on the Portuguese island, which is located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Delta confirmed the diversion was due to a mechanical issue and stated that safety is its top priority, providing overnight hotel accommodation and meals for those affected. The passengers eventually continued their journey on a replacement aircraft, and the airline has pledged to offer compensation.</p>

          <p>England's path to the Euro 2025 knockout stage is now clear: a victory against Wales in their final Group D match will secure their advancement. After a crucial 4-0 win over the Netherlands, the defending champions control their own destiny. Meanwhile, Wales faces near-certain elimination and would need an improbable, large-margin victory to have any chance of progressing. In the same group, France has already qualified, and the Netherlands must secure a result against them while hoping England fails to win. The scenarios are complicated by head-to-head tiebreaker rules if multiple teams finish with the same number of points.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial Florida law that criminalizes the entry of certain undocumented immigrants into the state. This decision means the law, which was signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, will remain blocked while legal challenges proceed. A federal judge had previously ruled that the state law likely overstepped into the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. Civil liberties groups praised the Supreme Court's denial, stating that it reaffirms the long-standing principle that individual states cannot create and enforce their own immigration systems.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has experienced a modest decline, dropping around 4% from its recent highs and creating a potential entry point for investors. While the fluctuation is minor, it comes at a time when many analysts predict the precious metal could eventually reach the $4,000 per ounce milestone. The article suggests that this dip is likely to be short-lived, with factors like upcoming inflation reports and Federal Reserve meetings poised to influence prices. For those seeking portfolio diversification and a hedge against inflation, acting now could be a strategic move before the next potential price surge makes entry more costly.
