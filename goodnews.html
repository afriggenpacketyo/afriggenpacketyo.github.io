          <p>Archaeologists excavating the Basilica of St. Stephen on Caelian Hill in Rome discovered a stone head believed to depict an ancient deity, likely from the Roman era. The head, found in the church's foundation, is deteriorated and covered in mortar, obscuring some features. It will undergo documentation, study, and restoration at the Central Institute for Restoration (ICR) in Matera, with students from the School of Advanced Training for Restoration involved in the process. The collaboration between the Appian Way Regional Park and the ICR aims to enhance archaeological and restoration practices, enriching understanding of the Appia Antica territory during the late antique period. This Fox News article adds to a growing list of ancient artifacts unearthed during archaeological digs.</p>

          <p>China rejected Japan's assertion that a Chinese coast guard helicopter entered its airspace near the Senkaku Islands, blaming the incident on a Japanese civilian aircraft. Liu Jinsong of the Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a protest with Akira Yokochi of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, citing the "intrusion of a civilian aircraft operated by Japan's right-winger." Yokochi reiterated Tokyo's protest, demanding preventive measures. The Japanese Defense Ministry reported the helicopter flew above the territorial waters for about 15 minutes, prompting the Air Self-Defense Force to scramble two jet fighters. Senior Col. Zhang Xiaogang of China's Defense Ministry stated the coast guard's action was "completely legitimate and legal."</p>

          <p>China is expediting the construction of its Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak (Best) nuclear fusion reactor in Hefei, aiming for completion in 2027. This project seeks to achieve net energy generation, a crucial step toward commercializing nuclear fusion as a clean energy source. The assembly involves thousands of components weighing approximately 6,000 tonnes. Chief engineer Song Yuntao stated that they have mastered core technologies, both scientifically and technically. The project began two months ahead of schedule, with Yan Jianwen noting the rapid progress as "China speed" in civil construction and component readiness.</p>

          <p>The area where Elon Musk's SpaceX operates in South Texas has officially been incorporated as a city named Starbase, following a local election where 212 residents, mostly SpaceX employees, voted in favor. The new city encompasses 1.6 square miles and will be governed by a mayor and two commissioners, overseeing planning, taxation, and local issues. Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president, will serve as the first mayor. A bill in the Texas legislature could grant Starbase control over closures of a local highway and access to nearby Boca Chica Beach during rocket launches, raising concerns from Cameron County officials.</p>

          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a new adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray" on Broadway, playing all 26 roles in a technologically innovative performance. The production uses smartphones and elaborate camerawork to explore themes of narcissism and the superficiality of modern society. Snook, portraying Dorian Gray, uses a smartphone to manipulate her image on a giant screen, highlighting the gap between false perfection and reality. This adaptation contrasts with another London import, "Vanya," starring Andrew Scott, which offers a different perspective on self-expression and performance.</p>

          <p>An editorial in Vox argues that self-driving cars, powered by AI, can significantly reduce traffic fatalities by eliminating human errors like distracted, drowsy, and impaired driving. Data from Waymo suggests that autonomous vehicles have 85% fewer crashes with suspected serious injuries and 92% fewer crashes involving pedestrian injuries. The author contends that slowing down the development and adoption of autonomous vehicles is costing lives, urging the public to focus on the potential benefits rather than outlier events. Despite economic disruption and public skepticism, the piece advocates for embracing AI-driven transportation to save thousands of lives annually.</p>
