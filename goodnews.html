          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors/publishers who accused the firm of illegally pirating nearly half a million books to train its chatbots. The agreement, which will pay approximately $3,000 per book, addresses past infringements but not future works. Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers lauded the settlement as a landmark step, signaling to AI companies that copyright infringement comes with a significant cost. Anthropic expressed satisfaction, noting the court's earlier ruling that AI training is transformative fair use remains intact, with this settlement resolving specific acquisition claims.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump stated he would not permit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank, ahead of their upcoming meeting. Trump also indicated that a deal on Gaza was "pretty close," amidst growing international pressure on Israel to end the conflict and occupation. This declaration comes as numerous Western states have formally recognized an independent Palestinian state, intensifying global calls for a peaceful resolution. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, speaking at the UN, expressed readiness to work on a French-announced peace plan, while reiterating Hamas would have no governance role.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Senate Bill 576, introduced by Senator Tom Umberg, aims to prevent streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video from playing commercials at excessively loud volumes, a problem federal law currently addresses for traditional broadcasters. The bill was inspired by an 8-month-old baby, Samantha, who was frequently woken by blaring ads, prompting her parents to advocate for change. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the legislation could establish a de facto national standard, as companies often avoid creating different policies for California. The Motion Picture Association has opposed the bill, citing challenges in controlling ad sources.</p>

          <p>The UK's inaugural stem cell collection center, exclusively dedicated to transplants, has opened at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, aiming to significantly increase life-saving donations. Run by the Anthony Nolan charity in partnership with NIHR, the center is expected to create 1,300 new donation slots annually, addressing a critical global shortage of cell collection facilities. This initiative is crucial for patients with blood cancers and disorders, who often face life-threatening delays due to capacity issues. Donors, like Jordan from London, expressed pride in contributing to this vital effort, which simplifies the donation process and offers hope for recipients.</p>

          <p>US country music star Luke Combs highlights the surging popularity of country music in the UK, noting it as the fastest-growing genre among British listeners. Ahead of a historic Grand Ole Opry performance in London, Combs remarked on the unique engagement of UK fans, who consume entire albums and focus intently on lyrics, contrasting with the louder, more "melee" atmosphere of US shows. He attributes this growth partly to streaming services making the genre more accessible and the band's consistent effort to tour internationally. The Opry's first performance outside the US at the Royal Albert Hall signifies this expanding global appeal.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized by the US Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport, have found a new home at the New York Aquarium. These corals, protected under endangered species acts, were in poor health after five days in transit and would have perished without intervention. The aquarium, acting as a "coral hospital," has successfully rehabilitated many pieces, some now on public display. This effort highlights the ongoing problem of illegal wildlife trade and the critical role aquariums play in conservation and public education about endangered marine life.</p>

          <p>A former senior Chinese official, Yang Weimin, has urged the government to prioritize boosting household income over the next five years to stimulate consumption and drive economic growth. Ahead of discussions for China's next five-year plan, Yang emphasized that weak consumer demand is fundamentally linked to income levels. He specifically called for increasing the share of household disposable income in national income and enhancing consumer spending's contribution to total demand. This recommendation underscores a strategic shift towards internal consumption as a key economic engine. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasized the company's focus on growth, which he believes will drive shareholder value.
