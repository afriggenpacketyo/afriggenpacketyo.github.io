        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has limited the potential for widespread compensation claims over hidden commissions in car finance deals, a decision that provides relief to lenders. The court rejected the argument that car dealers have a primary fiduciary duty to buyers, which could have triggered billions in payouts. However, the ruling did find one specific agreement "unfair" under the Consumer Credit Act due to a large, undisclosed commission, setting a precedent for similar cases. The decision does not resolve the separate issue of discretionary commission agreements, which are under investigation by regulators and could still result in substantial redress schemes for consumers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using an expedited removal process on migrants who entered the U.S. legally through humanitarian parole. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb could significantly curtail the administration's mass deportation campaign, including the controversial practice of arresting migrants at courthouses after their cases are dismissed. The judge noted the plaintiffs had "played by the rules" and that the case raised a "question of fair play." This decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of migrants, primarily from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, who were paroled into the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A ruling by the European Court of Justice has dealt a significant blow to Italy's controversial plan to process asylum seekers in Albania. The court found that Italy's method for designating a migrant's home country as "safe" for return is not compliant with EU law. This "safe country" concept is fundamental to the Italy-Albania deal, which aimed to fast-track applications and deportations. The decision requires Italy to revise its procedures, effectively halting the offshore plan and being hailed as a victory by human rights organizations who have opposed the deal from its inception on legal and humanitarian grounds.</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple has welcomed a baby boy who developed from an embryo that was frozen for 11,148 days, or just over 30 years. This is believed to be the longest an embryo has been stored before resulting in a live birth. The process, known as embryo adoption, involved the transfer of an embryo originally created and donated in 1994. The birth surpasses a previous record set in 2022. The event highlights the viability of long-term cryopreservation and raises awareness about the estimated 1.5 million frozen embryos currently in storage in the United States.</p>

The company's stock, trading under the ticker FIG, had more than tripled on its first day, closing at $115.50 after being priced at $33 per share. Figma's strong market debut is a positive signal for the tech IPO market, which has seen a recent resurgence after a prolonged quiet period. The company nearly had a different fate, as a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was called off in 2023 due to regulatory opposition.</p>

          <p>Indian fast bowler Prasidh Krishna revealed that a heated on-field exchange with England's Joe Root was a deliberate tactic to disrupt the star batter during the second day of the fifth Test. The incident is the latest in a series marked by high tensions between the two teams. England's assistant coach acknowledged the strategy, noting that while words have been exchanged, the teams are still getting along. The match remains tightly contested, with India holding a slight advantage after England's bowlers struggled and their fielders dropped three crucial catches late in the day's play.</p>

          <p>The National Football League is expected to take an ownership stake in ESPN, a major strategic move for both the league and parent company Walt Disney Co. In exchange for equity, ESPN is anticipated to take operational control of the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and the Red Zone channel. This partnership would further intertwine the nation's most powerful sports league with its most dominant sports broadcaster. The deal comes as ESPN adapts to the decline of traditional cable television by launching a direct-to-consumer streaming service and could reshape future media rights negotiations across the industry.</p>

          <h2>Germany Debates Raising Retirement Age Beyond 67 to Address Pension System Strain</h2>

          <p>A debate over Germany's pension system has been reignited, with the Economy Minister suggesting people may need to work longer to ensure its sustainability. Due to an aging population, the ratio of workers to pensioners is shrinking, placing immense strain on the system. The proposal to raise the retirement age beyond the currently planned 67 has faced backlash from coalition partners and trade unions, who argue it unfairly penalizes workers in physically demanding jobs. Experts suggest a mix of solutions is needed, including better childcare, migration policies, and reforming the pension structure itself.</p>

          <p>The Presidential Fitness Test, a long-standing feature of American physical education for over 50 years, is set to make a comeback after being phased out in 2013. President Trump signed an executive order to revive the standardized set of exercises, which includes drills like the shuttle run and the one-mile run. The order cites declining physical well-being and rising obesity rates as a threat to the nation. The revived program will be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, with a reestablished council tasked with developing the new criteria for the test.</p>
