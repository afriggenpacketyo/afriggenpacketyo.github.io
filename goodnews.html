          <p>The Republic of Ireland has committed to new legislation ensuring full cooperation with a reformed UK legacy body addressing cases from the Northern Ireland Troubles. This agreement, part of a "new framework" between the British and Irish governments, includes establishing a legacy unit within An Garda Síochána and a €25m support fund for victims. The initiative aims to mend a rift caused by the current UK Legacy Act, which was widely opposed for controversial elements like conditional immunity. The new framework will involve significant changes to the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery, renaming it the Legacy Commission.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 01:04:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept its policy rate steady at 0.5%, aligning with economists' forecasts, as Japan's core inflation rate fell to 2.7% in August, its lowest since November 2024. This marks the third consecutive month of decline for core inflation, which excludes fresh food prices. The BOJ's decision, reached by a 7-2 majority, reflects a cautious stance prioritizing stability amidst slowing inflation and global uncertainty. While some advocate for rate hikes due to inflation remaining above the 2% target, others argue that high headline inflation is distorted by supply constraints rather than strong domestic demand.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants, extending their National League West division lead to three games, despite a challenging outing from starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto and a shaky bullpen. Yamamoto pitched 5⅓ scoreless innings but struggled with command, issuing a career-high six walks. The Dodgers' relievers, which have recently faced inconsistencies, managed to hold on, executing crucial pitches in high-pressure moments in the seventh inning. This win, though hard-fought, provided a much-needed boost of confidence for the relief corps and strengthened the team's standing.</p>
