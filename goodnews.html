          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the US Open quarter-finals with a dominant 6-1, 6-4 victory over Cristina Bucsa, without facing a single break point. The Belarusian star, who won her first US Open title last year, emphasized her current focus on winning and not dwelling on past achievements, aiming for her first major title this year after reaching two Grand Slam finals. Sabalenka is striving to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2014 to successfully defend the US Open singles title. She will next face 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the last eight, maintaining her strong, undefeated run in sets.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares surged nearly 19% after the company reported better-than-expected net income in its June quarter, driven by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit and a continued revival of its e-commerce business. Revenue rose 2% year-on-year, while net income dramatically increased by 78%, partly due to gains from equity investments and the disposal of a Turkish e-commerce firm. The cloud division saw robust 26% year-on-year revenue growth, fueled by strong AI demand, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth. Alibaba continues to balance significant investments in AI and new e-commerce models with navigating China's competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

He urged the bloc to promote inclusive economic globalization and an equitable global governance system. Leaders from Belarus, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Russia also delivered speeches at the summit, which aims to strengthen security, economic, and cultural cooperation. The SCO's expanding scope and membership underscore its growing role as a significant Eurasian counterweight to Western influence, with discussions focusing on charting a new phase of high-quality development and regional stability.</p>

          <p>American volunteer pilots, famously known as the "Flying Tigers," who valiantly fought for China against Imperial Japan during World War II, continue to be revered in China despite current US-China tensions. These mercenaries, hired in 1941, were credited with destroying nearly 500 Japanese planes, earning them the status of saviors among many Chinese. This enduring historical bond is underscored by the invitation extended to the descendants of the Flying Tigers' founder to China's upcoming military parade, commemorating the 80th anniversary of WWII's end. This appreciation for shared wartime history stands in stark contrast to the often frosty diplomatic relations between the two nations today.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to open broadly higher on Monday, with Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and Italy's FTSE MIB projected to see slight gains, while the UK's FTSE index remains unchanged. This positive outlook follows mixed performances in Asia-Pacific markets, where investors reacted to China's RatingDog manufacturing data, which unexpectedly showed expansion in August. Traders are also closely assessing the likelihood of a U.S. Federal Fed interest rate cut at its September meeting, influenced by recent inflation data and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments. U.S. financial markets are closed for the Labor Day public holiday. (not investment advice)</p>

The summit, attended by over 20 foreign leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, serves as a platform for China to project itself as a global peacemaker amidst persistent trade tensions with the United States and ongoing conflicts. Xi highlighted China's $84 billion investment in other SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education programs, aiming to foster high-quality development and cooperation within the bloc.</p>

          <p>Former England and Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney believes the current season could be "now or never" for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, expecting him to finally deliver significant silverware. Rooney's comments follow Arsenal's 1-0 defeat to Liverpool, a result he felt underscored Arsenal's cautious approach in big games. He suggested Arsenal should have shown more bravery and taken more initiative at Anfield to secure a win.

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's state-owned rail operator, has permanently abolished peak time rail fares, offering significant savings for many passengers starting September 1. This initiative, previously piloted and then reinstated, aims to encourage a substantial shift of commuters from cars to trains. For instance, a ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow will now be almost 50% cheaper, with other routes seeing similar reductions. First Minister John Swinney announced the move, citing improved financial positions and strong calls from commuters, climate activists, and the business community. This policy is expected to put more money in people's pockets and contribute to reduced carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Tianjin, with their peace talks reportedly accelerated by the Trump administration's recent tariffs on Indian imports. India, steadfast in its refusal to stop buying Russian oil, is actively seeking new opportunities, leading to renewed engagement with its neighbor, China. This meeting signals a potential shift in India's policy of "strategic autonomy," though significant roadblocks remain, including unresolved border disputes and a burgeoning trade deficit. The renewed synergy between Delhi and Beijing will likely be tested by upcoming multilateral forums like the Quad summit, especially if former President Trump attends and makes anti-China statements.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott reacted to the surprising trade of All-Pro Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating he "wasn't surprised" given the reportedly personal nature of Parsons' contract negotiations with owner Jerry Jones. Parsons, now the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback after securing a massive $188 million deal, was traded for two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Prescott expressed relief that the tension between Parsons and the Cowboys had a definitive resolution, avoiding further distraction for the team. He wished Parsons good luck, acknowledging they will face each other in Week 4 of the upcoming NFL season.</p>

The significant transfer marks a major move in the football world, with Isak having trained alone and missed recent Premier League games amidst intense speculation about his future.</p>
