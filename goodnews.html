          <p>The UK and US have reached a deal to reduce or remove tariffs on some goods traded between the two countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While not a comprehensive trade deal, this agreement cuts car tariffs to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars and scraps a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports into the US. Negotiations will continue on pharmaceuticals and digital trade, but there will be no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms. The article clarifies that the agreement is a significant achievement for Starmer and will require months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn his nomination of Ed Martin for US Attorney for the District of Columbia due to resistance from senators.

          <p>U.S. intelligence agencies have increased their focus on Greenland, spurred by President Trump's interest in acquiring the island and Vice President Vance's visit to a U.S. military base there. This increased focus has led to a growing number of intelligence reports about Greenland being circulated in the executive branch and Congress. Some reports focus on Russian or Chinese interest in the island, as the White House remains concerned about Arctic security and encroachment by China and Russia on American interests. While much of the intelligence work is based on open-source information, officials expect more work to be done on Greenland and its population.</p>

          <p>A House of Lords committee heard that home working has led to a more significant decline in after-work drinking in city centers outside London. Data suggests that in London, post-work drinks have shifted from Friday to Thursday, but this shift is not seen in other large British cities. Instead, spending in bars in these cities is more likely to shift into the weekend, indicating that workers are coming in from a leisure perspective rather than going out after work. This trend suggests a change in social habits due to remote work.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek defeated Elisabetta Cocciaretto to reach the third round of the Italian Open, continuing her bid for a fifth title in six years at the French Open. Naomi Osaka also progressed, winning against Viktorija Golubic after a tough three-set match. Italian Jasmine Paolini advanced after defeating Lulu Sun. Swiatek, who will bid for a fifth title in six years at the French Open later this month, has reached at least the quarter-finals of her previous eight tournaments, but is yet to win a trophy this season.</p>
