          <p>Costco reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong growth in membership income and e-commerce sales. The warehouse retailer has successfully attracted more members, particularly younger shoppers, by offering value and expanding its digital features. Despite facing inflation and higher tariff costs, the company has adapted by adjusting its merchandise and introducing private-label alternatives. Company executives noted that while same-store sales growth has decelerated slightly, overall traffic and transaction sizes have continued to climb. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A family visiting Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park discovered a 2.79-carat chocolate brown diamond, the third-largest found at the park this year. Raynae Madison and her family were visiting for her nephew's birthday when she found the unusual stone while sifting through soil in the park's designated search area. Park staff confirmed the gem's identity, explaining that brown diamonds from the crater get their color from structural defects formed during their creation. Madison named the stone the 'William Diamond' in honor of her nephew, continuing the park's long history of public diamond discoveries.</p>

          <p>After facing intense takeover speculation earlier in the year, British energy major BP has seen its fortunes improve, with its share price climbing over 32% since early April. This resurgence has quieted rumors of potential acquisition by rivals like Shell or state-owned firms. The positive shift is attributed to a strategic reset, strong quarterly results that beat expectations, and a series of successful oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized the company's focus on internal growth and value creation for shareholders, signaling confidence in BP's standalone strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

Emery praised Watkins' work rate and contribution to the team, stating that his effort is more important than his immediate goal-scoring record. The manager asserted his confidence that the goals will return soon, emphasizing the player's overall positive performance and tasks completed for the team.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to approve a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new structure, avoiding a potential ban. The agreement establishes a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, and a board controlled by Americans. Under the deal, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, will own less than 20% of the new entity, and the app's algorithm will be retrained to run on U.S. user data hosted by Oracle. The move satisfies a law requiring divestiture due to national security concerns over the app's Chinese ownership.</p>

          <p>Actor William Shatner, 94, has reassured fans that he is in good health after reports circulated that he had been hospitalized for a medical emergency. In a social media post, the "Star Trek" icon stated he had "over indulged" and used the moment to caution followers against trusting tabloids and AI-generated news. His agent confirmed that Shatner had experienced an issue with his blood sugar and called for emergency services as a precaution but is now "perfectly healthy." Shatner humorously referenced a famous Mark Twain quote, stating that "rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated."</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he would not allow Israel to annex the occupied West Bank, a move some hardline members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government have advocated for. Speaking to reporters, Trump stated, "It's time to stop now," reinforcing private assurances he reportedly gave to leaders of Arab nations. The statement comes as several Western countries have moved to recognize a Palestinian state, increasing international pressure on Israel. Annexation of the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, would likely make the formation of an independent Palestinian state impossible.</p>

          <p>An Oregon murder suspect who was mistakenly released from jail has been arrested following a multi-day manhunt. Ty Anthony Sage, 26, was facing charges of second-degree murder and first-degree robbery but was accidentally released on bail due to a clerical error, despite a judge having previously denied him bail. The Multnomah County Sheriff called the release a failure and committed to a full review to prevent future occurrences. Sage was apprehended at a gas station in Florence, Oregon, bringing a resolution to the search and providing relief to the victim's family.</p>

          <p>As Beijing prepares its 15th five-year plan, analysts anticipate a strategic focus on strengthening domestic supply chains and advancing further up the global value chain. Despite some manufacturing, like iPhone assembly, moving to countries like India, China's ecosystem remains dominant in producing critical components for many industries. The next economic blueprint is expected to address vulnerabilities and chokepoints in high-tech sectors to enhance resilience amid external uncertainties and trade tensions. This strategy aims to solidify China's position as an indispensable hub for global manufacturing while fostering greater technological self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has given preliminary approval to a $1.5 billion settlement offered by AI company Anthropic to resolve a class-action lawsuit filed by authors. The lawsuit alleged that Anthropic illegally used pirated book databases to train its AI models, including its well-known assistant, Claude. If finalized, this would be the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history. As part of the agreement, Anthropic will pay approximately $3,000 per book and has agreed to destroy the datasets containing the allegedly pirated material, setting a significant precedent for AI and copyright law.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that short-term economic headwinds in China, such as a cooling property market, are obscuring a more significant and resilient long-term transition. The author contends that the country's economy is supported by a strong foundation built on synergistic investments in green infrastructure, digital connectivity, and world-class scientific research. China now leads in the majority of key technologies and produces a significant share of the world's highly cited scientific papers. This synergy is fostering a more diversified and sustainable economic model, moving beyond reliance on a single source of growth.</p>
