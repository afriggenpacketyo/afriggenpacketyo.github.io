          <p>Congressional Republicans are pursuing a spending and tax cut package, spearheaded by House Speaker Mike Johnson, to bolster their political standing amid economic concerns stemming from President Trump's tariffs. The bill aims to extend the 2017 tax law, but its impact may be overshadowed by the negative effects of the tariffs, which could raise costs and batter markets. The article suggests that Republicans face a dilemma, needing Trump's support for the tax extension while also needing to address the economic damage caused by his trade policies, creating a precarious path to the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized that China represents a "large opportunity" for the semiconductor and artificial intelligence industry, cautioning against overly strict U.S. chip controls. She advocated for a balance between export controls for national security and ensuring broad adoption of U.S. technology to benefit U.S. jobs and the economy.
