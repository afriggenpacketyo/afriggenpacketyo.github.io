          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 23:00:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell Metabolism, suggests that fathers can transmit the benefits of exercise to their children through genetic mechanisms. Researchers found that offspring sired by exercise-trained mice displayed intrinsic exercise adaptations, including improved muscle mass, lower body fat, and stronger bones, compared with those sired by sedentary fathers. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that injecting sperm microRNAs from exercised mice into normal fertilized eggs reproduced these exercise-derived traits in the offspring. This groundbreaking research highlights paternal exercise as a potentially cost-effective route to improve offspring health and offers new insights into intergenerational health.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have announced a strategic adjustment to Shohei Ohtani's pitching schedule for the National League Championship Series, delaying his next start to later in the series. Manager Dave Roberts explained that this decision allows Yoshinobu Yamamoto to pitch on his regular five-day rest, optimizing the team's pitching rotation across a potential seven-game series. This move also implicitly provides Ohtani additional time to focus on recalibrating his hitting, following a challenging performance in the NL Division Series. While this means Ohtani might make only one pitching start, the Dodgers prioritize maximizing their best pitchers' innings and Ohtani's offensive output.</p>

          <p>Maintaining adult friendships often becomes challenging amidst life's increasing demands, leading to a common phenomenon of "ghosting" or simply drifting apart.

This article offers practical strategies for nurturing platonic bonds, emphasizing the importance of transparent communication, vulnerability, and creative ways to connect, even through mundane activities. Experts highlight that strong social circles significantly reduce health risks and combat "relational loneliness."

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers from the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to objectively study stress, revealing that a significant drop in nose temperature can serve as a robust measure of stress levels and recovery. This article details a study where participants, including a BBC science correspondent, underwent a carefully designed stress test involving impromptu speeches and mental arithmetic. The thermal cameras consistently captured a temperature dip in participants' noses, a physical reaction linked to blood flow redirection. Scientists believe this non-invasive technique could be a "game changer" for monitoring stress in both humans and non-human apes, potentially aiding in managing harmful stress levels and identifying risks for anxiety or depression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has advised UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" in the upcoming Budget, urging comprehensive tax reform instead. The Chancellor is expected to raise tens of billions to meet self-imposed fiscal rules without breaking manifesto promises on income tax, National Insurance, or VAT. The IFS warns against economically harmful tax rises and proposes aligning overall tax rates across different income forms, suggesting property tax and capital gains tax reforms as "good places to start." It cautions against a wealth tax and recommends against restricting pension contribution relief, advocating for broader, growth-friendly changes to the tax system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dow futures surged over 300 points, signaling a market rebound, after President Trump posted on Truth Social to calm investors regarding renewed U.S.-China trade tensions. His remarks, following an earlier threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, suggested a potential de-escalation, leading markets to anticipate another instance of the "TACO trade" (Trump always chickens out). Vice President Vance also hinted at reasonableness if China reciprocates, further easing market anxieties. This article indicates that despite Beijing's defiant stance on trade, investors are largely interpreting the situation as a negotiating tactic rather than a full-blown trade war, viewing the recent market dip as a buying opportunity.
