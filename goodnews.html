          <h2>European Defense Industry Supports Proposed Eastern Drone Defense System</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European defense giants have expressed strong support for the proposed "drone wall" on the region's eastern border, viewing it as a crucial measure to address a rapidly escalating security challenge from drone incursions, allegedly by Russia. Companies like Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall are ready to offer their expertise and technology, emphasizing the need for robust counter-UAS drone defense systems. However, some industry experts warn that the concept risks oversimplification, advocating for a complex, interoperable network of sensors and countermeasures rather than a literal wall. Concerns also exist about potential bureaucratic hurdles and the speed required for its implementation to effectively protect against evolving threats.</p>

          <p>England striker Aggie Beever-Jones is making a compelling case for Chelsea and the national team's number nine position, scoring in five consecutive Women's Super League appearances. Her exceptional form, including diverse goal types and strong technical skills, has been crucial amid injuries to other key Chelsea forwards. Experts like Ellen White and Fara Williams praise her progression and resilience, noting her transformation from a bit-part player to a central figure. This homegrown talent's rise is seen as highly exciting for both her club and the Lionesses, pushing her up the national team's pecking order.</p>

          <p>Thomas Wolf, co-founder of Hugging Face, argues that current AI models like ChatGPT are unlikely to lead to Nobel Prize-level scientific breakthroughs, contrary to claims by some industry leaders. Wolf points out that these chatbots are designed to predict the most likely next word and often align with user prompts, whereas true scientific discovery requires contrarian thinking and predicting novel, unlikely truths. While AI can serve as a "co-pilot" for research, aiding humans in generating ideas, the fundamental design of existing models may limit their capacity for truly groundbreaking, unexpected scientific insights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has indicated that the UK government may soon lift the two-child benefit cap, acknowledging its "devastating impact" on child poverty. The Conservative-introduced policy restricts payments for third or subsequent children born after April 2017. Phillipson, leading a child poverty task force, stressed the "real urgency" of addressing the issue as child poverty rates continue to rise. While full abolition is advocated by campaigners, reports suggest the Treasury is considering alternative solutions, such as a tapered system or limiting additional benefits to three or four children, to tackle the problem.</p>

          <p>Two Canadair regional jets, operated by Endeavor Air, a Delta subsidiary, were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport Wednesday night. The incident, which occurred between an outbound and an inbound flight, resulted in one flight attendant sustaining a minor injury, requiring hospital transport as a precaution, though no other passengers were harmed. Preliminary information indicates the departing aircraft's wing made contact with the fuselage of the arriving plane. Passengers were safely deplaned and bused back to Terminal C, with Delta initiating an investigation alongside FAA, NTSB, and Port Authority, prioritizing safety and customer care.</p>
