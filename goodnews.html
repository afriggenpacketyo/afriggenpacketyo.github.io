          <p>Strawberry growers in the UK anticipate a "stonking start" to the 2025 season due to warm days and cool nights, which enhance the fruit's sweetness. Despite a dry spring and warnings of a potential summer drought, growers have irrigation systems in place to mitigate the effects of extreme weather. Farmers are reporting that the strawberries are ripening at a phenomenal rate and are of good size and sweetness, and the Summer Berry Company has already seen increased production. Consumers can look forward to particularly flavorful berries this summer, with suggestions to pair them with black pepper, balsamic vinegar, or chilli for added depth.</p>

New engine designs, such as the General Electric GE9X, offer alternative methods for noise reduction without the drawbacks of chevrons. These new designs incorporate new materials and nozzle designs that reduce friction and create a more compact exhaust stream.
