          <p>Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, reported a 14% drop in first-quarter operating earnings, falling to $9.64 billion due to a significant decrease in insurance-underwriting profit, which was impacted by Southern California wildfires. The company also cited a $713 million loss related to foreign exchange as the dollar weakened. Buffett cautioned that potential tariffs could further negatively affect the conglomerate's profits, adding uncertainty to the financial outlook. The conglomerate's insurance-underwriting profit plunged nearly 50%, signaling a rough start to the year for this segment of the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Donaldson, experiencing shortness of breath and dizzy spells, initially dismissed his symptoms until he saw a PSA featuring NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar discussing atrial fibrillation. Prompted by the PSA, Donaldson sought medical attention and doctors discovered a rare, orange-sized pericardiac cyst growing inside his heart. The cyst was compressing his right ventricular outflow tract, leading to his symptoms, and required open-heart surgery to remove and reconstruct his RVOT. Donaldson is now recovering and grateful for Abdul-Jabbar's message, which encouraged him to seek medical help.</p>

          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) aims to reduce "elderspeak," a form of communication that sounds like baby talk and is often used with older adults, by educating caregivers to address older people as adults. Studies show that elderspeak, which includes inappropriate endearments and simplified language, can lead to resistance to care and other negative behaviors. The CHAT program has been shown to reduce the use of elderspeak and resistant behaviors in nursing homes. The article also emphasizes the importance of cultural sensitivity and open communication to ensure older adults are treated with respect.</p>
