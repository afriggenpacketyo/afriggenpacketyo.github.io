          <p>A U.S. District Court judge is set to rule on a lawsuit filed by the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, aiming to prevent the federal government from deploying the National Guard over their objections. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul argues that the federalization of troops is patently unlawful and unconstitutional, citing President Trump's claims of Chicago being "out of control" and his desire to use American cities as military training grounds. The federal government, in its 59-page response, maintains that President Trump possesses the legal authority to deploy troops and that state objections should not impede the operation. Possible outcomes include the judge ordering the Guard's withdrawal, affirming the president's power for them to stay, or allowing a temporary presence with major restrictions on their actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, a visit occurring just six months after his last annual physical examination. The White House did not provide an explanation for the second checkup, which precedes a potential trip to the Middle East following a peace deal announcement. While his April physical showed no major abnormalities, a later examination revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a condition affecting leg veins. Despite this, the president's physician stated there was no evidence of a more serious issue, maintaining Trump remains in "excellent" overall health.</p>

          <p>The IRS has unveiled new, higher capital gains tax brackets for 2026, increasing the taxable income limits for long-term capital gains and adjusting dozens of other provisions, including federal income tax brackets. For 2026, single filers with taxable income up to $49,450 and married couples filing jointly up to $98,900 will qualify for a 0% long-term capital gains rate. This announcement provides clarity on future tax liabilities for investors, allowing for better financial planning. Notably, these updates come despite the IRS furloughing nearly half its workforce due to the ongoing government shutdown, highlighting continued administrative functions even during fiscal disruptions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee is nearing its announcement for the Nobel Peace Prize winner, with President Trump among the high-profile nominees, especially following the first phase of his Gaza peace plan. The award recognizes significant contributions to international fraternity and peace, with past recipients ranging from Nelson Mandela to Malala Yousafzai, though some choices have sparked controversy. Thousands can nominate candidates, including government members and former laureates, but the committee's deliberations are secret, adding to the anticipation. Despite Trump's repeated assertions of deserving the prize, observers suggest the Gaza ceasefire's timing might be too late to influence this year's outcome, as sustained peace efforts are typically valued over quick political wins.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. rare earth and critical mineral miners surged after China imposed stricter export restrictions on products containing rare earths and related technology, fueling market speculation. Beijing's new rules, requiring licenses for exports, intensified hopes that the Trump administration will increase investment in a domestic supply chain to counter China's global dominance. The White House has already taken equity stakes in major U.S. miners like MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals, marking a significant push to bolster the domestic industry. This action reinforces the urgency for forward-leaning U.S. industrial policy to secure critical mineral supply chains, vital for national security and various advanced technologies.

          <p>Robert Roberson, convicted in 2002 for the death of his 2-year-old daughter Nikki, has been granted a stay of execution by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, just one week before his scheduled lethal injection. Roberson's defense argues his innocence, claiming Nikki died from severe pneumonia exacerbated by medication, not shaken baby syndrome as initially diagnosed. The court's ruling mandates a review of his arguments under Texas' "junk science" law, which allows relief if evidence used in conviction is no longer credible due to new research. This development follows similar cases where shaken baby syndrome diagnoses have been re-evaluated, leading to exonerations and highlighting evolving scientific understanding in forensic evidence.</p>
