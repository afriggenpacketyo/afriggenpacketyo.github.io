          <p>Former President Trump has publicly scolded Walmart after the retail giant warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices, asserting that the company should absorb the costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Trump called on Walmart to "EAT THE TARIFFS" and maintain lower prices, despite the company's claim that tariffs, even at reduced levels, would impact their ability to keep prices down. Walmart has stated it will do its best to keep prices low, but cannot absorb all the pressure from the tariffs. This dispute highlights the ongoing tension between the former president's trade policies and their potential effects on American consumers.</p>

The staging was fun but lacked the scale of other performances. The band's friendship and positive energy were evident, and the UK laid good foundations, but ultimately failed to capture enough public votes.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler has surged to the lead at the US PGA Championship after a stellar third round, positioning himself as the favorite to win.
