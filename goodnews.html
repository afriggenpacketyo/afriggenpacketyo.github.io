          <p>Ahead of their upcoming boxing match, Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. and Jake Paul are both insisting that their fight is a genuine contest and not a staged event. For the 39-year-old Ch√°vez Jr., the fight represents a serious opportunity to revitalize his career after a period of personal challenges and rehabilitation. Meanwhile, Paul, a social media influencer turned boxer, aims to solidify his legitimacy in the sport by defeating a member of a legendary boxing family. Both fighters have dismissed skepticism, emphasizing that they are preparing intensely for a real and consequential bout.</p>

          <p>A prominent economist from China International Capital Corporation has suggested that China's existing third-party payment platforms, like WeChat and Alipay, provide the nation with a significant comparative advantage in the global stablecoin race. According to Peng Wensheng, these platforms function similarly to stablecoins by being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and are supported by a mature regulatory framework. He argues that their stability is reinforced by strict safeguards, including customer funds being backed by central bank money, positioning China favorably as stablecoins become more central to global finance.

          <p>Harvard University has partnered with the University of Toronto to create a backup plan for its international graduate students who may be barred from entering the United States. This move comes in response to potential U.S. visa restrictions and a legal battle with the Department of Homeland Security over student records. Under the plan, affected students from Harvard's Kennedy School could continue their studies as visiting students at Toronto's Munk School, taking courses from both faculties. The initiative aims to provide stability and educational continuity for students amid growing uncertainty over U.S. immigration policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique avoids the need for open-skull surgery, a method used by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink, thereby reducing risk and recovery time. In the trial, a 67-year-old patient paralyzed by a stroke regained some limb movement after a stent electrode was inserted into his brain's vasculature via a neck vein. This advancement represents a significant potential shift in neurotechnology, offering a safer alternative for treating paralysis.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, extending their winning streak despite what their manager described as a flawed performance. The game saw starting pitcher Dustin May struggle, defensive errors, and inconsistent offense from key players. However, a leadoff home run and a game-tying triple from Shohei Ohtani, along with a two-run homer by Max Muncy, provided enough firepower. A game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth inning sealed the victory, highlighting the team's ability to win even when not playing at its best.</p>

Sources close to Acheampong, an academy product who signed a new five-year contract last year, have also dismissed suggestions of his frustration at the club.

A farewell ceremony drew thousands of visitors, marking a poignant moment for the zoo, which has had a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994.

The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security, assessed a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. While researchers note that further study is needed, they suggest that certain components of the diet, such as omega-3 fatty acids in fish and nutrients in seaweed and soy, may contribute to improved mental well-being.

The dark comedy follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and dysfunctional relationships, addressing taboo subjects with a bleakly humorous tone. Sadler, the writer, explains that the new series will be even more intense, influenced by their all-female upbringing and what she describes as the "bleak" modern dating scene. The show satirizes the idea of being single as the characters' worst nightmare, a theme fueled by online trends.</p>
