        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a fresh record high for the third consecutive day, demonstrating remarkable resilience amid broader market losses across Asia. This upward trend is primarily fueled by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., allowing the Kospi to reach an intraday high of 3,794.87. The positive performance stands in stark contrast to other Asia-Pacific markets, which traded weaker due to intensifying fears over the U.S. banking sector and global trade tensions. This article suggests a unique economic buoyancy in South Korea, driven by specific trade developments despite a challenging international financial climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former members of the UK military will now be able to apply for a digital version of their identity cards, starting Friday, marking a significant step in modernizing public services. Approximately 1.8 million veterans are eligible to download this new digital ID to their smartphones, which ministers suggest could serve as a "case study" for a planned wider scheme for all British citizens by 2029. While physical cards will still be issued, the digital version aims to provide easier and more secure access to public services, including healthcare, housing support, careers advice, and various discounts. This initiative is part of broader government efforts to streamline identification and combat illegal working.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Max Scherzer delivered a vintage performance, and Andrés Giménez contributed significantly with a home run and four RBIs, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to an 8-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners. This crucial win evens the American League Championship Series at two games apiece, shifting momentum back to Toronto. Scherzer, making his 500th career start at 41, allowed only two runs over five and two-thirds innings, demonstrating his enduring skill and strategic importance. The Blue Jays' offense, which scored 13 runs in Game 3, continued its momentum in Seattle, setting the stage for a pivotal Game 5 in the best-of-seven series.</p>

The impressive sales occurred despite heightened competition from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi, which are aggressively expanding in the higher-end market amidst a challenging economic climate.

          <p>A long-acting injection to prevent HIV, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use on the NHS in England and Wales, aligning with existing policy in Scotland and marking a significant advancement in public health. Administered every other month, this injection offers a convenient and discreet alternative to daily pills for HIV-negative individuals at high risk of contracting the virus. Experts hope this "game-changing" treatment will significantly contribute to the UK's ambition of ending new HIV cases by 2030, particularly benefiting vulnerable populations for whom oral PrEP is challenging to adhere to. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) anticipates offering the jab in NHS-operated sexual health clinics in the coming months, expanding access to vital prevention.</p>

          <p>The article explores a significant cultural shift that has made discussing sweat less taboo, largely influenced by celebrities like Alan Carr, Emma Stone, and Adele openly sharing their experiences with perspiration. This normalization is further driven by the rise of wellness trends, such as saunas becoming popular networking hubs for professionals, and the beauty industry actively promoting a "sweaty makeup" aesthetic. While scientists remain skeptical about claims of "sweating out toxins," they universally acknowledge sweat's crucial physiological role in regulating body temperature and its evolutionary importance.

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, marking a significant judicial check on executive power. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals panel found the deployment a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment and deemed the administration "unlikely to succeed" in proving a "rebellion" or inability to enforce laws with regular forces. Trump had argued troops were needed for crime prevention in Chicago and to protect federal immigration facilities, describing Chicago as a "war zone."
