          <p>Recent developments in the financial sector suggest a strong rebound in dealmaking activity, which is considered a positive sign for investors in major investment banks like Goldman Sachs. The firm was recently selected as a financial advisor in the historic $55 billion leveraged buyout of video game publisher Electronic Arts, reinforcing its top position in mergers and acquisitions. Additionally, competitor Jefferies reported record third-quarter advisory fees, further indicating a healthier environment for investment banking that had been suppressed by higher interest rates and economic uncertainty.

          <p>California-based startup Aetherflux is advancing the concept of space-based solar power by developing a constellation of satellites designed to collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth using infrared lasers. Led by Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt and backed by investors like Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the company plans its first launch on a SpaceX rocket next year. The technology aims to provide power to a network of small ground stations, with the Department of Defense as an initial key market for powering remote battlefield operations. The primary challenge remains making the technology cost-competitive with traditional energy sources on a broader scale.</p>

          <p>In response to the growing consumer trend of increasing daily protein intake, Starbucks has launched a new line of Protein Lattes and Protein Cold Foam. These new beverages offer between 15 and 36 grams of protein, providing a convenient option for customers, particularly those who might otherwise skip breakfast. While nutrition experts acknowledge the potential benefits for certain individuals, such as athletes, they caution that these drinks should not be considered meal replacements as they lack other essential nutrients like fiber. Experts also advise consumers to be mindful of the added sugar content in some of these coffee-based protein drinks.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has proposed a plan to resume processing new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for the first time in four years. If approved by a federal judge, the program would reopen to first-time applicants in all states except Texas, where a lawsuit challenging DACA's legality is ongoing. Under the proposal, existing DACA recipients in Texas could maintain their deportation protections but would lose their work authorization. The move follows years of legal battles that have left the program in a state of uncertainty, though immigrant advocates caution that the proposal is not yet final.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an agreement with pharmaceutical company Pfizer to voluntarily lower the prices of its medications in the United States. Under the deal, Pfizer will sell drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations and will invest $70 billion in U.S.-based manufacturing and research. In return, the company will receive a three-year exemption from pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. The agreement is part of the administration's push for "most-favored-nation" pricing, and the White House is in negotiations with other drugmakers, such as Eli Lilly, to secure similar deals to reduce healthcare costs for American consumers.</p>

Their efforts helped India post a competitive total of 269-8 in the rain-shortened game. Sri Lanka's chase started promisingly but faltered after the dismissal of their captain, Chamari Athapaththu.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When considering debt settlement as a solution for overwhelming debt, it is crucial to distinguish reputable programs from potentially harmful ones. A trustworthy debt settlement company should possess professional accreditation from organizations like the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators and maintain a good standing with the Better Business Bureau. They are legally prohibited from charging upfront fees and must be transparent about their fee structure, the risks involved, and the realistic timeline for the process. A safe program will also ensure that the dedicated escrow account for settlement funds is federally insured and remains under the consumer's control.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate reduction by the Federal Reserve, borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. Currently, an $80,000 HELOC with today's average rate of 7.88% would result in an approximate monthly payment of $966 for a 10-year repayment period or $759 for a 15-year period. These costs are notably lower than they were in previous months when interest rates were higher. Because HELOCs have variable rates, these payments could decrease further with future Fed cuts, though borrowers should also prepare for the possibility of rates rising. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widely misunderstood "7-year rule" for credit card debt primarily relates to how long negative information can remain on a consumer's credit report. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, most delinquent debts, charge-offs, and collections must be removed after seven years from the initial delinquency date, which can help improve a person's credit score. This rule often aligns with state statutes of limitations, which typically bar creditors from suing to collect old debts after a similar period. However, the debt itself does not legally disappear, and collectors may still attempt to contact the individual for payment, making it important for consumers to understand their rights.</p>
