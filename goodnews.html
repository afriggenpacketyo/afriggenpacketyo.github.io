          <p>South Korea's new presidential administration is signaling strong support for its domestic shipbuilding industry, which it describes as being in a "major crisis." President Lee Jae-myung has pledged to transform the nation into a leading global maritime power. Policy guidelines focus on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through increased digitalization and automation. This strategic push comes as both South Korea and Japan position themselves to compete more effectively, particularly as the United States targets China's dominance in the global shipbuilding market.</p>

The British player pushed the three-time major champion to her limits in a captivating match, demonstrating that she is closing the gap with the sport's top elite. Although emotional after the defeat, Raducanu expressed pride in her effort and noted the significant progress she has made in recent months.

          <p>The act of crying at work is increasingly being viewed as a sign of emotional intelligence rather than weakness, challenging traditional notions of professionalism. This article explores the changing perceptions, noting that while some still fear it could harm promotion prospects, many employers now see compassion and understanding as key to a motivated workforce. The discussion includes anecdotes from both men and women who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal news. Experts suggest that showing vulnerability can be a powerful tool for leaders, humanizing them and demonstrating that they care deeply about their work.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters to hibernate, burning the fat and releasing the carbon deep underwater. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, stores as much carbon as the annual emissions of about 55 million cars. The discovery highlights the Southern Ocean's critical role in absorbing excess heat, though growing threats to these vital creatures are a cause for concern.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. The chick is one of ten hatched at the zoo this year, a significant event for the species, which is listed as vulnerable to extinction. Zoo experts distributed eggs among different nests to improve survival chances, entrusting one to the male couple. This instance is another example of same-sex penguin pairs acting as successful foster parents, a behavior observed in zoos around the world. The zoo's penguin colony plays an important role in the international breeding program for the at-risk species.</p>

          <p>Germany started its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was a positive start, the team's performance was marred by an injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears after a knee injury in the first half. Given her history of two previous ACL injuries, her availability for the rest of the tournament is in serious doubt, casting a shadow over the victory. The match saw Brand score her first-ever tournament goal, a crucial step up as the team looks for new leaders following recent high-profile retirements.</p>

          <p>Within Global South-focused alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS, India is emerging as a significant counterweight to China's leadership ambitions. Both organizations require consensus for decision-making, a rule that frequently allows India to assert its own strategic interests. A recent example occurred when SCO defense ministers failed to adopt a joint statement due to a lack of consensus on language related to terrorism, a key issue for India. This dynamic highlights the complex relationship between the two Asian giants as they compete for influence within these multilateral forums.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks outlines five "toxic" food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli meats because of nitrates and sodium. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes, and deep-fried foods cooked in reused industrial oils. The article advocates for healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins to build healthy eating habits from childhood.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team kept their T20 series against India alive with a dramatic five-run, last-ball victory at The Oval.

The match featured a stunning momentum shift, with India in control before a fast-bowling spell from Lauren Filer, who dismissed two key batters, turned the tide.
