          <p>NBA star LeBron James has addressed rumors about his future after he was seen practicing at the facility of his former team, the Cleveland Cavaliers. James, who recently exercised his player option for the 2025-26 season, clarified that the practice session was not indicative of a potential team change. He explained on social media that he still lives in the area during the offseason and has trained at that same facility every summer since it was built, telling speculators they were simply bored.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri with his final lap in a windy and challenging qualifying session. Piastri secured a surprise second place, with his teammate Lando Norris close behind in third, signaling a strong performance from McLaren. The session was highly competitive, with Mercedes' George Russell and Lewis Hamilton finishing fourth and fifth, respectively. Verstappen noted that his team's low-downforce setup made the car difficult to handle but ultimately proved effective.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared her decision to raise her two children as a single mother, a choice she made after deep self-reflection. Theron explained that her own upbringing in a family affected by alcoholism and her tendency to lose herself in relationships led her to realize she was not equipped to have children with a partner. Relationship experts support her decision, framing it as a sign of strength and self-awareness, noting that modern women with sufficient resources can choose not to repeat unhealthy cycles.</p>

          <p>The increasing use of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options has led to a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation," leaving many customers confused and pressured. This article explores how technology, which became more prevalent during the pandemic, has expanded tip requests to new environments like fast-food counters and self-service kiosks. Experts note that while these systems can increase tip amounts, they can also irritate customers who feel guilted into tipping. The design of these interfaces often defaults to tipping, making it socially awkward to opt out.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a ceasefire in its war with Israel, stating it is prepared to enter negotiations on implementation. The proposal, backed by President Trump, outlines a potential two-month truce. While President Trump expressed optimism that a deal could be reached soon, sources indicate Hamas is still seeking firm guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with President Trump to discuss the deal.</p>

          <p>England and Wales face a significant challenge at Euro 2025, having been drawn into what experts are calling the tournament's "toughest group" alongside France and the Netherlands. This means three of the four teams in Group D are ranked in the world's top 11. While England are defending champions and the Netherlands won in 2017, France is on an impressive eight-game winning streak. As the lowest-ranked team in the competition, Wales embraces its underdog status, hoping to leverage it against formidable opponents in their first major tournament.</p>

          <p>A non-alcoholic "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming it can lower the body's primary stress hormone. The drink typically includes ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that this combination can meaningfully reduce cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, doctors emphasize that proven stress-reduction methods like quality sleep, exercise, and social connection are far more effective.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai, an innovative Chinese typewriter from the 1940s, has been rediscovered, exciting scholars. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the machine was a crucial step towards modern Chinese computing, solving the challenge of typing a language with thousands of characters instead of an alphabet. The typewriter's design, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, is a foundational concept in today's East Asian input methods, representing a successful fusion of technology and cultural preservation.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University, scientists at the Chapple Big Fish Lab are working to change the public's negative perception of sharks while studying their vital role in marine ecosystems. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team researches hundreds of sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay. By examining the contents of a shark's stomach, a process that involves inducing the shark to regurgitate, researchers can assess the animal's health, which serves as an indicator for the overall health of the ocean. The lab's work aims to generate support for the conservation of these often-misunderstood creatures.</p>

          <h2>Happiness Researcher Promotes '90-Second Rule' for Managing Negative Emotions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. The concept is based on neuroscientific findings that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a rush of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After that, any prolonged feeling of anger is a choice made by replaying the negative thought. Gawdat suggests allowing yourself that minute and a half to feel the emotion, and then consciously choosing to move on, a practice he believes can lead to a more fulfilled life.</p>
