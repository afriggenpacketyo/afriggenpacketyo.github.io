          <p>President Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting that the U.S. would maintain control of the steelmaker while Nippon invests $14 billion in U.S. facilities. Trump announced a plan to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% and promised no layoffs or outsourcing, with U.S. Steel maintaining full capacity for at least 10 years. He portrayed himself as a skilled dealmaker, claiming he rejected previous offers from Nippon until realizing their commitment to investing in America. The Biden administration previously blocked the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel over national security concerns.</p>

The road where the truck overturned was closed for 24 to 48 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee.</p>

The Rugby Football League and Members of Parliament are calling for the honours system to recognize the contributions of rugby league players. Critics suggest that class prejudice may be a factor in the sport's lack of recognition compared to rugby union. Rugby union, often seen as having more middle-class roots, has received knighthoods for more than 100 years.</p>
