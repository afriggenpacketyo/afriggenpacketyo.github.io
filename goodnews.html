          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rise after President Donald Trump approved the company's merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent on a national security agreement. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over key decisions such as relocating headquarters, moving production or jobs outside the U.S., renaming the company, and idling plants prematurely. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick elaborated on the government's rights, while Trump described the deal as a "partnership," though U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. All regulatory approvals have been secured, and the transaction is expected to close promptly.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's Proba-3 mission has achieved a new milestone by using two spacecraft to create an artificial solar eclipse, providing unprecedented views of the sun's corona. Consisting of the Occulter and Coronagraph spacecraft, the mission blocks out the sun's light, allowing scientists to observe the corona from a close proximity. This mission aims to address the mystery of the solar corona's high temperature compared to the sun's surface, and it also tests new space technology with autonomous precision flying. Combined with data from NASA's Parker Solar Probe and the Solar Orbiter, astronomers are gaining new insights into solar weather and the sun's magnetic field.</p>

          <p>Savings experts are weighing in on the most beneficial certificate of deposit (CD) term to consider ahead of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. While elevated rates have benefited savers, CD rates have recently inched downward, and further cuts may occur later in the year. Locking in the best CD rates now is crucial, but choosing the right CD term depends on individual circumstances. Short-term CDs may offer the highest interest rates currently, while long-term CDs provide longer-term security and predictability, and CD laddering offers a mix of both strategies, and this is not investment advice.</p>

At nearly 14 feet long and weighing 1,653 pounds, Contender was tagged by OCEARCH scientists in January off the Florida-Georgia coast. The shark's visit coincides with the time of year when great whites migrate north to warmer waters for a larger food supply.

          <p>New York City has completed a new elevated waterfront park designed to protect the community from flooding. The park acts as a "wall" to safeguard the area behind it, while also providing new recreational access for residents. The project, developed in collaboration with city and federal officials, aims to enhance community resilience against rising sea levels and extreme weather events. The park is designed to integrate flood protection measures with public space, offering both safety and enjoyment for the community.</p>
