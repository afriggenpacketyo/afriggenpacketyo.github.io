          <p>Many young people in China are postponing retirement plans due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and pressures related to housing and marriage, focusing instead on immediate concerns. The Chinese government has been urging young people to plan early for retirement, citing the long-term risks of an aging population and a strained pension system. However, most young employees feel that retirement is too distant to prioritize in a rapidly changing world, preferring to concentrate on their current well-being. A recent study highlighted the importance of the newly expanded personal pension system, a voluntary program aimed at encouraging individuals to build up retirement savings.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence to manage the complexities of global trade, particularly in response to tariff fluctuations.

While AI is a powerful tool, experts caution that its success depends on the quality of the data it accesses, and it should be seen as an enabler rather than a complete solution. </p>

          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay, a departure from previous generations known for their dedication to employers. A study indicates that approximately 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to admit it. The desire for more 'me time' is a primary motivation, as young people seek to balance work with personal interests and experiences. This shift reflects a changing attitude towards work, with a focus on personal well-being and a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers overcame a three-run ninth-inning blown save and a rain delay to defeat the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, but the victory came at a cost to their already strained pitching staff. Clayton Kershaw's start was limited to two innings due to a rain delay, forcing the bullpen to cover 11 innings. Despite the challenges, Teoscar Hern√°ndez's RBI double in the 13th inning secured the win for the Dodgers. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the usage of the bullpen would require careful management in the coming days, but he praised the resilience and performance of several relievers.</p>
