          <p>Representative Mikie Sherrill, campaigning for New Jersey governor, suggested the possibility of a third impeachment for President Donald Trump to prevent Republican actions after the 2026 midterms. Speaking at a campaign event, Sherrill, who voted for both of Trump's previous impeachments, responded to audience encouragement with a playful "Maybe we‚Äôll go for the trifecta." This statement comes as Representative Shri Thanedar filed new impeachment articles against Trump, alleging abuses of power. Sherrill emphasized the importance of state-level actions to counter Trump's agenda, highlighting the role of federalism in challenging the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst concerns about inflation, housing affordability, and navigating relations with the United States and China, with voters indicating that economic issues are their primary concern. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton are competing to address the cost-of-living crisis, but neither party has proposed ambitious solutions, as the country grapples with global economic and political turmoil originating from Washington. The election also highlights a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates and minor parties, and opposition leader Dutton has mirrored some policies of President Trump, including denouncing "wokeness."</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to weaken the Hong Kong dollar, which had strengthened due to increased capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion to maintain the local currency's trading band. This intervention occurred ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, potentially driving further capital into Hong Kong.

          <p>Vietnam is implementing administrative reforms to reduce government spending, streamline bureaucracy, and consolidate political power under the Communist Party leadership. These reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media outlets, and eliminating approximately 100,000 public sector jobs. The changes are intended to address economic stagnation and dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign. Additionally, Vietnam is responding to external pressures, including potential US tariffs, by strengthening political governance and economic resilience. The reforms also coincide with preparations for the Communist Party's 14th National Congress in 2026, potentially benefiting current party chief To Lam.</p>

          <p>The elimination of tariff exemptions for inexpensive goods from China is reducing advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. Temu and Shein, which relied on the de minimis loophole to ship goods valued at less than $800 tariff-free, have significantly decreased their online advertising spending. Temu has stopped shipping directly from China to the US, and Shein has not yet commented on the changes. Meta CFO Susan Li noted that some Asian retailers had already reduced their U.S. advertising spending in anticipation of the tariff changes, which could impact Meta's revenue, as advertisers from China had been one of the company's fastest-growing segments.</p>

          <p>South Africa's coastlines face threats from rising sea levels, but new research indicates that parts of the country are slowly lifting out of the ocean due to drought and groundwater loss. Scientists estimate that some areas are rising by two millimeters each year, counteracting the effects of rising seas. While this uplift may seem beneficial, geoscientists caution against optimism, noting that it comes at the expense of less water availability on the land surface. The study's insights could improve drought and flood monitoring, guide groundwater management, and inform climate adaptation efforts.</p>

Both Labour and the Conservatives experienced major losses, failing to retain any previously held councils. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens also saw increases in their number of councillors. The mayoral contests presented a mixed picture, with Labour retaining three positions, the Conservatives gaining one, and Reform UK securing the two newly-created mayoralties.
