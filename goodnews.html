          <p>As part of a U.S.-brokered peace plan, Hamas has released the last of its living hostages, bringing an end to a two-year captivity for many. The agreement, which also involves Israel releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, marks a significant step toward ending the long-running conflict. World leaders, including former President Trump, gathered in Egypt to oversee the finalization of the deal. This first phase of the plan is intended to lead to a permanent ceasefire and subsequent negotiations on the future governance and rebuilding of Gaza.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Science journalist Mindy Weisberger's book, "Rise of the Zombie Bugs," explores the phenomenon of real-life zombification, where parasites manipulate their hosts' behavior for their own benefit. Examples include fungi that force flies to climb high for spore dispersal and flatworms that make snails more visible to birds, their next host. This research into parasitic mind-control offers more than just horror-story inspiration; it provides valuable insights into complex biological processes. Scientists are studying these mechanisms to better understand immune system suppression, which could inform new medical treatments, and to develop targeted, environmentally-safe methods of pest control.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt have been awarded the Nobel memorial prize in economics for their research into how innovation fuels economic growth. Their work provides a deeper understanding of "creative destruction," the process where new technologies replace older ones, driving progress. Mokyr, an economic historian, focused on long-term trends, while Aghion and Howitt developed mathematical models to explain the mechanisms behind sustained growth. The Nobel committee highlighted that their research demonstrates that economic growth is not guaranteed and requires upholding the processes that foster innovation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed its 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which includes a provision strongly encouraging the invitation of Taiwan's navy to the Rim of the Pacific (Rimpac) military exercise. This marks a significant step in U.S. support for Taiwan amid rising military pressure from Beijing. The defense bill also authorizes $1 billion for the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative, expanding its scope to include combat casualty care. The bipartisan passage of the bill signals Washington's firm commitment to deterring aggression in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>England's rugby league head coach, Shaun Wane, has named the final 24-man squad for the upcoming Ashes Test series against Australia. The selection includes Hull KR's Grand Final-winning trio Mikey Lewis, Jez Litten, and Joe Burgess, with Burgess returning to the national team after a decade-long absence. However, Super League's Man of Steel winner, Jake Connor, was notably omitted from the team. The squad features a mix of talent from both the Super League and Australia's NRL, including six NRL-based players like AJ Brimson and Dom Young.</p>

          <p>According to Chen Li, an economist at Soochow Securities, China's stock market is poised to remain on course despite ongoing trade tensions and tariff threats from the Trump administration. Speaking at a strategy meeting, Chen argued that the foundation of the current global bull market is a weakening U.S. dollar, a factor that mitigates the impact of trade disputes. He suggested that investors have become largely "immune" to the constant threat of higher duties, viewing recent market corrections as temporary jitters rather than fundamental shifts.

          <p>After Hamas released all living hostages as part of the initial phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan, attention now turns to the complex subsequent stages. The 20-point plan calls for the complete demilitarization of Gaza and its governance by a temporary committee of Palestinian technocrats, eventually transitioning to a reformed Palestinian Authority. Key sticking points remain, including Hamas's refusal to disarm and disagreements over the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal. The plan's success hinges on navigating these contentious issues in upcoming negotiations, with the ultimate goal of establishing a permanent end to the war.</p>

The specific praise for Powell is seen as a significant boost for the adviser, who has faced domestic political pressure on other matters.

          <p>As the Milwaukee Brewers prepare to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series, the narrative of underdog versus powerhouse is taking center stage. Brewers manager Pat Murphy has humorously played into this theme, contrasting his team's small-market status with the Dodgers' 'shoestring budget' and star-studded roster. Despite the Brewers having a better regular-season record and sweeping the Dodgers, projections still heavily favor Los Angeles. The series pits a model of consistent, smart management against a team with a seemingly unlimited payroll, creating a compelling storyline for baseball fans.</p>

          <p>The recent suspension and subsequent reinstatement of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel has unexpectedly highlighted the genre's enduring cultural and political relevance. After Disney, ABC's parent company, suspended Kimmel following pressure from the FCC over comments about Trump supporters, a significant public backlash from artists and viewers led to his return. The incident energized Kimmel and his fellow late-night hosts, who have increasingly become passionate critics of the Trump administration. This renewed focus on speaking truth to power may offer a path for late-night television to reassert its importance in a fragmented media landscape.</p>
