          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has announced he will personally fund the education of 22 children from the Poonch district in Jammu and Kashmir who were orphaned during the May military conflict between India and Pakistan. This humanitarian gesture follows a visit by Gandhi to the region, where he met with families affected by the cross-border shelling. The conflict, which was sparked by a deadly attack on tourists in April, resulted in numerous civilian casualties, with the border district of Poonch being particularly hard-hit. This action comes as Gandhi settles into his new role as the Leader of the Opposition in India's parliament following recent elections.</p>

          <p>South Korean AI chip startup Rebellions, a firm positioned as a domestic rival to Nvidia, has secured a new investment from Samsung as part of a larger funding round. The company is seeking to raise between $150 million and $200 million to fuel product development and scale its operations ahead of a planned initial public offering. Rebellions, which focuses on designing chips for AI inferencing, has been collaborating with Samsung to manufacture its next-generation "Rebel" chip using an advanced 4-nanometer process. The investment and partnership are strategic for both companies, potentially boosting Samsung's foundry business while providing Rebellions with the backing to compete globally.

          <h2>Major Airports in China's Greater Bay Area Surpass Pre-Pandemic Passenger Levels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 05:30:08 EDT</div>

          <p>Passenger traffic at the international airports in Guangzhou and Shenzhen has exceeded pre-COVID levels in the first half of 2025, signaling a robust recovery in China's aviation sector. Guangzhou's Baiyun Airport handled over 40 million passengers, a 9.2% year-on-year increase, while Shenzhen's Baoan Airport served 32.55 million, up 10.8%. This strong performance, reflecting vibrant business activity and tourism in the Greater Bay Area, contrasts with Hong Kong International Airport, which, despite growth, remains below its 2019 passenger numbers. The data suggests a potential shift in the regional aviation landscape, with mainland airports gaining a competitive edge.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, a level it has held throughout 2025. While the Fed's rate has remained stable, this article examines its mixed impact on consumer borrowing costs during the first half of the year. Average credit card rates have seen a slight decrease, while auto loan rates have been largely unmoved. Meanwhile, 30-year fixed mortgage rates, which are more influenced by Treasury yields, have fluctuated between 6.6% and 7.1%. Economists note there is no guarantee that a future Fed rate cut would directly translate into lower borrowing costs for most Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fans of the late heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne will have a final opportunity to pay their respects as his funeral cortege travels through his hometown of Birmingham. The procession will take place on Wednesday, making its way along Broad Street to the Black Sabbath Bridge and bench, which has become a memorial site for the singer. Osbourne, who passed away at 76, was a celebrated figure in the city, described by the Lord Mayor as a "son of Birmingham" who put the city on the global map. The public event, funded by the Osbourne family, precedes a private funeral and allows fans to be part of the final farewell.</p>

          <p>UK utility firm Anglian Water will pay £62.8 million after an investigation by the regulator Ofwat uncovered a "serious breach" in its management of sewage treatment facilities. The investigation found that failures in operation and maintenance led to excessive sewage spills from storm overflows, which Ofwat deemed unacceptable. Instead of a direct fine, the company has agreed to invest £57 million to improve its wastewater network and contribute £5.8 million to a community environmental fund. The penalty comes as water companies face intense criticism for underinvestment and pollution while raising customer bills to fund necessary infrastructure upgrades.</p>

          <p>A weekly roundup of restaurant health inspections in Lake County, Florida, for July 21-27 shows a mixed record of compliance with state standards. While one establishment, The Hungry Camper in Clermont, received a perfect score with no violations, eight other restaurants were cited for high-priority violations. These serious infractions included issues like improper food temperature control, incorrect storage of toxic chemicals, and the presence of roaches. The report, which serves as a public service since Florida restaurants are not required to post inspection results, highlights the ongoing efforts by regulators to ensure food safety and hygiene in public eateries.</p>

This article explores the line between genuine chemistry and manufactured publicity, citing other examples like Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey.

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has announced plans to tighten oversight and phase out outdated capacity in key manufacturing sectors like electric vehicles and solar power. The move is part of a broader government effort to address what it calls "neijuan," or excessive internal competition, and low-quality, cut-price production that has become rampant in these industries. The ministry stated it will use upgraded mandatory national standards to force out inefficient producers. This policy shift aims to consolidate industries and improve the overall quality and competitiveness of China's manufacturing base, while also promoting hi-tech consumer goods to boost domestic demand.

          <p>Google is launching a significant new feature in the UK called "AI Mode," which generates conversational, summary-style answers to user queries instead of the traditional list of blue links. This optional tool, powered by Google's Gemini AI, is a response to the changing ways people seek information and the rise of AI chatbots. The shift is causing concern among publishers and businesses who rely on traffic from Google search results for revenue, as AI summaries may reduce the need for users to click through to external websites. Google has not yet finalized how advertising will work within this new mode, creating uncertainty for the digital economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union could unexpectedly benefit the United Kingdom, according to some economic analysts. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on most EU goods, while the U.K. has separately secured a lower 10% rate, making British exports to the U.S. relatively cheaper. This could incentivize U.S. importers to favor British products and may even encourage some EU-based manufacturers to shift production to the U.K. to avoid the higher levy. While the actual impact remains to be seen, the 5% tariff differential presents a potential competitive advantage for the U.K. in the transatlantic trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant shift in global manufacturing supply chains, India has overtaken China to become the leading exporter of smartphones to the United States, according to research from Canalys. In the second quarter of 2025, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from just 13% a year prior. This surge is primarily driven by Apple's strategy to diversify its production away from China amid ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainty. In contrast, China's share of smartphone exports to the U.S. fell from 61% to 25% over the same period, highlighting a broader trend of manufacturers moving final assembly to other nations.

Created in Japan in 1974, the Monchhichi became a global phenomenon in the 1980s but was unavailable behind the Iron Curtain. To meet demand, a state-owned enterprise in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) produced its own version, the Tiemi. While similar in appearance, the Tiemi was a distinct product that became popular throughout the Eastern Bloc. Today, these GDR-era dolls have become nostalgic collectors' items, representing a unique piece of Cold War-era consumer culture.</p>

The strong performance was driven by its investment banking division, which saw a 10% year-on-year increase in income to £3.3 billion. Like other major banks, Barclays benefited from increased market volatility related to U.S. tariff policies, which boosted trading revenues in fixed income and currencies. The results show that the bank's strategy to focus on its investment banking strengths is paying off, even as it faces a shifting domestic banking landscape and potential new U.S. capital rules.
