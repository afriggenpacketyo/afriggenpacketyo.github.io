          <p>President Trump announced that Elon Musk's official role in the administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will end on May 30, but hinted at Musk's ongoing involvement. Trump praised Musk and stated he will "always be with us, helping all the way." Musk's tenure at DOGE, which began in January, is ending due to the legal 130-day limit for his "special government employee" designation. Despite criticism from Democrats, DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, and markets have reacted positively to Musk's return to the private sector.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japanese authorities are expected to issue a public notice easing the ban, which has been in place since August 2023, and open registration for Japanese facilities that process marine products. Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. This agreement marks a significant milestone, though it may take a few months for shipments to begin due to registration and radiation checks.</p>
