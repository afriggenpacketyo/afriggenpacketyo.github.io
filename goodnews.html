          <p>Japan has enacted a law requiring 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in April 2026. The law targets firms producing over 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually, covering approximately 60% of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will receive emission allowances, and those exceeding their limits must purchase carbon credits, incentivizing emissions reduction. While designed to lower emissions, the system could lead to price increases for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable for an unusual characteristic: existing shareholders are selling a larger portion of shares than the company itself. In Circle's offering, 60% of the shares are being sold by existing shareholders, reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. One potential reason for this is the extended period of poor returns for venture capital firms, leading to a strong desire for liquidity. Circle, however, is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, making the decision less about financial necessity and more about investor appetite for exits.</p>

While many agree that the initial vaccine course offered significant protection, the need for yearly shots against new variants is more contentious.

          <p>A judge has struck down an executive order by President Trump targeting the law firm WilmerHale, marking another legal victory for firms resisting the administration's crackdown. The judge ruled that the order, intended to punish the firm for its association with Robert Mueller, was unconstitutional. Despite the ruling, the firm had already suffered due to the order, with clients curtailing their relationships. The decision validates the strategy of fighting back against the administration rather than caving to pressure.</p>
