Speaking after the Fed's recent quarter-point reduction, Tepper warned that lowering rates too aggressively while inflation remains a concern could reignite price pressures and create asset bubbles. He stated that he remains invested in the stock market for now, acknowledging the difficulty of betting against an easing Fed, but expressed unease with high market valuations, noting that "nothing's cheap anymore."

          <p>Renowned football manager José Mourinho has been appointed as the new head coach of Benfica on a contract extending until the summer of 2027. This marks a return to the Lisbon-based club where he began his managerial career in 2000, though his initial tenure lasted only ten games. Mourinho, who was recently dismissed by Turkish club Fenerbahce, inherits a team that is currently sixth in the Primeira Liga. Known for his extensive trophy-winning record across Europe, his appointment is seen as a move by Benfica to instill a winning mentality back into the squad.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating that the government's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." The administration had claimed it was acting on requests from the children's families and the Guatemalan government to facilitate reunification, but the court found no evidence to support this. The ruling came after an emergency lawsuit was filed to stop the deportations as the minors were already on planes in Texas. This decision reaffirms legal protections that treat unaccompanied minors differently from adults who cross the border illegally.</p>

          <p>For the first time in South America, scientists have discovered prehistoric insects, including ancient beetles, flies, and wasps, preserved in 112-million-year-old amber. The find, located at a quarry in Ecuador, provides a rare look into the ecosystems of the supercontinent Gondwana during the age of dinosaurs. Researchers say these specimens are like "little windows into the past," offering crucial evidence about the co-evolution of insects and the flowering plants that were beginning to diversify at the time. The amber also contained fossilized pollen and leaves, indicating the area was once a humid, resinous forest different from today's Amazon.</p>

          <p>This article explores the philosophy of 17th-century thinker Baruch Spinoza as a tool for managing the emotional impact of modern-day criticism and online attacks. Spinoza advocated for using rational thought to understand and control emotional reactions, a process now known as metacognition, to avoid being a "prey to his emotions." By moving the experience of fear or anger from the brain's primitive limbic system to the analytical prefrontal cortex, one can achieve equanimity. The article offers practical advice based on his teachings, such as pausing before reacting and analyzing feelings objectively, to maintain composure in the face of public reproval.</p>

His agent, Rich Kleiman, humorously noted that being locked out of the account has been unintentionally profitable, as they have been unable to sell any of the cryptocurrency while its value has surged dramatically. Bitcoin was trading for under $1,000 for most of 2016 and is now valued at over $100,000. Kleiman confirmed they are working with Coinbase to recover the account, in which both he and Durant are also investors.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of 2025, mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low, providing potential savings for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For a $500,000 mortgage with a 30-year fixed term, the current average rate of 6.13% results in a monthly principal and interest payment of about $3,040. This is approximately $300 less per month compared to the start of the year, when rates were above 7%. This reduction in borrowing costs can significantly improve affordability for new buyers and create valuable refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of St. Andrews have pinpointed a group of brain cells that act as a "mileage clock," tracking the distance an individual travels. By recording the brain activity of rats running in an arena, they observed that specific cells fired in a regular pattern corresponding to the distance covered. When the environment's shape was altered, this firing pattern became erratic, and the rats' ability to estimate distance was impaired. A parallel experiment with human volunteers showed the same behavioral pattern, suggesting that our brains use a similar mechanism for spatial navigation and memory.</p>
