          <p>In a series of in-depth interviews, candidates vying to become California's next governor in 2026 have articulated their stances on pressing issues. Topics discussed include congressional redistricting, immigration, homelessness, and the state's high cost of living. The field, comprising both Democrats and Republicans, offered varied perspectives, with most Democrats supporting a Newsom-backed redistricting measure while Republicans criticized it. This series aims to provide voters with direct answers beyond typical campaign talking points, covering a comprehensive range of topics from crime to the state's insurance crisis.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Dolly Parton has taken to social media to dispel rumors about her declining health, which had caused a frenzy among her fans. Concerns grew after her sister posted a message asking for prayers and Parton postponed a series of shows last month for unspecified health reasons. In a video, the 79-year-old singer appeared in good spirits on a set, declaring she was still working hard and not ready to die. She acknowledged that she had neglected her health following the death of her husband, Carl Dean, but is now receiving treatment and feeling better.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves parallel to Mexico's Baja California Sur peninsula, though it continues to generate high surf and dangerous rip currents. The storm is not expected to make landfall but its moisture is projected to bring significant rainfall and potential flash flooding to parts of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico later in the week. As of Wednesday night, Priscilla had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. Forecasters anticipate it will continue to weaken over the next two days, becoming a remnant low by Friday.</p>

          <p>Japan's SoftBank Group has announced a deal to purchase the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a move that significantly expands its footprint in artificial intelligence. Following the news, SoftBank's shares surged by as much as 13%. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son stated the acquisition aligns with his vision to unite advanced AI with robotics, a concept he calls "Physical AI." This deal indicates ABB will no longer pursue a separate public listing for its robotics business and reinforces SoftBank's strategy of investing heavily in companies central to the AI boom.

          <p>HSBC has announced a proposal to privatize its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank, in a deal valuing the Hong Kong-based lender at over $37 billion. The move would involve canceling Hang Seng Bank's shares in exchange for cash, offering a significant premium over the recent average share price. Following the announcement, Hang Seng Bank's shares soared by nearly 30%, while HSBC's shares fell. HSBC, which already owns a majority stake, stated the deal underscores its confidence in Hong Kong as a global financial hub and will allow it to better integrate and grow both banking entities.

          <p>Former President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, which includes the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops. The deal, brokered with the help of Qatar and Egypt, is set for a final vote by the Israeli cabinet. If approved, the process would begin with an Israeli military pullback to an agreed-upon line, followed by the release of hostages within 72 hours. This initial step aims to end the two-year conflict, although complex details about the long-term governance of Gaza remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from an Orleans Parish jail in May, was captured in Atlanta after a brief standoff with law enforcement. His arrest concludes a multi-agency manhunt that spanned several months.

The original jailbreak highlighted significant security and design flaws at the New Orleans facility. Authorities are now investigating how Groves traveled to Atlanta and who may have assisted him during his time as a fugitive.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that hosting the Olympic Games presents a significant opportunity for the cities of China's Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Shenzhen. The author suggests that a joint bid could foster regional pride, enhance social cohesion, and accelerate integration across these economically dynamic but culturally distinct communities. By leveraging existing and future infrastructure investments, the Olympics could serve as a catalyst to break down barriers and create a greater sense of shared identity. The piece frames the potential bid as a powerful moment of promise for the region's future on the global stage.</p>

          <p>The 20-point peace plan proposed by the Trump administration details a multi-stage process to end the Israel-Hamas war, beginning with an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages within 72 hours. In exchange, Israel would release thousands of Palestinian prisoners and withdraw its forces to a designated perimeter. The plan also proposes that a temporary "technocratic" committee, supported by an international stabilization force, would assume governance of Gaza, replacing Hamas. While Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has backed the proposal, it sidesteps a definitive path to Palestinian statehood, framing it only as a potential future aspiration.</p>

          <p>A decade ago, Middle School 50 in Brooklyn was listed as persistently dangerous with declining enrollment, but principal Benjamin Honoroff has engineered a dramatic turnaround. By integrating debate techniques into every subject, from English to math, he fostered critical thinking and communication skills among students. The school's debate team flourished, eventually winning a national championship. This innovative approach led to a significant rise in test scores, with proficiency jumping from single digits to over 60% in English and 70% in math, and enrollment has since increased substantially.</p>

          <p>A former library director in Campbell County, Wyoming, who was fired amid a heated dispute over books with LGBTQ+ and sexual content, has won a $700,000 settlement. Terri Lesley was terminated in 2023 after community members demanded the removal of certain books from the youth sections, a move she resisted. In her lawsuit, Lesley claimed that county officials violated her First Amendment rights by siding with the book objectors and firing her. While the county denied her claims, they agreed to the settlement, which Lesley said vindicates her decision to stand up for constitutional principles.</p>

This will be his second physical examination since April, when his physician declared him "fully fit to execute the duties" of the presidency. The president's health has been a subject of public speculation, particularly after he was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency over the summer. Following the checkup, Trump is reportedly considering a trip to the Middle East to help finalize the recently announced Gaza peace agreement.</p>
