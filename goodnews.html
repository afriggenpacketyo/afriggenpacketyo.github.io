          <p>Actor Danny Dyer has revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani convinced him to stay in rehab in 2016, a turning point in his struggle with addiction. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Dyer shared that he was ready to leave the facility but reconsidered after the letter made him reflect on the pain he had caused his family. Dyer, who rose to fame in the film Human Traffic and later starred in EastEnders, discussed how fame led him to make bad decisions, including heavy drug use. He realized the extent of his addiction when he struggled to put on jeans and saw the toll it was taking on his wife and children.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being released from federal custody, expressing joy and gratitude. She thanked supporters and voiced her faith in the American justice system despite her ordeal. Ozturk's detention sparked outrage over the Trump administration's immigration policies, as her visa was revoked following an opinion piece she wrote criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands. Supporters and legal representatives emphasized that her detention violated her First Amendment rights, with a judge noting the government presented no other evidence for her detainment.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has found that a new medication, zongertinib, shows promise for treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The oral medication outperformed the standard treatment option, an intravenous antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy, while carrying fewer risks of adverse effects. The study was conducted at 82 sites globally, with a majority of the 188 NSCLC patients being Asian. Wang Xin, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer Hospital, suggested that zongertinib could establish a new benchmark for targeted therapy in HER2-mutant NSCLC.</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as the "big tent" party during a town hall in Pennsylvania. Gallego suggested that Democrats have become too pure and exclusive, alienating potential voters. He cited podcast host Joe Rogan as an example of someone "kicked out" of the tent for not perfectly aligning with the party's message. Gallego emphasized the need for alliances with people who may not agree on every issue, drawing on his success in a battleground state with more registered Republicans than Democrats.</p>

          <p>As global uncertainties increase, China is diversifying its sources of imported food, with Southeast Asian neighbors becoming viable suppliers. Yunnan, a Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a key role in this regional agricultural cooperation. Yunnan's involvement dates back to the "alternative crop cultivation programme," which aimed to reduce opium production by sharing agricultural technology. Overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could support China's food security by diversifying its food supply sources.</p>

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler in Bedfordshire, invites people to explore the healing power of touch, claiming it has measurable health benefits, such as boosting serotonin and oxytocin levels, while lowering stress hormones. She hosts "cuddle puddles" where people can experience platonic touch and comfort. While some might raise an eyebrow at the thought that people are paying for this, Samii stresses it is a "fully clothed, platonic, nurturing service", with consent forms and explicit boundaries. Experts agree that touch can benefit physical and mental health, though the relationship between the people involved is important.</p>
