        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Defense Department is evaluating the possibility of assigning up to 600 military attorneys as temporary immigration judges to address the significant backlog of cases in immigration courts. This proposal follows the Trump administration's decision to ease job requirements for these temporary positions, allowing a broader range of government lawyers to qualify. The American Immigration Lawyers Association has voiced concerns, emphasizing the complexity of immigration law and the need for specialized expertise. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has also suggested using National Guard troops as immigration judges, which legal experts consider unprecedented, with the Justice Department potentially covering the costs and providing training. </p>

          <p>President Trump finalized a trade deal with Japan, implementing 15% baseline tariffs on most Japanese goods, including autos, after months of negotiations. As part of the agreement, Japan will invest $550 billion in U.S. projects and increase purchases of American agricultural products, commercial aircraft, and defense equipment. The deal aims to provide market access in manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, and automobile sectors. The finalizing of the deal coincides with growing political pressure on Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, with reports indicating internal discontent within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party following recent election losses.

          <p>A US lawyer named Mark S Zuckerberg is suing Facebook, claiming the platform repeatedly suspends his account under the false accusation of impersonating a celebrity. He alleges that these suspensions have occurred five times over eight years, resulting in significant financial losses for his legal practice. Zuckerberg's lawsuit argues that Meta, Facebook's parent company, breached its contract by improperly taking down advertising he paid for. Facebook has since reinstated his account, acknowledging the error and promising to prevent future occurrences. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) will assist the California Highway Patrol (CHP) in providing security for former Vice President Kamala Harris after President Trump revoked her Secret Service protection. The LAPD's Metropolitan Division officers, typically assigned to crime-suppression in high-crime areas, will now protect Harris. This arrangement is temporary, with Harris expected to hire her own security soon. Trump's decision to end Harris' security coverage beyond the usual six months has drawn criticism, with some calling it political retaliation. </p>

          <p>A US federal appeals court upheld an injunction preventing the State Department from enforcing President Trump's policy directive that sought to prevent transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports that accurately reflect their gender identities. The ruling is the latest in a series of cases linked to an executive order signed by Trump, directing the government to only recognize male and female biological genders. The American Civil Liberties Union sued, arguing the policy unlawfully prevented transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people from obtaining passports consistent with their gender identities. The court concluded that Trump's policy reflected unconstitutional animus toward transgender Americans. </p>

          <p>London City Lionesses agreed to sign Paris St-Germain midfielder Grace Geyoro for a world-record £1.4m, marking a significant investment in the Women's Super League. The WSL newcomers also activated teenage Spain international Lucia Corrales' release clause and paid around £430,000 to bring her in from Barcelona. The addition of Geyoro, once confirmed by the clubs, would mean London City have made 16 permanent signings during a busy summer in which wealthy American owner Michele Kang showed she was willing to invest in her side. The Lionesses have been able to build a structure from scratch, with a board full of women's football expertise and facilities specifically catered towards women. </p>
