          <p>The cost of higher education continues to rise, emphasizing the importance of securing affordable student loans. Federal undergraduate loan rates are decreasing slightly for the 2025-2026 academic year. To obtain low student loan rates, experts recommend starting with federal loans, comparing private lender options, optimizing credit profiles, using a cosigner if possible, and taking advantage of rate discounts. Shorter repayment terms can also lead to lower interest rates, potentially saving borrowers thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a new national priority voucher plan aimed at significantly reducing drug review times for companies supporting U.S. national interests. The plan seeks to shorten review times to one to two months by allowing companies to submit the majority of a drug application before final clinical trial results. In its first year, the FDA plans to issue a limited number of vouchers to companies aligned with national health priorities, including addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing.

          <p>The assisted dying bill has cleared initial stages in the House of Commons, but it must now go through the House of Lords. The Lords will scrutinize the bill, and MPs will have a final say on any changes suggested by peers. The bill's supporters are concerned about the possibility of the bill running out of time. Peers who oppose assisted dying may try to stop it by tabling many amendments. The government is officially neutral on the bill, but it will try to ensure Parliamentary time is made available to debate it.</p>

          <h2>Assisted Dying: The Significance of Today's Vote</h2>

          <p>The vote to approve Kim Leadbeater's assisted dying bill is arguably the biggest vote regarding bodily autonomy since the legalization of abortion in Great Britain in 1967. The bill will now go to the Lords, where it is likely to spend several months undergoing scrutiny. If the legislation is passed, the Health Secretary will be required to set up an assisted dying service under the NHS. It could take up to four years to set up an assisted dying service, meaning it could be 2029 or even 2030 before the first medically-assisted death happens.</p>

          <p>A court case against England goalkeeper Khiara Keating has been dropped nearly a year after she pleaded not guilty to possessing canisters of nitrous oxide. The 20-year-old Manchester City goalkeeper was charged with possession of a Class C drug on 18 June last year after an investigation by Greater Manchester Police. Greater Manchester Police has confirmed the case has been discontinued. Keating has not made an appearance for England's senior team yet but is part of the 23-player squad selected to compete at Euro 2025 next month.</p>

          <h2>Labour to Shift Council Funding Towards Poorer Areas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 11:03:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Labour plans to redistribute council funding towards more deprived areas in England, updating formulas that affect billions of pounds in allocations. The new system aims to address the higher demand for council services and weaker council tax bases in poorer areas. While ministers argue the changes will benefit communities in need, rural councils have raised concerns about potential losses. The Institute for Fiscal Studies anticipates a significant redistribution towards deprived areas, particularly in urban parts of the North and Midlands. (not investment advice)</p>
