          <h2>German States Dispute Fairness of Staggered Summer Holiday Schedule</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 04:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is intensifying in Germany over the nation's summer holiday schedule, with several states arguing the current system unfairly benefits Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. These southern states always have the last holiday slot due to traditional Pentecost breaks, allowing their residents to travel during less expensive, off-peak times. Critics from other states, like North Rhine-Westphalia, are calling for an end to this "preferential treatment" to ensure a fairer rotation for all families. However, Bavarian leaders have firmly rejected any changes, stating their holiday rhythm is a core part of their regional identity.</p>

          <h2>Cartier-Owner Richemont Reports Sales Decline in Japan as Yen Strengthens</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 03:44:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods conglomerate Richemont has reported a 15% decline in sales in Japan for the first quarter, a sharp reversal from the previous year's significant growth. The downturn is attributed to the recent strengthening of the Japanese yen, which has dampened the tourist spending splurge, particularly from Chinese shoppers, that had previously boosted the market. Despite the slowdown in Japan, Richemont's overall revenue saw a 6% rise, driven by strong performance in its high-end jewelry division. The report highlights the sensitivity of the luxury market to currency fluctuations and international travel trends. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The England men's cricket team has been fined and docked two World Test Championship points for a slow over rate during their recent victory against India. Match officials determined that the team, led by captain Ben Stokes, failed to bowl the required number of overs within the allotted time. The penalty causes England to drop from second to third place in the championship standings. This is not the first time the team has faced such sanctions, with Stokes previously arguing that the use of fast-paced bowlers puts them at a disadvantage.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the National Health Service in England has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants." The recommendation aims to reduce patient confusion and clarify the distinction between these roles and fully qualified doctors. Authored by Professor Gillian Leng, the review also suggests standardized uniforms and badges, and states that associates should not be responsible for diagnosing patients. The review follows concerns over patient safety and a lack of clarity regarding the scope and responsibilities of these growing healthcare roles.</p>

          <p>The MLB All-Star Game was decided for the first time by a home run "swing-off" after the American League rallied to a 6-6 tie in the ninth inning.

The case re-examines whether Kim's act was a self-interested coup attempt or a patriotic effort to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy, as he claimed. His family fought for the retrial, arguing his conviction was unjust and based on a flawed military trial that involved torture. The retrial forces a national reckoning with a pivotal, and still deeply divisive, moment in the country's turbulent path to democracy.</p>
