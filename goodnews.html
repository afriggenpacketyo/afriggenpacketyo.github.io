          <p>An SUV crashed into a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, leading to a ruptured gas line and a subsequent massive explosion that destroyed the building. Two courageous bystanders rescued the driver and a passenger from the vehicle just moments before the blast occurred. While multiple people involved in the initial three-car accident were hospitalized, authorities confirmed that no one was inside the restaurant at the time and no additional injuries resulted from the explosion itself. The adjacent businesses also sustained significant damage from the powerful blast.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, California's largest wildfire this year, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Favorable weather conditions and an increase in personnel have helped raise containment to 30% as of Sunday. The blaze, which started on Wednesday, has threatened around 50 structures and prompted mandatory evacuation orders for over 200 residents. The fire poses a particular threat to the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to several endangered species, and officials are hoping to make more progress before a predicted midweek heatwave.</p>

Kershaw received his 11th selection through the Commissioner's "Legend Pick," recognizing his historic career, which includes over 3,000 strikeouts. He will be joined by his teammate Yamamoto, who has had a standout season, leading the team in wins, strikeouts, and ERA. They will join fellow Dodgers Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Shohei Ohtani, who were previously selected as starters for the midsummer classic.

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss occurring after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will provide people with necessary time away from work to grieve. The new legislation will entitle parents to at least one week of leave, with the exact duration currently under consultation. The move has been welcomed by advocacy groups as a significant step in acknowledging the impact of early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new plan to offer early years teachers in England tax-free payments of £4,500 to attract and retain them in nurseries located in disadvantaged areas. This incentive, part of a broader £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy, aims to narrow the educational attainment gap among preschool children. The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, emphasized the goal of giving the youngest children a better start. The strategy also includes more frequent Ofsted inspections for nurseries and the creation of new local hubs for youth and parent support, modeled on the former Sure Start centres.</p>
