          <p>Ford Motor reported a 16.3% year-over-year sales increase for May, driven by an employee pricing program and strong hybrid vehicle sales. The increase in sales of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles also contributed to the positive results, offsetting a drop in electric vehicle sales. Ford has announced some vehicle price increases, specifically on those imported from Mexico, which they attribute to a combination of seasonal adjustments and tariff impacts. May marked the third consecutive month of double-digit sales increases for the automaker, indicating a positive trend despite economic headwinds (not investment advice).</p>

In contrast to *Trust Exercise*, where anger was a dominant mood, *Flashlight* presents it as a tunnel characters travel through. Choi's protagonists find that anger is impermanent and that letting it go allows other emotions, such as love and hope, to emerge. The novel examines how individuals cope with and move beyond anger in the face of difficult circumstances.</p>
