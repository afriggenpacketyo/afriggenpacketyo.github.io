          <p>For 15 seasons, senior executive chef Erin Wishon has been a key component of the Kansas City Chiefs' success, preparing protein-focused meals for nearly 300 players and staff members daily. Her culinary work is credited with fostering a communal, family-like atmosphere within the organization, which team president Mark Donovan considers vital to their culture. Wishon draws inspiration from various sources, including social media, to create engaging and nutritious menus that serve as both fuel and a mental break for the team. Her contributions were recognized when she, along with other staff, received a Super Bowl championship ring.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 12:57:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns about outliving savings, a retirement income strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention as an alternative to traditional guidelines like the 4% rule. This approach involves converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds remain invested for growth and flexibility, aiming to provide a balance of security and liquidity. While this strategy can reduce market volatility stress, retirees should consider the trade-offs, including reduced liquidity for the annuitized portion and continued market risk for the invested funds.

This includes a new deal to sell directly on Amazon for the first time since 2019.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially launched its "Gold Card" program, offering U.S. residency for a $1 million fee, a significant price reduction from the initially proposed $5 million. Immigration attorneys report a surge in interest from wealthy individuals, particularly from China and India, as the new price point makes it highly competitive with other countries' investment visa programs. While the administration plans to issue 80,000 Gold Cards to raise federal revenue, the program faces legal challenges and logistical hurdles, including how applicants will be processed ahead of existing backlogs for other visa types.</p>

          <p>Nick Clegg, former head of global affairs at Meta, stated that technology companies should maintain a respectful distance from politics, expressing that people should be uneasy about tech firms intervening in the public sphere. Speaking about the recent U.S. deal to keep TikTok operational, Clegg highlighted the importance of scrutinizing the safety of American data and the ownership of the app's algorithm. He warned against the trend of "data localization," where countries require citizen data to be stored domestically, arguing it could erode the open data flows that are fundamental to the internet.</p>

          <p>Author Patricia Lockwood's second novel, "Will There Ever Be Another You," delves into the transformative experience of long COVID, mirroring her own battle with the illness. The book's protagonist suffers from a persistent fever and cognitive difficulties that make her question her own identity, feeling as if she has been replaced by someone new. The novel explores this profound change not just as a sickness but as a catalyst for metamorphosis, where the character develops new ways of thinking, creating, and perceiving the world. This theme of personal transformation is a recurring interest in Lockwood's work.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to facilitate a deal that will allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new structure, thereby avoiding a national ban. The agreement establishes a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, which will manage U.S. user data and security. Under the deal, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, will own less than 20% of the new entity, satisfying a congressional divest-or-ban law. The order pushes back the law's enforcement to January 2026 to allow time for the complex agreement to be finalized.</p>

With the property sector in a slump and limited overseas investment options, more Chinese retail investors are returning to the stock market.

          <p>The young Brooklyn-based rock band Geese has released a new album, "Getting Killed," that is earning critical attention for its electrifying and novel sound. The music blends a wide range of influences, from Frank Zappa to the Rolling Stones, into an unpredictable mix of punk and free jazz. The album's sound is characterized by complex time signatures, sudden shifts in arrangement, and the groggy, off-balance vocals of frontman Cameron Winter. This article suggests the band's chaotic and disorienting style captures the feeling of living in a world saturated with digital content, making music that confronts rather than escapes modern anxieties.</p>
