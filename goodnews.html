He expresses concern about the state of cinema in Argentina due to government decisions and the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on foreign films.

          <p>President Trump's nomination of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness specialist, as the next surgeon general has ignited controversy, with critics questioning her lack of an active medical license and her focus on functional medicine. Means, who left her surgical residency to pursue functional medicine, has been described as a "woo-woo wellness influencer" by some media outlets. Supporters defend her ability to inspire Americans to rethink the healthcare system, arguing that her unconventional approach challenges the status quo. The surgeon general's role involves overseeing public health initiatives and communicating scientific information to the public, but the nominee must be a member of the Corps and must have ‚Äúspecialized training or significant experience in public health programs.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a trade agreement with the UK, which involves the US maintaining import taxes on most UK goods while rolling back some taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In exchange, the US anticipates increased sales of American beef, ethanol, and other agricultural products in the UK. While the White House touted the deal as a "breakthrough," analysts suggest the substantive benefits may be limited. The announcement has drawn criticism from American carmakers, who point out that the plans make UK-cars less expensive to import than many of the models made by their companies, which have operations in Mexico and Canada.</p>

          <p>China's latest stimulus measures to revive economic growth have failed to boost its stock market, as investors remain concerned about the ongoing trade war with the U.S. The stimulus package, which includes interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, was largely priced in by markets, and analysts suggest more targeted fiscal measures are needed to boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round focuses more on industrial and social needs rather than direct financing for investments and share buybacks.

          <p>President Trump has requested House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax increase on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. Trump proposes creating a new top income bracket for those earning over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6%. This move would partially reverse the tax cuts enacted in 2017, potentially easing concerns about cutting Medicaid to offset the cost of tax cuts benefiting the rich.

          <p>The Camogie Association's enforcement of skort wearing in camogie matches has been labeled as "sexism" by former All-Star Jane Adams, who urges the association to allow players a choice between skorts and shorts. A Gaelic Players Association survey revealed that 70% of players experience discomfort while wearing the skort, and 83% want the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue, while one player has vowed to wear shorts in an upcoming final, even if it means forfeiting the title.</p>

          <p>The Kooks and Hard-Fi, two bands from the 2000s indie boom, are experiencing a revival after finding a new audience on TikTok. The bands discuss the changing music industry, the decline of grassroots venues, and the shift in music consumption towards introspective content. The Kooks are headlining the O2 Arena for the first time, while Hard-Fi is releasing a 20th anniversary edition of their debut album and preparing a new album. They attribute their revival to teenagers rediscovering their parents' music and the return of anthemic choruses to guitar music.</p>

          <h2>Pavement's Story Told Through Documentary, Biopic, Musical, and Museum</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "Pavements" tells the story of the indie band Pavement through a combination of documentary footage, a stage musical, an art gallery, and a parody of a Hollywood biopic. Director Alex Ross Perry wanted to capture the band's unconventional nature and explore what it would be like if they were the world's most important and influential band. The invented stage show, "Slanted! Enchanted! A Pavement Musical," features arrangements of the group‚Äôs music, while the Hollywood biopic portion of the project, titled ‚ÄúRange Life: A Pavement Story,‚Äù captures pivotal moments, such as an awkward band meeting in which label executives confront the group over the uncommercial approach of its latest album and another in which Malkmus blithely declines an offer to appear on an episode of ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù hosted by Quentin Tarantino.</p>

          <p>Zara, owned by Inditex, is celebrating 50 years since its first store opening and offers a rare glimpse into its operations. The company relies on 1,800 suppliers globally, bringing clothes to Spain for distribution to 97 countries. CEO Oscar Garcia Maceiras says US tariffs won't disrupt supply chains or expansion in the US. Zara's design team of 350 from 40 countries draws inspiration from various sources, creating key pieces for the season, and it changes its products much more frequently than traditional retailers.</p>

          <p>The first samples of Moon rock brought back to Earth in nearly 50 years have arrived in the UK on loan from China, making Professor Mahesh Anand the only scientist in the UK to have access to this material. Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth. China collected the rocks on its Chang'e 5 space mission in 2020 when it landed on a volcanic area called Mons R√ºmker. Following a long tradition of global collaboration between space scientists, China has for the first time granted seven international researchers samples to make new discoveries.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an AI tool that can estimate a person's biological age from facial photos, which they say could help assess a patient's health and guide medical care. The AI tool, called FaceAge, found that study subjects with cancer appeared five years older than their chronological age. Researchers hope to commercialize the technology, but experts have concerns about its accuracy across different populations and its potential misuse. The AI tool's results will be used to support, but not replace, clinicians‚Äô judgment.</p>
