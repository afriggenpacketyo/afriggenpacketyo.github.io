          <p>Newcastle United has officially completed a club-record signing of German striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a fee that could reach up to £69 million. This acquisition surpasses the previous record set by Alexander Isak's transfer three years ago. The 6-foot-6-inch forward has signed a long-term contract and will wear the number 27 jersey for the club. However, he was not registered in time to be eligible for the upcoming match against Leeds United, delaying his debut for the team.</p>

          <p>China is deepening its security cooperation in Africa through its Global Security Initiative (GSI), notably by providing military training to Somali forces. The program aims to help Somalia develop a self-sufficient defense force to combat the extremist group al-Shabab, especially as the African Union mission prepares to withdraw. This initiative is part of a broader strategy that includes law enforcement training and anti-piracy cooperation, aligning with Beijing's strategic and economic interests in the Horn of Africa.

          <p>The Ndlovu Youth Choir from South Africa has released a Zulu-language translation of Queen's iconic song "Bohemian Rhapsody," marking the first time the band has ever officially authorized such a project. The release, timed for the song's 50th anniversary, honors Freddie Mercury's birthplace in Zanzibar and was created with the blessing of Queen's surviving members. The choir meticulously translated the lyrics to preserve the original's meaning while weaving in African musical traditions. The project celebrates cultural fusion and brings a new, vibrant interpretation to a classic rock anthem.</p>

          <p>German football legend Thomas Müller is embracing his new career chapter with the Vancouver Whitecaps in Major League Soccer, quickly endearing himself to local fans. In a recent media appearance, Müller demonstrated his commitment by correcting a reporter who mistakenly referred to his location as the USA instead of Canada. On the field, he has already made a significant impact, scoring a game-winning penalty in his first start. Off the field, he is adjusting to life in Vancouver, which he notes is far more than the "village" it was once called.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new world record for the fastest unsupported, non-stop row across the Pacific Ocean. They completed the grueling 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia in just under 140 days, beating the previous record by more than 20 days. The trio overcame severe challenges, including violent storms that washed one brother overboard temporarily. Their remarkable feat has also served as a successful fundraiser, raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.</p>

          <p>Preliminary data from the CDC reveals a substantial and continuous drop in fatal drug overdoses in the United States since mid-2023, reaching a five-year low. This decline contrasts sharply with President Donald Trump's ongoing narrative that fentanyl poses a growing threat, a claim he has used to justify policies like harsh mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. Public health experts are studying the reasons for the dramatic improvement, attributing it to a combination of disrupted supply chains and better access to addiction treatment. The data suggests progress in the public health crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Caltech have developed a groundbreaking process that could revolutionize plastic production by using captured carbon dioxide as a primary ingredient. The method uses renewable electricity to convert CO2 into compounds like ethylene, which can then be transformed into durable industrial plastics known as polyketones. This innovation offers a potential pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by turning a harmful pollutant into a valuable material. While the technology is still in early stages, it represents a significant step toward creating a more sustainable and less environmentally damaging plastics industry.</p>

          <p>A global movement to enhance online child safety is driving the development and adoption of new AI-powered technologies. Spurred by regulations like the UK's Online Safety Act, which mandates that tech companies protect minors from harmful content, firms are increasingly implementing age-verification systems. Companies like Yoti use AI to estimate a user's age from a selfie, a method now used by platforms including Pornhub, Spotify, and X. This has created a new market for digital ID and safety tech, while also raising important questions about user privacy and data security.</p>

China remains one of the few countries without restrictions on alcohol sales to its neighbor, making North Korea its second-largest market for bottled wine by volume. This trade is permissible because alcohol is not classified as a luxury good under the United Nations sanctions that have been in place since 2006. The data highlights a key economic link between the two allied nations.</p>

Despite struggling with a lower back issue that required a medical timeout, the 38-year-old delivered his best performance of the tournament so far. With the win, Djokovic becomes the oldest man to reach the last 16 at the US Open since Jimmy Connors in 1991 and ties Roger Federer's record for most grand slam fourth-round appearances. Norrie played aggressively and managed to win the second set, but Djokovic's superior serving ultimately decided the match.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to expand the use of expedited removal for undocumented migrants detained away from the border. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the government's attempt to fast-track deportations for individuals who have been in the country for up to two years without a judicial hearing likely violates their due process rights. The decision is a significant setback for the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, which aimed to deport up to one million people annually in a potential second term.</p>
