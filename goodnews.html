          <p>This article recounts the story of Julie Moore, an Army wife who revolutionized how the U.S. military informs families of service member deaths. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore lobbied for a more dignified approach. She arranged with Western Union to receive telegrams herself, personally delivering the news and providing support to grieving widows. Her efforts led to the current protocol where service members notify families in person, offering comfort and assistance during a difficult time; in 2023, Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore to honor Julie and her husband Hal.</p>

The Fujian is the People‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äôs third carrier and the first to be equipped with advanced electromagnetic catapults, which will greatly enhance the Chinese navy's abilities in offshore defense and long-distance sea escort operations once it enters service.

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister. This expectation comes after the previous minister's dismissal due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The poll also indicates that many believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, a target lower than what Prime Minister Ishiba has pledged. The new minister plans to sell government stockpiles directly to retailers, aiming to make rice available at 2,000 yen per 5 kg. (not investment advice)</p>
