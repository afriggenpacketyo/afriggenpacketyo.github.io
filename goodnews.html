          <p>Private equity bosses are increasingly optimistic about investment opportunities in Europe, reversing a previous trend of subdued sentiment. Factors contributing to this shift include falling interest rates, Germany's fiscal stimulus package, and increased political stability in France, Germany, and the U.K. Despite lackluster appetite from institutional investors and muted M&A activity, firms are building headcount in Europe in anticipation of new opportunities, although some caution that Trump's policies are keeping everyone on edge.

          <p>According to his biographer, Stephen Witt, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is primarily motivated by negative emotions, particularly fear of failure, paranoia about competition, and guilt about letting people down. Despite leading a company valued at nearly $3.4 trillion, Huang constantly worries about its potential collapse. Witt's insights come from a six-hour interview with Huang, as well as conversations with his colleagues and employees, for his book "The Thinking Machine."</p>

          <p>Andrey Kurkov's Kyiv mysteries explore the surprising ambivalence felt by people living under occupation, even when authorities use violence and terror to maintain control. The novels follow policeman Samson Kolechko as he navigates chaos and seeks to maintain order, regardless of the ideology of the ruling party. Kurkov's work echoes Mikhail Bulgakov's themes of contrasting bourgeois comfort with the barbarism outside, highlighting the moral compromises made during occupation.</p>
