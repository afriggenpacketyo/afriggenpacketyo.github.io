          <p>China is strategically increasing its coffee imports from African nations to secure new supply chains and meet surging domestic demand. This push is facilitated by zero-tariff policies and leverages uncertainty around U.S. trade relations, allowing Chinese companies to secure long-term supply agreements.

          <p>As China accelerates the deployment of its state-backed Guo Wang satellite internet network, a rival to SpaceX's Starlink, a shortage of available launch rockets is emerging. This bottleneck is creating challenges for other Chinese space ambitions, particularly commercially funded projects like the Qianfan satellite constellation. To overcome this, private satellite companies are now turning to China's growing commercial rocket sector to secure the launches needed to meet their ambitious deployment timelines.</p>

          <p>California officials have announced that the state correctional facility in Norco will be closed by the fall of 2026, a decision driven by the state's declining inmate population and expected annual savings of $150 million. The medium-security prison, which currently houses nearly 3,000 inmates, will be deactivated, with staff and inmates transferred to other facilities. The site, which was originally a luxury resort in the 1920s, will undergo a "warm shutdown" to prepare it for potential reuse or sale.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating more than $4 billion in FEMA funds originally designated for disaster mitigation projects. The ruling sides with 20 states that sued after the administration terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge stated that redirecting the money, intended for projects like flood prevention, could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters.</p>
