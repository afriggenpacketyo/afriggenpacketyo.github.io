          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard successfully intercepted and offloaded over $20 million worth of cocaine and marijuana at its Miami Beach base. The seizure, which included approximately 2,220 pounds of cocaine and 3,320 pounds of marijuana, was the result of four separate encounters with alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea. The operation was a collaborative international effort involving the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Netherlands Navy, and the U.S. Navy. A Coast Guard commander emphasized that such missions are a critical team effort to prevent illicit drugs from reaching American communities.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new comet, named 3I/ATLAS, that originated from outside our solar system and is currently passing through it. This marks only the third time such an interstellar visitor has been detected, offering a rare opportunity to study material from another star system. The comet was spotted by a NASA-funded telescope in Chile and is currently about 420 million miles away, posing no threat to Earth. Scientists are racing to observe the object before it moves out of view, anticipating a future increase in such discoveries with the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban believes that artificial intelligence will be the driving force behind the world's first trillionaire, who could even be a single individual working from their basement. Speaking on a podcast, Cuban stated that the full potential of AI has not yet been realized and that its eventual integration into daily life will be as transformative as the internet or smartphones. While acknowledging issues like job displacement and misinformation, he urged people to familiarize themselves with AI tools like ChatGPT.

Federal undergraduate loans for the upcoming year are fixed at 6.39%, offering accessibility regardless of credit history. In contrast, private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer, potentially offering substantial savings. While private loans can be cheaper for some, they lack the robust protections of federal loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new Labour government in the UK has outlined a 10-year plan to reform the National Health Service (NHS), aiming to shift care from hospitals to community-based health hubs. The proposal includes creating up to 300 new neighborhood centers, expanding access to weight-loss treatments to combat obesity, and improving technology through the NHS app. The plan also addresses dental care shortages by potentially requiring new dentists to work in the NHS for a set period. However, the proposal has been criticized for not directly addressing the pressing issue of social care reform.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to further scale back the 'Right to Buy' scheme in England to protect the country's social housing stock. Under the new plans, newly-built social homes will be exempt from the scheme for 35 years, and tenants will need to live in a property for at least ten years before they can purchase it. The maximum discounts available to tenants will also be significantly reduced. The policy, a signature of the Thatcher government, has been blamed for depleting affordable housing, and these changes aim to help local councils build and retain more homes.</p>

          <p>The Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap has rapidly risen from a Belfast-based group to a globally recognized and controversial act. The band, known for rapping about youth culture and a united Ireland, uses the marginalized Irish language as a political statement. Their vocal criticism of the British government and pro-Palestinian advocacy have drawn both acclaim and condemnation, leading to a terrorism investigation in the U.K. and calls for performance cancellations. Despite the controversy, the band drew a massive crowd at Glastonbury, solidifying their status as a powerful voice for a new generation in Northern Ireland.</p>
