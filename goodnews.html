          <p>The Sports Bra, a sports bar in Portland, Oregon, is dedicated to showing women's sports and has gained a loyal following since opening in 2022. Founder Jenny Nguyen aimed to create a space where women's sports are prominently displayed and celebrated, fostering a sense of belonging for young girls interested in sports. The bar has become a popular spot for fans and athletes alike, promoting gender equality in sports viewership and investment. Despite progress, inequalities persist, with female athletes facing online abuse and lacking representation in top-paid athlete lists, highlighting the ongoing need for equity efforts.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose population has declined by 90% in the last 30 years. The glitter is mixed with apple chunks and fed to the voles, allowing researchers to track their movements via their droppings. Different glitter colors help distinguish between vole families and their territories, providing crucial data for habitat management and protection. The team is testing this method on captive-bred water voles before applying it in the wild, hoping to improve conservation efforts and aid the species' dispersal and survival.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists in Alberta, Canada, are excavating a mass grave containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus bones to understand how these dinosaurs died 72 million years ago. The site, nicknamed the "River of Death," holds one of the largest bone beds in North America, offering a unique snapshot of a single community of animals. Researchers believe the dinosaurs were part of a migrating herd that was wiped out by a catastrophic flash flood. The team's findings are featured in the BBC series 'Walking With Dinosaurs,' which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, signaling continued concerns about consumption in the country's economy. Despite this, industrial output grew more than expected, indicating resilience against U.S. tariffs. The Chinese government acknowledges external uncertainties and the need for further economic recovery consolidation. Fixed-asset investment rose slightly below expectations, while the urban unemployment rate eased. China's exports surged, particularly to Southeast Asian countries, offsetting a drop in shipments to the U.S., though domestic demand remains a concern. Automobile sales grew only slightly, and the real estate sector continues to face challenges.</p>

          <p>Apple is planning to significantly increase iPhone production in India, aiming to make it a major hub for the U.S. market.

To become a truly independent manufacturing hub, India needs substantial investment in infrastructure, skills, and technology, while also navigating complex geopolitical relations with China.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to introduce pre-arrival screening for visa-free travelers by fiscal year 2028 to enhance efficiency and boost inbound tourism. The system, modeled after the U.S.'s ESTA, will require travelers from visa-exempt countries to provide travel and personal information before arrival. This will allow the Immigration Services Agency to examine data in advance and deny boarding to individuals with criminal histories or records of illegal stays in Japan. The goal is to facilitate the government's target of attracting 60 million foreign tourists by 2030.</p>

These include drugs given by injection that block the testicles from making testosterone, or a pill that does the same thing. If the medications that block testosterone, and the chemotherapy and radiation therapy, stop working, there are other drugs that can be used to quell the cancer.</p>
