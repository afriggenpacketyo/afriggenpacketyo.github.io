          <h2>Federal Student Loan Borrowing Limits and Options Explained</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average annual college costs exceeding $38,000, many students rely on federal loans, which offer borrower protections but have strict limits. The article details these annual and lifetime borrowing caps, which vary by dependency status and academic level, often leaving a significant funding gap. For instance, dependent undergraduates are limited to $5,500 in their first year. When federal aid is insufficient, private student loans can be an alternative, though they typically require credit checks and may have less flexible repayment terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new crypto treasury company, The Ether Machine, is set to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker ETHM, aiming to be a major institutional investment vehicle for ether. Backed by prominent crypto investors like Pantera Capital and Electric Capital, the firm plans to accumulate ether, similar to MicroStrategy's bitcoin strategy. However, it will differentiate itself by focusing on generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's operations and produces returns, which current ether ETFs do not offer.

          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four and a half hours, smartphone addiction is a growing global health concern linked to anxiety, depression, and physical ailments. This article outlines science-backed strategies to combat this behavioral addiction, which can be as difficult to quit as smoking. Recommended methods include creating physical distance from the phone, reducing notifications, setting the screen to grayscale, and using self-control apps. Experts suggest combining multiple techniques and, for severe cases, seeking professional help like cognitive behavioral therapy to address the root causes of the addiction.</p>

          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced it has purchased approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities.

          <p>Domino's Pizza is strategically positioning itself to attract more customers, particularly from lower-income groups, as the restaurant industry faces headwinds from frugal consumers. CEO Russell Weiner stated that while competitors struggle, Domino's can gain market share by emphasizing value, citing the success of its $9.99 "Best Deal Ever" promotion. The company reported a 3.4% rise in U.S. same-store sales, driven by both new products and effective deals that resonated across all income levels. This strategy contrasts with fast-food rivals, as consumers are increasingly choosing to eat at home or spend on perceived better value.</p>

          <p>Melius analyst Ben Reitzes has reiterated his call for Apple to make a significant move in artificial intelligence, such as acquiring the AI-powered search engine Perplexity. The analyst suggested that such a purchase could transform Apple from a "toll taker" into an AI leader and boost its stock value. CNBC's Jim Cramer agreed, noting that legal challenges to Apple's existing business models, like its search agreement with Google, make an acquisition necessary.

One man, Brian Flynn, became a rare double living organ donor, donating a kidney to a stranger and later part of his liver to a 4-year-old boy, saving both their lives. The other story features Rachel Bee, a teenager diagnosed with Crohn's disease, who used her experience in infusion centers to invent "Infusion Hero," a sweatshirt with zippered sleeves to keep patients warm and comfortable during IV treatments.

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has warned that the future of public service broadcasting (PSB) is at risk because young audiences predominantly watch platforms like YouTube. To address this, Ofcom is urging YouTube to give more prominence to content from established PSBs like the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4, particularly in genres such as news and children's programming. The regulator suggests that broadcasters must work with YouTube to make their content easier to find and has even raised the possibility of new legislation to enforce this.</p>
