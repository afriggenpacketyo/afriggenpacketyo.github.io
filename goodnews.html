          <p>The White House announced that the United States and China have reached a trade deal after two days of negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that 'substantial progress' had been made, and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested that the agreement would help resolve the national emergency caused by the massive US trade deficit. While details remain scarce, President Trump praised the talks as a 'total reset' in relations, signaling a potential de-escalation of the trade war. The deal is expected to address the trade imbalance and improve market access for American businesses in China.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo defended the club owner's post-match intervention after a draw against Leicester, attributing it to confusion over a substitution. The owner, Marinakis, was reportedly frustrated when a player signaled he was fine to continue but then couldn't, leading to the team playing with one man less. Nuno praised Marinakis' passion and desire to improve the club, stating that his actions stem from wanting the best for the team. Nuno also emphasized that the owner's actions are why the club is growing as a whole.</p>

          <p>A fourth round of talks between the US and Iran over Tehran's nuclear programme have taken place in Oman, with both sides agreeing to meet again. US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said the discussions in Muscat were encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described them as "difficult but useful". The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies it has such an aim and on Sunday again stressed it did not intend to give up the programme. Donald Trump pulled out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and five other world powers in 2018.</p>
