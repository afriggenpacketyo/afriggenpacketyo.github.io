          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have utilized an advanced AI protein language model to investigate convergent evolution, the process where unrelated species independently develop similar traits. The study moves beyond traditional methods by analyzing complex 3D protein structures rather than simple sequence similarities. This innovative approach allowed the team to identify previously hidden relationships between proteins that evolved separately but serve similar functions, such as echolocation in both bats and dolphins. The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, highlight an underappreciated genetic basis for how different species adapt in similar ways to their environments.</p>

          <p>Senior Chinese officials are conducting tours across the country to promote key national priorities, focusing on technological advancement and social welfare. In the eastern province of Zhejiang, Vice-Premier Zhang Guoqing urged manufacturers to integrate advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and large language models into their production processes to foster 'new quality productive forces.' He emphasized supporting specialized firms in areas such as all-solid-state batteries and optical instruments to enhance China's manufacturing capabilities. This push for high-tech innovation is a central part of the government's strategy to drive economic growth and maintain global competitiveness in critical industries.</p>

          <p>China is embarking on one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects, a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet. Dubbed a "project of the century," the line will traverse treacherous terrain, including high-altitude mountain ranges and permafrost zones, with an average elevation above 4,500 meters. The total investment for this mega-project could reach an estimated 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), making it one of the costliest rail lines ever built in the country. A new state-owned company has been established to oversee its construction and operation, highlighting Beijing's commitment to enhancing connectivity and economic development in its western autonomous regions.</p>

          <p>The European Union has begun the gradual rollout of its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) for non-EU citizens traveling to the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces manual passport stamping, will require travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, upon their first entry. This registration will be valid for three years. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, there are concerns about potential delays during the initial implementation phase. The system is being introduced in stages at various border points, including airports and Channel crossings like Dover and the Eurotunnel, with full activation expected by April 2026.</p>

          <p>Wales's Plaid Cymru party has committed to developing a formal plan for Welsh independence but has clarified that it will not pursue a referendum within the first term of a potential Plaid-led government. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth gained members' endorsement to establish a "standing commission" that will engage the public on the country's constitutional future and prepare a white paper on independence. This represents a shift from the party's previous pledge to hold a referendum within five years. The new strategy focuses on first enhancing devolution by seeking more powers, such as over justice and policing, as part of a longer-term journey toward independence.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to lead the team to the World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the painful memory of their 2022 play-off defeat to Ukraine. Scotland is currently well-positioned in their qualifying group, tied on points with leader Denmark, and is favored to win their upcoming match against Belarus. Clarke, who has already successfully guided Scotland to two European Championships, ending a long major tournament drought, is now focused on securing a place at the men's World Cup for the first time in 28 years. A victory could guarantee another play-off spot and keep hopes for automatic qualification alive.</p>

          <h2>Explainer on German Religious Holiday Laws and Accommodations for Non-Christian Faiths</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 02:51:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein has highlighted the country's approach to religious holidays, which is governed by a patchwork of state-level regulations. The agreement formalizes the existing practice allowing Muslim students and employees to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays, a right already extended to other religious groups for their significant observances. While some media outlets misleadingly framed this as "extra holidays," the policy simply affirms constitutional protections for religious freedom, allowing individuals to observe their faith without creating new legal entitlements. This reflects a broader national conversation in Germany about integration and equality in a religiously diverse society.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 02:18:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the mechanism that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a new plant. Their research, published in the journal Cell, identified two key genetic switches that can be flipped to induce this process, known as somatic embryogenesis. This ability was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs, but the findings show that differentiated plant cells can regain this potential under the right conditions. The breakthrough provides fundamental insights into one of biology's most profound processes and could have significant implications for agriculture and plant biotechnology.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her personal journey of understanding body donation after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, revealed her decision to donate her body to medical science. Initially shocked, Owen produced a documentary at Cardiff University to explore the process, learning how donated bodies serve as "silent teachers" for medical students, providing invaluable, hands-on anatomical education that textbooks cannot replicate. The article details the logistical and emotional aspects for families, who may wait up to three years for the return of their loved one's remains for a funeral. Inspired by her mother's wish to give back, Owen ultimately decided to register as a body donor herself.</p>

The decisive victory improves his undefeated record to 35-0 and sends a clear message to the junior middleweight division. The win sets up a highly anticipated future showdown with fellow undefeated fighter Vergil Ortiz Jr., a bout promoters are calling one of the best matchups to be made in American boxing.</p>

          <p>Despite being the all-time leading goalscorer for both England and Tottenham Hotspur and achieving remarkable success at Bayern Munich, questions persist about whether striker Harry Kane is fully appreciated. This article examines his prolific career, noting that he is the fastest player to reach 100 goals for a single club in Europe's top five leagues, surpassing even Erling Haaland and Cristiano Ronaldo. While some critics point to his lack of major tournament victories with England, pundits argue his all-around game, consistency, and humble demeanor make him one of the world's truly elite players. His impact is often described as understated compared to other superstars, leading to a potential underestimation of his generational talent.</p>
