          <p>A rare gold lobster, named Calvin, was rescued from being cooked at a restaurant in Charlestown, Rhode Island, after a cook recognized its unique genetic mutation. This mutation, occurring in approximately one in 30 million lobsters, results in a yellowish-orange shell. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center in North Kingstown, where it is now on display. The center's director noted that such lobsters are often mistaken for more common orange ones, and would turn red if cooked like typical lobsters, however Calvin was saved from such a fate and now has the opportunity to impress visitors.</p>

Amorim has made several pointed statements about the team's performance, including calling them "probably the worst in Manchester United history" after a defeat. De Ligt, being Dutch, appreciates the straightforwardness, viewing it as a positive trait given the Dutch reputation for blunt speaking, which he believes fosters a beneficial environment for the team. </p>

          <p>England fast bowler Jamie Overton will miss the remainder of the one-day international series against the West Indies after fracturing his little finger. The injury occurred while Overton was attempting to take a return catch during the first match at Edgbaston. Although he initially left the field for treatment, he returned to bowl and managed to take three wickets before the severity of the injury was fully assessed. Overton is expected to be sidelined for approximately a month, which also means he will miss the subsequent T20 series against the West Indies; Matthew Potts has replaced Overton in the England XI.</p>

          <p>Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and a graduate of Ranger School, discusses the debate around gender-neutral fitness standards for combat roles. She recounts her experiences in Ranger School, emphasizing that she was never given special treatment or had the standards lowered for her. Vanasse argues that while physical fitness is important for combat arms, lethality extends beyond physical capabilities to include tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership. She responds to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's claim that women don't belong in combat by highlighting the accomplishments of women who have served and asserting that standards were never lowered for them. </p>

Construction machinery is being used to control the run-off of accumulated water.

Nearly 6,000 drug tests in California prisons are believed to have yielded false positives between April and July of the previous year. Inmates who were denied parole based on these faulty tests may be granted a new hearing before the parole board. Advocates are also concerned that the results could affect inmates in the future and are pushing for medical files to not be included in parole hearing decisions. </p>

The top concern of displaced homeowners was about the lack of leadership to get it done, rather than affordability, although many homeowners are indeed worried that they won‚Äôt have enough money to rebuild the way they want.

          <p>A recent study suggests that UN population estimates may be significantly undercounted, particularly in rural areas of the global south. While this news might sound alarming, the author argues that anxieties about overpopulation are often rooted in power struggles and reflect concerns about who is considered a burden or a threat. The article traces historical anxieties about overpopulation, from Malthus to Ehrlich, and notes that coercive population control policies have largely given way to a focus on women's empowerment. The author concludes that while population growth presents challenges, it does not necessarily lead to apocalyptic catastrophe and that ethnonationalist concerns about declining birthrates in the West are misguided. </p>

          <p>Memory cafes are gatherings for people with cognitive impairment and their caregivers, offering camaraderie and fun in a supportive environment. These cafes are relatively cheap and easy to run, often relying on volunteers and small grants. They provide social support for both patients and caregivers, helping to ease stress and combat social isolation. The model has gained popularity, with over 600 memory cafes operating across the country, and is particularly prevalent in states like Wisconsin, which has a strong infrastructure for dementia care. </p>
