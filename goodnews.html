          <p>Burberry plans to reduce approximately 1,700 roles globally by 2027 as part of organizational changes amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment. The luxury house's sales experienced a 6% decline in the fiscal fourth quarter, slightly better than analysts' expectations. CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future, despite flagging geopolitical tensions and potential tariff risks. The company's sales fell across all regions, with Asia-Pacific experiencing the most significant weakness, marking a continued effort to turnaround the embattled luxury brand's performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump's administration has taken several actions that could hinder the growth of the renewable energy sector in the United States. These actions include pausing wind energy projects, proposing tariffs on imports from Southeast Asia, and attempting to repeal parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. These policies inject uncertainty into the clean energy sector, despite significant growth in recent years, driven by investments through the IRA. Experts believe that while renewable energy will continue to grow, the pace may be slower due to these challenges, potentially impacting the nation's competitiveness in the global clean energy market.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 2% amidst volatile trading after announcing a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen. The company's operating income for the last three months surpassed analyst estimates, despite a decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, with shareholders receiving the majority of shares through dividends. However, the company's outlook for the current financial year was subdued, forecasting a modest increase in operating profit partly due to the impact of tariffs.</p>

In response, Canada has invited King Charles to open its parliament, signaling a message of sovereignty.
