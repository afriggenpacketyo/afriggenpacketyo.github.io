          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly finalizing new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, signaling a significant shift in its broadcast strategy. NBC is set to acquire Sunday games and Wild Card playoff games for approximately $200 million per year, while Netflix will gain rights to the Home Run Derby for around $50 million annually. ESPN will receive a new $550 million package, which includes MLB TV and in-market games for five local teams, despite previous disagreements where ESPN sought to reduce its payments. These three-year deals, expiring after the 2028 season, aim to expand the league's monetary and reach potential by forging new partnerships in a changing media landscape.</p>

          <p>Canada announced it will remove retaliatory tariffs on many U.S. products covered by the USMCA trade agreement, a move aimed at reducing tensions with the U.S. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the decision is expected to re-establish free trade for the majority of goods between the two nations, effective September 1. This action follows a recent call between Carney and President Trump, who welcomed the withdrawal of tariffs as "long overdue." While Canada will maintain levies on specific sectors like autos, steel, and aluminum, this action marks a significant step towards resolving ongoing trade disputes and facilitating smoother bilateral commerce, reflecting a strategic effort to preserve Canada's trade advantage.

          <p>Intel shares rose significantly after President Trump announced that the U.S. government has agreed to take an equity stake in the chipmaker, suggesting a 10% share in exchange for CHIPS Act funds. While a White House official noted "ongoing discussions" and no final agreement, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had previously advocated for a non-voting equity stake for government investment. This move signals a notable shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government taking a more active role in corporate America to support domestic advanced chip manufacturing. SoftBank also recently invested $2 billion in Intel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland father of two, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee, marking his freedom for the first time since his wrongful deportation to El Salvador earlier this year. His lawyers confirmed he is now en route to his family in Maryland, following a supreme court order that directed federal officials to facilitate his return to the U.S. Ábrego was initially deported based on unproven claims of MS-13 gang affiliation by the Trump administration and later charged with human smuggling, which his legal team vehemently rejects as "preposterous." This outcome represents a significant legal victory for Ábrego, who reportedly endured physical and psychological torture during his detention in El Salvador.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. stocks rallied significantly and bond yields tumbled after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, where he offered a more dovish indication of future monetary policy. Powell's remarks about growing downside risks in the labor market and how the "shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance" led traders to increase their bets on multiple interest rate cuts before year-end. This market-friendly interpretation caused a surge in cyclical, economically sensitive stocks such as Capital One, DuPont, and Home Depot. The strong positive reaction highlights the market's eagerness for potential easing of monetary policy and its impact on various sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film "Splitsville," directed by and starring Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin, attempts to satirize modern marriage and male friendship but ultimately falls short. The movie follows Carey, whose divorce leads to a complicated open relationship scenario involving his best friend Paul and Paul's wife, Julie. While it offers moments of humor, particularly in an extended fight scene, the review criticizes the film for its self-regard and for centering the male leads' antics, making the female characters feel underdeveloped. Despite strong performances from Adria Arjona and Dakota Johnson, the comedy struggles to deliver meaningful insights, suggesting the duo might be better served by working behind the camera.</p>

          <p>Fifteen young climate activists, aged eight to 17, have filed a lawsuit against the state of Wisconsin, challenging its pro-fossil fuel policies. The plaintiffs argue that two state laws, which prohibit the public service commission from considering air pollution when permitting new fossil fuel plants and from requiring more carbon-free electricity, violate their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The lead plaintiff, Kaarina, shared her personal story of forced relocation due to climate-exacerbated flooding, highlighting the direct impacts on youth. The lawsuit, supported by non-profit law firms, seeks to overturn these laws and push Wisconsin towards its pledged 100% carbon-free electricity goal by 2050.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in his Jackson Hole speech, offered a cautious indication of potential interest rate cuts, citing "sweeping changes" in policy and a "shifting balance of risks" to the economy. While noting a resilient labor market, he highlighted rising downside dangers and inflation risks from tariffs, suggesting the Fed can "proceed carefully." Powell's remarks hinted that current restrictive policy and evolving risks "may warrant adjusting our policy stance," which the market interpreted as dovish. He also reaffirmed the Fed's 2% inflation target and emphasized the importance of the central bank's independence from political demands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 1870s marked a period of immense cultural, economic, and technological transformation in America, as explored through historical photos. This era, fueled by the Second Industrial Revolution, saw millions migrate from rural areas to burgeoning, often crowded and unsafe, cities. Railroad expansion facilitated westward movement, while European immigration reshaped demographics. Despite the abolition of slavery, African Americans faced severe limitations on their freedom and voting rights, with the Civil Rights Act of 1875 later deemed unconstitutional. The period also witnessed a rise in public education, new leisure activities like cycling and baseball, and significant advancements in transportation and communication.</p>
