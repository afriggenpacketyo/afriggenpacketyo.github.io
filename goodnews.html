          <p>This article details the investigation into the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis, where a key piece of evidence was bloody, bare footprints left at the crime scene. The footprints, combined with DNA evidence, eventually led investigators to Jerry Westrom, who was convicted of the murder in 2022. The article describes how forensic scientists used genetic genealogy to identify Westrom as a suspect and how footprint analysis confirmed his presence at the scene. Despite Westrom's denial and the presence of other DNA at the scene, the jury found him guilty, bringing closure to a decades-long search for justice.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This approach involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Examples include the extension of Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway, where Chinese firms contribute a significant portion of the funding and gain exclusive construction and operation rights for decades.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's only female combat pilot, Lieutenant Kateryna, flies helicopter missions against Russian troops, highlighting the country's efforts to recruit more women into the military.
