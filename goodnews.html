        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis is spearheading an ambitious plan to revive the Stellantis-owned truck brand following a significant 38% sales decline since 2019. The strategy includes reintroducing popular Hemi V-8 engines, launching a new industry-leading powertrain warranty, and returning to NASCAR to boost brand visibility. Kuniskis aims to reclaim a substantial market share, targeting a figure in the 20-29% range, up from the current 17%, by focusing on both retail sales and operational efficiency. The turnaround plan, which extends through 2026, also involves delaying some electrification projects to align with current market demand and launching new models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major tech companies and governments are heavily investing in quantum computing, a technology that promises to solve problems currently impossible for traditional computers, though it remains largely in the research phase. While potential applications include breakthroughs in medicine, material science, and AI, the most immediate concern is its ability to break current encryption standards, posing a significant national security risk. Researchers are focused on overcoming major hurdles like error correction and scaling the number of qubits from dozens to the millions needed for a practical machine. Despite recent progress, experts believe a useful quantum computer is still many years away from realization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The once-iconic hotel minibar, popularized in the 1970s, has largely fallen out of favor with major hotel chains due to logistical and financial challenges. High operational costs, food spoilage, and theft made the amenity more of a burden than a revenue generator for many establishments. In response, hotels have shifted towards more modern and profitable alternatives like 24/7 lobby marketplaces and strategic partnerships with food delivery services such as DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub. While some luxury and boutique hotels are reimagining the minibar with curated local products, it is becoming a relic in most midscale hotels, replaced by more convenient options for travelers.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer and a key Tesla supplier, is aggressively expanding its global operations. Facing intense price wars and overcapacity in China, the company is using funds from its recent $5.2 billion Hong Kong IPO to build factories in Europe, including a major plant in Hungary. CATL also plans to introduce its battery-swapping technology to the European market, a move that could significantly alter the region's EV landscape by addressing concerns about charging speed and battery longevity.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists report they may have found the oldest rocks on Earth within Canada's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt in Quebec. Using two different dating techniques, a new study estimates the rocks are approximately 4.16 billion years old, settling a long-standing dispute over their age. These primordial rocks are extremely rare, as Earth's tectonic activity typically recycles older formations. Studying such ancient samples provides a valuable glimpse into the planet's earliest history, including how its crust formed and potentially how life began. The site, located on Inuit tribal lands, is currently restricted to prevent damage while a plan for its protection and research is developed.</p>

          <p>A contentious debate is underway over whether to remove the grizzly bear from the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) list, a decision with major implications for conservation policy. After being listed in 1975, the grizzly population in the Yellowstone area has recovered successfully, exceeding all biological benchmarks and now numbering over 1,000. Proponents of delisting argue that the ESA's purpose is to recover species, not protect them indefinitely, and that state agencies are equipped to manage the population. Opponents fear that removing federal protections would expose the bears to new threats like hunting and habitat loss, arguing the recovery is still fragile and could be reversed by political pressures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karen Russell's new novel, "The Antidote," uses a historical fantasy setting in Dust Bowl-era Nebraska to explore the dangers of memory erasure. The story centers on a "prairie witch" who stores painful memories for townspeople, allowing them to avoid guilt, including the founding shame of stealing land from American Indians. The novel argues against the fantasy of shedding the past, suggesting that memories, both personal and collective, must be kept in circulation for societal health and individual self-knowledge. Through its characters, the book posits that confronting and sharing difficult histories, rather than hiding them, is essential for justice, healing, and maintaining a true sense of identity.</p>

In contrast, less wealthy but still affluent buyers are acting more cautiously, being more sensitive to high interest rates. According to a survey of luxury agents, over half have seen an increase in all-cash offers in 2025, as wealthy buyers seek to avoid high borrowing costs and leverage real estate as a hedge against inflation. However, the market saw a dip in May, and buyers at all luxury price points have become more discerning about property condition and amenities. (not investment advice)</p>
