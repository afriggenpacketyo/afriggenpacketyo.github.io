        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's finding that the Trump administration's sweeps appeared to be based on race or language. The ruling requires federal agents to have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals and prohibits basing arrests solely on factors like ethnicity or speaking Spanish. While the administration criticized the decision as judicial overreach, immigrant advocacy groups praised it as a crucial protection of constitutional rights against indiscriminate enforcement actions that have instilled fear in local communities.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers superstar Luka Doncic has officially signed a contract extension, solidifying his commitment to the franchise for the foreseeable future. The 26-year-old guard, who was acquired in a major trade from the Dallas Mavericks last season, announced the deal himself, expressing excitement to pursue championships in Los Angeles. The move ends speculation about his potential departure and positions him as the central figure for the team in the post-LeBron James era. In conjunction with the signing, Doncic also pledged a $5 million donation to support young athletes globally.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is establishing a new left-wing political party with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, but it currently lacks a name. The duo is asking their reported 600,000 registered supporters to help choose a name, which must be approved by the Electoral Commission before they can field candidates. Experts note that a party's name is a crucial part of its brand identity in the modern digital age, where traditional party structures have eroded. The challenge lies in finding a title that effectively conveys the party's core principles and resonates with voters.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather from cancer was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in comedy. Hill, who was a qualified doctor, felt unsuited for the profession and recalled feeling out of his depth when breaking tragic news to patients. He explained that his stepfather's death at age 54 made him realize he did not want to spend his life in a career he was not passionate about. The move ultimately led to a successful entertainment career with popular shows like "Harry Hill's TV Burp."</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a prominent advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, is now signaling a more cautious approach to its strategy. This shift contrasts sharply with China's aggressive embrace of open-source AI, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced models. Some experts, including computer scientist Andrew Ng, suggest that China's competitive open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in AI development. This dynamic highlights a potential divergence in strategy between Western and Chinese tech giants in the race for AI dominance.</p>

A team of 150 employees found numerous items dropped from ski lifts, including an old iPod Nano, vape cartridges, and inexplicably, a hamburger flipper. The most unusual find was a message in a bottle that contained an old COVID-19 vaccination card. The resort noted that beyond the strange finds, the effort serves as an important reminder to care for shared natural spaces.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. She was detained in May during what the couple believed was a routine green card application interview, due to an old, unknown removal order. Her case drew attention to the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement, which has seen a dramatic increase in arrests. After advocacy from her attorney and the office of Senator John Kennedy, she was released on bond and reunited with her family.</p>

The deal, which is pending league approval, includes plans to relocate the team to Boston for the 2027 season and build a new $100 million practice facility. The Sun, currently owned by the Mohegan Tribe, has been one of the league's most successful teams on the court.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was sent from Australia in 1943 as a diplomatic gift but died just before arriving in the UK. For decades, it was rumored that the creature died from shell-shock caused by a nearby German U-boat attack. However, recent archival research by students has revealed that the platypus likely died from overheating, as logbooks showed water temperatures on the ship rose well above the safe threshold for the species.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes competition is underway at the New Orleans Saints training camp, where two Australian punters are battling for a single NFL contract worth nearly $3 million. Incumbent punter Matt Hayball, a former Geelong VFL player, is facing a challenge from rookie James Burnip, who recently finished his career at the University of Alabama. Both athletes are graduates of the ProKick Australia academy. The situation highlights the cutthroat nature of the NFL, where only one will secure the lucrative roster spot by the final cuts, leaving the other unemployed.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start since returning from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his efforts were not enough as the Dodgers lost 4-0 to the Tampa Bay Rays. Snell's only blemishes were two home runs hit by Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite the loss, Snell's sharp return, characterized by strong command and 19 swing-and-misses, offered a promising sign for the Dodgers' late-season starting rotation.</p>

          <p>With former Vice President Kamala Harris announcing she will not run for governor of California, the race has been thrown wide open with no obvious front-runner. Candidates like former Rep. Katie Porter and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra are now vying to establish momentum, but political observers note that none currently possess statewide name recognition. The absence of Harris, who had frozen fundraising and planning for other hopefuls, means the campaign is effectively resetting. Experts suggest that factors like fundraising, key endorsements, and the ability to build a profile will now be crucial in the wide-open field.</p>
