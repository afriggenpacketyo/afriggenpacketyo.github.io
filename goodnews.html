          <h2>US Intelligence Memo Contradicts Trump's Claims About Venezuelan Gang</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 13:22:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A declassified U.S. intelligence memo concludes that the Venezuelan government, led by President Maduro, does not control the Tren de Aragua (TDA) criminal gang. This contradicts claims made by President Trump, who has used the gang's alleged control by Maduro to justify deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while some Maduro regime members may tolerate or work with TDA, there is no evidence of widespread, organized cooperation or direction of the gang's activities in the U.S. The intelligence community assesses that Maduro views the gang as a threat, and that TDA is decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large-scale human trafficking or migrant smuggling.</p>
