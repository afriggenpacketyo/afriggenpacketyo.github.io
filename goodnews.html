          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia have announced a new initiative to ensure a stable supply of critical minerals, a move aimed at reducing reliance on China's market dominance. The 'Quad' group's joint statement emphasized the risks of depending on a single country, citing potential economic coercion and supply chain disruptions. The initiative was announced following a meeting of the nations' foreign ministers in Washington, D.C. This collaboration seeks to diversify supply chains for minerals essential for semiconductors and other advanced technologies, reinforcing strategic stability in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The Brooklyn-based judge stated the Department of Homeland Security lacks the authority to revoke the designation before its previously scheduled expiration in February 2026. The administration had planned to end the protections in September, which would have removed work permits and exposed migrants to deportation. The court's decision emphasized that migrants had relied on the existing deadline to enroll in schools, secure jobs, and receive medical treatment.</p>

          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a decorated WWII veteran, attorney, and real estate developer who was a pivotal figure in shaping Los Angeles's cultural landscape, has died at age 105.

He played a key role in acquiring the Panza Collection, which forms the core of MOCA's permanent collection.

          <p>The number of migrants apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border dropped to a historic monthly low of just over 6,000 in June, according to preliminary government data. This continues a significant lull in illegal immigration that the Trump administration credits to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced border enforcement. The figures are a stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration, where daily apprehensions often exceeded this new monthly total. Administration officials confirmed that for a second consecutive month, no migrants were released into the U.S. after being apprehended.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza.

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who testified before lawmakers in 2023 while dying from a rare cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's advocacy drew a direct line between the chemicals, which contaminated her community's water, and public health crises, inspiring lawmakers to take decisive action against the widespread pollutants.</p>

With shrapnel injuries now accounting for up to 80% of battlefield trauma, these tools allow for minimally invasive procedures, even on delicate organs like the heart. Developed by a volunteer-led initiative, the modernized magnets are more precise and effective than older methods.
