          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The pair, who have lived and run a charity in the country for almost two decades, were freed following mediation by Qatar. Their family had publicly lobbied for their release for months, expressing grave concerns over their deteriorating health in prison, including malnutrition and convulsions. The Taliban, which has not disclosed the reason for the detention, maintained that the couple received adequate medical care while in custody.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has rejected former President Donald Trump's suggestion that the military should be used to stop asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel. During a state visit, Trump advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration, a proposal Trade Secretary Peter Kyle dismissed, stating that the UK Border Force is responsible for policing borders. Kyle emphasized that the military's primary focus should remain on national defense, although a working relationship with the Border Force exists. The discussion occurs as the UK government continues its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France to deter small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>Apple has launched its iPhone 17 series globally, drawing significant crowds from Beijing to London. The release is seen as a critical test for the company as it faces intensified competition in key markets like China from rivals such as Huawei and Xiaomi. Early signs, including strong preorder volumes on Chinese e-commerce platforms, suggest positive consumer demand for the new models, which include the iPhone 17 Pro and a new iPhone Air. However, the successful launch is set against a backdrop of investor pressure for Apple to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises after a previously underwhelming rollout.</p>

          <p>Human remains discovered in Oregon's Central Cascades in 1976 have been identified as Marion Vinetta Nagle McWhorter, who went missing in 1974 at the age of 21. The identification was made possible after her younger sister, Valerie Nagle, submitted her DNA to an ancestry website, which was later matched to the cold case. McWhorter, who was of Ahtna Athabascan heritage, was last seen at a shopping mall in a Portland suburb. The breakthrough provides long-awaited closure for her family, and the Linn County Sheriff's Office is now investigating the circumstances surrounding her death.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C.'s veteran non-voting delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, 88, is facing a primary challenge from city council member Robert White. White argues that the district needs its "strongest fighters" in Congress, particularly as it confronts interference from the Trump administration, implying it is time for new leadership. This challenge comes amid growing concerns about Norton's ability to continue her role effectively, which she has held since 1991. The political pressure mounts as D.C. leaders contend with federal oversight of the city's police and legislative proposals from House Republicans aimed at imposing "tough on crime" policies.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish governments have unveiled a new framework to handle legacy cases from the Northern Ireland Troubles, aiming to provide "maximum truth, justice and accountability" for victims. This new deal is intended to replace the widely opposed Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act. Key provisions include restoring inquests that were previously halted, establishing an independently overseen Legacy Commission with new investigative directors, and creating a cross-border body for information retrieval. The agreement, which requires new legislation in both countries, is being presented as a significant improvement for addressing the conflict's painful history.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is investing in a Zambian copper and cobalt facility through a $1.4 million grant to fund a feasibility study for its expansion. This strategic move aims to secure a direct supply of these critical metals for American industries, thereby challenging China's near-monopoly on their production and processing. The grant, provided by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency to a subsidiary of the U.S.-based company Metalex, supports plans to increase production at the Kazozu mine. The initiative is part of a broader effort by the U.S. to diversify supply chains for minerals essential for electric vehicles and military equipment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a podcast discussion, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens and host Garry Kasparov explore the state of American democracy and the possibility of a political realignment. They argue that the traditional left-right divide is becoming obsolete, replaced by a conflict between liberal and illiberal forces. Stephens suggests that what America needs is not a centrist party but a true liberal party dedicated to free markets, free speech, and the rule of law. The conversation posits that such a shift could emerge from the implosion of one of the existing major parties, but would require a charismatic leader to build a new winning coalition.</p>

          <p>An Eritrean man has been deported from the UK to France under the new "one in, one out" agreement after the government won a last-minute High Court challenge. To secure the removal, the Home Office tightened rules around human trafficking claims, arguing that such claims can be pursued from a safe country like France. The judge ruled the deportation was in the public interest as part of a policy to disrupt criminal smuggling gangs. This case marks a significant legal victory for the government's strategy to deter small boat crossings by creating a risk of return to France for asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>Secondhand shopping has evolved from a niche hobby into a major global market, driven by younger consumers who see it as a creative and sustainable alternative to fast fashion. Resale promises to reduce waste and carbon emissions from the fashion industry, which is a significant global polluter. However, as major retailers like Zara and H&M enter the resale market, they are bringing e-commerce tactics that encourage impulse buying and overconsumption. Experts warn that without a corresponding reduction in the production of new clothes, the environmental benefits of thrifting could be undermined, turning it into just another revenue stream for fast fashion.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Getafe's manager, José Bordalás, a figure who polarizes opinion in Spanish football with his pragmatic and intensely physical style of play, often labeled "anti-football" by purists. Despite criticism from high-profile figures like Xavi, Bordalás has a formidable record, consistently leading Getafe to overachieve with one of La Liga's smaller budgets. His methods are rooted in meticulous structure, high-pressure tactics, and demanding training sessions that push players to their limits. While his approach sacrifices aesthetic beauty for results, it has made his teams notoriously difficult to play against and earned him deep respect from his players and fans.</p>

For towns like Marfa, Friday night lights bring together generations of residents, reinforcing traditions and fostering a sense of unity.

This surplus has also led to less competition and fighting among the bears, with observers noting significantly more playful behavior.

          <p>The Bank of Japan has decided to keep its policy rate steady at 0.5%, a move that was widely expected by economists. The decision comes as Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% for August, its lowest level since November 2024 and the third consecutive month of decline. While inflation remains above the bank's 2% target, the easing price pressures support the BOJ's cautious stance against premature tightening.
