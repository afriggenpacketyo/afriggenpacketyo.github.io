        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco's net profit for the first quarter of the year decreased by 5% compared to the same period last year, totaling $26 billion. This decline is attributed to lower oil prices and reduced production. While the profit marginally exceeded analyst expectations, free cash flow also fell from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion. The company maintained its base dividend but reduced its performance-linked dividend payout, reflecting ongoing financial pressures amid slowing global demand and trade challenges.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that China is increasingly investing in renewable energy projects in Africa, with solar and wind power accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, and Africa has become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with global trends as China commits to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas. The growing demand for electricity and untapped renewable energy resources on the continent are expected to further drive this trend.</p>

          <p>Wayne Dopson, an Australian business owner, replaced his gas-powered truck with a BYD Shark hybrid pickup, praising its technology, power, and smooth ride. Dopson highlights the low running costs due to his solar panels and the vehicle's ability to power tools on-site. While he appreciates the Shark's features and performance, he is concerned about its resale value due to rapid advancements in EV technology. Dopson believes that more Chinese EV brands in Australia will lead to longer warranty periods and better quality cars, despite some limitations in off-roading capabilities.</p>

          <p>Jorgen Boassen, a former bricklayer from Greenland, has become an unlikely political influencer due to his fervent support for President Trump. Despite facing hostility at home for his pro-Trump stance, Boassen's advocacy has gained him contacts in Washington and a role in promoting closer U.S.-Greenland ties. He is now advocating for a security alliance between an independent Greenland and the United States, believing that Denmark has failed to adequately defend the territory. Boassen's story highlights the intersection of local politics and international relations in the Arctic region.</p>

          <p>A Chinese team has developed an algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to perform autonomous aerobatic maneuvers, surpassing human capabilities in intense flight missions. The algorithm allows drones to execute high-risk maneuvers and adjust speed and direction rapidly, mimicking the agility of birds of prey. This innovation could redefine traditional drone flight paradigms by transforming unstable postures into high-survival rewards, potentially revolutionizing applications in various fields.</p>

The museum, located in a U.S. town accessible only through Canada, relies heavily on Canadian tourism, which has declined due to boycotts and economic factors. The owners, facing 145% tariffs on their Chinese-made ducks, found it unsustainable to continue operating in the U.S. and decided to move their business across the border.</p>
