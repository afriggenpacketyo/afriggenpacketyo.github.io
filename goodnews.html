          <p>The UK government has signed an agreement with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to explore using artificial intelligence in public services like education, defense, and justice. This non-binding deal aims to boost productivity and economic growth, with OpenAI expanding its London office. The partnership will also focus on developing safeguards to protect public data and democratic values, though it has drawn criticism from groups concerned about the unlicensed use of creative works for training AI models.</p>

          <p>An exhibition at the National Museum of Ireland is showcasing 1,300-year-old manuscripts featuring doodles and notes from early medieval Irish monks. These scribbles, found in the margins of a 6th-century grammar book, offer a rare glimpse into the monks' daily lives, including complaints about hangovers, bad weather, and poor-quality ink. The notes, written in Old Irish, also express anxieties about Viking raids, providing a humanizing look at monastic life. The exhibit, on loan from Switzerland's Abbey Library of St. Gall, highlights the personal and humorous side of these historical figures.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has announced plans to invest $50 billion in its U.S. operations by 2030, a move that follows similar commitments from other global drugmakers amid U.S. tariff pressures. A key part of the investment is a new multi-billion dollar facility in Virginia to produce its weight management drugs, which will be its largest single manufacturing investment globally. The funding will also expand R&D and cell therapy capabilities in several states, creating thousands of jobs. This commitment underscores the company's focus on the U.S. market, which is expected to generate half of its projected $80 billion annual revenue by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Formula 1 Q&A session addresses several key topics, including the future of driver Max Verstappen, who is considered more likely to stay at Red Bull than leave for Mercedes. It also discusses the transition of new team principal Laurent Mekies to Red Bull following Christian Horner's departure, noting Mekies will likely observe before making major changes. The article explains that new floor upgrades on current cars are not relevant for the 2026 season due to a complete overhaul of aerodynamic regulations. Finally, it explores how teams gauge engine development for 2026, suggesting gossip and staff movement create an impression that Mercedes is currently ahead.</p>

          <p>The small Norwegian village of Ulefoss sits atop the Fensfeltet, Europe's largest known deposit of rare earth elements, which are vital for modern technologies like electric vehicles and defense systems. A mining company, Rare Earths Norway (REN), plans to develop an "invisible mine" by tunneling diagonally to access the deposit, aiming to begin full-scale operations by 2030. This project could be a game-changer for the EU, which currently relies almost entirely on China for these critical materials. While there are local concerns about environmental impact and potential subsidence, the community, with its long history of mining, is generally supportive.</p>

Recent progress has been spurred by the launch of semi-solid-state EVs in China, with many companies now aiming for a 2027/28 rollout. However, some experts remain skeptical, pointing to persistent technological hurdles, high costs, and significant improvements in existing battery technologies that weaken the investment case for solid-state.
