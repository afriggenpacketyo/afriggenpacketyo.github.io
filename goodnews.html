          <p>Nvidia announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst predictions, driven by a 56% surge in its data center business. The company's forecast for the current quarter also indicates continued strong growth, with expected revenue of $54 billion, signaling sustained high demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite this positive performance, data center revenue slightly missed estimates for the second consecutive quarter, causing a minor dip in the stock during extended trading. The report confirms Nvidia's central role in the global AI buildout, with the company also approving an additional $60 billion in share repurchases.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis highlights the increasing financial strain of buying a new car, with nearly one in five buyers committing to monthly payments of $1,000 or more. To navigate this expensive market, experts advise against several common mistakes, including purchasing a vehicle beyond one's financial means and accepting dealership financing without securing a pre-approved loan from an external lender first. Other critical errors to avoid are trading in a car with negative equity, failing to negotiate with a dealership's internet sales team, and overlooking the value of certified pre-owned vehicles. These steps can save consumers thousands of dollars and prevent long-term financial distress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southern California is expected to experience rainfall, potential thunderstorms, and dangerous surf conditions this week due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Juliette. The cyclone, currently weakening off the coast of Mexico, is projected to bring increasing moisture to the region starting Wednesday night. Forecasters anticipate scattered showers across southwestern California, with some areas potentially receiving up to a quarter-inch of rain. The mountains in Riverside and San Bernardino counties face the highest risk of thunderstorms and possible flash flooding, while coastal areas are warned of hazardous rip currents through Friday.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Key CD Strategies Ahead of Anticipated September Fed Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 16:28:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a high probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, savers are advised to take strategic actions now to maximize earnings from certificates of deposit (CDs). Experts recommend that consumers shop online for the highest available rates, as online banks typically offer better returns than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. It is also crucial to accurately determine the amount of money one can afford to deposit without needing early access, to avoid withdrawal penalties. Finally, savers should look to secure the longest-term CD that fits their financial plan, locking in current high rates before they potentially decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain Why September May Be an Opportune Time for Homeowners to Consider a HELOC</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 16:23:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing against their home equity may find September to be an advantageous month to apply for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Currently, HELOCs offer one of the cheapest borrowing options, with average interest rates lower than those for home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards. Furthermore, with a Federal Reserve rate cut likely this month, the variable rates on HELOCs could become even cheaper. This coincides with record-high home equity levels, providing homeowners with a substantial borrowing base, though experts caution against the temptation to overborrow from this accessible source of funds.

          <p>Shares of Kohl's jumped 24% after the department store chain reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Despite a decline in overall sales, the company showed progress in reducing inventory and managing expenses, prompting it to narrow its full-year sales guidance to the higher end of its previous forecast. Interim CEO Michael Bender acknowledged that economic pressures are causing some customers to trade down but stated the company is correcting its own missteps. These changes include reintroducing petite sections, bringing back jewelry, and overhauling its coupon strategy to win back shoppers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers seeking a secure return on a significant deposit, a $40,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) can still offer substantial interest earnings despite the potential for higher returns in the stock market. Current rates could yield anywhere from approximately $423 on a 3-month CD to over $9,000 on a 5-year CD. This option is particularly attractive for those who prioritize principal protection and predictable growth over the volatility of equity investments. However, with a potential Federal Reserve rate cut looming, experts suggest that now is a good time to act to lock in these higher rates before they potentially decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The announcement of Taylor Swift's engagement to NFL player Travis Kelce has demonstrated the pop star's significant economic influence, causing noticeable movements in the stock market. Following the news, shares of Signet Jewelers, one of the few publicly traded jewelry companies, jumped over 6%, while Ralph Lauren, the brand the couple appeared to be wearing, also saw a modest rise. The event even boosted shares of American Eagle after it announced a collaboration with Kelce's clothing brand. This phenomenon, where Swift's activities directly impact consumer behavior and corporate valuations, underscores her unique position as a major economic driver.</p>

          <p>Keegan Bradley has confirmed he will not be a playing member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team, choosing instead to focus solely on his role as captain for the upcoming event in New York. While Bradley admitted that the decision to overlook his own playing ambitions "hurts," he described the captaincy as the "ultimate job in golf" and a significant honor. The move is seen as a selfless act that could inspire his selected players, as it eliminates any questions of self-interest. His decision aligns with the modern demands of the captaincy, which have made the dual role of player-captain, last held by Arnold Palmer, nearly impossible in the contemporary era.</p>

CEO Dev Ittycheria credited the success to a boom in customer acquisition, noting that the company added over 5,000 new customers in the first half of the year, many of whom are AI-native companies.

          <p>Restaurant chain Cracker Barrel has abandoned its new logo and reverted to its original design following widespread public criticism, including from former President Donald Trump. The attempted rebrand, which removed the iconic image of "Uncle Herschel" from the logo, was met with accusations that the company was abandoning its traditional, folksy identity for a "sterile" and "soulless" design. The episode caused a nearly $100 million drop in the company's market value, which has since recovered. Branding experts noted that the company failed to appreciate its customers' deep emotional connection to its established image, which evokes a sense of nostalgia and homestyle comfort.</p>

The 22-year-old right-hander has had a dominant season in the minor leagues, leading all players in both strikeouts and earned-run average. After posting a 1.59 ERA in Double-A, he was promoted to Triple-A Syracuse, where he pitched 11.2 scoreless innings. The Mets are bringing Tong up to serve as a sixth starter, providing their pitching rotation with extra rest as the team competes for a playoff spot in the final stretch of the season.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that nearly six million full-time workers in the U.S. without a bachelor's degree earned over $100,000 in 2023, challenging the traditional view that a four-year degree is essential for a high-paying career. The report identified numerous fields where a significant percentage of non-graduates achieve six-figure salaries, including software development, architectural management, and skilled trades like elevator installation and repair. This data comes as many people question the return on investment of a college education due to rising tuition and student debt. A growing number of employers are also loosening degree requirements, opening more opportunities for skilled workers.</p>

This development signals compliance with a federal judge's recent order to shut down the facility, which has faced heavy criticism and multiple lawsuits over its harsh conditions and environmental impact. The camp was constructed hastily at a remote airstrip and was touted by Donald Trump as a holding center for undocumented immigrants.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL has relaxed some of the restrictions placed on Tom Brady for his second season as a Fox Sports analyst, now that his minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders is approved. Last year, Brady was barred from attending pre-game production meetings with coaches and players to avoid conflicts of interest. The league has now lifted that rule, although he must still attend these meetings remotely and is prohibited from being at team facilities for practices. The rule preventing him from egregiously criticizing officials remains in place. This adjustment allows Brady more access to prepare for his broadcasting duties.</p>
