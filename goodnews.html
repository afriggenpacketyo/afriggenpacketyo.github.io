          <p>Layoff notices for staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) were rescinded, and several worker safety programs are being restored. The reinstatements came a day before Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was scheduled to testify before Congress about the layoffs. Restored positions include those in respiratory health, safety research, compensation analysis, and personal protective technology. However, some staff, particularly in mining research, remain laid off, and the CDC's STD and viral hepatitis labs are still affected by layoffs. The article provides context on the agency's role and the impact of the initial layoffs on critical safety programs.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Australia have found that Barbie doll's feet have evolved from arched to flat, correlating with her designated career or hobby. This shift reflects Barbie's empowerment and changing social roles. The study examined 2,750 dolls produced from 1959 to 2024, measuring foot posture, equity, employment, and time. The research found that "employed" dolls were more likely to have flat feet, while fashion-focused ones had arched feet. The article contextualizes this finding within the broader history of Barbie and her representation of women's roles in society.</p>
