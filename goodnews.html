          <p>South Korea has ceased its loudspeaker broadcasts of anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, signaling a move towards easing tensions. President Lee Jae-myung ordered the halt as part of efforts to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which resumed last year in response to North Korea's trash balloon campaign, included K-pop songs and messages critical of the North Korean leadership. This decision is seen as a proactive step to reduce military tensions and alleviate concerns for South Koreans residing near the border, though North Korea has yet to respond to Seoul's move.</p>
