          <p>Belarus released opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky and over a dozen other political prisoners after an appeal from the White House, signaling a potential thaw in relations between Belarus and the US. The release occurred shortly after a visit from President Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, to Minsk, marking a high-profile engagement. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, expressed gratitude to President Trump for brokering the deal, and Lukashenko's spokeswoman indicated that the release was ordered at Trump's request. The freed prisoners have been transferred to Lithuania and are receiving care, with several European politicians and members of Belarus's exiled opposition welcoming the news.</p>

          <p>A yacht carrying approximately 400 people struck a dock in the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street, resulting in non-life-threatening injuries to 35 people. The boat hit a pylon while attempting to dock near Riverside Park, causing passengers who were waiting to disembark to fall. Marine units escorted the yacht to a dock at West 125th Street, where passengers were unloaded, and 22 individuals were taken to local hospitals for treatment. The Coast Guard is currently investigating the incident, which follows a similar crash last month involving a Mexican navy training ship and the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC report examines the challenges faced by GP receptionists during the daily 8 AM rush for appointments in England. Receptionists often encounter frustrated patients who perceive them as obstacles to accessing care. The Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham, like many others, experiences a surge in calls when lines open, with appointments typically booked within half an hour. Despite upgrades to the telephone system, high demand means some patients inevitably miss out, leading to verbal abuse and emotional strain on reception staff. The government is implementing measures to address the issue, including increased funding and online appointment booking options.</p>

          <p>The pop-punk band South Arcade is riding the wave of Y2K core, a growing interest in the culture of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their music, reminiscent of MTV and 90s slasher movie soundtracks, draws inspiration from artists like Rihanna, Korn, and Justice. While band members were born at the start of the millennium, their fondness for the era stems from older siblings and friends. They gained traction on TikTok, where the Y2K hashtag has been used in millions of posts, and they see a mix of fans engaging with their music, from those who experienced the era firsthand to younger listeners discovering it for the first time.</p>

          <h2>Social Media "Quick Fixes" For Stress Hormones Questioned</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC article questions the validity of social media advice promoting "quick fixes" to lower cortisol levels, a stress hormone. The article notes the prevalence of posts advising cortisol cocktails, supplements, and lavender balm, while experts caution against relying on these methods. Professor John Wass of the University of Oxford argues that attributing body changes solely to cortisol levels is misleading, as various factors can contribute. Jasleen Kaur Carroll, a technology company manager, found that social media hacks were ineffective in addressing her burnout and autoimmune condition flare-up, emphasizing the need to tackle the root cause of stress through therapy and mindfulness.</p>

          <p>Students are being urged to report blackmail scams encountered on dating apps, as investigators note a rise in such cases. Fraud teams at Nationwide advise potential victims to seek trusted friends' help to avoid sharing private images during new online relationships. A Cardiff student shared an experience of recognizing AI technology being used by fraudsters. The National Crime Agency issued an alert to schools about the dangers of sextortion, where criminals trick victims into sending explicit material and then blackmail them. Those being blackmailed are urged to seek help and support and not to suffer in silence.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, proposed offering new army recruits a ¬£10,000 bonus to boost troop numbers amid concerns about global instability. The plan aims to increase the number of trained soldiers from just under 71,000 to more than 73,000, and former armed services personnel would be offered ¬£20,000 to return for two additional years. Additionally, the Liberal Democrats suggested distributing pamphlets to every British home to prepare citizens for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The party plans to fund the bonus scheme through an increase in the Digital Services Tax on large social media and tech companies.</p>
