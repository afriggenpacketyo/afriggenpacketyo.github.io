          <p>The Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower rates.  The decision follows a period of observation regarding the impact of Trump's tariff policies on inflation and economic growth.  The Fed's forecast indicates some concern about rising inflation, predicting two rate cuts in 2025 and additional cuts in 2026 and 2027.  This decision contrasts sharply with Trump's repeated calls for immediate rate reductions.</p>
