          <p>Wesleyan University President Michael Roth expressed concern over potential restrictions on Chinese students and the broader implications for higher education in the United States. He views the increased scrutiny of Chinese students as an act of intimidation aimed at scaring schools into conforming to the current administration's policies. Roth emphasized the importance of attracting international students to learn about American values and freedoms, noting that limiting their access undermines the country's free atmosphere. While acknowledging legitimate criticisms of higher education, such as a lack of intellectual diversity, he cautioned against addressing these issues under pressure from an authoritarian administration.</p>
