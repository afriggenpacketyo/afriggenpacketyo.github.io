          <p>Ether (ETH) surged to a new record high, its first since 2021, immediately following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole, which strongly hinted at potential interest rate cuts. Powell indicated that the current restrictive policy stance and shifting economic risks might warrant adjustments. This unexpected dovish tone from the Fed chairman triggered a rapid market repositioning, leading to approximately $120 million in short liquidations for ETH within an hour. The development also positively impacted shares of companies focused on accumulating ether, reflecting a broader sentiment of easing monetary policy that could continue to fuel crypto market momentum.

          <p>The Consulate General of India has secured a lease for a full floor in downtown Los Angeles' AON Center, establishing its second California office in addition to San Francisco. This 10-year lease for over 20,500 square feet signals expanded cooperation between Los Angeles and India, especially with Southern California hosting global events like the 2028 Olympics and parts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The new diplomatic presence aims to make essential services more accessible to the over half a million Indian Americans in the region and foster increased trade, investment, and cultural connections across various industries.

          <p>England's Red Roses delivered a dominant 69-17 victory over the United States in their Women's Rugby World Cup opener, played before a record-breaking crowd of 42,723. Reigning World Player of the Year Ellie Kildunne was instrumental, scoring two tries and assisting two others in a player-of-the-match performance. Despite the overwhelming win, which extended their streak to 28 victories, head coach John Mitchell emphasized the need for continued improvement, noting some midfield passes went astray and a desire for more clinical play in the first half. The team's strong performance, particularly in the scrum and driving maul, sets a high standard for their campaign.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists and divers have recovered ancient artifacts, including a sphinx statue and Roman coins, from Abu Qir Bay near Alexandria, Egypt. These relics are believed to be from a sunken city, possibly an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, dating back over 2,000 years to the Ptolemaic and Roman eras. Many statues are notably missing their heads and feet, a type of damage attributed by officials to a natural disaster such as a tsunami or earthquake. The discoveries confirm the site was once a thriving residential city and port, also underscoring Alexandria's vulnerability to rising sea levels, which are projected to render one-third of the city uninhabitable by 2050.</p>

          <p>Meta is preparing to unveil its "Hypernova" smart glasses, featuring a digital display in the right lens, and a neural wristband controller at its annual Connect conference next month. These consumer-ready glasses, expected to cost around $800 and sold in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, will offer limited visual features, primarily for displaying simple information like text messages. The accompanying wristband, developed by Meta's CTRL Labs, utilizes sEMG sensor technology to enable hand gesture control, with the aim of gathering crucial data for future, more advanced AR glasses. This launch signifies Meta's deeper commitment to the wearables market, despite the company setting low initial sales expectations for the Hypernova device.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is nearing new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, significantly restructuring its broadcasting landscape. Under the proposed deals, NBC is expected to acquire all Sunday night games and wild-card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix will secure the rights to the Home Run Derby for about $50 million a year. ESPN will receive a new $550 million package, which includes MLB TV rights and in-market games for five local teams, alongside a new midweek national game package. These three-year agreements mean all major MLB media rights will now expire after the 2028 season, potentially benefiting the league monetarily and in terms of reach by attracting more bidders.</p>

Despite its growth, Netskope is not yet profitable, recording a $170 million net loss, though this figure represents a narrowing from the prior year's loss. The IPO occurs during a dynamic period for cybersecurity deals, following successful market debuts by several other tech firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares experienced a rise of over 3% following reports that Apple is in early discussions to potentially integrate Google's Gemini AI models into an updated version of Siri. Apple reportedly inquired about Google developing a custom AI model for a Siri launch anticipated next year, particularly as Apple has faced challenges in defining its own AI strategy, while Gemini consistently ranks high in AI benchmarks. These reported talks are significant, especially as Google faces potential risks to its lucrative search deals with Apple, with an upcoming judge's ruling on Google's alleged search monopoly. Such a collaboration could profoundly reshape the competitive landscape of AI assistants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Democrats have introduced a new bill aimed at establishing clear legal thresholds for advanced chips considered too critical to export to China without explicit congressional approval. The proposed legislation would mandate review for chips exceeding specific performance benchmarks, including total processing performance, performance density, memory speeds, or interconnect speeds. Representative Krishnamoorthi, ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, stated the bill's intention is to curb China's access to cutting-edge chips that support its military modernization and surveillance efforts. While designed to enhance national security, the measure faces significant challenges in passing both the Republican-led House and Senate.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. government has acquired a 10% stake in Intel, making it one of the tech giant's largest shareholders. This unprecedented move, confirmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Intel, originated from a meeting with CEO Lip Bu Tan following Trump's earlier demands for Tan's resignation over alleged China ties. The $8.9 billion investment is funded by existing CHIPS and Science Act grants and Secure Enclave program funds, converting them into equity. Trump framed the deal as crucial for strengthening U.S. leadership in semiconductors and boosting domestic chip production, aiming to reduce dependence on overseas manufacturing and secure a technological edge against China.

          <p>This opinion article asserts that Hong Kong can forge a crucial role in enhancing climate resilience for the Greater Bay Area, a highly dynamic economic region with over 86 million inhabitants. With the area increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events, climate resilience is framed not merely as an environmental imperative but as a fundamental economic strategy to protect regional prosperity. The article advocates for initiatives such as a cross-border early warning platform, which would pool meteorological data, and the adoption of common infrastructure standards. It highlights that every dollar invested in resilient infrastructure can generate significant benefits, suggesting this coordinated approach could become a global model for coastal megaregions.</p>
