          <h2>US Sunscreens May Be Less Effective Than International Alternatives</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 10:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that U.S. sunscreens may not be as effective as those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays, due to regulatory differences. The FDA's approval process for new UV-filtering ingredients is lengthy, leading to a limited range of available options compared to countries like Europe and South Korea. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives. Despite these concerns, dermatologists emphasize the importance of wearing sunscreen and recommend broad-spectrum options with an SPF of 30 or higher. </p>

The portraits feature women who have contracted FGS, highlighting their courage in speaking publicly about the disease, which often carries stigma and shame. The women wear traditional Malagasy face masks, symbolizing their beauty and normalcy, and stand against backdrops representing the contaminated waters where they were infected. The project emphasizes the need for increased awareness and access to clean water and healthcare to combat the disease. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms, ruling it unconstitutional. The court sided with civil liberties groups who argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. Louisiana's Attorney General plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the Supreme Court. Similar laws have been challenged in Arkansas and Texas, testing the boundaries of religion in government. </p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with a history of heart troubles, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant to address dangerous heart rhythms and high antibody levels. After receiving a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in 2019, Baker's condition worsened, leading to her placement on the transplant list. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic proposed a combined heart-liver transplant, which had never been done before in someone with an LVAD. Despite a challenging recovery, Baker is now doing well and hopes her case will pave the way for more patients to receive lifesaving treatment. </p>
