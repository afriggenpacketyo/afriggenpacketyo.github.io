          <h2>Japan's Inflation Rate Eases in June but Remains Above Central Bank's Target</h2>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, decreased to 3.3% in June, aligning with economists' expectations and down from a 29-month high. This marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has exceeded the Bank of Japan's 2% target, driven by persistent price pressures on non-subsidized items. While the easing was helped by the government releasing stockpiled rice, economists remain cautious due to the depreciating yen, which could increase import prices and impact consumer spending. The economic outlook is further complicated by political uncertainty from an upcoming election and potential U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has admitted that European nations were previously "free-riders" on U.S. defense spending but stated they are now committed to increasing their own contributions. In an interview, Merz emphasized that Russia poses a significant threat to European peace and that Germany is boosting its military budget accordingly. His comments came as he visited the UK to sign a historic friendship and defense treaty, aiming to create a triangular alliance with France to enhance security and economic growth. Merz also addressed trade tensions, expressing hope for a resolution to President Trump's threatened tariffs on EU exports.</p>

          <p>On the fifth anniversary of his death, civil rights icon John Lewis was honored with a "Good Trouble Lives On" day of action, featuring over 1,500 protests across all 50 states against the Trump administration. Organizers expected tens of thousands to participate in marches, rallies, and vigils demanding an end to crackdowns on civil rights, voting rights, and social programs. In Atlanta, marchers gathered at Ebenezer Baptist Church to connect Lewis's legacy of nonviolent protest with current opposition to the administration's policies. The events aimed to channel Lewis's call for "good trouble, necessary trouble" into a broad-based movement for justice and dignity.</p>

          <h2>China Debuts New Military Drone with Vertical Take-Off and Landing Capability</h2>

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone capable of taking off and landing vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, before transitioning to horizontal flight. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, was tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. This design allows for high-speed flight comparable to a fixed-wing drone while retaining the flexibility of vertical deployment, eliminating the need for a runway. The drone was developed by a state-owned subsidiary of AVIC, the same company that produces China's stealth fighters and other advanced military drones.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game provided a rare moment of bipartisanship in Washington, as female members of Congress from both parties played together on one team. Unlike the men's partisan baseball game, this event unites lawmakers against a team of female journalists, the "Bad News Babes," to raise money for a charitable cause. The game benefits the Young Survival Coalition, which supports young adults diagnosed with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the event has raised nearly $5 million and serves as a powerful symbol of unity for a greater cause.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Colchester, Essex, has fully immersed himself in the culture and style of the 1940s, a passion he developed after learning about the World Wars. The teenager, named Lincoln, dresses exclusively in clothing from the era, listens to period music, and even rides a 1939 bicycle. He works at a 1940s-themed tea room and antiques shop, where his knowledge and passion are adored by customers. Lincoln says he admires the era's elegance and sense of community, and he feels it is important to remember the sacrifices made during that time, a sentiment his supportive family shares.</p>

          <p>An ice core believed to be up to 1.5 million years old has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, where scientists will begin the process of melting it to study Earth's ancient climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the core contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that can reveal information about temperature, wind patterns, and atmospheric composition from a previously unknown period. Researchers hope the data will help them understand a mysterious shift in the planet's glacial cycles and provide insights into how Earth's climate system responds to high concentrations of greenhouse gases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting next July, shoppers using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services like Klarna and Clearpay will face tougher affordability checks under new regulations from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The rules are designed to bring the largely unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit and prevent consumers from accumulating excessive debt. This means some shoppers may be denied credit at the point of sale. The new framework will also provide users with the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and ensure clearer information on fees and cancellation rights is available.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump, 79, was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition, after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. The disclosure followed public speculation prompted by photographs showing bruising on his hand and swollen legs. A presidential physician confirmed the diagnosis, stating it is frequent in individuals over 70 and that Trump remains in "excellent health" with no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The White House press secretary attributed the hand bruising to frequent handshaking combined with his use of aspirin for cardiovascular prevention.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders over the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The lawsuit sought to have executives reimburse the company for billions of dollars in fines and legal costs, arguing they failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse and violated a 2012 FTC consent order. Details of the settlement were not immediately made public. The trial, which was expected to feature testimony from Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg, was halted on its second day following the announcement of the agreement.</p>
