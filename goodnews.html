          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project in Suffolk, aiming to boost economic growth and energy security. The Treasury claims the project will create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes, marking the biggest nuclear building program in a generation. Critics, however, condemn the investment, arguing the money could be better spent elsewhere and fearing it will increase consumer bills. The final investment decision on the funding model is expected later this summer.</p>

          <p>The Rodon Group, a Pennsylvania-based plastics injection molding company, is experiencing a surge in business due to President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. The tariffs have led to increased demand for domestically produced toys, particularly K'nex sets, as consumers seek to avoid the impact of higher import costs. The company has invested in automation to remain competitive and keep production in the United States. Despite a potential trade agreement with China, uncertainty surrounding tariffs continues to drive demand for domestic manufacturing.</p>
