          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, was released from federal custody after a judge ordered her immediate release, marking the end of a six-week ordeal that sparked outrage over President Trump‚Äôs immigration policies. Ozturk, whose student visa was canceled, was among numerous international students facing deportation as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on higher education, ostensibly to combat antisemitism. The New York Times article highlights that her supporters argue that her detention was in retaliation for an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands, violating her First Amendment rights. The judge stated that her detention could potentially chill the speech of non-citizens in the country.</p>

          <p>A 47-year-old cold case has been solved with the arrest of Willie Eugene Sims for the 1977 murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California. The New York Times article highlights that Sims was identified through a thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the crime scene, which matched his print in the FBI database after an upgrade to the search algorithm. Investigators also matched his DNA to evidence found on the victim and noted a striking similarity between his booking photo from a 1977 attempted murder case and the original sketch of the suspect. The arrest brings closure to Ralston's family after decades of uncertainty.</p>
