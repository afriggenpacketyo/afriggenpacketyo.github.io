          <p>Former MLB pitcher Steven Register, diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, received a life-saving liver transplant from Kristin Johnston, a high school classmate he hadn't seen in 20 years. Johnston volunteered after seeing Register's wife's Facebook plea for a donor and discovering they shared the same blood type. The surgery involved transplanting 70% of Johnston's liver into Register, with both livers expected to regenerate over time. The families hope their story raises awareness about living organ donation and the impact it can have on saving lives.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police officer hiring after the council reduced the number of officers to be hired in the coming fiscal year. The agreement ensures that council leadership will identify funds for an additional 240 recruits within 90 days. Restoring the police recruits will require the council to free up an additional $13.3 million for the coming year, with costs growing in subsequent years.

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock in France, the politics of remembrance has gained momentum, with politicians turning to address sins of the past. Parliamentarians have adopted three texts that reclassify historical events or offer the prospect of reparations, including posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus and recognizing returnees from Indochina. A resolution addressing a "double debt" to Haiti, dating back to 1825, was also adopted, calling for recognition, repayment, and reparations. Some experts see the willingness to take historical responsibility as a form of social maturity, while others view it as a symbolic gesture in a politically paralyzed legislature.</p>
