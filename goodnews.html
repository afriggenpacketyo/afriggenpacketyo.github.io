          <p>SpaceX has launched its 33rd commercial resupply mission, sending a Dragon capsule with 2.5 tons of supplies and scientific equipment to the International Space Station. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral early Sunday, successfully delivering its payload into orbit. In addition to crew supplies and research projects, the capsule is equipped with an add-on thruster kit designed to help maintain the station's altitude. This new capability will allow the Dragon spacecraft to assist with periodic re-boosts, a function predominantly handled by Russian spacecraft until now.</p>

          <p>Tiny homes expert Levi Kelly successfully built a 19.4-by-4-foot house in his Ohio yard for just $5,000, demonstrating the potential of minimalist living. The project, which took one month to complete, utilized an old utility trailer as its foundation and features essential amenities like a bed, kitchen with a mini-fridge, a portable toilet, and an outdoor shower, all powered by solar panels. Kelly built the home to challenge the limits of small-space design and has even stayed in it during a snowstorm to test its durability. He advises aspiring builders to prioritize their goals, whether minimalism or comfort.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $750 million, making it the 10th largest prize in the lottery's history, after no ticket matched all winning numbers in Saturday's draw. The cash value for the upcoming Monday drawing is estimated at $338.6 million. Although there was no grand prize winner, Saturday's drawing produced several million-dollar winners, with tickets in Maine, Massachusetts, and South Dakota matching the five white balls. The jackpot has been steadily climbing for 36 consecutive drawings since a winning ticket was last sold in California on May 31.</p>

          <p>Founded by Elon Musk in 2002, SpaceX has evolved from a struggling startup to a dominant force in the global space industry, now valued at around $400 billion. The company's success was significantly bolstered by crucial early contracts from NASA to resupply the International Space Station, which saved it from near bankruptcy. Today, SpaceX is indispensable for U.S. space access, responsible for launching NASA astronauts, deploying critical Starlink internet satellites, and developing the Starship rocket for future moon missions. Its low-cost model has fundamentally reshaped the entire space ecosystem, enabling broader access for companies worldwide.</p>

          <p>Although initial data for Eli Lilly's oral obesity pill, orforglipron, showed slightly less weight loss than expected, analysts believe it remains a formidable rival to Novo Nordisk's oral Wegovy. Orforglipron's key advantages are that it is a small-molecule drug, making it easier and potentially cheaper to manufacture at scale, and it does not require the dietary restrictions associated with Novo Nordisk's pill. These factors could allow Eli Lilly to achieve greater market share in the lucrative weight-loss drug space, which is eager for more convenient and accessible treatment options.</p>

          <p>A new meme, the "performative male," is gaining traction among Gen Z on TikTok and has inspired real-life contests across the country. The term describes a man who adopts an alternative, intellectual, and "soft" aesthetic—such as carrying tote bags, reading feminist literature, and listening to indie female artists—often to attract progressive women. While largely a lighthearted trend poking fun at a specific subculture, it also taps into a deeper skepticism about authenticity. The phenomenon questions whether these traits are genuine or merely a calculated performance to appear enlightened and unproblematic.</p>

          <p>A first-time Tesla owner shared an honest one-year review, noting that while his savings on gas were less than expected at $334, the real financial benefit came from reduced maintenance costs. He contrasted the $600 he spent on two new tires for the Tesla with the tens of thousands he had spent on repairs for his previous car. The owner concluded that the longer he drives the electric vehicle, the more he will save on maintenance, a sentiment echoed by other EV owners. This perspective underscores that the total cost of ownership for EVs often proves more favorable over time.</p>
