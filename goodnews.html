The coins, scattered around the shipwreck nearly 2,000 feet below the ocean's surface, feature depictions of castles, lions, and crosses, with the Latin motto "Plus Ultra" signifying the expansion of the Spanish monarchy. Colombian authorities plan to begin extractions from the ship, discovered in 2015, while protecting it from treasure hunters.
