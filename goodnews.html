          <p>Emma Raducanu delivered one of her best performances in recent memory with a commanding victory over former champion Marketa Vondrousova at Wimbledon, advancing to the third round. This confident win sets up a highly anticipated match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Despite entering her home Grand Slam with tempered expectations after a difficult season, Raducanu's form on grass and more relaxed demeanor suggest she is returning to her best, giving her a strong chance in the upcoming blockbuster clash.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the Pentagon's chief spokesperson, recent US airstrikes on three of Iran's key nuclear facilities have set back its program by an estimated one to two years. This assessment, based on intelligence collected after the strikes, suggests a more significant degradation of Iran's capabilities than was indicated in initial reports. The new evaluation supports the administration's claims of a successful operation, stating that critical components like centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site were effectively destroyed, significantly delaying Iran's path to developing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>The B-2 bomber pilots who conducted the recent airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites have been advised to maintain a low profile and conceal their identities during a planned July 4th visit to the White House. This precaution is due to security concerns that adversaries could target them using open-source information. The visit follows President Trump's public praise of the pilots as heroes, which came amid a controversy where he disputed classified intelligence assessments that initially downplayed the mission's overall success in setting back Iran's program.</p>

          <p>A US federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping proclamation that suspended the ability of migrants to seek asylum at the US-Mexico border. The judge ruled that the president overstepped his authority, stating that neither the Constitution nor existing immigration law grants him the power to bypass the legal asylum process by declaring an emergency. The ruling, which is a significant setback for the administration's immigration crackdown, has been temporarily stayed for two weeks to allow the government time to appeal the decision.</p>

These centers will be staffed by a mix of medical professionals to provide more convenient and accessible services closer to patients' homes.
