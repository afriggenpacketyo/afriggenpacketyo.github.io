          <h2>Singapore's Inflation Rate Eases to Lowest Since January 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:39:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's July inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest level since January 2021, as the city-state prepares for anticipated slower economic growth later this year. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, also dipped to 0.5%, falling below economists' projections. This moderation is primarily attributed to a decline in retail and other goods prices, alongside reduced electricity and gas inflation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore forecasts that inflation will remain "moderate" in the near term, citing global crude oil price stabilization and contained food commodity price increases. This economic shift, coupled with a "downshift" in the global trade environment, has already led the central bank to ease monetary policy twice this year to support the trade-dependent economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global labor markets are transitioning from the "Great Resignation" to a "Great Stay," characterized by fewer employees leaving jobs and a "no-hire, no-fire" freeze by employers. This significant shift, observed in both the U.S. and U.K., is driven by prevailing economic insecurity and uncertainty, prompting workers to remain in their current positions. Concurrently, firms are delaying hiring decisions, not necessarily to reduce staff, but due to an unclear economic outlook. While U.S. jobless claims remain near historical lows, nonfarm payroll growth has slowed, and U.K. job vacancies have fallen significantly across most sectors. This trend underscores businesses' reluctance to embark on new hiring until greater confidence in the economic trajectory is established.</p>

          <p>Football legend Wayne Rooney has offered crucial advice to Arsenal's Max Dowman, who made his Premier League debut at just 15 years and 234 days old, becoming the club's second-youngest player. Drawing on his own experience of debuting young, Rooney emphasized the importance of remaining grounded and listening to the counsel of family and close friends amidst growing fame. He lauded Dowman's impressive debut, which saw him win a penalty, and highlighted the necessity for the young talent to quickly adapt to the surreal environment of a first-team dressing room. Rooney's heartfelt message encouraged Dowman to fully enjoy his burgeoning career, which he believes holds immense potential.</p>

          <p>Shares of China's Dongfeng Motor Group surged nearly 70% to an eight-year high as trading resumed, following its parent company's announcement of plans to take the automaker private in a deal reportedly valued at about $7 billion. Concurrently, the Wuhan-based firm is preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. This strategic move aligns with China's broader efforts to consolidate its state-owned carmakers and enhance sector competitiveness. Despite reporting a nearly 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries for the first half of 2025, the company saw a significant 33% increase in sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models, with the VOYAH series experiencing an 84.8% surge.

          <p>China's spy chief, Chen Yixin, pledged increased intelligence and security cooperation with Cuba, marking 65 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations. During a meeting with Cuba’s Interior Minister Lazaro Alberto Alvarez Casas, Chen emphasized strengthening collaboration to safeguard national security and social stability in both countries. Alvarez praised China's remarkable achievements, calling it a role model for socialist nations. This commitment, following recent U.S. jitters over China's intelligence presence in Cuba, aims to advance the construction of a "China-Cuba community with a shared future" and includes increasing personnel exchanges and law enforcement capacity building.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged over 2%, nearing a four-year high, leading a broader rally across Asia markets following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish signals. His remarks at Jackson Hole hinted at potential monetary policy easing next month, boosting investor confidence. The tech sector was a primary contributor to the Hang Seng's gains, with companies like Nio experiencing significant increases, alongside strong performances from Chinese property developers. Analysts suggest that maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining market momentum, and that Fed rate cuts might trigger capital rotation from the U.S. to China. Other Asian markets, including Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Australia, also recorded notable advances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's central bank set the yuan's daily reference rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, a direct consequence of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks. Powell's comments at the Jackson Hole conference opened the door to a potential September interest rate cut by the Fed, which immediately led to a decline in the US dollar index. Consequently, the offshore yuan climbed to its strongest level since late July, reflecting robust market anticipation of significant easing from the Federal Reserve. Economists now widely believe a September rate cut by the Fed is almost certain, shifting market focus to the scale and pace of future easing measures throughout the year and across the cycle.

The National Hurricane Center anticipates it will remain well east and northeast of Bermuda. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had previously forecast an above-normal hurricane season, predicting 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine expected to reach hurricane strength.</p>

An earlier, smaller iteration, a 30-meter-long white airship, successfully ascended to an altitude of 1,000 meters and transmitted electricity to the ground in a January test. This advancement demonstrates a promising new approach to renewable energy, capable of providing power where conventional supplies are inadequate.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer outlines his Monday market playbook, noting a powerful rally driven by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish signals at Jackson Hole, which hinted at upcoming interest rate cuts. Powell's shift was primarily influenced by a dramatic deceleration in hiring, which outweighed his concerns about tariffs. Cramer argues that tariffs' inflationary impact has been muted, absorbed by manufacturers and retailers rather than fully passed to consumers. He identifies housing, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and initial public offerings (IPOs) as bullish undercurrents responding strongly to the "don't fight the Fed" analysis. Cramer also provides specific stock recommendations across various sectors, while cautioning against enterprise software and autos. (not investment advice)</p>
