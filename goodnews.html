        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stocks of major U.S. steel companies experienced a significant jump after President Trump announced the doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum, increasing them from 25% to 50%. This move, enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, aims to address what the administration deems a national security threat. However, the spike in U.S. steel tariffs is sparking concern that consumers could face price hikes on big-ticket products and even groceries. The European Union has announced it is preparing countermeasures against the United States in response to the higher tariffs, signaling potential trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway have surged by 213% in May compared to the previous year, contrasting with a downward trend observed across Europe. The increase is mainly attributed to the sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV. Despite this surge, Tesla's European sales have recently suffered a decline due to reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and political activities. However, Norway's EV incentives, including VAT exemption and discounts on road taxes, contribute to the popularity of EVs in the country.</p>

The plan also entails the removal of deferment and forbearance options, limiting borrowers' ability to pause payments during economic hardship. Finally, the proposal aims to limit future changes to repayment, providing more stability to the system. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts predict further increases, with some forecasting $40 per ounce by year-end, but note that the $35 mark has historically been a key resistance level. The economy's performance and the Federal Reserve's actions will play significant roles in silver's future price movements. While silver can be a hedge against market volatility, its suitability as an investment depends on individual goals, with experts recommending it comprise between 5% and 10% of a portfolio.
