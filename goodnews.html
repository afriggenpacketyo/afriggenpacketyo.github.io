          <h2>California Startup Develops Electric Add-On to Hybridize Diesel Trucks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 13:00:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California-based startup Revoy has created an innovative solution to reduce emissions from long-haul diesel trucks without requiring a full vehicle replacement. The company developed an electric dolly, a self-powered axle with a large battery pack, that fits between the truck and its trailer. This device pushes the rig, reducing the diesel engine's workload and cutting fuel costs by up to five times. Instead of lengthy recharging, drivers can swap the dolly for a fresh one in about five minutes at designated stations. The system is leased on a per-mile basis, eliminating upfront capital costs for trucking companies.</p>

          <p>The recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" restores three key tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, set to provide a significant cash flow boost to large corporations, especially in the tech sector. The law brings back immediate expensing for domestic R&D, 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures, and a more flexible interest deductibility limit. Analysts predict this will unlock billions in free cash flow for companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, which are heavily investing in AI infrastructure. This increased liquidity is expected to enhance their competitive advantage in AI and support large-scale stock buyback programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old Texas man has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to stalking and harassing Indiana Fever player Caitlin Clark. The man, Michael Lewis, admitted to sending hundreds of threatening and sexually explicit messages to Clark over social media and was found by police to be in an "imaginary relationship" with her. As part of his sentence, he is barred from having any contact with Clark, must stay away from associated venues, and cannot have internet access while incarcerated. The judge also recommended mental health treatment for Lewis, whose behavior was erratic during court proceedings.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched a new "study mode" feature within ChatGPT designed to help students learn by guiding them through problems rather than providing direct answers. This initiative addresses educators' concerns that AI chatbots can be used for cheating and hinder critical thinking. When activated, study mode prompts students with guiding questions and asks them to summarize answers in their own words. The feature, developed in collaboration with educators and students, will be available on both free and paid versions of ChatGPT, aiming to improve academic performance by fostering a tutoring-style interaction instead of acting as a simple answer machine.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs, a move that would solidify its position as the top U.S. credit card issuer. For Goldman Sachs, exiting the partnership would mark the end of a challenging venture into consumer finance that was marked by high growth but also significant losses and regulatory scrutiny. The deal would provide Apple with a more stable and experienced partner in JPMorgan, which is known for its disciplined approach to consumer credit. Earlier contenders for the high-profile card, including American Express and Barclays, are no longer in the running.</p>

The cubs were born six weeks ago to their mother, Terima, as part of a European-wide breeding program designed to maintain genetic diversity. Once mature, these cubs will be relocated to other zoos around the world to continue the vital conservation effort for their species.</p>

          <p>Real estate developers are finding that affordable housing projects could become more profitable, thanks to an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) in a recent federal bill. The legislation permanently increases the tax credits available to states and lowers financing requirements, which is expected to help produce over a million new affordable rental units by 2035. Despite challenges like high interest rates and construction costs, developers see a growing opportunity for investors in the sector. However, the Trump administration's proposed cuts to federal rental assistance programs could pose a new obstacle for financing these projects. (not investment advice)</p>

This article suggests that Turnberry could soon host the Scottish Open, a major event on the tour.

The podcast, launched in 2009, became a cultural touchstone for its long-form, deeply personal interviews with celebrities, musicians, and even a sitting president. Maron, who explores his own anxiety in his new HBO special "Panicked," acknowledges that ending the show will be difficult, as the conversations have been a nourishing part of his life.</p>

          <p>A German court has convicted three men for the 2022 theft of 483 ancient Celtic gold coins from a museum in Manching, Bavaria. The defendants received prison sentences of up to 11 years for the meticulously planned heist, which took only nine minutes and involved cutting local communication cables to disable alarms. The stolen treasure, considered the largest find of Celtic gold in the 20th century, is still mostly missing. Investigators believe part of the collection was melted down, as lumps of gold were found on one of the suspects upon his arrest, confirming archaeologists' worst fears.</p>

This article notes that the visit allowed Trump to blend his commercial interests with foreign policy, using his golf resorts as a backdrop for high-stakes discussions with European leaders.</p>
