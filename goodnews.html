        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and France have agreed to a new pilot scheme to manage illegal migration, which will involve returning some migrants who cross the English Channel in small boats. Under the "one in, one out" deal, the UK would send a number of arrivals back to France in exchange for accepting an equivalent number of vetted asylum seekers. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, announced the plan as a way to break the business model of people smugglers. While critics question its scale and effectiveness, the move marks a new cooperative strategy to address record-level crossings. </p>

          <p>Varda, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit, has successfully raised $187 million in a Series C funding round. The company's mission is to leverage the microgravity environment of space, which allows for different crystallization of medicines that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital will enable Varda to increase its flight frequency and expand its biologics lab to identify more drug molecules suitable for space-based manufacturing. The company recently achieved a milestone by receiving FAA approval for the return of its first capsule, which successfully created a drug in space.</p>

          <p>Denim maker Levi Strauss has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance after reporting strong second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company now anticipates revenue growth of 1% to 2%, a significant improvement from its previous forecast, driven by strong consumer demand and growth in direct-to-consumer sales. Despite the positive outlook, Levi's faces uncertainty from potential tariff increases on goods from Southeast Asia, a key manufacturing region. For now, the company plans to absorb the initial tariff costs, which it estimates will have a minimal impact on its earnings per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced the end of the requirement for air travelers to remove their shoes during security screening, concluding a policy that has been in place for over two decades. The mandate was originally implemented after the 2001 shoe-bomb attempt by Richard Reid. The article frames the policy as "security theater" and its removal as "populism theater," a move that grants a convenience previously reserved for premium travelers to the general public. The change is not attributed to any new technology or intelligence but rather to a shift in policy approach after years of inconvenience.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, a meeting that coincides with his company becoming the first to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. The context for the meeting likely involves the administration's national security-related export controls on advanced AI chips, which have effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to the lucrative Chinese market. President Trump praised the company's stock performance in a social media post, attributing its rise to his tariff policies. The discussion will likely address the future of U.S. restrictions on AI technology exports. (not investment advice)</p>
