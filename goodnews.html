          <p>A four-minute audio clip from President Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has been released, revealing Biden struggling to recall key dates, according to a New York Times article. The audio, published by Axios, highlights moments where Biden stumbled over dates related to his son's death and Trump's election. Republicans plan to release the full interview recording, arguing it provides evidence of Biden's cognitive decline. The emergence of the recording coincides with renewed scrutiny of Biden's health and past efforts to suppress concerns about his fitness for re-election.</p>
