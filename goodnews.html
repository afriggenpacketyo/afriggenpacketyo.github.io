          <p>Canada has pledged to meet NATO's 2% defense spending target within a year, significantly boosting its military investment. Prime Minister Mark Carney said the action was required to ward off threats from hostile governments, terrorist entities and cyber criminals. He conceded his country was "too reliant" on the United States for defense, adding that Washington was "reducing its relative contribution to our collective security". Canada will significantly boost its defense spending to hit a Nato target of 2% of GDP years earlier than planned.</p>

The approval gives doctors a new option for tackling the virus, which causes thousands of deaths among older Americans and hundreds of deaths among infants each year.</p>
