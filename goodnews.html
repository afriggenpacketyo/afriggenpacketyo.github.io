        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, illuminates the little-known story of how surfing was first introduced to the U.S. mainland. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes, studying at a nearby military school, fashioned surfboards from local redwood trees and demonstrated the royal sport to amazed locals. This act of "surf diplomacy" planted the seed for the sport's popularity in America, which would later be globally popularized by Duke Kahanamoku, highlighting a significant moment of cultural exchange.</p>

          <p>The Australian state of South Australia is set to ban the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers as part of a broader initiative against single-use plastics. The policy, effective September 1, targets the small containers which, despite being made of recyclable plastic, are often too small to be processed by recycling machinery. This move builds on previous legislation banning items like plastic straws and bags, aiming to curb pollution and protect marine life, as the containers are used for seconds but can persist in the environment for centuries.</p>

          <p>The price of the U.S. Open's signature Honey Deuce cocktail, now $23, has increased at a rate faster than general inflation since 2015. While the price is unchanged from last year, it has risen by 53% over the last decade, compared to a 36% increase in the consumer price index over the same period. Despite the high cost, the popular vodka-based drink remains a massive revenue generator for the tennis tournament, with over 550,000 sold last year alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum showcases 40 portraits of Ada Katz, the wife and muse of acclaimed painter Alex Katz, spanning their 50-year marriage. Katz, who came of age during the abstract expressionism movement but stayed true to his own form of realism, has painted his wife over 300 times. Curators note that his interest is often more in style and the play of light than in deep emotional portrayal, creating a detached quality that allows viewers to see themselves in the work, highlighting the enduring artistic partnership.</p>

The selection delves into the author's complex and tumultuous relationship with her mother, reflecting on her mother's recent death and the profound impact she had on Roy's life and perception of her native Kerala. Roy describes her mother as a formidable, unpredictable force, woven into the very landscape of her home, and grapples with the intense grief of losing a figure who had been a central topic of discussion for sixty years.</p>

          <h2>Is It Morally Acceptable to Be Happy in a World Full of Suffering?</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the ethical dilemma of experiencing personal happiness while being aware of widespread global suffering. The author draws on philosophical traditions that view humanity as interconnected, suggesting that feeling others' pain is a moral response. However, the piece argues this empathy should extend to sharing in others' joys as well, a concept known as "sympathetic joy." To avoid both cynicism and saccharine positivity, one must embrace the full spectrum of human experience, acknowledging that feeling good can be an act of resistance.</p>

          <p>The IRS has provided clarification on how consumers can still qualify for the federal electric vehicle tax credit of up to $7,500, even if they take possession of the car after the September 30 deadline. According to new guidance, a taxpayer who enters into a "written binding contract" and makes a payment for an EV on or before the deadline is eligible for the credit. This allows buyers to order a vehicle and put down a deposit before the cutoff date and still claim the credit when the car is delivered later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's high-profile crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., is facing significant setbacks in the federal court system. In several instances, grand juries have refused to indict individuals arrested during the federal law enforcement surge, a rare occurrence that suggests skepticism toward the cases being brought. Judges have also expressed frustration with prosecutorial missteps and delays, criticizing the government for filing weak or sloppy cases. This judicial resistance challenges the narrative of the crackdown's success, even as arrests continue at a high rate.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly contemplating a last-minute move for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez before the transfer window closes. The club has been seeking to resolve its goalkeeping situation and has also been in talks for Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens. However, Martinez, a World Cup winner with Argentina and a two-time FIFA Goalkeeper of the Year, would bring a wealth of high-level Premier League experience that the younger Lammens lacks, as United's coach acknowledged the difficulty of the position at the club.</p>

          <p>A worldwide boom in the popularity of matcha has caused its price to skyrocket and created supply shortages, even in its home country of Japan. Driven by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism surge, demand for the powdered green tea has strained Japan's aging farming communities. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, has jumped dramatically, forcing retailers to ration supplies as major companies create dedicated divisions to manage the intense competition for the product.

          <p>This opinion piece revisits Toni Morrison's 1995 analysis of fascism, arguing its relevance to the current political climate in the United States. Morrison described fascism not as a sudden event but as a series of steps, with American racism as its "succubus twin." The author contends that this historical genealogy is crucial for understanding today's challenges. The article calls for learning from the long history of Black resistance, which has fought racial fascism through belief, diverse forms of protest, and faith, offering a model for defending democracy.</p>

          <p>While the Democratic Party's public approval ratings have hit a 30-year low, some strategists see reasons for optimism. The concept of "negative partisanship," where voters are more motivated by dislike of the opposing party, could work in their favor as President Trump's own popularity wanes. Potential presidential candidates are actively competing to be the strongest voice against the administration, and polling for the 2026 congressional elections shows a slight Democratic advantage. The party's recovery plan involves rallying public opposition and focusing on economic issues.</p>
