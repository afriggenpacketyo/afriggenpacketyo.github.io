          <p>Newly discovered handwritten notes reveal Winston Churchill's frustration over the slow progress in securing penicillin supplies before D-Day. Despite penicillin being a British discovery, the UK lagged behind the US in production.

While sufficient supplies were obtained, primarily from the US, they were initially reserved for military use.
