          <p>BP has reported second-quarter profits of $2.35 billion, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. The energy major's CEO, Murray Auchincloss, highlighted strong performance and a major new oil and gas discovery in Brazil's Santos Basin, the company's largest in 25 years. This comes as BP shifts its strategy to prioritize fossil fuels over renewable energy investments, a move intended to boost its underperforming share price. The company also announced an increased dividend and a continued share buyback program, signaling confidence amid ongoing takeover speculation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Alan Tudyk, known for his roles in "Resident Alien" and numerous Disney films, described his perfect Sunday in Los Angeles, which revolves around coffee, his dogs, and gluten-free food. His ideal day begins with a morning run in the Hollywood Hills, followed by a large breakfast at Honey Hi in Echo Park. The schedule also includes visiting the Wacko novelty store and La Luz de Jesus Gallery, enjoying a vegan burger at Crossroads, and shopping at Dover Street Market. Tudyk emphasizes that the day is incomplete without multiple coffee stops and concludes with a traditional listening session with his wife to choose their official "song of the summer."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Theme parks are increasingly investing in permanent, year-round horror experiences, moving beyond the traditional Halloween season. Universal's new Horror Unleashed attraction in Las Vegas, opening August 14, exemplifies this trend with four elaborate haunted houses, themed bars, and interactive characters. This development reflects a broader cultural shift where horror is a year-round genre, fueled by the success of shows like "The Last of Us" and "American Horror Story." Industry experts note that Halloween has become a lifestyle for many, and theme parks are capitalizing on this demand for darker, more immersive entertainment that can be enjoyed any time of the year.</p>

          <p>In a move aimed at easing tensions, South Korea has started to dismantle the loudspeakers used to broadcast anti-Pyongyang propaganda across the border into North Korea. The decision follows an order from President Lee Jae Myung's administration, which is pursuing reconciliation and views warmer relations as an economic benefit. These broadcasts, a feature of inter-Korean relations since the 1960s, have included K-pop music and accurate weather reports, which some defectors have cited as a factor in their decision to flee. North Korea views the broadcasts as a major provocation, and their removal is a significant, though largely symbolic, gesture of goodwill.</p>

          <p>Actor Bella Ramsey reflects on the challenges and growth experienced while filming the second season of HBO's "The Last of Us." Ramsey, who is Emmy-nominated for their role as Ellie, discusses the difficulty of carrying the show after co-star Pedro Pascal's character was killed off early in the season. The role required intense physical stunt work and new emotional depths, particularly in portraying Ellie's relationship with Dina and her quest for vengeance. As the first out nonbinary actor to receive multiple Emmy nominations, Ramsey expresses gratitude for the recognition, hoping it helps other gender-nonconforming people feel seen while emphasizing they are simply existing and being true to themself.</p>

          <p>Gary Oldman, recently knighted, expresses his delight with the success of his Apple TV+ spy series, "Slow Horses," for which he received his second consecutive Emmy nomination.

          <p>The premiere episode of the new medical drama "The Pitt" establishes its core cast of characters through the hectic environment of a Pittsburgh emergency room. Executive producers John Wells and R. Scott Gemmill, along with star Noah Wyle, explain how the pilot uses subtle cues and interactions to hint at deeper storylines. Wyle's character, Dr. Robby Robinavitch, serves as the central figure through whom the audience meets the other staff, from the competent charge nurse to the cocky senior resident with a secret. The creators note that the episode is filled with small details, or "Easter eggs," that set up character arcs that will unfold throughout the first season.</p>

          <p>The Netherlands has announced it will purchase €500 million worth of U.S. arms for Ukraine, becoming the first country to contribute to a new NATO support mechanism. The scheme, called the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), was established to allow NATO allies to fund the acquisition of American defense systems and munitions for Ukraine. This initiative was developed after President Trump agreed to continue arming Ukraine on the condition that allies bear the costs. The Dutch package includes parts for Patriot missile systems and other crucial frontline equipment, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressing his gratitude for the contribution.</p>

          <p>In a personal experiment, a journalist and her boyfriend used ChatGPT as a mediator to navigate a relationship disagreement, reflecting a growing trend among Gen Z to use AI for dating advice. Initially, the chatbot's feedback seemed to confirm biases, suggesting the journalist was shouldering more emotional labor. However, after refining the prompts to demand neutrality and accountability, the AI provided a simple but revelatory insight that helped achieve a breakthrough. The author concluded that while AI can offer a quick, synthesized perspective, it cannot replace the nuanced, empathetic work required for human relationships and can risk oversimplifying complex dynamics without proper guidance and self-awareness.</p>

          <h2>Retrospective: How Hurricane Katrina Transformed New Orleans' Public Defender System</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the storm is remembered as a catalyst that exposed and ultimately transformed the city's deeply flawed public defender system. Before the storm, the office was underfunded, and thousands of inmates were lost in the system after the evacuation. In the aftermath, a group of dedicated lawyers, including current Chief Public Defender Danny Engelberg, rebuilt the office from the ground up. They successfully fought for full-time staff, proper resources, and eventually funding parity with the district attorney's office, fundamentally changing how legal defense for the indigent is provided in New Orleans and significantly reducing the city's incarceration rate.</p>

          <h2>Private Investment Poised to Reshape 'The Hundred' Cricket Competition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 04:21:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hundred, England's 100-ball cricket competition, is set for a major transformation as private investment is introduced, with changes expected to take effect by the 2026 season. Stakes in six of the eight teams have been sold to private investors, including several owners of Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises. This influx of capital is expected to lead to higher player salaries, potential team rebrandings, and possible changes to the tournament's format and structure. While the competition will proceed as normal for its fifth year, this marks a pivotal moment for the future of English cricket, aligning it more closely with global franchise league models.</p>
