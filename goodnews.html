          <p>Conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki has reportedly won the Polish presidential election, according to Polish media outlets, securing 50.89% of the vote against Trzaskowski's 49.11%. The Polish National Electoral Commission is expected to officially announce the results later today. While the president's role is mainly ceremonial, they command the armed forces, can veto government bills, influence foreign policy, and propose legislation. The new president will likely face challenges from Donald Tusk's pro-EU coalition government, which has been blocked by the current conservative president, Andrzej Duda.</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks have significantly increased after announcing a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The merger will create a new company listed in Sydney, acquiring all outstanding shares of both entities with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The deal aims to simplify the structure, add scale, and create a more investable company by unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers. The merger is expected to provide Brickworks shareholders with an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday.

The players are demanding a fair share of the FIFA Club World Cup prize money, as FIFA will pay MLS teams large amounts (about $9.5m) to participate in the tournament. However, the current collective bargaining agreement stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1m for the entire team. The MLSPA stated that the players have sought to meet with MLS to make changes, but the league has failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal.</p>

          <p>A report warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as some institutions are already cutting courses due to financial strain. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is reviewing how higher education will be funded in the long term and wants to support collaboration where possible. The Universities UK report suggests greater collaboration could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient. Some universities are already delivering courses collaboratively to benefit students, but more clarity is needed to prevent isolated decisions about course closures or mergers.</p>
