          <p>Samaritan's Purse, led by Rev. Franklin Graham, dedicated two new mobile homes to families in western North Carolina who lost their homes to Hurricane Helene. The ministry is building dozens of new, reinforced homes in the region, providing not just shelter but also a sense of hope and God's love to the affected families. Graham emphasized that these homes, built by volunteers, are a testament to God's unwavering support for those who have suffered loss. The families, who had been living in cramped conditions since the hurricane, expressed gratitude for the unexpected gift of fully furnished homes.</p>

          <p>A strike by New Jersey Transit train drivers has entered its second day, disrupting commutes for thousands and prompting resumed negotiations between the transit agency and the union. The New York Times article reports that the two sides, led by NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri, are meeting to address the pay dispute that triggered the strike. While Kolluri expressed hope for a swift resolution, he cautioned that the agency would not "break the bank" to reach a deal. The strike has forced commuters to seek alternative transportation, and officials are urging residents to work from home if possible.</p>

          <p>The Baltimore Orioles have fired manager Brandon Hyde following a disappointing start to the season, despite his previous success in guiding the team through a rebuild and winning Manager of the Year in 2023. The Guardian reports that the Orioles are currently in last place in the AL East with a 15-28 record. Third base coach Tony Mansolino will serve as interim manager. The decision reflects the organization's desire to change course after a slide in performance during the second half of last year, and an offseason that saw ace Corbin Burnes leave via free agency.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are increasingly resisting the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the fundamental principle of due process. The New York Times article highlights several cases where courts have intervened to ensure immigrants have the opportunity to challenge their deportations. The Supreme Court recently chided the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. Despite Trump's open disregard for due process, the courts are upholding the Constitution's protections for immigrants facing removal.</p>

          <p>Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin says that the upgrade on his car is 'lifting pressure' after qualifying fifth for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, which is the team's best of what has so far been a difficult year. BBC Sport reports that the upgrade has been partly influenced by their new managing technical partner, Adrian Newey. Alonso emphasized that while he was "happy to be fifth", it was not close to his or the team's ambitions. He wants to be in Australia (at the start of the season) next year and win the race."</p>
