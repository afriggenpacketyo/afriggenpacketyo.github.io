          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team has secured a spot in the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2002 after defeating Fiji in a hard-fought match. Francesca McGhie and Rhona Lloyd established an early lead with key tries, holding off a determined Fijian side that managed to score twice. A standout individual try from Emma Orr ultimately sealed the victory for Scotland, despite a late consolation score from Fiji. The Scottish team will now face Canada in a crucial Pool B decider as they continue their historic tournament run.</p>

          <p>A baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco, who was initially suspended for a celebratory bat flip after a home run, has been sold at auction for $9,882. The incident gained national attention, leading to a successful legal challenge by his father that overturned the suspension, allowing him to play in the state tournament. All proceeds from the auction, which drew 68 bids, will be donated back to Haddonfield Little League, the program Marco plays for. The bat flip also garnered support from Major League Baseball players and was commemorated with a special pin at the Little League World Series.</p>

          <p>Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo collaborated in a performance titled "Sarabande Africaine" at the Hollywood Bowl, exploring the African roots of the classical sarabande dance form. The concert featured a unique fusion of Baroque pieces by Bach and Handel with African drumming, Caribbean percussion, and modern instruments. The artists reimagined classics like Gershwin's "Summertime" and Ravel's "Bolero" with African influences, highlighting a shared musical heritage. A particularly poignant moment was their performance of Philip Glass's "Move On," a piece the composer wrote for both artists separately, creating a powerful sense of shared artistic ground.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to $1 billion for the first time in over a year, following 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. This ranks as the sixth-largest jackpot in the game's history, with players facing odds of 1 in 292.2 million to match all six numbers. Winners must choose between a 30-year annuity or a lump-sum cash option of nearly half the advertised amount. All winnings are subject to a 24% federal tax withholding, with the total federal tax rate likely reaching 37%, in addition to varying state income taxes.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, due to receding water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe drought, which has plagued the country for five consecutive years, has lowered the reservoir to its lowest point, enabling excavation of the Hellenistic-era tombs. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has inadvertently created opportunities for archaeological work in areas that are typically submerged. The discovered tombs are being carefully excavated and moved to a museum for preservation before water levels rise again.</p>

          <p>Anthony D. Fredericks, a 78-year-old retired education professor, attributes his "razor sharp" memory to five intentional daily practices. He emphasizes the importance of regular social interaction to combat stress, and continuous learning by reading on unfamiliar subjects to stay curious. Fredericks also uses a color-coded sticky note system for organization, engages in daily physical activity like swimming or walking to increase blood flow to the brain, and maintains a healthy diet with proper hydration and at least seven hours of sleep. He advocates for approaching memory maintenance as a proactive, full-time commitment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review identifies the private U.S. colleges that offer the best return on investment (ROI), with Princeton University topping the list. The analysis considers financial aid, academic rigor, and post-graduation earnings, revealing that many elite private institutions provide substantial value despite high sticker prices. For example, Princeton students on financial aid pay an average of just $10,555 annually and earn a median income over $110,000 a decade later. This is attributed to generous financial aid policies, such as Princeton's "no-loan" program, which are funded by large endowments.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist hedge fund, has announced a significant new position in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT specializing in Southern California industrial properties. Rexford's stock has underperformed, trading at a discount despite its valuable portfolio, due to concerns over poor corporate governance, high executive compensation, and a growth strategy that has diluted shareholder value. Elliott is expected to push for changes to improve governance and capital allocation, potentially including a strategic review that could lead to a sale of the company. (not investment advice)</p>
