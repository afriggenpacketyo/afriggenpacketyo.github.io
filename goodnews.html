          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 17:23:14 EDT</div>

          <p>Tesla has formally applied to operate its autonomous Robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to compete directly with Waymo, which has been active in the area since 2020. The move follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, that has faced some operational challenges and regulatory scrutiny, including minor accidents captured on video. This expansion represents a key step in Tesla's effort to catch up in the autonomous vehicle market, relying on its camera-based system which it claims is more economically viable than competitors' sensor-heavy approaches. The company is expected to provide further updates during its upcoming earnings call.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and France have established a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme to address illegal migration across the English Channel. Under the agreement, the UK will be able to return some migrants who arrive in small boats to France. In exchange, the UK will accept an equivalent number of vetted asylum seekers from France, with priority given to those from countries prone to people smuggling. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the plan aims to break the business model of smuggling gangs, while critics argue it will not be a sufficient deterrent.</p>

          <p>Denim maker Levi Strauss has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand despite potential headwinds from U.S. trade policy. The company's second-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by 11% growth in direct-to-consumer sales and strong performance in its women's apparel category. While the Trump administration's tariffs pose a risk, Levi's finance chief stated the company is currently absorbing the costs and the impact is manageable. CEO Michelle Gass's strategy of focusing on direct sales, reducing promotions, and product innovation is credited with bolstering the company's financial outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has ended the two-decade-long requirement for air travelers to remove their shoes during security screening. An analysis in The Atlantic frames this policy change not as a result of new technology, but as a form of "populism theater." The article traces the rule's origin to the 2001 Richard Reid shoe-bomber attempt and its evolution into what many considered security theater. For years, bypassing this inconvenience was a paid perk for services like TSA PreCheck, creating a visible class divide in security lines, which this universal change now eliminates.</p>
