          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to weaken. With rates currently at 4.25%, Bailey stated his belief that the path for rates is downward, citing signs that the economy is growing below its potential and creating "slack." This potential monetary easing comes as the UK economy contracted in May, job vacancies have fallen to their lowest level since 2021, and businesses express concern about a potential recession.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy successfully averted a technical recession by posting 1.4% growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a contraction from the previous quarter. The expansion was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors, with year-over-year GDP growth accelerating to 4.3%. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry issued a warning about significant uncertainty and downside risks for the second half of the year, citing a lack of clarity over U.S. tariff policies and ongoing global trade volatility.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing analyst expectations and bolstered by a temporary tariff truce with the United States that slowed the decline in shipments to America. The growth was also driven by strong demand from Southeast Asian and European markets, while imports saw their first increase of the year. Notably, exports of rare earths surged by 60% to a record high, and steel exports also jumped, despite widespread trade protections, helping to offset weaker domestic demand and support China's overall economic performance.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged past $120,000 to a new record high, fueled by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and growing investor confidence. The rally is also attributed to positive sentiment surrounding upcoming U.S. crypto legislation, dubbed 'Crypto Week,' which aims to establish a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets with support from the pro-crypto Trump administration. Analysts suggest this momentum is driven by long-term institutional buyers, with some setting year-end targets as high as $160,000, though risks from potential U.S. tariff policies remain.

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that U.S. President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17-19. He and First Lady Melania Trump will be hosted by King Charles II at Windsor Castle, an honor no previous U.S. president has received twice. The visit is viewed as a strategic effort by the UK's Labour government to maintain a close relationship with the Trump administration amid global trade tensions. However, the visit is expected to draw protests, similar to his 2019 trip.</p>

          <p>Restoration workers at the 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary are in a race against time to save about 100,000 historic books from a severe beetle infestation. The tiny drugstore beetles, attracted to the starch-based adhesives in the handbound volumes, have burrowed into a quarter of the library's collection. To eradicate the pests, the books are being carefully placed in oxygen-free environments for six weeks, a massive undertaking to preserve centuries of cultural and religious heritage. Experts believe climate change may have contributed to the infestation by allowing the beetles more development cycles.</p>
