          <p>Emma Raducanu was eliminated from the Washington Open after being defeated by Anna Kalinskaya in the semi-final with a score of 6-4, 6-3. Kalinskaya broke Raducanu's serve at a crucial moment to win the first set and maintained her momentum to secure the victory. This loss prevented a highly anticipated finals rematch between Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez, who had faced each other in the 2021 US Open final. Kalinskaya will now advance to face Fernandez in the final, aiming for her first WTA 500 title, after Fernandez won her own marathon semi-final match against Elena Rybakina.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight at Denver International Airport was evacuated on the runway Saturday due to a landing gear incident during takeoff. The Boeing 737 MAX 8, bound for Miami, experienced a maintenance issue with a tire that resulted in a fire, which was subsequently extinguished by the fire department. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely evacuated, some using emergency slides, with one person transported for a minor injury. The incident caused a temporary ground stop and dozens of flight delays, but airport operations have since returned to normal as the FAA investigates.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Attempt to Reconstruct Ancient Earthquake-Detecting Seismoscope</h2>

          <p>Scientists in China are working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as an urn-like instrument with eight dragons, each holding a bronze ball, that could reportedly detect distant earthquakes and indicate their direction. Despite its historical significance, the device's existence has been debated by some scholars, and it was even removed from Chinese school curriculums in 2017. The new research effort, supported by modern science, aims to restore the ancient invention's reputation and understand its sophisticated mechanics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary with an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded in 1775 with Benjamin Franklin as its first postmaster general, the agency's long history is being honored while its future remains a topic of political discussion. The celebration comes months after reports that the Trump administration was considering folding the USPS into the Commerce Department or pursuing privatization.

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, avoiding fears of a long-term injury. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for ten days to two weeks. He first felt pain during a game against Toronto after making a strong throw from the outfield. While the injury is a setback for the team, both Judge and manager Aaron Boone expressed relief that the diagnosis was not more severe.</p>

          <p>A recent article analyzes the cultural impact of "The Osbournes," the early 2000s MTV reality show that repositioned Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne from a heavy metal "Prince of Darkness" to a beloved, albeit eccentric, television father. The show pioneered the "reality sitcom" format by focusing on the mundane and chaotic domestic life of Ozzy, his wife Sharon, and their children, predating shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." Producers noted the show's appeal came from the contrast between the family's rock-star lifestyle and their relatable, everyday struggles. The series became a massive success, influencing a generation of celebrity-focused reality television.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official from the Democratic Republic of Congo, is on a fast track to Catholic sainthood after being murdered in 2007 for refusing to accept bribes. As a devout Catholic, Kositi prevented the smuggling of spoiled rice that could have poisoned the public, turning down increasingly large sums of money from smugglers. His body was found dumped outside a university, and his killing is seen by the Church as a martyrdom for his faith and commitment to justice. Last year, the Catholic Church declared him a martyr, a key step toward canonization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the physiological reasons behind the intense emotions experienced during high-stakes football matches. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, causes physical reactions like a racing heart and jitteriness, which is a normal sign of deep emotional investment. Experts advise fans to manage these feelings by getting adequate rest, having a clear match-day plan, and engaging in physical movement to release adrenaline. They also suggest reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, collective experience that allows for a rare, open expression of emotion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average temperatures in July running below normal and daytime highs struggling to surpass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west than usual, allowing a low-pressure system to keep the region cool and cloudy. This has also increased coastal upwelling, where strong winds bring colder ocean water to the surface, further lowering land temperatures. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, experts caution that the Bay Area's hottest months, September and October, are still to come.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened the existence of several establishments. Under the proposed changes, developers building new properties near existing venues would be required to soundproof the new buildings. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new bars in disused shops and promote outdoor dining and live performances to revitalize struggling town centers. While the government hopes to boost the hospitality industry, critics argue that other tax policies have been the primary cause of its struggles.</p>
