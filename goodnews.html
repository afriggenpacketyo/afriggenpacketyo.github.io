          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, secured a decisive reelection victory, four years after white officials allegedly locked him out of the town hall following his initial unopposed win in 2020. This week's election, the town's first since the 1960s, was held under a federal settlement after Braxton and other Black residents sued over the town's history of 'hand-me-down governance' in a majority-Black community. Braxton's victory is seen as a significant step toward restoring democratic processes and fair representation in the small town, which had previously seen leadership positions passed down without elections for decades.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for stable and amicable relations between India and China, stating that collaboration between the two Asian powers is crucial for a 'multipolar Asia and world.' Speaking during a visit to Japan, Modi highlighted that predictable bilateral ties can positively impact regional and global peace and prosperity. His comments signal a potential warming of relations with Beijing, a notable shift from New Delhi's recent strategy of positioning itself as a counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region. This diplomatic overture comes as India navigates its complex geopolitical relationships, including a recent cooling of ties with the U.S.</p>

The Spanish player, who won his first Grand Slam title in New York in 2022, briefly received treatment on his right knee but stated he was not concerned about it.

The artist, whose real name is Valerie Teicher Barbosa, has taken full artistic control, allowing her to experiment with a blend of English and Spanish tracks and explore a unique sound she calls 'Canadianatón.' This new album builds on her journey toward creative independence, which began with her 2024 LP 'Valerie.' Tei Shi also announced an upcoming U.S. headline tour to support the new record, starting in Los Angeles in late September.</p>

          <h2>Seniors Have Multiple Options to Access Home Equity Without Refinancing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As homeowners await more significant interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, seniors have several effective ways to tap into their record-high home equity without giving up their low mortgage rates. One key option is a reverse mortgage, available to those 62 and older, which converts equity into payments for the homeowner without requiring monthly repayments. Alternatively, home equity loans currently offer some of the lowest borrowing rates available, with fixed interest providing stability. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer flexibility for those unsure of their borrowing needs, though they typically come with variable rates. (not investment advice)</p>

She has previously indicated an intention to serve only two terms before returning to the private sector.

          <p>A growing number of multigenerational, high-value 'trophy' ranches are hitting the market as families with numerous heirs find it difficult to agree on the properties' futures. Brokers report a significant increase in listings for these legacy estates, some on the market for the first time in over a century. Demand remains strong from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, partly fueled by the 'Yellowstone' effect. While some families sell due to disinterest from the next generation, others face financial pressures, as these large properties are capital-intensive assets that can be difficult to maintain without sufficient liquidity.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelan nationals living in the United States. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority by trying to end the protections. The court noted that the TPS statute was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This ruling provides a significant, albeit potentially temporary, reprieve for Venezuelans who fled political and economic crisis in their home country.</p>

          <p>A major compromise has been reached in California between lawmakers, labor unions, and rideshare companies Uber and Lyft that will allow drivers to unionize and bargain collectively. Under the deal, drivers will maintain their status as independent contractors while gaining the right to negotiate pay and working conditions. In exchange, a separate bill will advance that significantly reduces the insurance coverage companies are required to carry for their drivers. Governor Gavin Newsom praised the agreement as a landmark compromise that empowers drivers while also aiming to make ridesharing more affordable for consumers.</p>
