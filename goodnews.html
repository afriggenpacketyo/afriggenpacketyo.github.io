        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with President Trump was overshadowed by the Trump-Musk feud, but analysts view it as a win for Merz. Merz's agenda included strengthening U.S.-German relations, discussing tariffs, and U.S. support for Ukraine. He seemingly addressed these points with Trump, highlighting the U.S.-German relationship by gifting Trump his grandfather's birth certificate. Merz also emphasized Germany's plans for higher defense spending, avoiding the sensitive topic of Germany's far-right party, the Alternative fuer Deutschland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Extreme heat is testing the resilience of roads, railways, and bridges worldwide, leading to infrastructure failures and increased maintenance needs. Heat reduces road traction, deforms rail tracks, and expands bridge joints, prompting the need for innovative solutions. Strategies include using heat-reflective coatings for roads, painting rails white to absorb less heat, and climate-proofing bridges with expansion joints and stress-resistant materials. As global temperatures rise, adapting transport infrastructure is crucial for maintaining economic and community stability.</p>

          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies confiscated in criminal cases by selling them through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong. This move could support Hong Kong's ambition to become a virtual asset hub. The Beijing Public Security Bureau is partnering with the China Beijing Equity Exchange (CBEX) to sell the assets through regulated platforms. Proceeds will be converted into yuan and deposited in designated accounts. This marks the first time a mainland agency has detailed a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's order curtailing foreign students at Harvard. The same judge also extended her block on another attempt by the administration to stop the university from issuing student visas. Harvard argued that the administration failed to back up claims that the students posed a threat to national security. The ruling provides relief for international students and challenges the administration's policies.</p>
