          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 20:51:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is advocating for a new policy that would require new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials before approval, a move described as a "radical departure" from current practices. This policy would necessitate studies where half the participants receive a placebo to compare results against the vaccine. While proponents argue this ensures safety, critics express concern about the ethics of using placebos when effective vaccines already exist. The exact definition of a "new" vaccine under this policy remains unclear, particularly regarding updated annual vaccines like those for the flu and COVID-19.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding elections amidst a global crisis, with the People's Action Party (P.A.P.) seeking to maintain its long-standing rule. Voters are concerned about the rising cost of living and housing affordability. The opposition is gaining support, criticizing the P.A.P.'s response to these issues. The election could be a referendum on change, testing the popularity of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong after he took office last year, and voters have been moving away from the two major parties that have long been dominant, instead turning to independent candidates and minor parties.</p>

The USDA had suspended funds for a child nutrition program because Maine would not comply with demands to bar trans girls from girls' sports. Maine sued the USDA, and a settlement was reached, restoring the funds. The governor said the USDA had frozen funds for a program that helps feed 172,000 children in the state.</p>

          <p>Scientists say that antibodies from a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades have led to an "unparalleled" antivenom. Tim Friede's blood has been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests. Current therapies must match the specific species of venomous snake, but Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites. The research identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has ordered the State Bar of California to revert to the traditional national exam format after a botched February exam. The court lowered the passing score on the February exam and directed the agency to abandon its new multiple-choice questions. The decision came shortly after the State Bar of California announced that its executive director, Leah T. Wilson, will step down in July, with many test takers urging Wilson to resign after the exam was plagued by technical glitches and irregularities.</p>
