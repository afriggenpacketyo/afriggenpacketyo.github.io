          <p>President Trump declared the U.S. would remove all sanctions on Syria to give the country "a chance at greatness" during a speech at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh. He stated his administration had already taken steps to restore normal relations between the U.S. and Syria. Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011 following the Assad regime's crackdown on anti-government uprisings. Trump's announcement was met with celebrations in Damascus, Syria, where people waved Syrian flags in response to the news.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order mandating pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily reduce prescription drug costs within 30 days or face new restrictions on government payments. The order directs the Department of Health to negotiate new drug prices, potentially linking U.S. prices to lower prices paid by other countries. The pharmaceutical industry opposes the order, arguing it could harm research and development. The "nation most favored" approach has been controversial, with a similar order facing legal challenges during Trump's first term.</p>
