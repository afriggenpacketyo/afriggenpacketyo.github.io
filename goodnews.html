        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican-led House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a single vote after Speaker Mike Johnson navigated internal GOP disagreements. The bill, crucial for advancing President Donald Trump's tax and immigration agenda, includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and border security spending. Johnson hailed the bill as a victory for Americans and a return to winning, though two Republicans opposed the measure, and one voted present. The bill now moves to the Senate, where revisions are expected, marking just the first hurdle in its legislative journey.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is seriously considering making Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public companies, which are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) critical to America's housing financial system. These entities buy mortgages from lenders and bundle them into mortgage-backed securities, selling them to investors, thus providing liquidity and stability to the market. Trump stated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are performing well and generating significant cash, suggesting the timing is right for this transition.

          <p>House Republicans made several late revisions to their tax cut and immigration bill to secure support for its passage. These changes included removing sections authorizing the sale of public lands in Nevada and Utah, renaming "MAGA" accounts to "Trump" accounts, and accelerating the implementation of Medicaid work requirements. The revised bill also quadruples the cap on state and local tax deductions and deregulates gun silencers.

          <p>The New York Times reports on a proposal where the Republican party is seeking to invest $1,000 for every American baby born over the next four years. The money would be deposited in a "Trump account" and invested on their behalf in financial markets. Once they had grown up, they could withdraw the proceeds to pay for certain expenses, including going to college or buying a house. People could only contribute post-tax income to the accounts, and gains in the accounts would also be taxed when money was withdrawn, making the ‚ÄúTrump account‚Äù function much like a typical investment account, rather than a tax-advantaged account like an individual retirement account or a health savings account.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics, driven by restrictions on visas and the ongoing effects of the pandemic. The decrease was primarily due to fewer people coming to work and study in the UK, coupled with a rise in those leaving after completing their studies. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper highlighted a 300,000 drop in net migration since the election and promised further reductions through new immigration measures. Conservative figures sought to claim credit for the decline, while Reform UK leader Nigel Farage criticized the figures as still disastrous.</p>

Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt and a pro-crypto agenda from President Trump have also bolstered bitcoin's value.

          <p>The Japanese government is considering reusing soil removed from areas around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on the premises of the prime minister's office and other ministries and agencies. The move aims to set a precedent on soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, after demonstration projects faced local opposition. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry, would likely be used for flowerbeds. The initiative is part of Japan's effort to reduce the total amount of soil needing disposal from the 2011 nuclear disaster.</p>
