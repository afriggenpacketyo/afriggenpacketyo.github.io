        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Yankees prevented a series sweep by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3, despite the Dodgers winning the first two games. Yoshinobu Yamamoto had a rare poor start, allowing a season-high in hits and walks, while the Dodgers made defensive and baserunning errors that cost them runs. Ryan Yarbrough, a former Dodger, pitched effectively for the Yankees, shutting down the Dodgers' offense, and the Dodgers' offense struggled without Mookie Betts, resulting in an inconsistent performance and a missed opportunity to build momentum. This game's final score was a result of the Yankees' strong performance.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Sounders protested the bonus structure for the Club World Cup with support from the MLSPA, which wore shirts reading ‚ÄúClub World Ca$h Grab‚Äù during warm-ups. The MLSPA stated that FIFA's new tournament increases player workload without regard to their well-being, and while MLS teams receive substantial payments for participation, players receive only 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million per team. The players sought to meet with MLS to change the arrangement, but the league has not offered a reasonable proposal. The Club World Cup will feature three MLS teams: Inter Miami, Seattle Sounders, and Los Angeles FC.</p>
