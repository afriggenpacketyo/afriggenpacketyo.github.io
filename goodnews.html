          <p>Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon are collaborating to allow institutional clients to invest in money market funds using blockchain technology. This initiative tokenizes ownership of funds, aiming to create more efficient and seamless transactions by reducing the friction found in traditional markets. Major fund companies like BlackRock and Fidelity have already joined the project, which builds on the growing acceptance of digital assets. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for large investors to park cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shortstop Ethan Holliday, the No. 4 overall pick in the MLB draft, has agreed to a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies that includes a record-breaking $9 million signing bonus for a high school player. The 18-year-old from Oklahoma comes from a prominent baseball family, as he is the son of former All-Star Matt Holliday and the younger brother of Baltimore's Jackson Holliday. This bonus surpasses the previous high school record and matches the fourth-highest for any draft pick since 2012. Holliday's impressive pedigree and outstanding high school performance have positioned him as a top prospect in professional baseball.</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating interest rates quashed by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled that their original trials were unfair due to misdirection of the jury, making the convictions unsafe. The men were among 19 traders convicted in the UK and US for rigging the Libor and Euribor rates, which influence global borrowing costs. Following the ruling, Hayes, who served over five years in prison, spoke of the devastating impact the conviction had on his family and life.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off her attacker's tongue while defending herself from a sexual assault. At 19, she was given a suspended prison sentence, while her attacker received a lighter, suspended sentence for trespassing. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, sought a retrial to clear her name after 61 years of living as a convicted criminal. The prosecution has now asked the court to acquit her, with a final verdict expected in September, marking a significant moment for victims' rights in the country.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is pushing for significant changes to Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems to curb their market dominance. The regulator has proposed designating the tech giants with a "strategic market status," which would empower the CMA to enforce new conduct requirements. The proposed changes address concerns over app store commissions, inconsistent review processes, and restrictions that prevent developers from informing users about cheaper payment options. While the CMA aims to create a fairer market, both Apple and Google have argued that the proposals could undermine user security and privacy protections.</p>

This move follows increased pressure from policymakers and accusations that the company has failed to shield young users from sexual exploitation and mental health harms. Meta also reported removing over 600,000 accounts linked to predatory behavior and sexualizing children on its platforms earlier this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A slowing housing market is compelling some homeowners to become 'accidental landlords' by renting out their properties instead of selling them. This trend is creating unexpected competition for large institutional rental companies, particularly in Sun Belt markets like Atlanta, Phoenix, and Dallas where these investors are most concentrated. With rising housing inventory and high mortgage rates deterring buyers, these new rental listings are adding to the available supply. While this may limit the ability of large landlords to implement significant rent increases, major firms are adapting by shifting their investment focus from purchasing existing homes to build-to-rent projects.

          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted German comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as 'El Hotzo,' of charges related to online posts he made following the 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Prosecutors had accused him of condoning a criminal offense for posts that joked about the attempt, arguing they constituted hate speech. However, the judge ruled that the posts were clearly recognizable as satire, albeit in bad taste, and did not demonstrate an intent to disturb public order. The court affirmed that in a liberal democracy, it is desirable for people to be able to argue about different opinions, even controversial ones.</p>

Finch, who still lives at home and cannot drive, has faced criticism about his lack of experience but dismisses it as ageism. He became interim leader after Reform UK emerged as the largest party in the May local elections. In an interview, Finch stated he was inspired by his party's platform and believes his appointment demonstrates that merit, not identity, is what matters for leadership roles within the party.</p>

          <p>A wooden shipwreck discovered by a schoolboy on a remote Scottish beach has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a remarkable history. Originally HMS Hind, the ship was a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in 1749 that participated in the American War of Independence. After its military service, it was sold and renamed, beginning a new life as a whaling ship in the Arctic. Archaeologists and local researchers used dendrochronology and archival records to piece together its identity, tracing its journey from naval battles to its eventual wreck off the island of Sanday in 1788.</p>

Currently, this status is primarily determined by financial thresholds, limiting access to assets like private equity and hedge funds.
