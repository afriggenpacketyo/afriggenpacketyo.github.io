          <p>President Trump engaged with conservative Republicans to address their concerns regarding the budget package, which includes his second-term agenda. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the meeting as productive, although some conservatives remain wary about the level of spending cuts. The bill also faces opposition from blue-state Republicans due to provisions on state and local tax deductions. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the original version of the bill would add trillions to the deficit over the next decade, while the Congressional Budget Office's analysis suggests an even higher increase.

Officials and residents expressed dismay, noting the oversight was meant to end the department's pattern of violent, racist, and unconstitutional practices. Minneapolis officials oppose the withdrawal and remain committed to the changes outlined in the agreement, while the police union welcomed the decision. The city also has a legal agreement with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights to overhaul police practices, which will remain in effect.</p>

          <p>US researchers are proposing a novel approach to combat malaria by administering malaria drugs to mosquitoes to clear their infection, preventing them from spreading the disease. Current efforts focus on killing mosquitoes with insecticide, but the Harvard University team found that a drug cocktail absorbed through the insects' legs can effectively rid them of malaria. The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with the drug cocktail to treat mosquitoes while they rest on the nets. This method could help combat insecticide resistance and reduce malaria transmission.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration welcomes Afrikaners as refugees due to claims of violence and discrimination, some Afrikaners dispute the existence of a "White genocide" in South Africa. While one Afrikaner professional hunter claimed a genocide is focused on White farmers, Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp stated Whites are economically the strongest group in South Africa. Nick Serfontein, an Afrikaner cattle farmer, also refuted the genocide claims, stating violent attacks on farmers are not generally racially motivated.

          <p>Researchers are advocating for the NHS to offer additional scans to women with very dense breasts as part of the breast screening program, which could detect more cancers and save lives. A Cambridge University-led study found that using alternative scans from traditional mammograms could significantly increase the number of cancers detected in this group. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, but cancers are harder to spot using mammograms. Alternative methods, such as enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, detected significantly more cancers in the study.</p>

          <p>Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit, Evernorth, has reached a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to provide copay caps on their weight loss drugs, Wegovy and Zepbound. The deal aims to lower costs for employers and cap member costs at $200 per month. The new arrangement includes a simplified pre-authorization process and consistent pricing across retail pharmacies and home delivery. This deal could provide more affordable access to weight loss medications for individuals and reduce costs for employers. (not investment advice)</p>
