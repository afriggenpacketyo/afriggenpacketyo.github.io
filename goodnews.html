        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom saw a record number of electric vehicle (EV) sales in September, with pure battery electric vehicles growing by nearly a third. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT), electrified vehicles, including hybrids, accounted for over half of all new car registrations for the month. This growth is attributed to manufacturer discounts, a wider variety of models, and a government grant scheme aimed at encouraging the transition from petrol and diesel cars. Despite the surge, the majority of these purchases were made by businesses for fleet use rather than private buyers.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to parts of a peace proposal outlined by President Trump, including the release of all hostages and handing over administrative control of Gaza to an independent Palestinian body. However, the group indicated that other aspects of the 20-point plan require further negotiation. In response, President Trump urged Israel to immediately halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, stating he believes Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed preparations to implement the first phase of the plan.</p>

          <p>Recent anti-China demonstrations in popular tourist districts of South Korea have not significantly impacted the number of Chinese visitors, according to aviation and travel industry analysts. Scheduled flights between the two nations continue to operate normally, and South Korea remains a top destination for Chinese tourists. Although the Chinese embassy expressed regret over the rallies, analysts believe that because both governments oppose the protests, tourism will likely remain stable. However, they caution that a shift in the Chinese government's official stance could quickly reverse this trend.</p>

          <p>Bowling Green State University's football team has seen a surge in fan engagement and attendance, partly thanks to its new, unofficial mascot: a 3-year-old Persian cat named Pudge. Owned by the team's long snapper, George Carlson, Pudge attends all home games and has become a beloved phenomenon among fans. Carlson initially brought the cat to the locker room to boost team morale during a difficult period, crediting Pudge with helping him cope with the loss of his mother. The school reports that home game attendance is up nearly 60%, the largest increase for any NCAA Division I team this year.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts stated the plan is to "just treat him like a regular pitcher," signaling confidence after a dominant late-season performance against the same Phillies team. Ohtani expressed gratitude for the opportunity to pitch in the postseason, a moment the team has been anticipating all year.</p>

          <p>Manchester United ended Chelsea's perfect start to the Women's Super League season with a hard-fought draw, marking only the second time they have taken points from the six-time defending champions. Despite the significant result, United's manager Marc Skinner expressed disappointment, believing his team missed several key opportunities to secure a victory. The performance was seen as a statement that United is a serious title contender this season, challenging Chelsea's long-standing dominance in the league. The draw keeps Chelsea at the top of the table, with Manchester United remaining two points behind in second place.</p>

          <h2>New California Law Grants Uber and Lyft Drivers the Right to Unionize</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 18:49:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a landmark bill allowing rideshare drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft to unionize and engage in collective bargaining while maintaining their status as independent contractors. The legislation is the result of a rare compromise between labor unions and gig economy companies after years of legal and political disputes. The new law establishes a process for drivers to unionize through the state's Public Employment Relations Board but does not extend to other gig workers, such as food delivery drivers. In a related move, Newsom also signed a bill that reduces the companies' insurance requirements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bournemouth has climbed to an unexpected second place in the Premier League, largely driven by the stellar performance of Ghanaian winger Antoine Semenyo. In a recent match against Fulham, Semenyo scored two goals and provided an assist, bringing his season total to six league goals. Since May, he has been involved in more goals than any other player in the league, becoming a key asset after the club sold off nearly £200m worth of talent in the summer. His success highlights the effective management of coach Andoni Iraola, who has guided the team to unprecedented heights.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on a temporary basis. This decision upholds a lower court's injunction against the president's executive order, marking the fifth time a federal court has blocked the policy. The court determined that the order likely violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment, which has historically been interpreted to grant birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already appealed to the Supreme Court, setting up a potential definitive ruling on the matter.</p>
