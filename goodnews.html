          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with a vote on President Trump's second-term agenda, which includes tax cuts, border security, and defense spending, despite persistent disagreements within the party. Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged the need for further negotiations but expressed confidence in passing the bill. Conservative hardliners initially blocked the legislation but later allowed it to advance after securing modifications to Medicaid work requirements. The bill still faces hurdles regarding state and local tax deductions and clean energy subsidies, with resistance expected in the Senate, as well. The legislation includes a debt limit increase, adding urgency to its passage before the July 4th deadline.</p>

          <p>Middleton High School in Wisconsin is experiencing a revival of trade classes, driven by the increasing demand for skilled tradespeople and the potential for six-figure salaries in blue-collar jobs. The school's focus on technical education is part of a larger trend across 27 states, where spending on technical education has increased significantly. Students are taking courses in woodworking, welding, and robotics, learning skills directly applicable to the workforce. With university enrollment declining slightly, more students are recognizing that college isn't the only path to a successful career.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including the creation and dissemination of fake images. The bill makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent, requiring websites and social media companies to remove such material within 48 hours. The legislation, championed by First Lady Melania Trump, aims to protect children from online exploitation and harassment. Free speech advocates have raised concerns about the bill's potential for censorship and government monitoring of private communications.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that former President Joe Biden delayed sharing his cancer diagnosis, questioning why the public wasn't notified earlier. Trump appeared to conflate the Gleason score with the stage of Biden's cancer, implying a cover-up. Biden's office disclosed that he was diagnosed with Stage 4 prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. Trump also claimed that Biden's officials had been effectively running the office by using the autopen to sign documents.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Venezuelan man won a legal battle in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that he should be allowed to return to the United States after being deported to El Salvador. The court determined that his deportation violated a class action settlement. The Trump administration had argued that his removal was justified under the Alien Enemies Act and that he was an admitted member of the Tren de Aragua gang, allegations he denies. The appellate panel rejected these arguments, asserting that the government had breached the settlement agreement.</p>

By studying neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, scientists hope to find differences that could reveal why matter prevailed, leading to the formation of planets, stars, and galaxies.
