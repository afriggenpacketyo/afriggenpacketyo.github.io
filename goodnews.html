          <p>Apple is seeking a stay on a recent court decision in its legal battle with Epic Games, arguing that the ruling, which requires Apple to allow developers to include external payment links in their apps, could cost the company substantial sums. The company states that complying with the order would disrupt its App Store ecosystem and negatively impact its business model, potentially costing them hundreds of millions to billions of dollars annually. Apple is appealing the contempt ruling, asserting that it has complied with the court's original order and that the new ruling is punitive rather than coercive. Apple argues that the changes forced by the ruling reduce consumer choice and damage its business.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are touting a newly enacted law designed to support the country's private economy, framing it as a crucial foundation for future growth, especially as China navigates ongoing trade disputes with the United States. The law aims to address challenges faced by private enterprises, including fair market competition, market access, financial support, and legal protections. The legislation is intended to unleash the internal momentum and creative vitality of the private sector, which is seen as increasingly important for China's economic development. The law clearly defines the legal status of the private economy and the government's support for it for the first time.</p>

          <p>Kavan Markwood, a Pittsburgh Pirates fan who fell 21 feet at PNC Park, is recovering "ahead of schedule" according to doctors, despite sustaining injuries to his skull, brain, spine, ribs, and lungs. Markwood has been moved out of intensive care and is preparing for physical therapy rehab, demonstrating remarkable progress. Family members have expressed gratitude for the support and emphasized that Markwood should not be judged based on the accident. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is investigating the fall, with initial reports suggesting Markwood may have been intoxicated, though a Pirates spokesperson stated he showed no signs of intoxication.</p>

          <p>An idle Southern California Edison transmission tower, Tower 208, was dismantled and removed for testing to determine its role in igniting the Eaton fire. The pylon has been the focus of investigators after video captured initial flames burning underneath the structure. Southern California Edison officials said the idle line it carried somehow became reenergized the day the fire began to burn, and that the reenergization of the line is now a leading theory into what sparked the inferno. The tower will be examined, photographed, and tested in a laboratory setting by fire investigators, Southern California Edison officials, and experts hired by plaintiffs who have sued the utility company.</p>

Boise's mayor issued a proclamation making the pride flag an official city flag. The moves are a reaction to laws restricting flags to the state flag, the US flag, and other official flags.</p>
