          <p>Shanghai and Beijing reported GDP growth rates of 5.5% and 5.6% respectively for the first nine months of the year, surpassing China's national average of 5.2%. This growth is primarily fueled by strengthening domestic demand, with retail sales increasing by 4.3% year-on-year, despite a slower start to the year. Hi-tech manufacturing, encompassing AI, integrated circuits, and biotechnology, significantly contributed to the industrial sector's expansion. While the economy shows stronger internal momentum, authorities caution that external uncertainties persist, necessitating further policy support to solidify the recovery.</p>

          <p>China and Indonesia are collaborating to establish a remote sensing application center aimed at enhancing environmental monitoring and resource management. This initiative will provide technical support for areas like agriculture, forestry, and water resources, facilitating data-sharing, research, and capacity building between the two nations. The technology is expected to aid in detecting illegal fishing, mapping coastal erosion, and tracking marine ecosystem health. This partnership marks a new stage in their relations, promoting mutual benefits and resource-sharing in environmental protection.</p>

          <p>The German Finance Ministry announced plans to pay the October salaries for approximately 11,000 local employees at US military bases in Germany. This measure is a sign of solidarity, ensuring these workers are not impacted by the ongoing US government shutdown. Germany anticipates reimbursement once the US government resumes normal operations. Separately, Chancellor Friedrich Merz faced criticism for comments linking migrants to public safety fears, which sparked controversy within his own party and protests, highlighting internal political divisions.</p>

          <h2>Historical Analysis Reveals "Wealth Pump" as Driver of Societal Crises and Paths to Resolution</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert analysis of over a hundred past societal crises, spanning two millennia, identifies the "wealth pump" as a recurring mechanism driving instability. This process involves the transfer of wealth from the general population to a concentrated elite, leading to rising economic and political inequality. The wealth pump undermines stability by fostering popular discontent, creating an overproduction of elites competing for power, and increasing the number of frustrated, highly educated youth. Historical resolutions often involved major epidemics, civil wars, or transformative revolutions, but modern societies can learn from past reforms to rebalance wealth and power, requiring decades of political struggle.</p>

          <p>Weather warnings for wind and rain across the UK have been reduced as Storm Benjamin, named by Météo France, moves eastward. While the storm brought violent winds up to 100mph to northern France, its impact on the UK is diminishing. Two yellow warnings remain for rain in Norfolk and Suffolk and wind across eastern England, with a low chance of localized flooding and gusts up to 55mph on coastal regions. The storm caused some earlier disruption, including power outages and railway blockages, but the immediate threat is lessening.</p>

          <p>While many retailers are shrinking, Dick's Sporting Goods is expanding its footprint with larger "House of Sport" stores, typically 120,000-150,000 square feet. These stores offer immersive experiences like climbing walls, sports cages, and golf simulators, alongside extensive merchandise. Executive Chairman Edward Stack views this strategy as essential for future success, with these stores generating high annual sales and strong EBITDA rates. Despite Wall Street's initial skepticism and significant capital expenditure, the concept is proving "wildly successful" and attracting major brands like Nike, often revitalizing vacant department store spaces in malls.</p>

          <p>Paleontologist Chinzorig Tsogtbaatar discovered Zavacephale rinpoche, a new species of pachycephalosaur, in southeast Mongolia, dating back 110 million years. This specimen, named "precious one" in Tibetan, is 15 million years older than any previously found pachycephalosaur, filling a critical evolutionary gap. The discovery includes the most complete skeleton of this dome-headed dinosaur group, revealing insights into their small size, rigid tails, and tiny hands. The juvenile dinosaur already possessed a fully developed dome, suggesting early head-butting behavior, and the specimen will remain in Mongolia for heritage protection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following massive "No Kings" anti-Trump protests, an expert discusses how to convert this energy into lasting political power. Harvard professor Theda Skocpol notes the protests' inspiring scale but cautions against equating turnout with power, emphasizing the need for sustained electoral organizing. She highlights the importance of local, broad-tent groups that emerged from previous protest waves to achieve policy and electoral effects. Skocpol criticizes top-down advocacy that prioritizes internal ideological battles over unified action, stressing that real political power comes from strategic organization and elite accountability, rather than solely mass demonstrations.</p>

          <p>The third T20 match between England and New Zealand in Auckland was abandoned due to persistent rain, resulting in a 1-0 series victory for Harry Brook's England side. Only 3.4 overs were played, with New Zealand reaching 38-1. Severe weather has caused widespread disruption in New Zealand, including power outages and flight impacts. This marks England's first overseas series win under Brook's white-ball captaincy, an encouraging start despite the limited play. The series was unusually scheduled early in New Zealand's season, ahead of the T20 World Cup and the upcoming Ashes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with several quantum-computing firms, including IonQ and Rigetti Computing, about taking equity stakes in exchange for federal funding. This aligns with a broader strategy to invest in industries deemed vital for US national security, following previous investments in rare earths company MP Materials and semiconductor firm Intel. The move signals an ideological shift towards greater government intervention in strategic industries, aiming for the US to benefit from company success tied to public funds. This strategy also underscores Washington's focus on technological competition with China.</p>

CEO Håkan Samuelsson noted a return to slight sales growth in September and the ramp-up of BEV car sales, despite a challenging short-term outlook due to macroeconomic pressures and US import tariffs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A national shortage of affordable "starter homes" is locking many first-time buyers out of the market, exacerbated by rising construction costs and homeowners reluctant to give up low mortgage rates. Austin, Texas, exemplifies this trend, where median home prices far exceed what average earners can afford, partly due to restrictive zoning and slow approval processes. Experts suggest strategies like working with Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to improve credit and savings, and considering homes further from city centers. State initiatives, like Utah's subsidized loans, aim to boost construction, offering some hope for future market shifts.</p>

          <p>A major UK study, published in The Lancet, has for the first time compiled data from over 150 clinical trials to compare the physical side effects of 30 different antidepressants. The analysis details how each medication affects weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol. It found frequently prescribed SSRIs generally have fewer physical side effects compared to older drugs. Lead author Dr. Toby Pillinger emphasizes the goal is to help patients and prescribers make individualized decisions, noting that side effects are not always negative and should not deter people from essential medication.</p>
