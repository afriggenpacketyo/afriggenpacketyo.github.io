          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ credit rating for long-term U.S. sovereign debt, projecting that revenue from the Trump administration's tariffs will largely offset the fiscal impact of a recent tax-and-spending bill. The rating agency noted that the "Big Beautiful Bill" is expected to increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. However, S&P warned it could lower the rating in the future if deficits increase due to political inability to contain spending or if political developments weaken U.S. institutions and the dollar's status as the world's leading reserve currency.

          <h2>The Evolution of the Word 'Nerd' from Geeky Insult to Mainstream Identity</h2>

          <p>The term "nerd," potentially first appearing in Dr. Seuss's 1950 book "If I Ran the Zoo," has undergone a significant cultural transformation. Initially a slang insult for socially awkward or overly intellectual individuals, the word was popularized by shows like "Happy Days." However, the rise of tech figures like Bill Gates and the mainstream success of "nerd culture" genres like science fiction and comic books have shifted its meaning. Today, "nerd" is often a self-applied term of endearment for anyone with a passionate interest in a specific subject, reflecting its journey from the margins to the mainstream.</p>

          <h2>Debate Continues on Whether Financial Rewards Effectively Motivate Students for Exam Success</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As GCSE students in the UK await their results, the practice of offering cash or expensive gifts for good grades remains a topic of debate among parents and experts. Some parents believe financial incentives provide motivation for students to study harder, while others feel good grades should be their own reward. Psychologists suggest that while rewards can work in the short term, they risk making achievement feel transactional. Experts advise that rewarding effort rather than specific grades can be a more sustainable long-term strategy, fostering an intrinsic value for education over a purely monetary one.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has appointed Francisco Roig, a long-time member of Rafael Nadal's coaching team, as her new coach. Roig, who was instrumental in all 22 of Nadal's Grand Slam victories, is renowned for his technical expertise. The move is seen as a significant step for the 22-year-old Raducanu as she aims to build on her recent upward trajectory and return to the top tier of women's tennis. Colleagues describe Roig as a patient yet demanding coach who can help Raducanu refine the overall quality of her shots ahead of the upcoming US Open.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the electric vehicle industry, a race between two battery chemistries has seen a major shift, particularly in China. Lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, which do not use cobalt, have overtaken traditional nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) batteries to become the dominant technology in the world's largest EV market. Cobalt mining is fraught with human rights and environmental concerns, making the shift to LFP a significant development for sustainable technology. The article explores why this transition has been so successful in China while adoption in the U.S. and other markets has been slower.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are suggesting that the list of major food allergens requiring mandatory warning labels in the UK and EU should be expanded. Based on an analysis of anaphylaxis cases in Europe, experts identified pine nuts, goat's or sheep's milk, buckwheat, and legumes like peas and lentils as emerging allergens causing increasingly frequent and severe reactions. The current list includes 14 substances, such as peanuts and gluten. The study, published in Clinical & Experimental Allergy, argues that reviewing and updating the list is necessary to protect consumers from potentially life-threatening reactions to these other foods.</p>

          <p>Thirty years after gray wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park, the ecological effects are proving to be more complex than the popular narrative suggests. While the reintroduction was successful in controlling the elk population, which had overgrazed the park's vegetation, attributing all subsequent ecosystem changes solely to wolves is an oversimplification. This article explores the nuanced scientific understanding of the trophic cascade that followed, including the roles of other predators, climate, and human influence. The legacy of the Yellowstone wolf reintroduction continues to inform debates about similar conservation efforts elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart rose significantly after the company announced a nearly 400% surge in net profit for the first half of 2025. The remarkable growth was driven by the booming global popularity of its "ugly-cute" Labubu dolls, which have become a viral sensation. The company's revenue more than tripled, with overseas markets in the Asia-Pacific and the Americas showing explosive growth. Following the strong results, the company's CEO expressed confidence in easily surpassing the firm's 2025 revenue targets, further boosting investor sentiment.</p>
