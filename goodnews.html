          <p>Homeowners with substantial equity are considering borrowing $100,000, leading to the question of whether a home equity loan or a HELOC is more cost-effective. While current rates are similar, HELOCs have variable rates that could decrease if interest rates are cut, potentially saving money. Home equity loans provide a lump sum with immediate repayment, while HELOCs offer a revolving line of credit with interest-only payments during the draw period. Homeowners should carefully consider their financial needs and consult with a lending expert to determine the most suitable option. (not investment advice)</p>

However, concerns arise as BNPL is used for everyday expenses like groceries and the prospect of financing conveniences like food delivery. As regulations evolve and BNPL companies face financial challenges, consumers must consider the long-term implications of relying on these services.</p>
