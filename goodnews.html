          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is launching an emergency task force comprised of experts from the FAA, Verizon, and L3Harris to ensure safety and efficiency at Newark Liberty International Airport.

          <p>CBS News reports that the EPA did not publish its annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions report, but the Environmental Defense Fund obtained and published the data. The report, examining data from 1990-2023, found that the U.S. has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by about 17% since 2005. Concerns remain that new policies by the Trump administration might worsen carbon pollution. The transportation sector is responsible for the most carbon dioxide emissions, while the electric power sector has reduced emissions due to renewable energy. </p>

The US scientists are working on the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota, while the Japanese scientists are building Hyper K. The goal is to understand why matter won over antimatter in the early universe. The discoveries in store will be transformative to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself. </p>
