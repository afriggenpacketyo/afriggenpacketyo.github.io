        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Vice President JD Vance expressed confidence in an imminent hostage release in Gaza, crediting the Trump administration's non-traditional diplomacy. He detailed a broader peace plan involving Muslim-majority nations providing ground troops for security and rebuilding efforts, with the U.S. playing a mediating role. Vance also addressed the ongoing government shutdown, blaming Senate Democrats for the resulting chaos and defending the administration's decision to lay off federal workers to preserve essential services. He framed the shutdown as a "hostage taking" by Democrats over healthcare policy, asserting the administration would not negotiate until the government is reopened.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance confirmed that Hamas is holding 20 living hostages, with their release anticipated within the next 24 hours. Speaking on ABC's "This Week," Vance stated that while final confirmation depends on seeing the individuals alive, the administration is optimistic about their safe return. The development is seen as a significant step toward peace in the Middle East, prompting President Trump to travel to the region to meet with the hostages and their families. This confirmation follows initial reports from The Wall Street Journal and marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The article explores the historical roots of America's strong record of invention, starting with Thomas Edison's development of a commercially viable electrical system. It highlights that Edison's success was not as a lone genius but as the leader of an "invention factory" that brought together diverse talents to solve complex problems systemically. This collaborative and risk-tolerant spirit continues today, fostered by a unique ecosystem of venture capital, government support, and a culture that glamorizes entrepreneurship and is more accepting of failure than many other nations. Experts and entrepreneurs from "Shark Tank" note that this environment has created a powerful engine for ingenuity.</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the common dilemma of whether one can still enjoy the Harry Potter series while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's anti-transgender stance. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that many beloved literary works were created by flawed individuals. The article suggests that the core positive messages of the books, such as rejecting prejudice, can still be valued even while acknowledging problematic elements. To do so ethically, the author recommends critically interrogating the content in a community setting and transforming fandom into a force for social good, rather than simply trying to "offset" guilt with donations.</p>

          <p>While younger consumers increasingly shop online, baby boomers remain loyal to department stores, leveraging perks that Gen Z may overlook. According to retail experts, these benefits include more generous return policies, free shipping for out-of-stock items, and personalized customer service from stylists, which can enhance the shopping experience. Data shows that the customer base for stores like Macy's and Bloomingdale's skews significantly older. The article suggests that the "tiktokification of retail" has conditioned younger shoppers to prioritize online convenience, while older generations value the tangible benefits and service that brick-and-mortar department stores can provide.</p>
