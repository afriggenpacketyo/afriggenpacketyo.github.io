          <p>President Trump indicated via social media that he is considering making Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, companies which play a vital role in America's housing financial system by buying mortgages from lenders and bundling them into mortgage-backed securities. Trump stated that the companies are performing well financially and that he would discuss the matter with his economic advisors. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that provide liquidity, stability and affordability to the mortgage market, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The president said he would make a decision in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers are proposing a novel way of treating mosquitoes for malaria by giving them malaria drugs to clear their infection so they can no longer spread the disease. A team at Harvard University has found a pair of drugs which can successfully rid the insects of malaria when absorbed through their legs. The long-term aim is to coat bed nets in the drug cocktail. Current efforts focus on killing mosquitoes with insecticide, but mosquitoes have become resistant in many countries.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration welcomes Afrikaners as refugees due to claims of a "White genocide" in South Africa, some Afrikaners are disputing these claims. Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp states that there is no sign of a White genocide and that Whites are economically the strongest group in South Africa. Nick Serfontein, an Afrikaner cattle farmer, also denies the genocide claims and highlights the importance of land being shared by both Black and White South Africans. The article notes that racial motives are not generally a factor in South Africa's high crime rate.</p>

A Cambridge University-led study found that alternative scanning methods could treble the number of cancers detected in this group of women. One in ten women have very dense breasts and a higher risk of developing breast cancer, but cancers are harder to spot in dense breasts using traditional mammograms. The study found that enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans detected significantly more cancers.</p>
