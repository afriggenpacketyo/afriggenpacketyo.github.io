          <p>Marie Tidball, a recently elected Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge who has a congenital disability, is highlighting the significant accessibility challenges within the Houses of Parliament. Despite the passage of the Equalities Act 15 years ago, she points to numerous physical barriers, such as heavy doors with round handles, long distances to accessible toilets, and inaccessible voting lobbies. Tidball is working with the House of Commons Modernisation Committee to implement changes, arguing that Parliament must reflect the 22% of the voting population with disabilities to enrich the nation's politics.</p>

Harris, who has never missed an NFL game in his career, has been cleared for contact and is gradually increasing his workload in practice to prepare for the upcoming game.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, is recognized as a landmark of national park architecture and the largest log cabin in the world. Built in 1904 using uniquely twisted wood pieces called 'freaks of the forest,' the lodge has hosted millions of visitors, including presidents and royalty. Its distinctive design popularized the rustic architectural style that influenced other famous lodges in national parks like Yosemite and Glacier. A dedicated team of carpenters works to maintain its historic integrity, ensuring the iconic structure remains a timeless American treasure.</p>

          <p>After his son Frederico was diagnosed with recurrent medulloblastoma, a rare and aggressive brain tumor, Fernando Goldsztein launched the Medulloblastoma Initiative (MBI) to accelerate research for a cure. Frustrated by the lack of treatment options, Goldsztein partnered with a leading researcher to create a collaborative model that unites over a dozen labs worldwide, requiring them to work together to receive funding. This international effort has already helped fast-track clinical trials for new therapies, including one that programs a patient's own white blood cells to target and destroy tumor cells, offering new hope for children with the disease.</p>

          <p>British musician Tom Odell shares how a 2016 performance he considered a failure profoundly inspired a young Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, who were in the audience. This connection came full circle when Eilish invited Odell to open for her world tour, coinciding with a new peak in his own career driven by TikTok success. Odell discusses his latest album, 'A Wonderful Life,' which explores personal vulnerability and the anxiety of living in a period of global uncertainty. He reflects on finding peace not in chasing goals but in embracing the present moment.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new transfer spending record, with the total outlay for the summer window surpassing £3 billion. The figure was pushed past the milestone by several major deadline-day deals, including Alexander Isak's £125 million move from Newcastle to Liverpool. This summer's spending is significantly higher than last year's £1.96 billion and exceeds the combined total spent by clubs in Germany's Bundesliga, Spain's La Liga, France's Ligue 1, and Italy's Serie A, highlighting the Premier League's immense financial dominance.

          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is receiving critical acclaim and potential Oscar consideration for his transformative role as UFC fighter Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." Johnson stated he had a "burning desire" to take on a more intense and raw role after years of being typecast in blockbuster action films. He described the experience as life-changing and a welcome opportunity to explore his capabilities beyond the confines of box office expectations. Early reviews from the Venice Film Festival have praised his performance as a "revelation" and noted his sincere, ego-less portrayal.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group of 10 Eurasian countries including China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a new development bank. The move is intended to insulate member nations from risks associated with the US dollar-dominated global trade system and to accelerate key infrastructure projects. Analysts suggest that creating this financial institution is a logical step for the bloc, which seeks greater economic autonomy and stability. The bank would provide concessional lending and strengthen financial cooperation among the member states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This new minimum age, determined using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and helps resolve decades of conflicting estimates. The finding strengthens the theory that the fossil belonged to Homo heidelbergensis, a species believed to be the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans. This suggests that more primitive human populations coexisted with emerging Neanderthals in southeastern Europe, adding complexity to our understanding of the human story.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis to be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom in the coming days. The increased visibility is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which could push the Northern Lights further south than is typical. While cloud cover and light pollution will affect viewing conditions, those in areas with clear, dark skies, potentially as far south as the Midlands, might witness the rare display.

While his form has improved with each round, his ability to withstand the strain against top-tier opponents remains a key factor. His next challenge is a quarter-final match against Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds a dominant 10-0 record.</p>
