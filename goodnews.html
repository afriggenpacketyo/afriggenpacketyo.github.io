          <p>Internal documents from Meta, leaked to the public, detail the company's updated guidelines for how its AI chatbots should handle conversations related to child sexual exploitation. The rules, now being used by contractors, strictly prohibit AI from engaging in sexual roleplay involving minors or providing access to abusive material, a change from previous versions that had been criticized. This development comes as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigates major tech companies over AI safety protocols for children. The documents highlight a clear distinction between allowing educational discussions about exploitation and preventing any harmful or sexualized interactions with young users.</p>

          <p>Dame Jilly Cooper, the renowned British author celebrated for her witty and risqué romance novels, has passed away at the age of 88. She was best known for the 'Rutshire Chronicles,' a series of bestsellers like 'Rivals' and 'Riders' that explored the amorous intrigues of the English upper class. Born in 1937, Cooper began her career as a journalist before publishing her first novel in 1975, eventually becoming a household name. While her work later faced criticism for outdated stereotypes, its popularity endured, culminating in a recent Disney+ adaptation of 'Rivals' that introduced her stories to a new generation of fans.</p>

          <p>The British government has unveiled a major reform plan for the home-buying system in England and Wales, aimed at increasing transparency and reducing transaction failures. Under the new proposals, sellers would be legally required to provide essential property information upfront, and binding contracts could be introduced to prevent last-minute withdrawals. The government estimates these changes could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and shorten the typical property transaction time by four weeks. While housing experts have generally welcomed the initiative, they have also called for more specific details on implementation, cautioning against repeating the failures of past reforms.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been jointly awarded to Shimon Sakaguchi of Japan and U.S. researchers Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell. Their collective discoveries identified regulatory T-cells, which act as 'security guards' that prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. This breakthrough explains a critical mechanism of immune tolerance and has fundamentally advanced our understanding of autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and type-1 diabetes. The research has paved the way for new therapeutic strategies, with ongoing clinical trials exploring how to manipulate these cells to treat cancer and prevent organ transplant rejection.</p>

          <p>Japanese beverage giant Asahi has partially restarted operations at its six domestic breweries after a cyberattack forced a complete shutdown of its ordering and delivery systems. The disruption had led to stock shortages of popular beers like Asahi Super Dry at major retailers across Japan. While the production facilities themselves were not compromised, the company had to halt operations because it could not process orders or shipments.

          <p>Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her debut novel, 'Gone Before Goodbye,' with bestselling thriller writer Harlan Coben. The book follows Maggie McCabe, a brilliant but disgraced combat surgeon who becomes entangled with a secretive Russian oligarch. The plot explores themes of medical ethics, organ regeneration, and the immense power of wealth, taking readers into a world of lavish extravagance and moral ambiguity. While some plot elements may seem far-fetched, the review in this article suggests the novel is a fast-paced and entertaining thriller that leverages the combined storytelling strengths of its two high-profile authors to deliver a compelling narrative.</p>

          <p>Despite significant investment and hype from tech leaders like Elon Musk, a prominent robotics expert, Rodney Brooks, argues that the vision of functional humanoid robots is 'pure fantasy thinking' for the foreseeable future. Brooks, a co-founder of iRobot, contends that creating robots that look human is not necessary for most tasks and that current technology cannot replicate the dexterity, sensory feedback, or balance of humans. He points out that demonstrations often feature simple, repetitive tasks like folding clothes in controlled environments, which is vastly different from navigating the complexities of the real world, a challenge he believes won't be solved for decades.</p>

          <h2>The Complex Nature of Empathy: A Psychological Tool That Can Both Help and Harm</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of empathy is currently being debated, with some questioning its inherent value and others experiencing burnout from its demands. Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki explains that empathy has three components: emotional, cognitive, and compassionate concern. While empathy can lead to biased decisions, it is also fundamental to human connection, reducing stress and loneliness for the empathizer and improving outcomes for those around them. Zaki argues that empathy is not a fixed trait but a skill that can be developed, suggesting that practicing small acts of goodwill and approaching disagreements with humility can strengthen this 'empathy muscle.'</p>

          <p>The Conservative party has announced a plan to provide a £5,000 tax rebate to young people to help them buy their first home. The 'first-job bonus' would be funded by diverting National Insurance payments into a dedicated long-term savings account upon securing a first full-time job. Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride stated that the proposal would be paid for by significant cuts to public spending, totaling £47 billion over five years. These cuts would target areas such as the welfare bill, the civil service workforce, and the foreign aid budget, reflecting the party's focus on fiscal restraint.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has welcomed positive remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump regarding a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin about the New START nuclear arms treaty. Putin had offered to voluntarily extend the limits on deployed strategic nuclear weapons for one year, even though the treaty is set to expire in 2026. Trump commented that the proposal 'sounds like a good idea,' a statement a Kremlin spokesperson said gives 'grounds for optimism.' The New START treaty is the last remaining major arms control agreement between the world's two largest nuclear powers, Russia and the United States.</p>

          <p>A time capsule buried in 1966 by sixth-grade students at White Bluff Elementary School in Savannah, Georgia, is set to be opened in 2066. The capsule was recently rediscovered after a former student raised questions about its location. It contains 19 items selected by the students to represent their era, including a Barbie doll, Batman comics, and magazines, along with a recorded speech and letters to the future. The project was part of the school district's centennial celebration, and archived documents reveal the students' hopes that their world, though 'sometimes unsettled,' would offer a valuable message to the future.</p>

          <p>Approximately 29 million UK consumers who purchased Apple or Samsung smartphones could be entitled to a share of a £480 million payout if a lawsuit against chip manufacturer Qualcomm is successful. The consumer group Which? is accusing Qualcomm of anti-competitive practices, alleging the company used its market dominance to charge inflated prices for essential components, which were then passed on to consumers. The case, which is now at trial in London, claims these practices affected smartphones bought between 2015 and 2024. If successful, each affected consumer could receive an estimated £17 per device.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded $50 million in grants for autism research, including a $5.1 million grant to Cornell University, as part of its Autism Data Science Initiative. This funding aims to better understand treatment outcomes and improve future clinical studies. The initiative comes as the Trump administration has shown a controversial interest in the disorder, with the president and health secretary promoting unproven theories about its causes. While some autism experts are concerned about the administration's rhetoric, they are cautiously optimistic about the sophisticated, forward-looking research that the new NIH funding will support.</p>

          <p>Delegations from Israel and Hamas are set to begin indirect negotiations in Egypt, fueling cautious optimism for an end to the two-year war in Gaza. The talks will focus on a 20-point U.S. proposal that includes the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a phased Israeli troop withdrawal. While Hamas has partially agreed to the framework, it is seeking changes to the withdrawal plan and guarantees against future large-scale military operations. The international community is applying significant pressure for a deal, though major obstacles, including Hamas's disarmament, remain unresolved.</p>
