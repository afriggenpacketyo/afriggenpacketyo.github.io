          <p>China's economy experienced a 4.8% year-on-year growth in the third quarter of 2025, slightly exceeding expectations, yet decelerating from previous quarters. This brings the country closer to its annual GDP growth target of around 5%, despite increasing external uncertainties affecting the global economy. The National Bureau of Statistics reported that the economic growth for the first three quarters of the year reached 5.2%, indicating steady progress towards the set objective. Despite the slowdown from the previous quarters, the figures suggest that China's economy is showing resilience in the face of challenging global conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets showed positive movement as they opened on Monday, buoyed by China's decision to maintain its benchmark lending rates, aligning with market expectations. Anticipation surrounds upcoming economic data releases from China, with analysts projecting a third-quarter GDP growth of 4.8%, a slight dip from the previous quarter's 5.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both experienced increases, reflecting investor confidence in the region's economic outlook. This positive trend follows a strong performance in U.S. markets last Friday, where major averages closed higher amid easing trade talk tensions with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rodrigo Paz, a centrist candidate, has won the presidential election in Bolivia, marking the end of two decades of governance by the leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. The election took place amidst Bolivia's worst economic crisis in decades, characterized by a US dollar shortage and a devalued currency. Paz, along with his opponent Jorge Quiroga, promised to shift the country away from populist economic policies, focusing on fixing the exchange rate and attracting foreign investment. Paz's victory signals a potential shift in Bolivia's alliances, with both candidates expressing interest in strengthening relations with the United States.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles museum is displaying decommissioned Confederate monuments alongside contemporary art, aiming to reframe historical narratives. The exhibit, titled "Monuments," features melted-down bronze from a Robert E Lee statue and a graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Curator Hamza Walker emphasizes the racist ideologies of the Confederacy, contrasting them with President Trump's efforts to reinstall Confederate symbols. The exhibit seeks to challenge the "Lost Cause" ideology and promote a more inclusive understanding of American history, and it is meant to serve as a response to rising racism.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that using the phrase "I don't" instead of "I can't" can be more effective in setting boundaries at work and preventing burnout. Career coach Helen Tupper explains that "I can't" invites negotiation, while "I don't" is more definitive and harder to challenge. Model and TV chef Lorraine Pascale shared her experience of burnout, highlighting the importance of saying no to avoid overcommitment. Dr. Claire Ashley advises adjusting goals to current capacity and sticking to a firm routine to complete the stress cycle and enjoy time off, thus preventing burnout.</p>

          <p>Millions of Indians are celebrating Diwali, the festival of lights, marked by lamps, firecrackers, and traditional sweets. While the festival brings joy, it also exacerbates air pollution, particularly in northern India, prompting restrictions on firecrackers. The Supreme Court has permitted the sale and use of "green crackers" in Delhi to curb pollution, but their effectiveness is debated. Despite the concerns, Diwali is a time for families to clean and decorate their homes, shop for new clothes, and exchange gifts, and the markets bustle with shoppers, boosting the economy.</p>
