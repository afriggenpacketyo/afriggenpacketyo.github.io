          <p>London-based fintech company Checkout.com has announced a share buyback program for its employees, establishing a new internal valuation of $12 billion. This figure represents a significant decrease from its $40 billion valuation during a 2022 funding round, although it's slightly up from a reported internal markdown later that year. The move provides liquidity for staff as the company, a competitor to Stripe and Adyen, continues to grow, forecasting 30% revenue growth and $300 billion in annual payment volume. This trend of offering liquidity through share sales is becoming more common among large private tech firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several European Union member states are set to hold initial discussions on creating a comprehensive anti-drone defense system, dubbed a "drone wall." The talks, which include nations bordering Russia as well as Denmark and observer Ukraine, were prompted by recent Russian drone incursions into EU airspace. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has advocated for the initiative to counter the growing threat. Meanwhile, Ukrainian drone attacks continue to impact Russian infrastructure, with a recent strike causing a fire at the Afipsky oil refinery, further straining Russia's processing capacity.</p>

          <p>High-level officials from the United States and China have agreed to increase communication to better manage their strategic differences following a meeting in New York. Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu reiterated Beijing's stance on Taiwan as an internal affair, while U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau pressed for action on the fentanyl crisis. Both sides described the talks as "candid, in-depth and constructive," signaling a mutual desire to maintain dialogue and explore areas of cooperation. The meeting is seen as a preparatory step for a potential summit between Presidents Trump and Xi.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black will test Europe's ability to win on American soil for the first time since 2012, following a trend of home-team dominance in recent competitions. Key factors for victory will include securing a fast start in the opening foursomes, which has been decisive in the last five events. Europe will also need to manage the notoriously boisterous New York crowd and leverage its greater collective Ryder Cup experience against a U.S. team led by world number one Scottie Scheffler. The presence of President Donald Trump on Friday is also expected to add to the electric atmosphere of the event.</p>

          <p>During a farewell meeting for Beijing's outgoing envoy, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that maritime disputes should not define the entirety of the relationship between the two nations. Both sides agreed on the importance of not allowing the South China Sea issue to overshadow other areas of cooperation, such as trade and cultural exchange. The language used echoed a 2023 joint statement that emphasized managing differences and expanding mutually beneficial cooperation. This meeting signals a potential effort to de-escalate tensions and refocus on maintaining a more stable and multifaceted bilateral relationship despite ongoing territorial conflicts.</p>

          <p>England's Ellie Kildunne has become a star player at the Women's Rugby World Cup, known for her exceptional talent and charismatic personality. Her journey began unconventionally, playing on boys' teams and even inventing a club name to attend a regional trial after her local options for girls' rugby dwindled. Now a World Rugby Player of the Year, Kildunne's on-field flair is matched by her off-field passions, including fashion and photography, and she openly discusses how her ADHD diagnosis is a "superpower." Her popularity has struck a chord with fans, making her one of the most celebrated figures in the sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy giant BP, which was seen as a prime takeover target just months ago, has seen its stock rise over 32% since April, outperforming many rivals. This improved market sentiment has quieted speculation that competitors like Shell or Exxon Mobil might acquire the company. The turnaround is attributed to a strategic reset, new leadership, cost-cutting progress, and a series of recent successful oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized that the company is focused on its own growth strategy, which he believes is the key to driving shareholder value and securing its independent future.

          <p>Former Manchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney shared several amusing and strange anecdotes from his career playing in away matches. Speaking on his podcast, he recalled a flooded dressing room at Sunderland caused by leaking toilets from the floor above, which soiled players' clothes. He also described how Chelsea's dressing room was always too hot, while Liverpool's at Anfield was always freezing, speculating it might have been deliberate. Rooney also recounted an incident where a pre-game hotel stay was disrupted at midnight by a firework display on the roof that the team hadn't been warned about.</p>

          <p>Chinese toy company Pop Mart has stated it is pleased to see the secondary market prices for its viral Labubu monster toys decrease after a period of extreme speculation. At their peak, some editions were reselling for over 2,000% of their retail price, but prices have recently cratered as the company ramped up production to meet demand. Pop Mart said its goal is to make its art accessible to genuine fans, not to fuel a speculative bubble for profit-seekers. Analysts note that while the resale hype boosted the brand's visibility, a more stable market is healthier for building a long-term customer base.</p>

          <p>China has opened an international operations center in Shanghai to promote the global use of its central bank digital currency, the e-CNY. The People's Bank of China aims to establish the digital yuan as an alternative in the international financial system, which is currently dominated by the U.S. dollar. The center will focus on three platforms designed to improve the efficiency of cross-border transactions, enable on-chain payments, and help existing financial infrastructure integrate with blockchain technology. This move is part of China's broader strategy to reshape the global financial architecture and increase the international footprint of its currency. (not investment advice)</p>

Zelenskyy's five-year term officially would have ended in May 2024, but elections are suspended under the martial law imposed since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022.

He believes AI will have a profound global impact on everything from drug development to the job market. While acknowledging that parts of the market are currently "frothy" and overvalued due to short-term hype, he argues the long-term transformation is real.

The bridge, which spans a deep and narrow gorge known as the "Earth's crack," will also be the world's longest mountain bridge at 2,890 meters.
