          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour dates, including concerts scheduled up to early July 2026, after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition, exacerbated by recent performances, affects his hearing, vision, and balance. NPH is a brain condition involving a buildup of fluid around the brain, which can cause pressure on brain tissue, leading to thinking and walking difficulties. Joel's doctor advised him to refrain from performing while undergoing physical therapy, and fans who purchased tickets will be automatically refunded.</p>

          <p>Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer on the movie "Rust," has been released from prison on parole after serving 13 months for her involuntary manslaughter conviction in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Gutierrez-Reed was found guilty in March 2024 after a prop gun discharged live rounds, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. The Parole Board of the State of New Mexico granted her parole, which runs through May 2026, requiring her to adhere to conditions such as electronic monitoring and employment or school enrollment. Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter charge in the same incident was dismissed earlier this year.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a planned partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, projecting the creation of at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. This follows the Biden administration's earlier blocking of Nippon Steel's outright acquisition of U.S. Steel on national security grounds. The arrangement suggests an investment by Nippon rather than an acquisition, though the ownership structure remains unclear. Investors cheered the plan, with U.S. Steel shares jumping significantly. The United Steelworkers union expressed concerns about the impact on American jobs.</p>

          <p>A judge dismissed a petition for a temporary restraining order against a Maui anesthesiologist, Gerhardt Konig, accused of attempting to kill his wife on a Honolulu hiking trail. Konig's wife initially filed the petition, alleging he pushed her toward a cliff, attempted to inject her with a syringe, and hit her head with a rock. The attorney for Konig's wife stated that the restraining order was unnecessary because Konig was being held without bail during the criminal case. Konig pleaded not guilty to an attempted murder charge in April.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, ensuring U.S. Steel will remain in America and keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh.

The partnership is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. U.S. Steel praised Trump's leadership, stating the partnership will bring massive investment and new technologies, while Nippon Steel committed to protecting American workers and national security.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants in the United States, including small, advanced reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline its rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months. The administration also set a goal of quadrupling the nation's nuclear power capacity by 2050. Critics fear that pressure from the White House could cause the agency to take shortcuts on safety. One order calls for rebuilding U.S. supplies of enriched uranium and other nuclear fuels.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge overturned Donald Trump's executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm that employed an attorney who investigated him. The executive order had suspended security clearances for the firm's lawyers and restricted their access to government buildings. Trump accused the firm of undermining justice and the interests of the United States, specifically criticizing their hiring of Andrew Weissmann, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation. The judge ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <p>A federal judge halted the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts to block international students from attending Harvard University, granting a temporary restraining order. Harvard had sued the Trump administration, accusing it of a "campaign of retribution" and violating the university's First Amendment rights. The administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with demands for records of protest activity. The lawsuit argued that stopping the flow of international students would destabilize the school, as they contribute significantly to the university and its mission.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. NPH involves excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulation in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition is diagnosed through imaging and spinal taps, and treatment typically involves a surgery called ventricular shunting. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve symptoms, but the prognosis depends on the disease's stage and other health conditions.</p>
