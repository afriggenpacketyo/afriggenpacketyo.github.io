          <p>In a significant display of transatlantic solidarity, several key European leaders will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are among those attending. This collective presence is seen as an effort to bolster Ukraine's position and prevent a repeat of a previously contentious solo meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump. The united front aims to underscore Europe's unwavering support for Ukraine and influence potential peace negotiations with Russia.</p>

          <h2>German Coalition Government Divided on Reinstating Compulsory Military Service</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's ruling coalition is at odds over how to expand the Bundeswehr to meet NATO personnel targets, with a central debate over reinstating compulsory military service. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of the SPD has proposed a more attractive voluntary service model, which includes mandatory questionnaires and medical checks for young men. However, members of the CDU/CSU coalition partners argue this approach is insufficient given the current security climate and advocate for a quicker path to potential conscription. The disagreement highlights a fundamental split on security policy, balancing individual liberties against the need for a stronger national defense amid regional threats.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old California man, Ryan Wardwell, was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in Tulare County. While attempting to rappel down the Seven Teacups waterfalls, extreme water hydraulics forced him off his lines and into a secluded spot with no escape route. After he was reported missing, a search operation involving a drone located him, leading to a dramatic helicopter hoist rescue. Wardwell sustained only minor injuries and dehydration, and has since been reunited with his family in what authorities called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the cost of higher education at some private U.S. institutions approaches $100,000 per year, a small number of schools continue to offer a completely tuition-free experience for all admitted students. The list includes institutions like Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and all five U.S. military service academies. While these colleges eliminate the financial burden of tuition, they often have highly selective admissions standards and may require students to participate in work-study programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation. These unique models provide an alternative path to a degree for students concerned about affordability and debt.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to restart its flight operations after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which had stranded over 100,000 travelers. The federal jobs minister ordered the striking workers back to their posts and referred the labor dispute to the Canada Industrial Relations Board for binding arbitration. The airline anticipates a gradual return to its normal schedule over the next week to ten days, with some cancellations expected during this period. The core of the contract dispute revolves around pay and compensation for unpaid work, with the union arguing the airline's latest offer was insufficient.</p>

          <p>A unique visa program is enabling elderly Mexican citizens to temporarily visit their undocumented children in the United States, facilitating emotional reunions after decades of separation. The article highlights the story of José Antonio Rodríguez, who had not seen his parents in 24 years since leaving his home in Zacatecas to work in California. Organized by Mexican state officials and community associations, the program navigates complex immigration barriers to allow these brief but deeply meaningful family visits. These reunions offer a poignant glimpse into the lives of families divided by the border, marked by years of communication only through phone calls and letters.</p>

          <p>The NoMa neighborhood in Washington, D.C., once an industrial area known as "Swampoodle," has transformed into a prime example of the "Yes In My Back Yard" (YIMBY) urban development philosophy. Through strategic rezoning and development over the past two decades, the area north of Massachusetts Avenue has seen a significant increase in housing construction, particularly high-density residential buildings. This pro-growth approach stands in contrast to the often restrictive building policies found in many American cities. The article presents NoMa as a case study in how embracing development can lead to the creation of vibrant, dense urban neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker from Hong Kong, has been granted political asylum by the Australian government. Hui fled Hong Kong in 2020 after facing multiple criminal charges related to his involvement in the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was later targeted with a police bounty. In a social media post confirming his asylum status, Hui expressed gratitude to Australia but also conveyed the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return to his hometown. He urged the Australian government to continue advocating for other activists who remain imprisoned in Hong Kong for their political beliefs.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, has returned to the number one spot in the world rankings for the first time in four years after a 41-24 victory over Argentina. In their Rugby Championship opening match in Cordoba, the All Blacks established a strong first-half lead, with winger Sevu Reece scoring two tries. Argentina mounted a significant second-half comeback, narrowing the deficit to just seven points at one stage. However, two late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho secured the win for New Zealand, extending Argentina's winless home record against the All Blacks to 15 matches.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on how her appreciation for Renaissance art evolved from youthful indifference to a profound connection forged through life experience. Initially dismissing the art form as unrelatable religious iconography, she found new meaning in its depictions of complex human emotions after experiencing trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood. The author connects her journey to the work of contemporary artist Jenny Saville, whose motherhood paintings are heavily influenced by Renaissance masters like Michelangelo. The article posits that understanding the deep emotional resonance of such art often requires a maturity and perspective that only living through life's significant events can provide.</p>

          <p>Phoenix police captured a notorious cold-case killer through an undercover operation at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. Detectives arranged to meet with Bryan Patrick Miller, a person of interest in the 1990s "canal murders," under the guise of a casual conversation. The true purpose was to covertly collect his DNA from a drinking glass. Miller, known locally for dressing as a "Zombie Hunter" character, was not initially considered a strong suspect by the lead detective. However, eleven days later, the DNA from the glass provided a direct match to evidence found on the victims, leading to Miller's arrest, eventual conviction, and a death sentence.</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century painter Ilya Repin, with a focus on emphasizing the artist's "Russianness." The collection, on loan from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, is curated to highlight periods of Repin's life and work within the context of the Russian Empire. This cultural diplomacy event comes as Ukraine has also claimed Repin, who was born in present-day Ukraine, as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition's framing underscores the close cultural and political ties between Beijing and Moscow, using art to reinforce a specific national narrative amidst contemporary geopolitical tensions.</p>
