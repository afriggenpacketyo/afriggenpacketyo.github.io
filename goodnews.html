Meleana Estes, a lei maker who learned from her grandmother, emphasizes the intention and love put into each lei. However, the tradition faces challenges due to suburban sprawl and climate change, leading to increased flower imports. Andrew Mau, who owns a lei boutique, adapts by using alternative materials like unripe fruit and wood beads to create "forever leis" in response to the dwindling flower supply.</p>
