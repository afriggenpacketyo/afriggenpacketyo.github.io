          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests across seven counties in Southern California. The ruling responds to a lawsuit by advocacy groups alleging that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on race and denying detainees access to legal counsel. The order also mandates that a specific detention facility in Los Angeles provide lawyers with access to their clients seven days a week. This decision comes amid heightened tensions and fear within immigrant communities due to intensified enforcement actions in the region.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. This strategic move is not an acquisition of the company but rather a talent and technology licensing agreement, bolstering Google DeepMind's work on advanced AI coding agents. The deal underscores the intense competition for top AI talent among major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Windsurf, which specializes in AI tools for writing code, will continue to operate under a new interim CEO.</p>

          <p>With the patent for the popular weight-loss drug semaglutide (sold as Ozempic) expiring in China next year, dozens of local companies are developing rival medications. As many as 60 GLP-1 drugs, which regulate appetite and blood sugar, are currently in clinical trials in China, positioning the country to compete in the estimated $150 billion global market. The introduction of cheaper, generic versions is expected to significantly increase accessibility for patients who currently find the treatment unaffordable. This impending competition is set to drive down prices and challenge the market dominance of current manufacturers like Novo Nordisk.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to leading the Sinaloa Cartel and orchestrating large-scale drug trafficking operations. He admitted to coordinating shipments of fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine into the United States and using violence to protect the cartel's empire. As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez will forfeit $80 million. The guilty plea is highlighted by U.S. authorities as a significant victory in their efforts to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and combat the fentanyl epidemic plaguing American communities.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent slowdown in cargo movement due to rising global trade tariffs, the Port of Long Beach has commenced a major $365 million expansion project. The plan involves adding 19 acres of new land and extending a quay to accommodate larger ships, which is expected to boost cargo-handling capacity by 50%. Officials expressed confidence in the long-term demand for larger vessel capacity, framing the investment as a crucial step to strengthen America's supply chain. The project moves forward even as both the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles have reported significant drops in container volume and exports.</p>

          <p>Narciso Barranco, an undocumented immigrant and father of three U.S. Marines, is scheduled to be released on bond after being held in federal custody for 20 days.

An immigration judge ordered his release on a $3,000 bond, and he will be free pending a hearing to adjust his status through parole-in-place, a program for military families. His family expressed relief and plans to seek immediate medical attention for injuries they believe he sustained during the arrest.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, both competing for their first title at the tournament. Swiatek, the world number one, brings experience but has historically been less comfortable on grass, while Anisimova plays with an aggressive, free-swinging style that could make her dangerous as the underdog. The outcome will likely depend on which player better manages the pressure of the occasion. Analysts note that Swiatek has adapted her game by playing further behind the baseline, a tactic that will be tested against Anisimova's powerful backhand.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine of "Australia first," seeking to navigate the growing tensions between the United States and China. In a recent speech, Albanese invoked the legacy of wartime leader John Curtin, who prioritized Australia's strategic reality over traditional alliances. While reaffirming the country's commitment to the AUKUS security pact and its alliance with the U.S., the prime minister is signaling a recalibration of relationships to assert Australia's own interests and sovereignty. This strategic shift comes as his government prepares for a state visit to Beijing.</p>

In just a few years, Viraj progressed from basic math to calculus, achieved a near-perfect ACT score, and graduated high school.

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has rejected TikTok's attempt to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, which accuses the social media platform of using manipulative and addictive design features to exploit young users. The lawsuit alleges that TikTok is intentionally designed to keep children engaged for longer periods, increasing their exposure to ads and prompting in-app purchases. The judge ruled the state's claims were specific enough to proceed, marking a significant step in holding the company accountable for practices that allegedly put children at risk. TikTok maintains that the suit's claims are outdated and that it provides robust safety protections.</p>
