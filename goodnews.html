          <h2>US Federal Reserve Maintains Interest Rates Amid Political Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 14:56:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has opted to maintain its benchmark interest rate, continuing a cautious strategy amid ongoing economic uncertainties, particularly those stemming from tariff policies. This decision comes despite significant public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has advocated for a rate cut to stimulate economic growth. The Federal Open Market Committee's vote was not unanimous, with two Trump-appointed governors dissenting in favor of a rate reduction, a rare public division. The Fed signaled it will continue to closely monitor inflation and incoming economic data before considering future adjustments to its monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 14:56:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields climbed after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold its current interest rates, a decision largely anticipated by financial markets. The central bank's stance, influenced by concerns that tariffs could fuel inflation, was articulated by Chair Jerome Powell. This policy decision prompted a discernible market reaction, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising by five basis points as investors adjusted to the Fed's outlook. The stability in rates was further supported by a government report released the same day, which showed that U.S. economic growth in the second quarter was stronger than economists had initially forecast.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 14:26:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The beverage company High Noon has issued a recall for some of its vodka seltzer variety packs because the cans were mistakenly labeled as non-alcoholic Celsius energy drinks. Announced through the FDA, the recall addresses the potential for unintended alcohol consumption by consumers. The affected packages contain cans that look like "CELSIUS® ASTRO VIBE™ Energy Drink" but are filled with alcoholic seltzer and can be identified by their silver lids instead of the usual black ones. The products were distributed to several states, and consumers are advised to dispose of the mislabeled cans and contact the company to receive a refund.</p>

          <p>Legislation aimed at banning members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks has successfully advanced out of a key Senate committee with bipartisan support. In an 8-7 vote, Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all committee Democrats to approve the measure, known as the PELOSI Act, for a potential vote by the full Senate. The bill would mandate that lawmakers divest their individual stock holdings and certify their compliance annually. The hearing exposed a divide among Republicans, with some defending the practice while Hawley argued that stricter ethics rules are essential for maintaining public trust in government.</p>

          <p>A new four-person crew is preparing to launch to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon, a mission that highlights the resilience of the space program. The flight's commander, Zena Cardman, was reassigned to this mission after significant technical issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft disrupted the original flight schedule. Her previous mission was altered to accommodate the return of Starliner astronauts whose own stay on the ISS was extended due to those problems. This Crew 11 mission also features a veteran astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut, demonstrating continued international cooperation and problem-solving in orbit.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at record highs, this article details the criteria for qualifying for debt forgiveness programs, which can substantially reduce a borrower's outstanding balance. The strongest candidates are typically those experiencing verifiable financial hardship, such as a job loss or significant medical bills. Individuals carrying large amounts of unsecured debt, often $10,000 or more, are also more likely to be considered, as creditors may prefer a partial recovery over a total loss in a bankruptcy scenario. Furthermore, borrowers who have already defaulted on payments often have more negotiating leverage. The article also outlines alternative options for those who do not qualify.

          <p>A recent deep-sea voyage in the Pacific Ocean has revealed vast, thriving communities of tubeworms and mollusks at depths exceeding 31,000 feet, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of complex life. These ecosystems, discovered in the Kuril–Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches, are believed to survive through chemosynthesis, where microbes convert chemical compounds from the trench itself into energy, forming the base of a unique food web. This process is distinct from life in shallower waters, which relies on sunlight or nutrients trickling down. The discovery suggests such deep-sea oases may be more widespread than previously known, opening new frontiers for scientific research.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged will continue to impact household finances, keeping borrowing costs elevated for the near future. This stability directly affects variable-rate products, with average credit card APRs remaining near 20% and rates for home equity lines of credit staying high. While not directly tied to the Fed's rate, fixed-rate mortgages have also remained in a high range due to broader economic uncertainty. Conversely, the high-rate environment continues to benefit savers, who can find high-yield savings accounts offering returns above 4%, providing an advantage against inflation.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has confirmed it will maintain access to critical weather data from a U.S. military satellite program, reversing a decision that had alarmed meteorologists. This data, from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, is essential for accurately forecasting storms and hurricanes. The Department of Defense had previously suggested cutting off access due to cybersecurity concerns, a move that could have severely compromised forecast models just before a predicted active hurricane season. The last-minute reversal averts a potential crisis, ensuring that forecasters retain this vital tool for protecting public safety.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has detailed his strategic vision for artificial intelligence, emphasizing the creation of "personal superintelligence" designed for individual empowerment rather than large-scale automation. This philosophy was shared just before an earnings report and follows Meta's multi-billion dollar investment in AI talent and a new research lab. In a public letter, Zuckerberg distinguished his approach from competitors who he claims are focused on replacing human labor. This massive investment in AI is reminiscent of Meta's expensive, long-term bet on the metaverse, a strategy that has faced considerable scrutiny from Wall Street investors.</p>

The project was inspired by O'Donnell's own discoveries during research, such as learning about Mary Katharine Goddard, the female printer whose name is on the Declaration of Independence. The book will chronicle the contributions of revolutionary women from 1776 to today, including figures like Katharine Wright and Emily Warren Roebling. Timed for release before America's 250th anniversary, the book is described as a passion project to fill a significant gap in historical education.</p>

Company executives highlighted that customer traffic improved sequentially each month during the quarter, with significant growth observed among non-rewards members for the first time in years. Analysts are optimistic about CEO Brian Niccol's report that the recovery is ahead of schedule, pointing to new service programs and upcoming menu innovations.
