          <p>Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, a surprising upset for the 33-year-old Democratic Socialist. Mamdani, a relatively unknown figure outside his Queens district, defeated a prominent name in New York politics. The official confirmation is pending until mid-July, but the implications for the city and the Democratic Party are already under debate. This win signals a potential shift in the political landscape, reflecting the growing influence of progressive voices in local elections. Optimism surrounds the potential for new leadership and policy directions. </p>

Speaking at a NATO summit in The Hague, Trump stated that a formal agreement with Iran may not be necessary because Iranian nuclear sites were destroyed. He emphasized that the U.S. is primarily concerned with preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, asserting that their enrichment efforts have been set back by decades. The president also expressed optimism regarding progress in Gaza, attributing it to the recent U.S. strikes. </p>

          <p>The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, designed to provide safe passage for wildlife over the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills, is entering its second and final phase. This phase involves constructing connectors that will allow wildlife to easily cross between the Santa Susana Mountains and the Santa Monica Mountains. Work includes burying overhead wires, moving water lines, stabilizing an underground creek, and building a tunnel over Agoura Road. The project, aimed at improving genetic diversity and safety for local wildlife, is expected to be completed by the end of 2026, with partial road closures anticipated in August. </p>

Netanyahu has successfully recruited the U.S. to join the strikes, benefiting from a shift in Israeli thinking and a focus on Iran. Painting Iran as Israel's arch-enemy has also helped Netanyahu distract from domestic political issues and the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians. Despite a spat with Trump over a late-night attack, Netanyahu is touting the strikes as a major achievement. </p>
