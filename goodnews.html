          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after finishing as runner-up the previous year. Zaki nearly faltered when he began spelling "commelina" incorrectly, but he recovered and ultimately won by correctly spelling "eclaircissement." The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and Zaki may be remembered for a word he got wrong as much as the one he got right. Zaki, who plans to donate a large portion of his winnings to charity, expressed that he decided to have fun with this bee, which led to his success.</p>

          <p>China's power grid has implemented a quantum-powered safeguard called a "diamond ring" to prevent catastrophic collapses by detecting grid instability in real-time with high precision. Designed by the University of Science and Technology of China in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, this toroidal device embeds nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors. The urgency for this system was highlighted after sweeping outages in Spain, Portugal, and France, as well as instability in China's Xinjiang region due to renewable energy fluctuations. As renewables increasingly dominate energy transitions, this system aims to address the challenge of weather-dependent unpredictability straining traditional monitoring systems.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the U.S. should maintain a tough stance on tariffs with the European Union to address the trade imbalance. The author suggests that Europe has historically engaged in protectionism, disadvantaging American products. The piece claims that the U.S. trade deficit with the EU has ballooned, necessitating a firm approach to negotiations. It concludes that the EU needs to offer significant concessions on trade to reflect the security guarantee provided by the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion essay explores the increasing trend of millennials and Gen Z choosing to be childless, citing reasons such as financial concerns, career priorities, and climate change fears. The essay suggests that a redefined understanding of ‚Äúharm,‚Äù ‚Äúabuse,‚Äù and ‚Äútrauma‚Äù has led to a new standard for parenting. This cultural shift has contributed to a nearly impossible standard for parents, who are now expected to ensure their children's mental health and career success well into adulthood. The author posits that this pressure contributes to the decision to forgo parenthood.</p>

          <p>Valerie, a mini dachshund, has returned home after surviving 529 days alone in the Australian bush, after running away during a camping trip in November 2023. Despite being microchipped and having an AirTag, the remote location made it difficult to track her. After months of searching, a farmer's photo led to her rescue by Kangala Wildlife Rescue, who used traps to capture her. Valerie has since settled back into her home, and her owners hope her story provides hope to others facing challenges.</p>

While some experts believe AI could eventually replace coders, others see it as a tool to enhance productivity and explore new ideas.</p>

          <p>Gold prices edged lower on Friday, on track for a nearly 2% weekly decline, as traders positioned themselves ahead of a closely watched US inflation report. The move came as investors awaited the release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred measure of inflation. Technical dynamics also contributed to the pullback, with the price action in gold failing to break above the key near-term resistance level of $3,328. The broader investment case for gold remains intact, boosted by renewed uncertainty over Donald Trump‚Äôs trade agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to increase rice exports in response to an expected long-term decline in domestic consumption. The annual white paper on food and agriculture for fiscal 2024 recommends exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production. China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have been identified as target markets. The government aims to boost rice exports nearly eightfold to 353,000 tons in 2030 from 2024, by increasing acreage managed by export-focused farmers and reducing production costs to better compete with foreign-grown rice.

          <p>The German central bank, the Bundesbank, expects inflation to stay on target at around 2%. In April, the annual inflation rate fell to 2.1%, the lowest rate since October, largely due to cheaper energy compared to the previous year. Since oil prices have remained low, no major change is expected for May's annual inflation rate. The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) is expected to publish its initial date on the May inflation rate at 2 p.m. Berlin time (1200 GMT). (not investment advice)</p>
