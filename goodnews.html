          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland halted hard-right breakthroughs, but discontent with mainstream parties persists. In Romania, centrist mayor Nicusor Dan defeated hard-line nationalist George Simion, while in Poland, liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski secured a spot in a runoff against nationalist Karol Nawrocki. The Polish vote saw a strong showing from hard-right candidates, including anti-Semite Grzegorz Braun, indicating a fragmented political landscape. Both Romania and Poland are moving away from the traditional duopoly of established parties.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting EU leaders in London to deepen defense and trade ties, aiming for a level of cooperation not seen since Brexit. Agreements have been reached on fisheries, trade, and security, with Starmer's office stating the goal is to slash red tape and grow the British economy. The agreement on fisheries allows EU fishermen access to British waters for an extended period in exchange for the EU easing red tape on food and drink imports and exports.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is banking on the public being tired of the Brexit debate as he navigates the UK's relationship with the EU. While the Conservatives have criticized the deal as "surrender," Reform UK is making a similar argument. Starmer's government believes that the public wants a smoother relationship with the EU within the existing parameters, and sees this deal as pragmatic common sense. The significance of this deal will depend on whether opposition parties choose to campaign on the issue.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government is proposing new rules to regulate the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector, aiming to protect shoppers from debt traps and provide certainty for the industry. The new regulations will require BNPL firms to conduct upfront checks to ensure people can repay what they borrow and make it easier for customers to access refunds.

          <p>China is intensifying its government austerity drive with new rules targeting white elephant projects, official vehicles, lavish meals, and meeting venue decor. The latest regulations, issued by the Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council, urge officials to practice diligence and thrift and oppose extravagance and waste. Analysts say this move reflects Beijing‚Äôs growing anxiety over mounting debts and aims to curb wasteful spending at various levels of government.</p>
