          <p>Manchester United has confirmed the departures of two of its forwards, with Rasmus Hojlund joining Italian champions Napoli on a season-long loan and Antony completing a permanent move to Real Betis. Hojlund's deal includes an obligation for a permanent £38 million transfer next summer. Antony joins the La Liga club for a fee of £21.65 million after a successful loan spell last season. Both players, who were expensive signings for United, struggled to make a significant impact at Old Trafford and were deemed surplus to requirements under the team's new management.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that he is "very encouraging" of people flying national flags like the Union Jack and St. George's Cross, viewing them as symbols of patriotism. However, he cautioned that their value can be diminished when they are used for purely divisive purposes, particularly in the context of recent protests surrounding asylum hotels. The Prime Minister's comments come as several local councils have begun removing flags from public infrastructure due to safety concerns, sparking a debate about national pride and political expression. Starmer affirmed his support for flags as a great symbol of the nation.</p>

          <p>Claims circulating on social media that former first lady Melania Trump worked as an escort and met Donald Trump at a party hosted by Ghislaine Maxwell are unfounded. These allegations originated from a 2016 tabloid article and have been repeatedly spread online. In reality, Melania Trump successfully sued the publications that made the escort claim for defamation, resulting in retractions and damage payments. Furthermore, multiple credible sources confirm that the Trumps were introduced by former modeling agent Paolo Zampolli at a party he hosted, not by Maxwell, rendering the widely shared copypasta false.</p>

Despite the continuity, Donald warned against expecting a "rinse and repeat" strategy, emphasizing that playing away from home presents a different challenge that will require new pairings and tactics.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scientific study from the University of Montpellier has revealed a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domesticated animals, beginning in the Middle Ages. Researchers analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones found that while both groups previously followed similar size cycles, a shift occurred around 1000 AD. Wild species like foxes and deer began to shrink due to habitat loss and intensified hunting. In contrast, domesticated animals such as sheep, cattle, and chickens grew larger as humans exerted more control through selective breeding and specialized management, highlighting humanity's profound and lasting impact on the natural world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's nationalized rail operator, has officially scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for traveling during traditional rush hours. The move is intended to encourage more people to use the train service, as post-pandemic travel patterns have left more capacity available on commuter trains. While passengers welcome the cheaper tickets, the initiative has sparked a debate on whether a similar policy could work in the rest of the UK. Experts are divided, with some warning it could lead to overcrowding on busy routes or potentially higher overall ticket prices to offset the lost revenue.</p>
