          <p>eToro, an Israel-based stock brokerage platform, experienced a 40% surge in its stock price during its Nasdaq debut after raising nearly $310 million in its IPO. The company sold almost 6 million shares at $52 each, exceeding the expected range of $46 to $50, resulting in a market capitalization of $5.6 billion. Wall Street is closely watching eToro as a potential indicator of renewed interest in IPOs, especially after previous delays due to tariff concerns. Other fintech companies like Chime and Hinge Health are also testing the IPO market, indicating a possible resurgence in initial public offerings.</p>

          <p>David Mauro, a small business owner of Jesusdoll.com, expressed relief that the U.S. and China reached an agreement to temporarily lower tariffs, which he hopes will ensure he has toys for the Christmas season.

The tariffs have been lowered to 30% for 90 days, meaning there's going to be a Christmas this year. Mauro is importing about $100,000 worth of dolls, and hopes they will arrive within the 90-day period during which the tariff rate is slated to be reduced.</p>
