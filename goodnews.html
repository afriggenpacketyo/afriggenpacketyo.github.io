          <p>Child and baby nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed provides five expert tips to help parents manage common fussy eating habits, which affect over half of children at some point in their development.

Other practical suggestions include being mindful of a child's natural appetite fluctuations and actively involving them in food preparation. This article emphasizes that fussy eating is a normal developmental phase and offers supportive, actionable strategies for fostering healthier eating habits and reducing mealtime stress.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, 'Play,' marks a conscious return to more joyful and vibrant themes after two commercially subdued and introspective records. The article notes his deliberate effort to infuse Asian and Middle Eastern musical flavors, featuring instruments like the sitar and tabla, and collaborations with artists such as Indian superstar Arijit Singh. While praised for its global influences and personal reflections on past struggles, the review suggests the album doesn't always fully commit to its adventurous spirit, often reverting to familiar pop structures. This article provides a critical analysis of the pop star's latest musical offering and its attempt to reclaim his mainstream appeal while exploring new creative territories.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has issued a landmark ruling, declaring that men can legally adopt their wives' family names, thereby overturning an apartheid-era law that only permitted women to change their surnames upon marriage. The court deemed the existing legislation discriminatory on the grounds of gender and characterized it as a "colonial import," noting that many African cultures traditionally allowed women to retain their birth names. This significant decision, which grants the government two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act, was met with mixed reactions, with some celebrating it as a progressive step for gender equality and a move towards decolonizing legal frameworks.</p>

          <p>China's US$12 trillion equity market is currently experiencing stunning gains, a bull run that is testing regulators' ability to guide its ascent towards Beijing's long-standing goal of positioning it as a steady source of household income. The government aims to shift household wealth away from the volatile property market and boost slumping consumer spending, seeking to cultivate a measured yet sustainable bull market akin to those seen in India or Japan. While recent moderation in gains reduces immediate volatility risks, authorities face the delicate challenge of fostering growth while preventing the wild booms and busts that characterized past decades.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed a staunchly bullish outlook for the market, vigorously arguing against what he termed "cynics" after major indexes reached new record highs. He attributed the market's current strength to a series of positive events and softer economic data, which could pave the way for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Despite acknowledging a "fraught backdrop" of national debt and geopolitical tensions, Cramer believes individual stocks can continue to thrive, pointing to a booming IPO market and significant rallies in certain companies. He suggested that bearish money managers risk losing investors if they do not adapt to the current bull market and become buyers soon. (not investment advice)</p>
