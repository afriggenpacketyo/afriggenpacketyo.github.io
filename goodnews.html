          <p>Apple has launched its new iPhone 17 worldwide, with significant attention on its performance in the competitive Chinese market against local rivals like Huawei. While the launch drew long lines of customers, the company faces pressure to demonstrate its progress in artificial intelligence after a previously underwhelming rollout. Initial preorder data from China appears positive, suggesting strong demand for the new models despite Apple's recent market share decline in the region, which could reassure investors.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2011, the total number of refugees living in Germany has decreased, dropping by approximately 50,000 in the first half of 2025. Government statistics show the population fell from 3.55 million to 3.50 million, a change attributed to a combination of deportations, voluntary departures, and naturalizations. The Left Party, which publicized the data, noted that the decline may also reflect stricter EU border policies making it harder for those in need of protection to enter.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has decided to keep its policy interest rate steady at 0.5%, a move that was widely expected by economists. The decision comes as Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% in August, its lowest level since November 2024 and the third consecutive monthly decline. While headline inflation remains above the bank's 2% target, the slowing trend supports the BOJ's cautious approach to monetary policy, prioritizing stability amid global economic uncertainty.
