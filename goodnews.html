        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka narrowly avoided a significant upset at Wimbledon, fighting back from a set down to defeat 37-year-old German veteran Laura Siegemund. Sabalenka struggled against Siegemund's unconventional and disruptive style, which included slices and slow-paced play, losing the first set 4-6. Despite visible frustration, the title favorite managed to regain her composure, clinching the next two sets 6-2, 6-4 to secure her spot in the semi-finals. The hard-fought victory, lasting nearly three hours, keeps Sabalenka's hopes alive for her first Wimbledon title, where she will now face American Amanda Anisimova.</p>

          <p>An activist group, the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, has successfully identified the 140th "stolen grandchild" from Argentina's brutal 1976-1983 military dictatorship. The 48-year-old man was born in a clandestine detention center to activist parents, Graciela Alicia Romero and Raul Eugenio Metz, who were arrested and never seen again. His identity was confirmed through DNA testing after an anonymous tip, allowing him to connect with his older sister, who was raised by their grandparents. The discovery highlights the ongoing, decades-long effort to reunite families and find the estimated 500 infants taken from their imprisoned mothers during the "dirty war."</p>

          <h2>"Revenge Saving" Trend Emerges as Economic Anxiety Shifts Consumer Habits</h2>

          <p>A new trend dubbed "revenge saving" is taking hold as economic anxieties cause many Americans, particularly younger generations, to shift from post-pandemic splurging to more aggressive saving. A survey by Intuit Credit Karma found that 44% of Americans have adjusted their financial habits based on their "vibe" about the economy, with many feeling more anxious than a year ago. Financial experts advise that while saving is positive, it should be intentional rather than purely emotional. They recommend strategies like "reverse budgeting," where savings goals are prioritized first, and using separate, appropriate accounts for different goals like emergencies and retirement to build financial security effectively.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Increases Price Target for GE Vernova, Citing Strong Revenue Visibility</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>GE Vernova's stock received a vote of confidence as BMO Capital raised its price target, suggesting the company's recent rally has further potential. The analysts highlighted the company's nearly $80 billion in incremental service-related revenue, which they believe is insulated from potential downturns in new turbine equipment demand. This outlook counters the idea that investors may have already missed the opportunity for gains. The analysis also suggests that potential new overseas orders and favorable accounting changes in the new U.S. budget bill could further bolster the company's growth and investment in domestic production capacity.

          <p>A new provision in the latest U.S. budget bill establishes "Trump accounts," a type of government-supported investment vehicle for children. For U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028, the government will provide an initial $1,000 deposit, with parents and employers able to contribute additional funds annually. The money grows tax-deferred in a diversified stock index fund and can be withdrawn for specific purposes like higher education or a first home purchase after the child turns 18. While financial experts see the initial government contribution as "free money," they note that existing options like 529 plans or Roth IRAs may offer better tax advantages for specific goals.

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, conspiracy theories blaming "cloud seeding" for the disaster have spread online, amplified by some political figures. The theory suggests that weather modification operations caused or exacerbated the rainfall. However, meteorological experts and scientists have unequivocally debunked this claim, stating it is physically impossible for cloud seeding to create a storm system of that magnitude. Experts explain that cloud seeding can only slightly enhance rainfall in existing clouds and cannot generate the trillions of gallons of water seen in the floods. Any particles from recent operations would have dispersed long before the storm hit.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz has advanced to his first-ever Wimbledon semi-final after a hard-fought victory over Russia's Karen Khachanov. After comfortably winning the first two sets, Fritz experienced a significant dip in the third and went down a break in the fourth, but he managed to rally and regain his focus. The No. 5 seed overcame the momentum shift and a faulty electronic line-call to win the match in a fourth-set tie-break. This marks a significant career milestone for Fritz, who has now reached the semi-finals of a Grand Slam and will face either Carlos Alcaraz or Cameron Norrie next.</p>
