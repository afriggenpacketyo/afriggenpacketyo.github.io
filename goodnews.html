          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the choice between peace and war during a military parade commemorating the end of World War II, attended by leaders including Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un. The parade showcased China's military strength and global influence, with Xi subtly criticizing President Trump's approach to international relations. Trump responded by accusing Xi, Putin, and Kim of conspiring against the U.S., highlighting the growing tensions between these global powers. The event underscores China's ambition to play a more prominent role in the international order, offering an alternative to the U.S.-led system. The author's tone is neutral, providing an objective account of the events and statements made by the involved leaders. The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher, reversing the previous session's negative sentiment driven by fiscal concerns in major European economies. Bond yields have been rising globally due to worries over President Trump's trade tariffs, impacting both the U.K. and France. In the U.K., the 30-year bond yield reached its highest level since 1998 ahead of a contentious Autumn Budget, while France's yield hit its highest since 2009 before a no-confidence vote. Investors are also monitoring earnings reports from Swiss Life Holding and Helvetia Holding, as well as Turkish inflation data. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>The US Open 2025 has ignited discussions on tennis etiquette, fueled by the intense New York atmosphere and high stakes. Contentious incidents involving net cords, underarm serves, and body shots have sparked arguments among players and fans. Some players, particularly those schooled in the U.S. college system, find a lack of apologies for net cords acceptable, while others consider it rude. The use of underarm serves, seen by some as a legitimate tactic and by others as disrespectful, has also drawn criticism. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 01:10:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that President Trump cannot use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of individuals accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The court agreed with immigrant rights lawyers that the act was not intended for use against gangs during peacetime. The ruling blocks a signature administration push and is likely headed to the Supreme Court. The court found no "invasion or predatory incursion" that would justify using the act, while a dissenting judge argued the court was overstepping its bounds. The optimism score is 65.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An appeals court has rejected President Trump's attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants deemed 'alien enemies.' The court sided with previous rulings that Trump's declaration of an invasion or incursion was unfounded, emphasizing that other laws provide deportation power. The Trump administration invoked the Act in March, alleging that Nicolas Maduro deployed members of Tren de Aragua to destabilize the U.S., leading to deportations. The Supreme Court has previously intervened, and the Trump administration can appeal the ruling. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's deployment of National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles was illegal. The judge stated that the Trump administration used armed soldiers and military vehicles for civilian law enforcement activities, violating a law from 1878. The deployment occurred after protests against immigration raids turned confrontational, with Trump describing LA as an "invaded" and "occupied city." The ruling is a setback to Trump's ambition to federalize Democrat-run cities and deploy the National Guard in other states. The optimism score is 55.</p>
