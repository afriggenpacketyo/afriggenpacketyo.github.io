          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, rallying support for the progressive nominee. Sanders highlighted Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a "test case" against oligarchic influence, criticizing mainstream Democrats for their muted support. Mamdani condemned CUNY's dismissal of anti-war professors and vowed to fight capitalistic greed, proposing rent freezes and tax increases for the wealthy. The event underscored a broader struggle for the Democratic Party's future and immigrant rights, with Mamdani promising increased legal aid for detained New Yorkers.</p>

A lucky winner could choose an estimated cash value of $826.4 million before taxes, or an annuitized prize with increasing annual payments. This drawing marked the 42nd since the last jackpot win in May, tying a game record for consecutive drawings without a top prize.

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots using the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that then collapse, releasing a powerful force. This allows for jumpers to be launched 1.5 meters into the air and can also be controlled for swimming, demonstrating the versatility of the approach. Published in the journal Science, this study showcases cavitation as an efficient launching mechanism, opening new possibilities for robotics and micro-device applications.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S., including Yonkers Middle High School in New York, are implementing Yondr locked magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms. This solution, adopted by at least 2.5 million students in 35 states, aims to reduce distractions and foster better engagement. While some students welcome the change, others seek ways to bypass the system. Educators, like Yonkers principal Dr. Sandy Hattar, report positive initial results, including more student interaction. The $25-30 per pouch cost has sparked budget debates, but proponents emphasize the goal of creating a more focused learning environment.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin served as a significant diplomatic platform for China to assert its vision for a multipolar global order. President Xi Jinping utilized the forum to position Beijing as a reliable alternative for global governance, especially amidst perceived US credibility issues under President Trump. The summit notably featured "bonhomie" between leaders of China, Russia, and India, signaling a united front against Washington's influence. The SCO, a Eurasian institution, prioritizes counter-terrorism and economic integration, including China's Belt and Road Initiative.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing her autumn Budget, influenced by recent cabinet reshuffles and global market volatility. Despite a week of political turbulence and initial bond market fragility, Reeves' position remains secure. She dismissed concerns of a UK-specific economic crisis, attributing bond market movements to global trends. The article suggests that the market rollercoaster will likely push the Chancellor towards higher taxes or lower spending to address any fiscal gap, rather than increasing debt. The Office for Budget Responsibility's judgment on UK productivity will be crucial in shaping the final Budget decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
