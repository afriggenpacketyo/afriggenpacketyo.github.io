        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent European Central Bank report indicates that gold has become the second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, surpassing the euro, due to increased demand from central banks seeking to hedge against inflation and diversify their holdings. Central banks' gold stockpiles are nearing levels seen in the 1950s and 1960s, driven by concerns about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies. While China, India, and Turkey have been leading buyers, there are signs that the rate of central bank gold purchases may slow down in the coming months. Despite this potential slowdown, analysts advise investors to maintain portfolio diversification and hold sufficient exposure to gold and hedge funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Malawi prepares for elections in September, young candidates are pushing for greater political inclusion, facing challenges such as entrenched party structures and financial barriers. A recent constituency re-demarcation has sparked interest among youth to join politics amid unemployment and the cost of living crisis. While some young entrants have launched their careers, others find that older leaders still heavily influence candidate selection within parties. Analysts emphasize that youth entering politics need solid strategies and resilience, while parties should create fair competition through transparent procedures for primaries. The article highlights the structural exclusion of young people due to the absence of youth-inclusive policies, high election costs, and societal resistance to youthful political actors.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a post-Brexit deal regarding Gibraltar's status, aimed at avoiding checks on people and goods crossing the Gibraltar-Spain border. The agreement establishes a system where passport checks are carried out by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the process at London's St Pancras station for Eurostar passengers. Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, has been a point of contention between the UK and Spain, with Spain disputing the UK's sovereignty since 1713. The deal addresses concerns about potential delays at the border due to the EU's upcoming Entry/Exit system, ensuring that residents can continue to cross using residence cards or government ID cards.</p>

This allows the AI to learn, plan, and make decisions in a more human-like manner, such as recognizing that a ball rolling off a table will fall.

          <p>U.S. inflation edged up to 2.4% in May compared to a year ago, according to the latest official figures, but the impact of President Donald Trump's new tariffs on consumers remains relatively muted. Prices of items like toys, car parts, and major appliances increased, but declines in petrol, airfares, and clothing offset these rises. Economists are closely monitoring the report to see how Trump's decision to raise taxes on imports affects the economy. While the White House maintains that companies in other countries will bear the costs, analysts expect it will take time for the tariffs to fully impact consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new tyrannosauroid species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, which lived over 85 million years ago and represents a "missing link" between smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids and larger apex predators like the Tyrannosaurus rex. The Khankhuuluu skeleton, discovered in Mongolia in the 1970s, was initially misidentified but later recognized as a distinct species with features not seen in more iconic tyrannosaurs. This mid-grade tyrannosauroid, weighing around 1,700 pounds, was one of the larger predators of its time and lacked the bone-crushing teeth characteristic of the T. rex. The identification has led to a rewriting of the tyrannosaur family history, showing that these Asian tyrannosauroids eventually migrated to North America and evolved into apex predators.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in May rose 2.4% on an annual basis, slightly less than expected, indicating that President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted prices on everyday items. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, increased by 2.8% over the past 12 months. The inflation rate likely rose less than expected due to a sharp decline in gasoline prices, offsetting price hikes in grocery items and housing costs. Economists expect the Federal Reserve to hold off on cutting rates until later this year, with the impact of tariffs potentially showing up in the CPI data later this summer.

Tusk's coalition has sought to reverse judicial reforms from the previous government, but the outgoing President Andrzej Duda blocked those efforts.

          <h2>Homeowners Regret Buying Due to Maintenance Costs and Hidden Fees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 10:08:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals that 45% of American homeowners have regrets about buying their current home, with the most common complaint being frustration over maintenance costs and hidden fees. A typical homeowner spends over $18,000 annually on non-mortgage home expenses, which can reach around $29,000 in states like Hawaii and California. These charges, such as internet bills, property taxes, and maintenance, are often overlooked during the purchase but can pose a significant financial burden. Experts advise factoring ongoing homeownership costs into the budget and offer to avoid surprise costs and potential debt.</p>

          <h2>Spacecraft Captures First Images of Sun's South Pole</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 10:00:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spacecraft has sent back the first-ever video and images of the Sun's south pole, enabling scientists to study the Sun's cycle between stormy and quiet periods. These images will help understand how solar activity affects satellite communication and power grids on Earth. The new images reveal a shimmering bright atmosphere with temperatures reaching a million degrees Celsius, interspersed with cooler gas clouds. The goal is to develop computer models for predicting space weather and better prepare for intense solar storms.</p>
