          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge hit his 358th career home run, placing him in a tie with the legendary Yogi Berra for fifth on the team's all-time list. The milestone occurred during a game against the Chicago White Sox, where Judge hit the home run in his first at-bat. He is now approaching Joe DiMaggio, who is fourth on the list with 361 home runs. Despite Judge's historic achievement, the Yankees lost the game 3-2, though they remain in a competitive position for a postseason wild card spot as the season enters its final month.</p>

          <p>In his weekly review of the Premier League, commentator Troy Deeney selected several players for his 'Team of the Week' based on their exceptional performances. Among those highlighted were Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai for his decisive free-kick and defensive work against Arsenal, and Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi for his solid defensive display against Tottenham. Other notable mentions included Chelsea's Joao Pedro, praised as a potential signing of the summer, and Everton's Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who showcased renewed confidence with a well-taken goal. The selections reflect a mix of established stars and rising talents making their mark early in the season.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has stated that the club must retain captain Marc Guehi to ensure a successful season, amid an improved £35 million transfer offer from Liverpool. Guehi, who has one year left on his contract and scored in a recent 3-0 victory over Aston Villa, has indicated he will not sign a new deal. Glasner emphasized that an agreement was in place to only sell Guehi if a suitable replacement was secured, which has not happened. The club is reluctant to lose the crucial defender for free next summer, especially after already selling key player Eberechi Eze to Arsenal.</p>

In an interview, Zhao revealed she initially hesitated to direct the film due to its themes of motherhood and grief, but found a personal connection to the story after experiencing a difficult period following her work on Marvel's 'Eternals.' The film, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has been met with a rapturous response at the Telluride Film Festival. Zhao described the filmmaking process as a profound journey of turning heartbreak into art.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued an emergency order to block the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came just as flights were reportedly being prepared for takeoff from Texas. Attorneys for the children argued the plan was illegal, as it would deny them due process and the opportunity to seek asylum or other humanitarian protections as required by U.S. law. The judge's temporary restraining order will last for 14 days, requiring the children to be returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

          <p>Liverpool claimed a significant 1-0 victory over title rivals Arsenal at Anfield, thanks to a stunning 83rd-minute free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai. The match was a cautious and tightly contested affair, with both teams showing immense respect and creating few clear-cut chances. Arsenal's conservative approach seemed aimed at securing a draw, but Szoboszlai's moment of brilliance from 30 yards out proved decisive. The result extends Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield to 13 Premier League games and gives Liverpool an early psychological advantage in the title race.</p>
