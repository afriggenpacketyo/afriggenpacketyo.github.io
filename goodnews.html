          <p>Gold prices have surged nearly 80% since early 2024, now approaching $3,700 per ounce, with predictions of reaching $4,000 this September. This article highlights three key factors driving this potential increase: anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, rising inflation currently at 2.9%, and general market uncertainty pushing investors towards safe-haven assets. These dynamics make gold an attractive investment for both current holders and new entrants seeking portfolio protection against economic fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly's experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, demonstrated superior efficacy in lowering blood sugar levels and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide in a head-to-head Type 2 diabetes trial. Orforglipron achieved a 2.2% reduction in hemoglobin A1c and 9.2% average weight loss, surpassing the competitor's 1.4% and 5.3% respectively. While the results are promising for a needle-free GLP-1 alternative, experts note the comparison was against a lower dose of Novo Nordisk's drug, suggesting more data is needed for a definitive market leader. Eli Lilly plans to seek approval for orforglipron for Type 2 diabetes in 2026.</p>

Originally postponed shortly after his death at 76, the one-hour film covers Osbourne's return to the UK from Los Angeles with wife Sharon and his "heroic" effort to perform a farewell concert in Birmingham. The intimate portrait delves into the couple's five-decade relationship and their battle against his health problems, showcasing his determination and humor. The family requested the initial delay out of respect for their difficult time.</p>

          <p>College sports leaders are exploring new revenue streams and financial models as the NCAA adapts to direct player payments following a $2.8 billion settlement. Commissioners from the Big East, ACC, and Big 12 discussed the sustainability of rising expenses and the challenge of allocating revenue, particularly between football and other sports. While some conferences, like the ACC, are adopting incentive-based media rights distribution, the Big 12 is considering strategic partnerships with private capital, though ruling out direct equity sales. This article highlights potential for growth in new sports like women's volleyball, despite financial pressures and legal uncertainties.</p>

          <h2>NHL Commissioner Bettman Welcomes Return of Players to Winter Olympics After 12 Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 12:44:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman expressed enthusiasm for the league's return to the Winter Olympics in Milan 2026, marking the first participation for NHL players in 12 years. Bettman highlighted the Olympics as a "most visible platform" and a crucial opportunity for players to represent their countries at a national level. The decision follows a new agreement with the IOC that addresses commercial arrangements and player living conditions, overcoming previous challenges regarding league control and team disruptions. Despite the logistical difficulties of pausing the NHL season for two weeks, Bettman believes the return will be "worth it" for the league's global visibility and player satisfaction.</p>

          <h2>IRS Expected to Adjust 2026 Tax Brackets for Inflation, Potentially Lowering Taxes for Millions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 12:43:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS is anticipated to announce inflation adjustments for its 2026 federal income tax brackets, potentially offering financial relief to millions of American households. Experts project a 2.7% inflation rate will be applied, with the bottom two tax brackets seeing a larger, roughly 4% increase in their income thresholds due to recent tax legislation. These annual adjustments aim to prevent "bracket creep," ensuring that cost-of-living pay increases don't inadvertently push workers into higher tax brackets. This article explains that individual tax rates will remain the same, but higher income thresholds mean more earnings will fall into lower tax bands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scotland's Parliament has approved plans to abolish the controversial "not proven" verdict, a unique feature of Scottish courts since the 17th century. This significant legal reform, part of wider justice changes, also includes increasing the threshold for a guilty verdict in jury trials and establishing a special sexual offenses court. While supporters argued the verdict reduced wrongful convictions, critics found it confusing and denied closure to victims. This article notes that raising the bar for guilty verdicts to 10 out of 15 jurors aims to address concerns about potential wrongful convictions following the "not proven" verdict's removal.</p>
