          <p>After 81 years, the remains of four U.S. airmen who died in the crash of the WWII bomber "Heaven Can Wait" are being laid to rest. The plane was shot down off New Guinea in 1944, killing all 11 aboard. A relative of one of the crew members, Scott Althaus, launched an investigation to locate the crash site. Project Recover, in partnership with the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, discovered the wreckage in 2017. The recovery mission led to the identification of four airmen, whose remains are now being returned to their families for burial with military honors.</p>
