          <p>Ismail Abdo, the 35-year-old leader of Sweden's Rumba crime organization and one of the country's most wanted criminals, has been arrested in Turkey. Abdo is accused of orchestrating drug trafficking and a wave of violent crime in Sweden from abroad, contributing to the nation's struggle with gang-related shootings and bombings. His arrest is the result of long-term cooperation between Turkish and Swedish authorities. The Rumba gang has been engaged in a violent feud with the rival Foxtrot network, which was linked to the murder of Abdo's mother in 2023.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies is holding its summit in Rio de Janeiro, aiming to strengthen cooperation and project unity for the Global South. However, the forum faces significant challenges, including the notable absence of Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is avoiding an ICC arrest warrant. This situation provides an opportunity for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a more prominent role. The summit will address topics like global governance and development financing, but internal disagreements and geopolitical rivalries, particularly between China and India, continue to limit the bloc's cohesiveness and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Mark Sanfratello, 72, has been indicted on murder charges for the 1983 disappearance of his then-girlfriend, 27-year-old Teresa Peroni, in Selma, Oregon. Peroni was last seen arguing with Sanfratello at a party before they walked into a wooded area, and she was never seen again. The case went cold for years until a human skull found in 1997 was recently confirmed to be Peroni's through advanced DNA testing. This new evidence, presented to a grand jury, led to the indictment, and Sanfratello was subsequently arrested in California, awaiting extradition to Oregon to face the charges.</p>

          <h2>Peace Deal Between DRC and Rwanda Faces Skepticism from Observers and Rebel Groups</h2>

          <p>A new peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, brokered by the United States, is being met with significant skepticism. While hailed as a milestone for stability, the M23 rebel group has rejected the deal's authority, and observers worry about its implementation and lack of inclusivity. Critics point out that the agreement fails to address accountability for past atrocities and seems to sideline key local actors. The deal also has strong economic motives, with some, including former President Trump, highlighting the potential to unlock the region's vast mineral wealth, which has fueled concern about the plundering of resources.</p>

          <p>Hamas is currently consulting with other Palestinian factions before providing a formal response to the latest US-backed proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release. President Trump has indicated he expects a decision from Hamas within 24 hours on the plan, which Israel has reportedly accepted. The proposal is believed to involve a 60-day truce, a staggered release of hostages for prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, Israeli military operations continue across Gaza, with recent overnight strikes in Khan Younis killing at least 15 people, underscoring the urgency of the diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Christopher Killick has been sentenced to three years in prison for the persistent harassment of Emily Hunt, a former government advisor on sexual assault cases. This sentencing marks a significant moment in a decade-long fight for justice for Hunt. Killick had previously received a community order for voyeurism after filming Hunt while she was unconscious in 2015, a case where an initial sexual assault charge was dropped. Despite a restraining order, he repeatedly breached it by tweeting about Hunt, leading to the eventual prison sentence, which Hunt described as a relief that brings her a measure of safety.</p>

          <p>A newly discovered interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, is being tracked by astronomers after it entered our solar system. This is only the third such object ever detected, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Scientists have determined the comet is about 20 km wide and poses no danger to Earth, as its closest approach in October will be over 1.5 times the distance from our planet to the sun. The discovery highlights the increasing capability of modern telescopes to detect such interstellar visitors, offering valuable opportunities to study material from other planetary systems.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease has outlined five food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong cardiovascular health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which contain harmful preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes and deep-fried foods cooked in industrial oils. Instead, he recommends wholesome alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and lean, unprocessed proteins.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding whether to pay for professional movers involves weighing cost against convenience, and financial experts suggest asking several key questions first. Homeowners should consider if they own valuable or fragile items that would be expensive to replace if damaged during a self-move. It's also important to calculate the value of time saved by outsourcing the labor, and whether the expense will protect one's peace of mind and prevent work-related disruptions. Ultimately, the decision should not jeopardize long-term financial goals or lead to taking on high-interest debt to cover the cost.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Germany are spearheading a proposal to create an alternative to the World Trade Organization (WTO), which they argue is no longer effective. The initiative, floated by Ursula von der Leyen and Friedrich Merz, aims to establish a new body with like-minded nations, potentially starting with the CPTPP trade bloc, to uphold rules-based trade and resolve disputes. This move is a direct response to the paralysis of the WTO's appellate body, which has been blocked by successive U.S. administrations. The goal is to create an alliance that can address modern trade challenges like US protectionism and Chinese market distortions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology suggests that what is considered "cool" is remarkably consistent across different countries. Researchers found that people perceived as cool tend to share six specific personality traits: they are seen as more extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open, and autonomous. The study, involving nearly 6,000 participants from a dozen nations, distinguished these traits from those associated with being a "good" person, such as conscientiousness and agreeableness. This suggests that coolness is tied to boundary-pushing and a desire for change, rather than purely moral or conventional qualities.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a collection of eight unusually large, 2,000-year-old Roman shoes at the Magna Roman Fort, part of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site. One of the leather shoes measures nearly 13 inches long, equivalent to a modern US size 15. The finds are puzzling because such large sizes are rare in the vast collection from the nearby Vindolanda fort, yet they represent a significant portion of the shoes found at Magna. Researchers are now investigating which Roman regiments were stationed at the site to understand who these large-footed individuals might have been.</p>
