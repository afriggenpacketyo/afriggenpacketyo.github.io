          <p>Archer Aviation's stock experienced a drop of approximately 15% following the company's announcement of an $850 million share sale. The company intends to allocate these funds towards infrastructure development and the implementation of an AI-based aviation software platform. Archer also plans to use the capital to support its Launch Edition program, which includes a partnership to provide air taxi services during the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The company's CEO, Adam Goldstein, stated that Archer now possesses the strongest balance sheet in the sector, enabling them to execute their plans both in the U.S. and internationally.

          <p>CBS News provides an overview of debt settlement, a strategy that allows borrowers to negotiate with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed. The process involves stopping payments to creditors and saving money in a dedicated account while a debt relief company negotiates on the borrower's behalf. Debt settlement is typically suited for individuals with significant unsecured debt who are already behind on payments. While it can offer relief, it also comes with risks, including credit damage, fees, and potential tax consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley attributed a recent factory shutdown to a shortage of rare earth minerals, essential components in automobile production. The U.S. relies heavily on China for rare earth minerals, and recent export controls imposed by Beijing have disrupted the supply chain. While U.S. and Chinese negotiators reached an agreement to resume exports, Ford is still facing challenges in securing the necessary materials. Farley expressed optimism about the trade talks but acknowledged ongoing difficulties in obtaining approvals for rare earth exports.</p>
