The storm, the ninth named one of the 2025 Atlantic season, is projected to move away from the Bahamas and towards Bermuda, with further strengthening anticipated. While swells from Imelda and Hurricane Humberto are impacting the U.S. East Coast, potentially causing life-threatening rip currents, Imelda itself is not expected to make U.S. landfall. Coastal North Carolina may experience isolated flash flooding from associated rainfall.</p>

          <p>Borrowers have seen mortgage rates decline recently, with the average 30-year fixed rate reaching a three-year low of 6.13% after the Federal Reserve's first 2025 interest rate cut. While a further Fed rate cut is anticipated in October, experts suggest it may not significantly impact mortgage rates, as markets often price in such decisions in advance. Mortgage rates are more directly influenced by Treasury yields, which may already reflect an expected 0.25% cut. Homeowners with high rates from recent years are advised to explore refinancing options, especially adjustable-rate mortgages, though with caution regarding associated risks.

          <p>Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national, has been convicted in the UK for her role in a large-scale fraud scheme that led to the world's largest single cryptocurrency seizure. The Metropolitan Police recovered 61,000 bitcoin, valued at over £5 billion, which Qian illegally acquired between 2014 and 2017 by defrauding over 128,000 victims in China. She fled to the UK using false documents, attempting to launder the stolen funds through property purchases. This conviction is the culmination of a seven-year international investigation into a global money laundering network.</p>

While acknowledging a "modestly restrictive policy stance" is appropriate, she indicated that further easing this year would depend on incoming data. The looming government shutdown poses an additional challenge, as it could halt key economic data releases, including the crucial nonfarm payrolls report. (not investment advice)</p>

A (AEXA), a new $345 million blank-check company focused on AI, energy, defense, and decentralized finance. Following a track record of poor returns from his previous SPACs, Palihapitiya structured AEXA differently, with no warrants and his compensation tied to a 50% share price increase post-deal. Notably, only 1.3% of the allocation went to retail investors, as he aims to "temper retail investors' involvement" and target institutional backing.
