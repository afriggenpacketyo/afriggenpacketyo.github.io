          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The original complaint, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a potential shift in regulatory approach towards the crypto industry, especially as the Trump administration aims to be more industry-friendly, with the Justice Department having already shut down its crypto enforcement team. Binance is also deepening its ties with World Liberty Financial, a crypto bank project linked to the Trump family. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japanese authorities expect China to issue a public notice easing the ban, which has been in place since August 2023, and open registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. While Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 prefectures, this move is viewed as a positive step in resolving tensions between the two countries. The agreement follows third-party monitoring of the water release and marine sampling near the Fukushima plant, which found no abnormal concentrations of radioactive substances.</p>

DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, but these efforts have faced criticism from Democrats in Congress.
