        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key R&D employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. This strategic move is not an acquisition of the company but involves Google paying for employee compensation and a nonexclusive license for Windsurf's technology. The deal underscores the intense competition for top AI talent among major tech firms like Google, OpenAI, and Meta. This transaction follows reports that Windsurf had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI, highlighting the high demand for expertise in advanced AI coding tools.</p>

          <h2>Prada to Collaborate with Indian Artisans Following Sandal Controversy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced a partnership with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing backlash for designs resembling traditional Kolhapuri sandals. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, leading to criticism from fashion critics and cultural advocates. In response, Prada initiated talks with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents the artisans. This move is seen as a positive step towards respectful collaboration between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities, with plans to patent the Kolhapuri chappal to protect its heritage.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of Chinese law firms are establishing a global presence to meet the growing demand from Chinese companies expanding their operations abroad. These firms are finding that Chinese businesses prefer the familiarity and trust of working with lawyers from their home country. The number of overseas Chinese legal offices has seen a significant 70% increase since 2018, reflecting a strategic push from Beijing to support this expansion. However, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients, particularly amidst rising geopolitical tensions, marking a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Following a series of incidents where defective power banks caught fire on commercial flights, China's civil aviation authority has imposed an emergency ban on substandard units. As of June 28, portable lithium-ion batteries lacking the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark are barred from domestic flights. This new rule has caused some confusion among travelers, leading to large numbers of power banks being abandoned at airports. The move highlights a growing public and regulatory focus on the safety of these ubiquitous electronic accessories, with a formal review of power bank products expected to conclude by the end of July.</p>

          <p>As the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, is set to expire in China next year, a wave of generic alternatives is on the horizon. Currently, there are around 60 similar drugs in trial by Chinese pharmaceutical companies, poised to enter the lucrative US$150 billion global market. This impending competition is expected to drive down the high cost of these treatments, making them more accessible to patients with obesity and diabetes. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic manufacturers in China will compete for market share, significantly increasing affordability.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent downturn in cargo volumes partly attributed to tariff uncertainties, the Port of Long Beach has commenced a major $365-million expansion project. The plan involves extending a terminal quay to accommodate larger ships and is expected to boost cargo-handling capacity by 50%. Officials expressed confidence in the long-term demand for larger vessel capacity, framing the project as a crucial investment in America's supply chain infrastructure. The groundbreaking ceremony proceeded even as recent data showed a significant drop in container movement through the port, reflecting the current volatility in global trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, who are meeting for the first time at the tour level. The outcome will likely hinge on which player better handles the pressure of the occasion. While Swiatek has more experience in major finals, Anisimova's underdog status may allow her to play more freely and aggressively. A key tactical battle will be Swiatek's powerful top-spin forehand against Anisimova's formidable backhand. Both players have found strong form on grass, setting the stage for what promises to be a competitive championship match.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is charting a new foreign policy course, asserting an "Australia first" doctrine to navigate the rising global tensions between the United States and China. In a recent speech, he drew inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin, who pivoted towards the U.S. based on strategic reality rather than tradition. While reaffirming the importance of the U.S. alliance and security pacts like AUKUS, Albanese's government is signaling a recalibration of relationships. This approach emphasizes Australia's sovereignty and its determination to shape its own future in an increasingly uncertain Asia-Pacific region.</p>

This unlocked a brilliant mind that had been hidden, allowing Viraj to progress from basic math to calculus in under three years and achieve a near-perfect ACT score. Viraj hopes his story will serve as a breakthrough for the entire non-speaking autistic community, demonstrating that immense potential can exist where it is not always seen.</p>
