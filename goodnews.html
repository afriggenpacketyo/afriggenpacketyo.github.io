          <p>Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer asserted that international law is central to the Starmer government's foreign policy, even when it requires foregoing short-term political gains.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing its plan to bar foreign nationals from studying at Harvard University. The judge issued an injunction, citing concerns that the administration was retaliating against Harvard for refusing to accede to demands to control the school's governance and curriculum. The administration had accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. This ruling protects the ability of international students to attend Harvard and challenges the administration's actions against the university. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the protection of academic freedom but also the ongoing tensions between the administration and educational institutions.</p>

The analyst explained that Iran has threatened to close the strait for over 20 years but has never done so because it has a lot to lose. Iran exports 1.7 million barrels a day through the strait. The market has also concluded that Iran won't close the strait, as oil prices dropped on Monday. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the reduced risk of disruption to global oil supplies.</p>
