          <p>Affirm's stock experienced an 8% decline after the company projected revenue between $815 million and $845 million for the current quarter, falling short of analysts' expectations, despite reporting better-than-expected profits for the previous quarter. While the company's key margin metric, revenue less transaction costs, slightly exceeded its long-term target range, and gross merchandise volume surpassed estimates, the weaker guidance raised concerns among investors. Affirm's CEO, Max Levchin, highlighted the success of 0% interest loans in attracting new customers and boosting lifetime value, and CFO Rob O'Hare noted stable credit outcomes, despite broader economic contractions and lower-income consumers focusing on essentials. Affirm reaffirmed its commitment to GAAP profitability by the end of fiscal year 2025 and continues to see growth from partnerships with Apple, Amazon, and Shopify.</p>

          <p>Mexican business leaders are expressing enthusiasm for Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan's advocacy for a stronger trade partnership between the US and Mexico. Rowan believes that the US and Mexico should be the driving economic force in the world for the next 50 years, particularly as companies seek alternatives to China for manufacturing. Executives view trade turmoil as an opportunity for increased integration between the two economies, which they see as complementary, with manufacturing job creation in Mexico correlated with job creation in the US. Mexico is also perceived as a strategic opportunity due to its proximity to the US, young demographics, and large pension system.</p>

          <p>Pinterest shares surged 15% after the company reported first-quarter earnings and provided better-than-expected guidance for the second quarter. While first quarter sales in the U.S. and Canada slightly missed estimates, revenue from Europe exceeded projections, and the company reported higher-than-expected adjusted EBITDA. CEO Bill Ready emphasized the company's transformation into a shopping destination, particularly for Gen Z, and CFO Julia Brau Donnelly acknowledged the impact of tariffs on some Asia-based e-commerce retailers' advertising spend, but expressed optimism about Pinterest's advertising products and overall business health. Despite broader economic uncertainties and ongoing trade disputes, Pinterest's performance contrasted with some other tech companies expressing caution about future quarters.</p>

Inspired by Andrew Carnegie's "The Gospel of Wealth," Gates aims to allocate another $200 billion to projects focused on eliminating preventable diseases, infectious diseases, and poverty. He criticized cuts to foreign aid budgets by the US, UK, and France, and addressed comments accusing Elon Musk of harming children through aid cuts made by Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge.

The $2.4-billion project aims to add seven stations and extend service to West L.A. by the 2028 Olympics, but faces potential delays due to funding shortfalls and tariff-related cost increases.

          <p>Former New England Patriots star Julian Edelman has spoken out about the media attention surrounding Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson, encouraging his former coach to refocus on football. Edelman emphasized the importance of avoiding distractions, a principle often stressed during their time together in New England, and suggested that the ongoing drama has become a distraction for the organization. While acknowledging Hudson's right to advocate for Belichick, Edelman urged a return to prioritizing football matters and minimizing personal affairs in the public eye. Cowherd suggested that both parties are benefiting from the attention, but Edelman countered that the continuous focus on Belichick's personal life is overshadowing football-related matters.</p>
