          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter of 2025, expanding by 4.3% year-over-year and beating economists' forecasts. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 5.5%. Despite these positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant downside risks from global economic uncertainty, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank has recently loosened monetary policy in response to these external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia is enhancing its strategic partnership with the Philippines through increased investment in maritime cooperation, including vessel remediation, training, and operational support. This move is part of a broader effort to strengthen regional security ties, with analysts noting the two nations are preparing to mark 80 years of diplomatic relations. The strengthening defense alliance occurs as Australia continues to manage its complex and vital trade relationship with China. This policy reflects a delicate balancing act between economic necessities and regional geopolitical alignments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant trend is emerging in China's higher education, with students increasingly opting for technology-focused majors like information technology and vehicle engineering. This shift reflects a belief that these fields represent the future of industrial development and is influenced by the nation's strategic push to bolster its tech sector. The trend marks a departure from two decades ago when international trade and urban planning were more popular choices. This academic pivot is driven by China's goal to gain a competitive edge in its technological rivalry with the United States.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory is celebrating a remarkable scientific achievement: 230 years of uninterrupted daily weather recordings, making it the longest continuous weather sequence in the UK and Ireland. This unique, handwritten dataset provides invaluable insights into long-term climate patterns and historical weather events, such as the "Night of the Big Wind" in 1839. The tradition, which began on July 14, 1795, continues today with a blend of human observation and modern technology. The article also highlights the crucial role of past observers, including a director's widow who ensured the record's continuity.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, a meeting that follows the president's announcement of a plan to sell weapons to NATO allies for transfer to Ukraine. The plan aims to expedite military aid by moving existing European stockpiles to Ukraine, with allies then purchasing replacements from the U.S. This strategy comes as the administration faces bipartisan pressure to increase support for Ukraine and impose stronger sanctions on Russia. The discussions are seen as a critical step in shaping the U.S. and NATO's evolving response to the ongoing conflict.</p>

A 5-2 extra-innings victory over the San Francisco Giants capped their pre-break performance, showcasing the resilience that has defined their season.

          <p>Donald Trump has been invited for an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom, which has been scheduled for a period when the UK Parliament is not in session. The timing of the September visit to Windsor Castle effectively removes the possibility of the US president addressing Parliament, a controversial prospect that some MPs had actively opposed. This strategic scheduling by the palace avoids a potential political flashpoint while still extending the diplomatic honor. The visit is seen as a significant move in the relationship between the Starmer government and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>In an address to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer made the case that investors must divorce their personal politics from their financial decisions, particularly regarding the Trump administration. He argued that despite many reasons to dislike the president, the market has been resilient, driven by individual investors and policies that are surprisingly constructive for investments. Cramer pointed to deregulation, a pro-deal environment, and the deflationary impact of AI as powerful forces for stocks that exist independently of political sentiment. He concluded that market forces under the current administration are favorable for stock prices. (not investment advice)</p>
