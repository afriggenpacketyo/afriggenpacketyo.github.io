          <p>The Chinese yuan has shown significant gains against the US dollar, reaching its strongest level since last November, with appreciation continuing through the first half of the year. Analysts, including those at Goldman Sachs, attribute this trend to China's resilient economic data and a growing lack of confidence in the US dollar due to concerns over US government debt and fiscal policy. The investment bank predicts the yuan will continue to strengthen, potentially breaking the 7 per dollar mark within six months and reaching 6.9 in a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the importance of nations developing "sovereign AI" to maintain strategic autonomy and cater to local languages and cultures. Experts noted that many current large language models are English-centric, failing to capture cultural nuances. They argued that leveraging open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize AI development. This approach allows emerging economies, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, to build their own AI ecosystems and prevent the benefits of the technology from being concentrated in just a few nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI for China unexpectedly rose to 50.4 in June, indicating a return to growth, which contrasted with the official government survey that showed a contraction. This divergence is attributed to the Caixin survey's focus on smaller, export-oriented firms and its mid-month timing, possibly reflecting a delayed response to a US-China tariff reduction. While production and new orders increased, new export orders declined and employment remained weak, with businesses expressing weakened optimism due to fierce market competition and unresolved issues with domestic demand.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed through significant housing reform legislation aimed at speeding up construction by easing requirements under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Newsom ensured the bills' passage by linking them to the state budget, a move that compelled reluctant lawmakers to approve the measures despite opposition from some labor and environmental groups. The new laws exempt most urban housing projects from CEQA and also streamline the process for other developments like health clinics. Experts believe these are some of the most consequential CEQA reforms in decades.</p>

          <p>The White House has declared a victory after Canada dropped its planned digital services tax, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stating that Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Trump. The proposed 3% tax on Canadian revenue from large US tech companies like Amazon and Google was met with threats of retaliatory tariffs from the US. Canadian officials confirmed the tax was rescinded as part of a "bigger negotiation," and trade talks between the two nations have since resumed. The move was criticized by Canada's opposition party but praised by US officials.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, plays a key role in slowing the ageing process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and organ ageing by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding helps explain the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-ageing benefits of physical activity. The discovery could also pave the way for new anti-ageing strategies that simulate the effects of exercise.</p>

This trend is largely driven by social media, as consumers seek out picturesque locations for photos, but some question the long-term viability of this business model. One consumer notes that many of these "influencer-driven" cafes rely on novelty that fades after a single visit. Despite these concerns, China's coffee industry is now valued at over $42 billion, with consumption expected to continue its rapid growth.</p>

LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, played for Memphis and Sacramento last season, demonstrating strong three-point shooting ability.

The review will examine statutory maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, acknowledging that the current provisions are often insufficient. For example, low pay for paternity leave leads one in three fathers to not take it, and the uptake of shared parental leave is very low. Campaign groups have welcomed the review as a generational opportunity to create a system that better supports working families.</p>
