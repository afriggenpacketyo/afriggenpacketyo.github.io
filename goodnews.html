        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to remain higher due to changes in the economy and ongoing policy adjustments. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, even with long-term inflation expectations largely aligned with the Fed's 2% target. He cautioned that the economy may face more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing challenges for both the economy and central banks. Powell's remarks suggest a difficult balancing act for the Fed in supporting employment while controlling inflation.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods plans to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to expand its international presence and gain a larger share of the Nike sneaker market. The deal will allow Dick's to operate Foot Locker as a standalone unit, maintaining its brands, and enter international markets where Foot Locker already has a strong presence. This acquisition is expected to enhance Dick's bargaining power with major brands and provide access to a broader customer base, although some analysts express concerns about potential integration challenges. Foot Locker shareholders will have the option to receive $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick's common stock for each share they own.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that President Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship violates four Supreme Court precedents. This comment was made during a Supreme Court hearing where Solicitor General D.

Justice Elena Kagan also questioned Sauer, suggesting his argument would prevent courts from ruling on the constitutionality of the executive order.

          <p>A growing debate in Washington surrounds the issue of 'debanking,' where financial institutions deny services based on political positions or risk assessments. While some argue it's politically motivated discrimination, others view it as banks exercising discretion to avoid risky clients. Despite differing opinions, there's increasing agreement that debanking is a problem, prompting discussions on potential solutions, including executive orders and fair access rules. The Trump administration has signaled a willingness to address the issue, while even bank lobbying groups show openness to revisiting fair-access regulations.</p>

The 24-year-old, who can play across the right-hand side, is highly sought after by Liverpool's manager, Arne Slot, for the upcoming season. Frimpong's release clause is estimated to be around 35 million euros (¬£29.5m), which Liverpool is expected to meet.

          <p>Democrats on Capitol Hill are divided over President Trump's executive order aimed at slashing U.S. drug prices, with some expressing cautious optimism and others dismissing it as mere bluster. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to set price targets for pharmaceutical companies, aligning them with the lowest prices in other developed countries. While some Democrats believe it's a step in the right direction, others are skeptical, citing Trump's past announcements with little meaningful impact on drug prices. Representative Ro Khanna introduced a House bill to make Trump's order permanent.</p>

          <p>As retailers reduce orders for foreign goods due to tariffs, companies specializing in recirculating overstocked or returned items are preparing for increased demand.

With fewer goods crossing the Pacific, these reverse logistics companies offer an alternative by reselling refurbished products. ReturnPro's CEO, Sender Shamiss, notes that the uncertainty in the market is driving retailers to reduce inventory purchases, creating an opportunity for these companies to bring returned items back into the supply chain.</p>

However, shadow chancellor Mel Stride cautioned that it was 'a bit premature to be popping the champagne corks'.

          <p>President Trump visited Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, a key U.S. military facility in the Middle East, before traveling to the United Arab Emirates. He addressed troops, discussing Qatar's purchases of American military supplies and sharing anecdotes. Trump is on a four-day tour of Gulf states, focusing on business deals and regional diplomacy. The U.S. military has used Al Udeid since 2001, and Qatar has invested billions in its development. During his visit, Trump also mentioned plans to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 as a donation from Qatar's royal family to serve as Air Force One.</p>

          <h2>Nationwide Injunctions Against Trump's Policies Face Supreme Court Review</h2>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to review the use of nationwide injunctions, which have been used by judges to block some of President Trump‚Äôs most aggressive policies. The case stems from Trump's executive order to restrict birthright citizenship, which was blocked by three judges issuing nationwide injunctions. The court's decision could significantly limit the power of federal judges to issue sweeping rulings that apply across the country. As of late March, judges had issued 17 nationwide injunctions against the Trump administration, affecting policies on immigration, federal funding, and education.</p>

          <h2>US-UK Trade Agreement Faces Consumer Resistance Over Food Standards</h2>

          <p>The United States and Britain recently agreed to lower some tariffs, creating a $5 billion export opportunity for American agricultural products in Britain. However, U.S. officials face the challenge of countering the perception that American meat is substandard. While the agreement is seen as a first step, differences in food production standards, such as hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken, could hinder a more comprehensive trade deal. British consumers are wary of relaxing food production standards, and there is resistance to changing regulations inherited from the European Union.</p>

          <p>Walmart reported solid sales growth for the recent quarter, particularly in its e-commerce division, but cautioned that President Trump‚Äôs tariffs will soon lead to price increases. Despite strong sales, the company refrained from projecting profits for its current quarter due to tariff policies. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon stated that the company will strive to keep prices low but cannot absorb all the pressure from tariffs. The company also marked a milestone, recording its first-ever profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, both in the U.S. and globally.</p>
