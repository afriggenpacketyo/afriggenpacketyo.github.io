          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, titled "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," is bringing fresh attention to a lesser-known French Impressionist painter. While Caillebotte is recognized for his iconic "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the exhibition highlights his unconventional focus on male subjects, a theme that scandalized the 19th-century art establishment. The show explores how Caillebotte depicted men in intimate, interior settings, challenging traditional notions of masculinity for the era. This has sparked contemporary debate over the artist's personal life and the interpretation of his work.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents who lost homes and businesses in the devastating Eaton fire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support struggling local restaurants and foster community connection. Founded by a resident who lost her own apartment, the club organizes weekly gatherings at different eateries, providing a vital economic boost and a space for shared healing. For many members, the club offers a unique sense of belonging and understanding among people who have experienced similar trauma. Mental health experts note that such community-led initiatives are a powerful model for post-disaster recovery, helping to rebuild social bonds that were fractured by the tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A "cortisol cocktail" has become a popular trend on social media, with influencers claiming the non-alcoholic drink can reduce stress, boost energy, and aid weight loss by lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The mocktail typically includes ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and salt, which contain nutrients that can be depleted by stress. While medical experts acknowledge the potential hydration and electrolyte benefits, they caution that there is no direct scientific evidence proving the drink's efficacy in reducing cortisol levels. Health professionals instead recommend foundational wellness habits like a healthy diet, exercise, and proper sleep to manage stress.</p>

          <h2>Historians Discuss the U.S. Constitution as a Living, Amendable Document</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 09:23:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A historical review of the U.S. Constitution emphasizes its original design as a dynamic and amendable framework, rather than a static relic. Historian Jill Lepore and National Constitution Center CEO Jeffrey Rosen explain that the founders expected the document to be constantly revised to reflect an evolving nation, a process exemplified by the initial inclusion of the Bill of Rights. The article highlights that the Constitution was born from compromises, including over slavery, and was later transformed by amendments that sought to fulfill the Declaration of Independence's promise of equality. It notes a modern departure from this vision, with constitutional change now often driven by Supreme Court reinterpretations rather than the amendment process.</p>

          <h2>Amazon Deploys AI-Voiced Summaries of Product Reviews, Raising Questions About Nuance and Trust</h2>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its use of artificial intelligence with "Hear the Highlights," a feature that provides AI-voiced audio summaries of product information and customer reviews. While intended to simplify the shopping experience, the feature raises concerns about whether an AI can effectively capture the nuance and context found in human reviews. Critics worry that by distilling thousands of comments, the AI may overlook critical niche feedback, particularly on safety issues, and could unintentionally blend promotional marketing language with genuine user experiences. The technology is seen as a step toward more interactive, conversational AI shopping agents, but its current implementation risks losing the unique, personal insights that make customer reviews valuable.</p>

          <p>Europe's Ryder Cup golf team is employing an unconventional training method to prepare for the famously hostile crowds at Bethpage in New York: virtual reality headsets that simulate spectators shouting abuse. Captain Luke Donald introduced the technology to help players like Rory McIlroy desensitize themselves to the intense pressure and name-calling they anticipate facing. McIlroy confirmed he encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want," noting that while nothing can fully replicate the real experience, it is part of a detailed strategy to prepare for the challenges of playing on American soil.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, sports analysts are predicting the potential outcomes and key players to watch. The Minnesota Lynx, driven by a "revenge tour" after a controversial loss last season, are seen as a top contender, led by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier and the league's best defense. The Las Vegas Aces, however, are entering the postseason on a 16-game winning streak, making them a formidable opponent for a potential finals matchup. Other teams considered at risk or as long shots include the Phoenix Mercury and the expansion Golden State Valkyries, with discussions also noting the absence of rookies Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark.</p>

          <p>Leading Wall Street analysts have identified Broadcom, Zscaler, and Oracle as stocks with significant long-term growth potential, largely driven by the artificial intelligence boom and strong demand in cloud and cybersecurity sectors. Broadcom's impressive earnings are bolstered by accelerating AI-related revenue, with one analyst projecting it to reach $20 billion in fiscal 2025. Cybersecurity firm Zscaler is benefiting from high demand for its Zero Trust security solutions, while Oracle's stock surged after it reported massive growth in its contracted cloud revenue, signaling strong future performance.

          <p>In a remarkable act of bravery, surgeons at the Kyiv Heart Institute performed a life-saving heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl during one of the most intense Russian missile and drone attacks on the city. Dr. Borys Todurov and his team drove through explosions to retrieve the donor heart from another hospital and completed the surgery as their own building shook from the nearby blasts. The recipient, Kira Skliarova, whose heart was severely weakened by childhood illness, is now recovering well. The donor was a 4-year-old girl who died in an accident, and her mother later visited Kira to listen to her daughter's heart beating.</p>
