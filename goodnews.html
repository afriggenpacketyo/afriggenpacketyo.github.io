          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has commented that it will be difficult for star striker Alexander Isak to remain at Newcastle United. This follows the club's rejection of a £110 million offer from Liverpool, with the 25-year-old player reportedly still determined to make the move. Rooney noted that while it's a significant loss for Newcastle, financial regulations might make selling Isak beneficial for strengthening the overall squad.</p>

The ruling, described as the most significant climate development since the 2015 Paris Agreement, suggests that fossil fuel production and subsidies could be considered internationally wrongful acts. Financial experts argue this could force a revaluation of assets tied to fossil fuels, as investors must now account for increased legal and regulatory risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A children's playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened after a shocking discovery of 177 World War Two-era bombs buried just beneath the surface. The devices were found by a worker installing new play equipment, leading to a specialized ordnance disposal operation. The bombs, believed to be practice munitions, were found carefully stacked, likely left over from a military ordnance depot that occupied the site during the war, remaining undetected for decades.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights the growing issue of loneliness among young men, citing research that shows a sharp decline in close friendships and a feeling of being unknown. The author suggests that societal pressures push men into a "man box" of misogynistic beliefs and an identity based on domination, which is fundamentally at odds with building community. The piece calls on men to take responsibility for changing this narrative by actively creating deeper, more emotionally open friendships in offline spaces.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that the prime minister allow him to appoint peers to the House of Lords, citing a "democratic disparity" in the upper chamber. In a letter, Farage argued that his party's significant vote share in the last general election and recent successes warrant representation. He pointed out that other parties with fewer MPs and votes, such as the Liberal Democrats and Green Party, currently have members in the House of Lords while Reform UK has none.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing forecasts despite trade headwinds from U.S. tariffs. The better-than-expected performance was largely due to strong exports, which contributed significantly to GDP growth. However, economists remain cautious, predicting a potential slowdown in the coming quarters as investment spending may soften and the full impact of tariffs on key sectors like automobile exports is felt.

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending the article describes as more true to the character than a traditional fairytale romance. After the death of her husband Mr. Big and a failed rekindling with an old flame, Carrie accepts a future that may not include another great love. The review argues that this conclusion better honors the original "Sex and the City" theme that friendships, not romantic partners, are one's true soulmates.</p>
