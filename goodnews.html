          <p>The film "28 Years Later," a reboot of the zombie franchise, presents a plot set nearly three decades after a viral outbreak isolated the British Isles. The story follows a family's struggle for survival and their encounters with both the infected and other humans. The film blends moments of philosophy with violence and comedy, creating a tonally ungainly yet intriguing spectacle. The filmmakers use abrasive editing and sound to evoke themes of struggle and division, suggesting that humankind's natural state is conflict, and the film explores the idea that the things that make us feel safe are also our weaknesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that state and local policies regulating plastic bag use have significantly reduced shoreline litter in the U.S. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups, finding that areas with bag policies saw a 25% to 47% decrease in plastic bag litter over six years compared to unregulated areas. The study suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective than bans, particularly partial bans, in limiting litter. This comprehensive review highlights the effectiveness of plastic bag policies in mitigating plastic pollution in marine environments.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have dropped charges against Jose Manuel Mojica, a Los Angeles protester accused of assaulting border patrol agents during a demonstration against immigration raids. Mojica, who maintained his innocence, claimed he was brutally attacked by law enforcement during his arrest. The U.S. attorney's office dismissed the charges, stating it was "made in good faith and in the interest of justice," after video footage surfaced. Mojica's attorney argued that the charges were based solely on his participation in the protest and exercising his constitutional rights.</p>
