        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave with temperatures expected to reach 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow thunderstorm warning for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The warning is in effect from Saturday afternoon into Sunday, with potential for flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert is also in place until Monday, raising concerns about pressures on health and social care services and a potential rise in deaths, particularly among the elderly and those with health conditions. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and scientists attribute the increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves to climate change.</p>

          <p>Several towns and cities in eastern Germany are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation, with Guben being one such example. The "trial living" scheme provides people with the opportunity to stay for up to four weeks without charge, aiming to encourage long-term relocation. Guben, like many eastern German cities, has experienced significant demographic changes since reunification, including declining birth rates and emigration of young people. The city is also investing in new industries such as battery production, hoping to fill around 300 job vacancies.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their 2025 tour with a defeat against Argentina, highlighting issues with cohesion in the newly formed side. While the Lions demonstrated ambition in their attacking shape and created opportunities, their execution was lacking, with offloads going to ground and passes missing their targets. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed his frustration, emphasizing the need for sharper play as they head to Australia. Despite the loss, there were encouraging signs in their ball-handling, but Farrell will demand better.</p>

The legislation only applies to the sale and manufacturing, not possession, making it the second state after Washington with such a law.

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, recently released from an ICE detention center, described his experience as a violation of human rights, stating that rights are left behind upon entering the facility. He highlighted the stark contrast between the country's purported championing of human rights and the reality inside the detention center. Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was detained for his pro-Palestinian activism, leading to a legal battle for his release. He expressed excitement about reuniting with his newborn son and wife, and vowed to continue advocating for those still detained.</p>
