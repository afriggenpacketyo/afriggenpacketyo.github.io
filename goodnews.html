          <p>Datong, a city in China's Shanxi province, successfully averted disaster during severe summer rains, despite nearly 20 hours of upstream flood discharges. This success is attributed to a project initiated over 15 years ago by former mayor Geng Yanbo, which widened the city's main waterway and reinforced its banks. Residents initially questioned the investment, but now recognize its crucial role in preventing catastrophe. Economists suggest such infrastructure investment not only enhances urban resilience but also stimulates the economy, as seen with Beijing's recent 1 trillion yuan sovereign debt issuance for disaster prevention.</p>

A memorial will also be built to honor those lost. While the 99-year-old Camp Mystic Guadalupe remains too damaged, its sister site, Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, will welcome campers, signifying a step towards recovery and enhanced safety.</p>

Speaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, Zelenskyy described ending the conflict as an "unbelievable mission" and noted a "very good," substantive meeting with Trump. Trump, when asked about the nomination, responded, "Why not." This highlights a potential shift in the dynamic between the two leaders regarding the war's resolution.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the UN Security Council, asserting that China possesses the influence to compel Russia to end its war against Ukraine. He argued that "Without China, Putin's Russia is nothing." Kyiv has previously criticized Beijing for allegedly supplying items usable in Russia's war effort, a claim China denies, stating it maintains an "objective, impartial position" and advocates for peace talks. Zelenskyy's statement underscores Ukraine's strategy to leverage global powers in seeking a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul indicated to DW that Germany's recognition of a Palestinian state is "a question of when," rather than if. Speaking at the UN's 80th anniversary, Wadephul noted that EU member states are united on a two-state solution, with only the timing of recognition dividing them. Germany has historically been reluctant, preferring a solution through negotiations between Israel and Palestinians. This statement reflects evolving European stances amidst ongoing Middle East tensions, while Germany also affirmed NATO's firm defense against airspace infringements.</p>

CEO Eddie Wu Yongming, also chairman of Alibaba Cloud, stated the company aims to be the "world’s leading full-stack AI service provider." Wu sees artificial general intelligence (AGI) not as an end, but a "new beginning," predicting it will automate 80% of existing jobs and lead to "artificial super intelligence" (ASI) that solves complex global problems. This mirrors increased AI spending by US tech giants like Nvidia.</p>

Trump indicated that Ukraine could achieve this with support from Europe and NATO, and that the US would continue supplying weapons to NATO for their use.
