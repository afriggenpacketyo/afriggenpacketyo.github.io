          <p>China is increasing its strategic focus on Latin America, capitalizing on perceived uncertainty in the United States' approach to the region.

Infrastructure development is expected to remain a key area of cooperation, serving as a means to counter U.S. influence. This outreach includes offering substantial credit lines to support development in Latin American and Caribbean nations, positioning China as a reliable partner amidst global trade tensions.

          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults outlines five parenting rules for raising successful children, emphasizing the importance of trusting instincts and culture over influencers and clickbait. The advice focuses on following the child's interests, prioritizing enjoyment over strict developmental milestones, and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should trust their instincts, follow cultural traditions, and focus on their child's individual needs. By emphasizing enjoyment and authenticity, parents can create a supportive environment for their children's development.</p>

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed a tumor from a woman's spine through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. Karla Flores, 20, was initially diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, and a second tumor was discovered on her spine during an MRI. The surgical team, led by Dr. Mohamed Labib, developed a unique plan to access the spinal tumor through the side of Flores' eye, which they called the "third nostril" approach. The procedure took approximately 20 hours, and Flores is now cancer-free, though she is undergoing rehabilitative therapy.</p>

          <p>A Harvard-trained educator argues that children who learn to use AI effectively will become smarter adults, but warns against simply copying and pasting AI-generated answers. Instead, she advises teaching children to ask follow-up questions to understand how AI models arrive at their conclusions. She emphasizes that AI can be a valuable tool for learning if used as a coach rather than a crutch. The educator suggests schools should incorporate AI usage into their curricula to help students develop valuable skills.</p>
