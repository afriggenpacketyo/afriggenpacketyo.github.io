          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a stunning pole position at the Singapore Grand Prix, narrowly beating Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Russell's impressive lap, his first pole since June, placed him ahead of the championship-contending McLaren drivers, with Oscar Piastri in third and Lando Norris in fifth. Verstappen attributed his second-place finish to being impeded by Norris on his final qualifying lap, an incident Norris dismissed. The result marks a significant achievement for Mercedes in Singapore and sets up an exciting race, with Russell in a prime position to challenge for a victory against the dominant Red Bull and McLaren teams.</p>

          <p>WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has vowed to improve relationships with players following sharp public criticism from Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier. Engelbert expressed that she was disheartened by the sentiment that the league does not care about its players and stated she must do better to ensure they feel valued. She announced the formation of a new committee to review officiating and confirmed that discussions for a new collective bargaining agreement are scheduled. Engelbert also denied making certain comments attributed to her about Caitlin Clark and affirmed her commitment to remaining as commissioner to see through these changes and continue the league's growth.</p>

          <p>Costco has entered an agreement with drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members at a substantially lower cost. Through its prescription program, members with a valid prescription can purchase a four-week supply for $499, roughly half the typical out-of-pocket price. This initiative aims to provide an affordable and authentic alternative to cheaper, compounded versions of the drugs, which have raised safety concerns. The move could significantly increase access to these high-demand medications for patients whose insurance plans do not cover them, further boosting their widespread use for weight management.</p>

          <p>After two decades of meticulous restoration work, Egypt has opened the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III to the public. Located in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor, the over 3,000-year-old tomb is one of the largest in the necropolis and had suffered from severe deterioration before the Japanese-led project began. The restoration involved more than 260 specialists who worked to conserve the site's exquisite wall paintings and structural integrity. The tomb, first discovered in 1799, features a long sloping passageway leading to burial chambers for the king and his queens, offering visitors a remarkable glimpse into the grandeur of the Eighteenth Dynasty.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key parts of a Gaza peace proposal outlined by President Trump, including the release of all hostages. In response, President Trump stated he believes the group is "ready for a lasting PEACE" and urged Israel to immediately halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages. Israel's Prime Minister's Office confirmed it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan, which involves a cessation of IDF offensive activity to allow Hamas to organize the hostage release. U.S. envoys are traveling to Egypt, where indirect talks are expected to begin Sunday to finalize the details of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Mohammed Kudus is earning recognition as one of Tottenham Hotspur's most influential new players after scoring the winning goal in a 2-1 victory over Leeds. The Ghana international, who joined from West Ham for £55m, has already provided four assists this season and has been praised by manager Thomas Frank as the team's best offensive player so far. Kudus's performance was highlighted by his crucial goal and an assist for Mathys Tel's opener. Pundits like Wayne Rooney have lauded his dribbling ability, strength, and work rate, noting that he brings a new and exciting dimension to the Tottenham midfield.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have officially added veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw to their National League Division Series roster ahead of their series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Kershaw, a future Hall of Famer, was not on the roster for the wild-card round but is expected to provide a steady presence out of the bullpen. His inclusion is seen as crucial for adding left-handed pitching depth against the Phillies' lineup, which features several powerful left-handed hitters. This move ensures Kershaw will have at least one more opportunity to pitch in the postseason before his anticipated retirement at the end of the season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated resilience, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieving multiple record highs this week despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The healthcare sector led the gains, with shares of Danaher and Eli Lilly surging over 15% following a deal exempting Pfizer from certain tariffs. The technology and utilities sectors also performed strongly, partly driven by the continued investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. In portfolio news, the CNBC Investing Club reported buying more shares of Nike and Boeing, citing positive signs in their respective business strategies, while trimming its position in Bristol Myers Squibb.

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets trading near record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to increase their exposure to overseas markets. Analysts argue that a phenomenon known as "home bias" has led the average American investor to be overly concentrated in domestic equities, potentially missing out on better value and growth opportunities abroad. Emerging markets, particularly China and India, are highlighted as having long-term potential driven by large populations, strong demographics, and rapid economic growth. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF recently hit a 52-week high, suggesting growing investor interest in diversifying beyond the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that there is sufficient evidence to investigate whether the prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García on human-smuggling charges is an act of illegal retaliation by the Trump administration. The judge granted a hearing after noting that the charges were filed shortly after Ábrego successfully sued the administration over his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. The ruling highlighted "remarkable statements" by a deputy attorney general that seemed to link the prosecution to Ábrego's lawsuit. This case has become a focal point in the broader political conflict over the administration's aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>Days of violent protests in Pakistan-administered Kashmir have been called off after a civil rights alliance reached a deal with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which led to the deaths of at least ten people, were centered on demands for cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. Under the new agreement, the regional government has pledged to meet these demands and improve public services. The breakthrough came after Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sent a delegation to negotiate with the protest leaders, bringing a peaceful resolution to the widespread civil unrest.</p>

Ryan says that relocating has significantly improved his mental health and motivation, allowing him to escape the financial pressures he felt in the United States.

His Houston-based food truck, Goodies Soul Kitchen, became a major success by targeting the late-night crowd and focusing on high-quality service, bringing in over $1 million in gross revenue in its first full year. Matthews is now focused on expanding his food businesses and is committed to hiring other formerly incarcerated individuals, judging them on their skills rather than their records.</p>
