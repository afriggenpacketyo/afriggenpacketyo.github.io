          <p>Texas health officials have officially declared the end of the state's significant measles outbreak, following a period exceeding 42 days without any new reported cases in previously affected counties. Since its onset in late January, the outbreak led to 762 confirmed measles cases across Texas, with over two-thirds impacting children, and tragically resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. State health services commend the tireless efforts of public health professionals whose comprehensive response, including widespread testing, vaccination drives, and public awareness campaigns, was crucial for containment. Despite this positive milestone, officials caution that additional cases may still emerge in Texas due to ongoing national outbreaks, urging healthcare providers to maintain vigilance and test for compatible symptoms.</p>

          <p>Millions of current and former AT&T customers are now eligible to file claims for compensation from a substantial $177 million legal settlement stemming from two major data breaches that occurred in 2024. These breaches compromised sensitive personal information, including birth dates and Social Security numbers for 73 million account holders, and exposed call/text records for nearly all cellular customers. Eligible claimants can potentially receive up to $7,500, provided they furnish documentation proving losses directly traceable to the incidents. The proposed settlement awaits final approval from a federal judge in December 2025, with payments to be disbursed thereafter, offering recourse for affected individuals.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero has solidified his long-term commitment to the club by signing a new four-year contract, extending his tenure until 2029. The 27-year-old Argentine center-back, who initially joined Spurs on loan in 2021 before a permanent transfer, has become a pivotal figure, making 126 appearances and scoring eight goals. Notably, he recently captained the side to a Europa League final victory, ending the club's 17-year trophy drought. Despite summer speculation linking him to Atletico Madrid, Romero's new deal and appointment as club captain by new head coach Thomas Frank underscore his integral role in the team's future.</p>

          <p>A captivating display of northern lights, or auroras, is anticipated to be visible across more than a dozen U.S. states tonight, including Washington, Michigan, and Maine, following a forecast of a minor geomagnetic storm. This natural phenomenon occurs when atoms and molecules in Earth's atmosphere collide with solar flares, causing a vibrant spectrum of colors in the night sky. The auroras are expected to appear particularly vivid due to the current moon phase, which ensures a darker night sky. This increased activity is a direct result of the sun's magnetic field reaching its solar maximum phase, a period projected to continue through 2026, offering prime viewing opportunities.</p>

          <p>A superintendent in a Pennsylvania school district is revolutionizing music education by utilizing 3D printers to produce violins at a remarkably low cost of just $50 per instrument. Dr. Laura Jacob, inspired by the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra's use of plastic instruments, began this innovative program to alleviate the financial burden on families, particularly as over 70% of her students come from low-income households. In five years, she has successfully printed over 200 violins, offering them free to students and fostering a lifelong love for music. This initiative empowers children by removing barriers to access musical instruments.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise on Optimal CD Deposit Amounts Amidst Evolving Interest Rates</h2>

          <p>Financial experts are advising savers on optimal deposit amounts for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) this August, emphasizing the importance of aligning decisions with individual financial situations, emergency fund status, and liquidity needs. While short-term CDs currently offer attractive Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) of 5% or more, investors are encouraged to compare these returns against other low-risk options like high-yield savings accounts or Treasury bonds. The prospect of Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year suggests that locking in higher rates now could be a strategic move. Additionally, employing a CD laddering strategy is recommended to balance earning competitive interest with maintaining access to funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly agreed to the latest proposal from regional mediators, Egypt and Qatar, for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Israel. The comprehensive two-stage plan, based on a U.S. framework, would see Hamas release approximately half of the 50 remaining Israeli hostages—20 of whom are believed to be alive—during a 60-day temporary truce. Concurrently, negotiations would commence on a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. This development comes as Israel's cabinet is expected to approve plans to expand its offensive into Gaza City, following previous breakdowns in talks.</p>
