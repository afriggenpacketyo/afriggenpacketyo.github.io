          <p>Director Emerald Fennell, known for "Saltburn," has shared her vision for the upcoming film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights," starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi. Speaking in Haworth, Brontë's hometown, Fennell described her intent to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced reading the novel as a teenager. She acknowledged taking some creative liberties to fill in what she imagined as a 14-year-old, while still preserving much of the original dialogue. The film aims to be a deeply personal and visceral interpretation of the classic, scheduled for a Valentine's Day 2026 release.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed election technology company Smartmatic by repeatedly making false claims that its machines rigged the 2020 presidential election. The judge identified 51 specific instances where Lindell falsely alleged Smartmatic interfered with results in Los Angeles County. However, the court deferred a ruling on whether Lindell acted with "actual malice," a necessary finding for Smartmatic to collect damages, which its attorneys state could be in the "nine-figure" range. Lindell has vowed to continue his fight against voting machines.</p>

          <p>Researchers have announced a major breakthrough in the treatment of Huntington's disease, a fatal neurodegenerative condition with no current cure. A new gene therapy has been shown to slow the progress of the disease by 75% in a clinical trial, bringing profound hope to affected families. The treatment offers the prospect of managing a condition that combines symptoms of dementia, Parkinson's, and motor neurone disease. While the therapy still needs to go through regulatory approval and will likely be expensive, it represents a pivotal moment for a community that previously had no effective treatment options.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The architectural and urban planning principles long championed by King Charles are shaping the design of 12 new towns soon to be announced by the UK government. These new developments will prioritize walkability, "gentle density" with terraced housing instead of high-rises, and environmental sustainability, echoing the King's vision seen in projects like Poundbury. Once criticized by the architectural establishment, the King's focus on traditional styles, local materials, and community-focused public spaces is now seen as mainstream. The goal is to create communities rather than just housing sites, learning from the mistakes of post-war new towns.</p>

          <p>A BBC Radio 4 experiment, "The Great Influencer Experiment," followed three individuals with no social media presence as they attempted to build an online following over three months. A potter and stroke survivor, a historian, and a theatre performer each navigated the challenges of creating content, chasing views, and dealing with online feedback. The participants experienced the emotional toll of seeking validation through likes and views, the pressure of authenticity, and the time-consuming nature of content creation. While some found professional benefits, the journey highlighted the significant mental and emotional grind required to achieve social media traction.</p>

After securing the ball, Jameson overheard another fan hoping to get one for her mother, Donna Morey, who was celebrating her 80th birthday at the game. Realizing an older fan was less likely to be tossed a ball, Jameson walked over and gave his to her, stating she couldn't come to as many games as he could. Morey was shocked by the gesture, calling it a symbol of "goodness in this world."</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records concerning the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. The enduring mystery has captivated the public for nearly 90 years, spawning numerous theories about her fate. The move follows a request from a Republican lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands, who cited "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart being seen on the island of Saipan. While it is unclear what, if any, classified documents exist, the order aims to bring transparency to one of history's most famous unsolved cases.</p>

          <p>Southern California has experienced a dramatic display of at least 2,000 lightning strikes over the past two days, primarily occurring over the Pacific Ocean. The electrical storm is attributed to a slow-moving low-pressure system that has trapped moisture off the coast. This weather event precedes a forecast for potential thunderstorms and showers in the region over the weekend, particularly on Saturday afternoon. While most areas are expected to receive only light rainfall, there is a possibility of heavier downpours over recent burn scars, according to the National Weather Service.</p>

          <p>Team Europe has taken a commanding three-point lead over the United States after a dominant performance on the opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black. The Europeans won the morning foursomes session 3-1 and followed up by taking the afternoon fourballs 2.5-1.5. Key performances from Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood helped stifle the American team and quiet the home crowd. The strong start puts Europe in a favorable position to win its first Ryder Cup on American soil since 2012, leaving U.S. Captain Keegan Bradley under significant pressure heading into the second day.</p>
