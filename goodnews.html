          <p>President Donald Trump took to social media to announce he had personally solved a "whodunit" involving a large gash in the newly installed limestone in the White House Rose Garden. Writing that "Surfaces are very important to me as a Builder," Trump described how he demanded an investigation into the damage. According to his post, security footage revealed a subcontractor using a broken steel cart was responsible. Trump stated the stone will be replaced at the contractor's expense, and the company will be barred from future White House work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts are providing updated guidance on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that limits should be based on developmental stages. The general consensus recommends a "screen-free until three" approach, as young children need to explore their physical environment to develop crucial motor and cognitive skills. For older children, the focus shifts from just time limits to the quality of content and ensuring that screen use does not replace essential activities like physical play, social interaction, and imagination, which are vital for healthy development.</p>
