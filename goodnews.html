          <p>Amid rising geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing, wealthy mainland Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their capital away from U.S. real estate towards markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada. In 2024, these countries became the top choices for Chinese buyers seeking homes costing over US$5 million, a shift from 2023 when the U.S. was the preferred destination. Factors such as geopolitical friction, protectionism, and increased scrutiny of property deals have discouraged some buyers, leading them to seek friendlier alternatives.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition. The program provides families with $10,000 per year, with up to $30,000 for children with disabilities, and will cover up to 90,000 students in its first year. Supporters say it will give parents more educational options, while critics argue it will divert resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families. The program is capped at $1 billion for the first year but could cost up to $4.5 billion annually by 2030.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled against Malta's practice of offering citizenship to foreign investors, effectively banning the last 'golden passport' program in the EU. The court found that Malta's policy made nationality a mere commercial transaction, undermining the solidarity and mutual trust between member states. While purchased passports are now ruled out, 'golden visas' offering residence permits for real estate purchases or other major investments remain a concern, with the European Commission emphasizing the need for stricter monitoring and due diligence to mitigate security and corruption risks.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of people in common-law relationships have chosen not to legally marry due to the requirement to adopt the same surname, a law unique to Japan. The survey found that the rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% indicating they would marry if separate surnames were allowed. Conservative members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party oppose changing the law, citing concerns about traditional family values.

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with 12,000 net new coffee shops opening in the past year as the drink becomes more accessible to the masses. This expansion is fueled by aggressive competition, lower prices, and a government push to promote domestic beans.

The increasing popularity of coffee reflects a shift in consumer preferences and the evolving dynamics of China's beverage industry.</p>
