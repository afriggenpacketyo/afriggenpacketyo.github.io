          <p>Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the popular Labubu toy, expresses satisfaction as the toy's secondary market resale prices drop significantly, viewing it as a move towards a more sustainable model. The company, which ramped up production to meet demand and combat scalpers, stated its products are for genuine art connection, not just profit. Analysts suggest this pivot, following initial hype-driven desirability, is crucial for long-term customer retention and avoiding a "one-hit wonder" status. Pop Mart is expanding globally and investing in character animation to maintain relevance beyond the blind box craze. (not investment advice)</p>

This article underscores the medical community's concern that Trump's remarks could lead patients to unsafe alternatives, stressing the importance of physician consultation and the lack of scientific consensus on a causal link to autism.</p>
