          <p>According to CBS News, the royal family of Qatar is considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane, potentially to be given to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office. However, Qatar's Media Attach√© to the U.S. stated that the transfer is under review, and no decision has been made, disputing reports of an immediate gift. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres has called for an investigation into the ethics and legality of accepting such a gift from a foreign government, citing concerns about federal ethics regulations and the Emoluments Clause. The White House insists that any gift would be accepted in compliance with applicable laws.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Japan and Chile have reaffirmed the importance of free trade as both countries feel the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S. administration. During a meeting, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed his intent to deepen bilateral cooperation under the Trans-Pacific Partnership framework. This comes as Japan's FY 2024 current account surplus reaches a record high.

While Saudi Arabia has pledged $600 billion in US investments, Trump desires to raise that to $1 trillion, including increased military equipment purchases. Discussions will also focus on attracting Gulf investment into US tech firms and boosting the region's access to American semiconductors.</p>

President Trump expressed optimism, suggesting potential tariff reductions. However, Chinese officials emphasized the need for the U.S. to drop its "unilateral" tariffs first.

          <p>Neuroscientists in Switzerland have developed a "digital bridge" to help people with severe spinal cord injuries regain movement and other bodily functions. The technology sends signals wirelessly from the brain to the healthy part of the spinal cord, bypassing the injury. While walking again is a priority, patients also seek to restore bladder function, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation. Spinal cord stimulators may also show promise in helping people with Parkinson's disease regain mobility. Clinical trials are underway to assess the safety and efficacy of these therapies.</p>
