        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart's CFO John David Rainey indicated that despite recent agreements to lower tariffs on imports from China, consumers are likely to see price increases later this month. He explained that the magnitude of these increases is beyond what retailers or suppliers can absorb. While Walmart is working with vendors to mitigate the impact and plans to absorb some of the higher costs, Rainey noted the speed and magnitude of the price increases are unprecedented. The article also notes that Walmart is seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer due to its wide customer base. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall inflation has cooled, the prices of some everyday items, such as coffee and beef, are still soaring. Coffee prices have increased due to droughts in major producing regions like Vietnam and Brazil, limiting the global supply. Beef prices have risen due to a shortage stemming from drought conditions in 2022, which led to a reduction in the national beef herd. Additionally, car repair costs have increased due to the rise of high-tech vehicles and a shortage of skilled technicians, leading to higher compensation costs for repair companies. </p>

          <p>Walmart warned that even with reduced tariffs on China, the company may soon be forced to raise prices on certain items.

While Walmart will try to avoid passing import taxes onto customers, McMillon emphasized that higher tariffs will inevitably lead to increased prices.

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the drug crisis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Deaths declined across all major drug categories and in most states, marking the lowest tally since 2019. Experts attribute this decline to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and the use of naloxone. However, concerns remain about sustaining this progress, especially given proposed cuts to federal health programs addressing the drug crisis. Despite the decline, drug fatalities remain high, with over 80,000 deaths in 2024.</p>

          <p>Taylor Carty, a woman diagnosed with cerebral palsy, is fighting to remove barriers for aspiring doctors with disabilities after her acceptance to Wayne State University School of Medicine was rescinded. The university claimed she couldn't meet technical standards requiring unassisted performance of certain medical procedures. Carty filed a discrimination complaint, arguing that the university failed to provide reasonable accommodations as required by federal law. Experts say medical schools need to update their technical standards to be more inclusive, as disabled physicians bring crucial perspectives to the profession. Carty is now pursuing a Master of Public Health degree and advocating for policy changes to make the medical field more accessible.</p>

Powell highlighted the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing a difficult challenge for the economy and central banks. He has also noted the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation, complicating the Fed's efforts to balance employment and control inflation.</p>
