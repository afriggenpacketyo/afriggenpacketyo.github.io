        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of researchers is working to create NeoTest, a rapid and affordable diagnostic test for neonatal sepsis, a major cause of infant mortality in developing countries. The current methods for testing are slow, expensive, and often inaccurate, leading to delayed treatment and hundreds of thousands of infant deaths annually. The NeoTest team aims to secure $120 million for an advance market commitment, incentivizing manufacturers to develop a test that provides results within minutes and costs around $8 per test. The initiative seeks funding primarily from middle-income countries that would directly benefit, marking a shift towards self-reliance in global health initiatives. This innovative approach could save countless lives by improving antibiotic targeting and reducing antibiotic resistance.</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock has criticized Republican proposals to impose work requirements for Medicaid eligibility, arguing they would disproportionately harm hardworking Americans. Warnock cites studies showing that such requirements do not incentivize work and instead create bureaucratic hurdles that lead to coverage loss. He contends that providing healthcare access encourages employment by supporting a healthy workforce, advocating for expanded Medicaid coverage without these conditions. A Republican House budget resolution includes significant spending cuts to Medicaid through 2034, with work requirements being considered as a means to achieve these reductions, potentially impacting millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria after 14 years of civil war, a move hailed in Damascus as a chance for economic recovery and stability. The decision follows the establishment of a new interim government led by Ahmad al-Sharaa after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. The sanctions relief is expected to facilitate aid delivery, encourage investment from neighboring countries, and enable the rebuilding of devastated infrastructure. While challenges remain, including corruption and the scale of economic damage, the move is seen as a significant step toward revitalizing the Syrian economy and stabilizing the region.</p>

The court found that the commission did not adequately explain its refusal or demonstrate a thorough search for the messages.

          <p>Many institutions and individuals still assume that mothers are the default parent, even when fathers are equally or more involved in childcare. Research shows that schools and doctor's offices are more likely to contact mothers, regardless of which parent is listed as the primary contact. This assumption can disrupt mothers' work and create frustration for fathers who want to be more involved. Outdated software systems and societal stereotypes contribute to the problem, highlighting the need for a shift in perceptions and practices to support more equitable parenting roles.</p>
