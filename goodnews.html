        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 has turned positive for the year, driven by gains in consumer discretionary and information technology sectors, fueled by Tesla and Amazon. Microsoft is cutting 3% of its global workforce, but shares are not moving higher, likely due to investors anticipating a breather after strong earnings. Disney is launching a new ESPN streaming platform for $29.99 a month, aiming to offset declining linear TV revenue and bolster its streaming business. Upcoming earnings reports include CyberArk Software, JD.com, Sony, and Tencent; weekly mortgage applications are the only key economic report to watch. (not investment advice)</p>

Cifu apologized for his remarks, acknowledging they did not reflect the standards of the Florida Panthers organization. The Maple Leafs and Panthers are currently tied in their playoff series.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, slightly less than economists expected, indicating that price hikes remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing costs were a major driver of inflation, while energy costs also increased despite lower gasoline prices. Grocery prices dropped slightly, with egg prices declining 12.7% but remaining near historic highs due to bird flu outbreaks. Economists are watching for signs that Trump's tariffs are affecting consumer prices, although the impact may not be evident in economic data for several months.</p>
