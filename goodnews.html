          <p>New government data from England indicates that pupils who were partially absent during the first week of the 2024-25 school year were significantly more likely to become "persistently absent" later on, missing at least 10% of school. Over half of those partially absent in week one became persistently absent, compared to only 14% of those who fully attended. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged parents and schools to prioritize attendance at the start of the 2025 term, emphasizing that every missed day impacts a child's future. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains higher than pre-Covid levels, prompting calls for more support beyond school gates to boost engagement.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst reportedly plans not to seek reelection in 2026, according to a senior Republican official, opening the door for a competitive Senate race. Ernst, who was first elected in 2014, made history as the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran. Representative Ashley Hinson is already planning to announce a run for the soon-to-be-open seat. During her time in the Senate, Ernst held leadership positions and advocated for federal budget cuts, though she also faced scrutiny over a vote for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth despite her record as a sexual assault prevention advocate.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto is uniquely positioned to offer a new, pragmatic approach to global diplomacy. With Indonesia's extensive international relationships and its role as an economic powerhouse bridging competing ideologies, Prabowo's message could serve as a roadmap for a "next world order." The article argues that the current international system is often paralyzed by vetoes and national agendas, underscoring a pressing need for a new international framework. Prabowo's philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" is presented as a potential corrective model that prioritizes cooperation over confrontation, advocating for practical action over revolutionary rhetoric in a complex world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting September 1, Costco will enforce a new policy granting its Executive Members exclusive early shopping access, following a recent grace period. These premium members, who pay a $130 annual fee, will be allowed into stores an hour before other customers on most weekdays and 30 minutes earlier on Saturdays. This initiative aims to reward the company's "most loyal members" but has sparked considerable controversy and division among its broader customer base. This change is the latest in a series of significant shifts for Costco, which also recently transitioned from selling Pepsi to exclusively Coca-Cola products in its food courts, a decision that similarly elicited mixed reactions from its patrons.</p>

          <p>Guillermo del Toro's highly anticipated Netflix adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, realizing a project he has envisioned for decades. The ambitious film stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the creature, a role Elordi took on short notice after Andrew Garfield's departure due to scheduling conflicts. Del Toro emphasized his vision for a "newborn" and "beautiful" creature, focusing on humanizing monsters and exploring the central question of what it means to be human. Early reviews are mixed, with some praising its epic scale, artistic beauty, and emotional depth, while others found it somewhat safe or lacking substance, though most critics agreed it earned its significant runtime.</p>

          <p>The US Open has been characterized by a notable surge in player anger and frustration, with multiple high-profile incidents involving Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Jelena Ostapenko drawing significant attention. Players like Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff attribute the heightened emotions to a combination of factors, including the gruelling late-season schedule, the immense stakes of a Grand Slam, and the notoriously energetic New York crowds. While some, like Naomi Osaka, suggest certain players are inherently more volatile, the tournament's unique atmosphere appears to amplify these tendencies. This ongoing drama has become a major talking point, garnering increased social media engagement and reflecting the intense pressure athletes face.</p>

          <p>Mark Knoller, a revered CBS News White House correspondent and unofficial presidential historian, has died at 73. Knoller was known for his meticulous, self-imposed record-keeping of every presidential action, movement, and utterance across eight administrations, filling a crucial void in American history. Despite the competitive nature of journalism, he generously shared his encyclopedic knowledge with colleagues, historians, and even White House aides. After his voice began to fail, he reinvented himself as a prolific Twitter (now X) user, sharing news and insights with hundreds of thousands of followers. He is remembered by colleagues as the hardest-working, most devoted, and kindest journalist of his generation.</p>

          <p>A hotel's request to silence the chimes of Machynlleth's 150-year-old town clock overnight has been rejected by the town council. The Wynnstay Hotel co-owner, Huw Morgan, cited regular guest complaints about the clock, which chimes every fifteen minutes, and expressed dissatisfaction with the council's handling of the issue. The town council, which recently spent £55,000 to restore the clock, stated that its chimes are an integral part of the town's "character" and a tourist attraction. This decision means the hotel must wait six months to resubmit a proposal, highlighting a local conflict between preserving historical tradition and addressing modern noise concerns for local businesses and visitors.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," delves into her continued frustrations with dating, despite achieving immense success and pop superstardom with her previous chart-topping album. The album, described as shrewd and tangy, features a gallery of incompetent and unfulfilling male characters, from smooth talkers to self-improvement fanatics neglecting intimacy. The controversial album cover, depicting Carpenter kneeling with a man holding her hair, sparked debate about female submission, which she dismissed as critics missing the satirical point. Musically, the LP blends '70s AM-radio pop with country and dance, showcasing Carpenter's versatile vocals and sharp songwriting, even if some lyrics occasionally aim for memeability.</p>

          <p>Despite extensive research, there are no uniform international rules on safe screen time for children, as technology and social norms evolve rapidly. Experts generally agree on a precautionary principle, linking recommendations to developmental stages: "screen-free until age three," maximum 30 minutes for kindergarteners, and gradually increasing limits for older children. Concerns focus on how screen time replaces crucial developmental activities like motor skill development, social interaction, and language acquisition, with studies showing reduced parent-child verbal interaction. While acknowledging the benefits of technology, experts emphasize the importance of parental supervision, open communication, and setting clear boundaries to mitigate potential harms.</p>

Grealish's consecutive two-assist games mark a first for an Everton player in the Premier League.

          <p>Residents of Newtown, Powys, organized a spontaneous community effort to move thousands of fish from the Aberhafesp Brook after it "completely gone" due to prolonged dry weather and four recent heatwaves. Local resident Dave Lister discovered fish "gasping for air" in a shrinking puddle and, after reporting the incident to Natural Resources Wales (NRW) with no immediate assistance, rallied friends to relocate salmon, trout, and stickleback to the river. NRW later advised against moving fish during extreme conditions due to potential harm, but Lister argued their immediate intervention was better than leaving them to die. This event highlights the severe impact of recent heatwaves and drought conditions on aquatic ecosystems in Wales, prompting concerns about wider environmental effects.</p>
