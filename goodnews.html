          <p>Crystal Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson was central to the FA Cup final against Manchester City, making key saves and inspiring his team to a 1-0 victory. However, a controversial incident involving Henderson handling the ball outside the box to deny Erling Haaland a scoring opportunity sparked debate. While VAR checked the incident, no sanction was given, with the explanation that Haaland was not denied an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. Former player Wayne Rooney strongly disagreed with the decision, calling it a "100% a red card".</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for warning that prices would increase due to tariffs on imported goods, urging the company to "eat the tariffs" instead. Trump argued that Walmart, which made billions last year, should sacrifice profits to avoid charging customers more.
