          <p>Japan's government will introduce fast lanes for South Korean visitors at Tokyo's Haneda and Fukuoka airports throughout June to commemorate the 60th anniversary of normalized diplomatic relations. South Korea will reciprocate with similar lanes for Japanese travelers at Gimpo in Seoul and Gimhae in Busan, aiming to boost mutual exchange. This marks the first time Japan has established lanes exclusively for passengers of a specific nationality. The initiative targets visitors who have traveled between the two countries within the past year, streamlining immigration procedures for flights arriving between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.</p>

          <p>Corey O'Connor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, defeated incumbent Ed Gainey in the Democratic primary, signaling dissatisfaction with the city's current progressive leadership. O'Connor, supported by the party's "old guard" and some Republican donors, campaigned on revitalizing downtown and resourcing the police. Gainey, the city's first Black mayor, had focused on affordable housing and attracted the 2026 NFL Draft to Pittsburgh. The election outcome reflects a broader trend of challenges to progressive officeholders in traditionally Democratic cities.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has suspended its bonus scheme for senior executives following criticism over the company's performance and financial troubles. The scheme, which could have awarded executives up to 50% of their pay, was paused pending guidance from the regulator Ofwat. Downing Street expressed disapproval of the bonuses, given Thames Water's mismanagement and environmental issues. The company secured an emergency ¬£3bn loan in March to avoid collapse and is seeking to reduce its ¬£20bn debt.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new test that significantly reduces the time required to diagnose brain tumors, from weeks to hours. The "ultra-rapid" genetic testing method is considered a "game changer" by surgeons and could improve patient care. The method, developed at the University of Nottingham, has already been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate in diagnosing tumor types. The quicker diagnosis allows for more timely and effective treatment decisions, potentially reducing the need for multiple surgeries and alleviating patient anxiety.</p>
