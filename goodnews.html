          <p>David Ellison, the new CEO and chairman of the merged Paramount Skydance, has swiftly initiated a transformative strategy, securing a seven-year, $7.7 billion deal for exclusive UFC streaming rights and acquiring rights to develop a live-action Call of Duty film. He also brought in "Stranger Things" creators, the Duffer Brothers, for exclusive content and made a key executive hire, underscoring a commitment to significant investment in content and technology. The article also reports on Paramount Skydance's consideration of a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, which could further consolidate Ellison's media empire. These ambitious actions aim to reposition the company in the competitive entertainment landscape, though analysts anticipate a substantial investment phase before seeing a major financial upside.</p>

          <p>The widespread adoption of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Zepbound is significantly impacting the apparel retail industry, leading to a noticeable shift in clothing size demand. Resale stores are experiencing an influx of larger sizes and increased demand for smaller ones, a phenomenon dubbed the "Ozempic effect." While some retailers are reportedly reducing extended sizes on racks, experts caution against abandoning the plus-size market, which remains underserved. The article notes that price reductions and new drug formats could further accelerate this trend, influencing inventory management and production strategies across the industry.</p>

          <p>South Africa has reopened the inquest into the 1977 death of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, nearly 48 years after his passing in police custody. Authorities initially claimed Biko died from accidentally hitting his head, but this new inquiry aims to uncover the truth behind what is widely believed to be his brutal torture and murder. The National Prosecuting Authority seeks to provide closure to Biko's family and society, following previous inquiries like the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that offered amnesty.

While a common solution, raising the age disproportionately affects lower-income individuals who have shorter life expectancies. The article advocates for a more progressive approach, such as raising the retirement age only for the top 40% of earners, as outlined in a Brookings reform plan. This strategy, combined with other progressive benefit cuts and tax hikes, aims to ensure the program's solvency while protecting vulnerable populations. (not investment advice)</p>
