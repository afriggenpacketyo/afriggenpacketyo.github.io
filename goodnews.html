          <p>Shares of bitcoin miner and data center operator TeraWulf surged over 10% following an announcement that Google increased its stake in the company. This deal raises Google's stake from 8% to 14% and provides up to $1.4 billion in additional financial backstop, bringing the total to about $3.2 billion. The investment is intended to fund the expansion of TeraWulf's Lake Mariner facility in New York for advanced artificial intelligence infrastructure. This news follows a recent spike in stock value after the company signed two 10-year computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open reveals that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills has significantly increased contraceptive use among people who previously used no method or less effective ones. Researchers found that nearly a third of individuals using the OTC pill, Opill, had previously used no contraception at all. The study highlights that users of the non-prescription pill were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and live in rural areas, suggesting it successfully reduces barriers to access. Experts believe this increased accessibility is a crucial tool for reproductive autonomy.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner humorously recounted her "vile" experience filming a kissing scene with her former "Game of Thrones" co-star, Kit Harington, for their new horror film, "The Dreadful." Turner explained on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" that their close bond, having played siblings for years, made the romantic scenes incredibly awkward. She recalled that after she suggested Harington for the role, he pointed out the script's romantic elements, which she had overlooked. On set, both actors reportedly felt like retching during their first kissing scene due to their brother-sister-like relationship off-screen.</p>

Coach Sean McVay confirmed Stafford's return but stated there were no further updates, indicating the team will monitor his progress on a day-to-day basis.

          <h2>Experts Explain How Reinvesting Dividends Can Significantly Boost Investment Returns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:28:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advocate for dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a straightforward method for investors to leverage the power of compound interest. Instead of receiving cash payouts, a DRIP automatically uses dividends to purchase more shares of the same stock, including fractional shares. This passive strategy is particularly beneficial for long-term investors who may not actively manage their portfolios, as it ensures their money is consistently working for them. Historical data shows this approach can lead to substantially higher total returns over time compared to simply collecting cash dividends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, resolving a defamation lawsuit over false claims broadcast by the network about the 2020 presidential election. Dominion had sued Newsmax for $1.6 billion, arguing the conservative media outlet knowingly aired devastating lies about its voting machines. This settlement follows a previous landmark $787 million settlement between Dominion and Fox News over similar claims. According to an SEC filing, Newsmax will pay the amount in three installments, with the final payment due in January 2027.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a long-sought leader of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel, is scheduled to plead guilty in a Brooklyn federal court to numerous drug trafficking charges. Zambada, 77, is accused of overseeing a violent global operation that involved torture, murder, and smuggling vast quantities of illicit drugs into the United States. This development comes after federal prosecutors announced they would not seek the death penalty. Zambada was arrested in Texas last year after decades of evading capture, and his plea marks a significant moment in the U.S. effort against international drug cartels.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Advise on the Optimal Timing for Taking Out a Reverse Mortgage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:01:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that the best age for a senior to take out a reverse mortgage depends on individual circumstances, including health, income needs, and long-term financial goals. Generally, waiting until one's early 70s is often recommended, as older borrowers typically qualify for larger loan amounts and have a clearer picture of their retirement needs. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without making monthly payments, but it reduces the equity left for heirs. It can be a useful tool to supplement retirement income or delay taking Social Security benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

During a post-match press conference, Amorim pushed back against questions about his choice, explaining that Onana was not fully match-fit after a recent injury. He emphasized that Bayindir had performed well during the pre-season and earned his spot, stating that dropping him would undermine the team's group philosophy.

          <p>The Texas Department of State Health Services has officially declared that the state's significant measles outbreak is over. The declaration was made after 42 days—twice the disease's maximum incubation period—passed without a new reported case in affected counties. The outbreak, which began in January, resulted in 762 confirmed cases, primarily among children, and led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health officials credited the containment to a comprehensive response involving testing, vaccination, and public education, but warned that vigilance is still needed due to ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S.</p>

The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to establish a separate identity for the network. The move comes nearly 30 years after the channel's founding as a partnership between Microsoft (MS) and NBC.</p>

          <p>As discussions continue regarding international support for Ukraine, an analysis of aid commitments reveals key financial details. According to the Kiel Institute, a German think tank, the United States has committed a total of $130.6 billion to Ukraine between January 2022 and June 2025. In contrast, European nations combined have contributed a larger sum of $165.7 billion over the same period, which includes military, financial, and humanitarian assistance. While the U.S. remains the largest single-country donor, the data contradicts claims that America's financial support vastly outweighs that of its European allies.</p>

The move comes amid increasing political pressure on drugmakers to lower medication costs in the U.S. and follows a similar price reduction for its weight-loss drug, Wegovy.
