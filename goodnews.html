          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage with a remark that he had never bought a bag of rice, as he receives it from supporters, at a time when the public is struggling with soaring rice prices. The comment was seen as out of touch and added to public frustration over the government's handling of the rice shortage, which has led to rationing in some supermarkets. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister. The resignation comes ahead of a crucial parliamentary election, posing a challenge to Ishiba's already unpopular government.</p>

          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq has won the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp,' becoming the first Kannada language book to receive the honor. Translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, the stories poignantly depict the hardships faced by Muslim women in southern India. Mushtaq's work mirrors the challenges these women encounter, including religious conservatism and a patriarchal society. Her win highlights the value of attention to lives lived at the edges and the strength required to persist, as noted in a review by the Indian Express newspaper.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed a bill into law legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients, making it the 11th state to enact such a statute. The End-of-Life Options Act allows mentally capable adults with a terminal illness and six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. The law includes safeguards such as mandatory counseling, waiting periods, and a second medical opinion on the patient's prognosis. Supporters of the bill argue that it provides compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice in the face of unimaginable suffering.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to "pause" its scheme to pay out bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its ¬£3 billion rescue loan, following public and governmental criticism. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, which could have led to them getting ¬£1m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses. Downing Street stated that rewarding executives for failure was unacceptable, and the Environment Secretary accused Thames of trying to circumvent rules to ban water company bonuses. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with public expectations.</p>
