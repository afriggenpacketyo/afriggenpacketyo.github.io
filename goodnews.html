          <p>Dan Wang, a keen observer of contemporary China, has characterized the nation as an "engineering state," contrasting it with the "lawyerly state" of the US. China's rapid development of infrastructure, from subway systems to high-speed rail, showcases its commitment to engineering and technology. The country's STEM graduates significantly outnumber those in the US, and many top officials are engineers. This article highlights China's focus on engineering as a matter of national security and priority. </p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs May Have Been Domesticated in China as Early as Neolithic Period</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, potentially challenging the conventional view that domestication first occurred in the Near East. The study, analyzing two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, found evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. This discovery indicates that the domestication process of wild boars coincided with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. The article presents new insights into the history of animal domestication. </p>
