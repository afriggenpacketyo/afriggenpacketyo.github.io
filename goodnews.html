          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing a thorough examination of his heart condition. The 91-year-old was admitted to the University of Tokyo Hospital following a health checkup that revealed signs of myocardial ischemia. Akihito had previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022. He abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, becoming the first Japanese monarch to step down in approximately two centuries, and his health has been closely monitored since.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have developed a close, trusting relationship rooted in their shared commitment to defending Ukraine's sovereignty against Russian encroachment.

          <p>Hainan, a tropical island province off China‚Äôs southern coast, is positioning itself as a major shopping destination to benefit from the intensifying trade war with the United States. The island's duty-free stores are set to gain a further advantage as Hainan prepares to launch its own separate customs regime, allowing it to avoid the retaliatory tariffs imposed by Beijing on American imports. The goal is that this policy will attract more visitors to the island‚Äôs duty-free shops by offering cheap iPhones and U.S. cosmetics, helping to drive a surge in tourism.</p>

          <p>President Trump has agreed to lift the 25 percent tariffs on steel from Britain, providing relief to the country's struggling steel industry. The tariffs, which went into effect in March, had added substantial costs and complexities to British steel makers already facing weak demand and high energy costs. While company officials express relief, uncertainties remain regarding products shipped to the United States via European Union countries. This article is from The New York Times.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's representative has denied any involvement in creative decisions on "It Ends With Us," the movie starring Blake Lively, amidst a legal battle. Swift was reportedly subpoenaed in the lawsuit between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, but her spokesperson stated that her only involvement was licensing her song ‚ÄúMy Tears Ricochet‚Äù for the film. Baldoni alleges that Lively and Ryan Reynolds pressured him to accept changes to the script, with Lively referring to Swift and Reynolds as her "dragons." Swift's team claims the subpoena is a ploy to draw public interest rather than focusing on the case's facts.</p>

          <p>With interest rates decreasing, first-time home buyers are finding innovative ways to enter the housing market, including using Lifetime ISAs, income booster mortgages, and relocating to cheaper areas. Many are also opting for shared ownership schemes or buying fixer-uppers to make homeownership more accessible. One couple saved for nearly three years using Lifetime ISAs to buy a three-bedroom flat, while another used an income booster mortgage by adding a family member's income. These strategies offer various pathways to homeownership despite rising house prices.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has been released from immigration custody following a judge's order for her to be freed on bail. The judge cited concerns that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when she was detained after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. Ozturk was arrested for an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. The court ruled that her continued detention was unwarranted, allowing her to return to her studies and community.</p>

          <p>In Bristol, dedicated police teams are working to combat night-time exploitation by engaging with street sex workers and disrupting kerb crawlers. The approach focuses on criminalizing the men buying sexual services rather than the women, who are often vulnerable. Police officers conduct patrols, issue community protection warnings, and send offenders to courses to prevent reoffending. This tactic, aligned with the Nordic Model, aims to safeguard the women and reduce harm. The police also work with charities to offer support and gather intelligence from the sex workers.</p>

          <p>A new TV drama about the 1988 Lockerbie bombing highlights how flaws in the initial victim response influenced subsequent protocols, including those used after 9/11. Kara Weipz, who lost her brother in the bombing, recalls learning about his death from a news report, which underscored the need for families to be notified before names are released. The efforts of victims' families led to key reforms, from strengthening travel warning systems to tighter baggage screening. The drama also emphasizes the role of volunteers and the strength of bonds forged in the aftermath of the tragedy.</p>
