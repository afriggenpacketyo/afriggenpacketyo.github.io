        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. home equity levels at a record high, homeowners have a significant borrowing source available as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates. Current average rates for home equity loans hover around 8.2% to 8.4%, making any rate near this range a competitive offer for prospective borrowers. The article also contrasts these with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently feature lower variable rates but carry the inherent risk of future rate increases, requiring careful budgeting from homeowners.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite gold prices reaching a record high of over $4,000 per ounce, some top financial advisors argue that stocks remain a superior long-term investment. They point out that over a 30-year period, the S&P 500 has historically provided higher annualized returns than gold, attributing this to the power of compounding earnings and dividends. While gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, experts generally recommend limiting its allocation in a diversified portfolio to a low single-digit percentage.

Parton, 79, explained that she had to cancel some appearances to address health issues, including a kidney stone, which she had neglected after her husband's death earlier in the year, but assured everyone that she is not seriously ill.</p>

          <p>Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has publicly stated that manager Ruben Amorim needs a three-year timeframe to demonstrate his coaching abilities, dismissing speculation about his immediate future. Despite a poor start to the season and a 15th-place finish last year, Ratcliffe affirmed his support for Amorim and criticized the media's demand for "overnight success." He emphasized that the club will not make "knee-jerk reactions" and that his control over football decisions ensures Amorim will be given the necessary time to prove his worth.</p>

          <p>Nike CEO Elliott Hill is focusing on reviving the company's performance in China as a cornerstone of its global comeback strategy. After a failed direct-to-consumer push under his predecessor, Hill plans to re-center the brand on sport, transforming its 5,000 Chinese stores from sportswear-oriented to sport-led concepts, such as running-focused outlets. Sales in Greater China recently fell over 9%, and the company faces headwinds from U.S. tariffs, but leadership is confident that this strategic pivot will restore sustainable growth.

          <p>A lesser-known financial tool, the single-purpose reverse mortgage, offers a targeted solution for homeowners aged 62 and older who need funds for a specific, approved expense like property taxes or essential home repairs. Unlike more common reverse mortgages, these loans are typically offered by state or local agencies and come with lower costs but are restricted to a single use. While they allow seniors on fixed incomes to access home equity without monthly payments, their availability is limited and often contingent on income qualifications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil is on track to export a record 102.2 million tons of soybeans by the end of October, surpassing its full-year totals for both 2023 and 2024.

According to the grain exporter group Anec, China has accounted for nearly 80% of Brazil's total soybean exports this year, a historically high share for the South American agricultural powerhouse.
