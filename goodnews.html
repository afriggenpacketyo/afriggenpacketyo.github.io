          <p>A Fox News opinion article uses the historical journey of Christopher Columbus as a metaphor for the importance of courage in overcoming personal challenges and achieving one's potential. The author reflects on the immense risks Columbus took by sailing across the Atlantic in small ships with limited navigational tools, framing it as an act of profound bravery. While acknowledging the modern controversy surrounding Columbus and the rise of Indigenous Peoples' Day, the article focuses on the theme of courage to inspire readers. It encourages individuals to confront fear, break negative habits, and pursue their goals despite uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A heartwarming story recounts how a college professor's act of kindness enabled a struggling student to continue her education in 1971. Silvana Clark, who was financially abandoned by her parents after high school, was on the verge of dropping out of community college due to a lack of funds. Her drama professor, George Meshke, told her she had received a "college drama scholarship" that would cover her next semester's tuition. Clark later discovered that no such scholarship existed and that Professor Meshke had paid for her tuition himself, a gesture that allowed her to ultimately graduate.</p>

          <p>On a landmark trip to the Middle East to finalize a Gaza peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that the war is over. The statement was made in Tel Aviv as he arrived to mark the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas for over two years. As part of the agreement, Hamas is expected to disarm, and Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the remaining hostages. Trump is scheduled to address the Israeli parliament before traveling to a major international summit in Egypt to formalize the end of the conflict, a significant geopolitical development.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa is currently debating the decriminalization of sex work, a move supported by advocacy groups to protect the rights and safety of the country's estimated 150,000 sex workers. Proponents argue that current laws make workers vulnerable to extreme violence, with studies indicating nearly 60% have been sexually assaulted, sometimes by police officers. A national moratorium on prosecuting sex workers is in place until a high court trial in May 2026, which will decide the constitutionality of the existing laws. Opponents, however, contend that sex work is inherently exploitative and should remain criminalized.</p>

          <p>The European Union is actively seeking to engage younger citizens, known as Gen Z, on key policy issues like cyberbullying to foster greater confidence in its democratic processes.

This outreach comes as surveys indicate significant skepticism among young Europeans, with many feeling the EU is not democratic or is poorly implemented, reflected in declining youth voter turnout. By involving them in policy-making, the EU hopes to demonstrate its relevance and build trust with a generation crucial for its future.</p>
