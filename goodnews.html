          <p>Robyn Denholm, Tesla's board chair, has sold $198 million in Tesla stock in the past six months, bringing her total profit to over $530 million since becoming board leader. These sales raise questions about her confidence in Tesla's prospects, especially as Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration and polarizing political activities have impacted car sales. Despite Musk advising employees to hold onto their stock, Denholm's sales, executed under a prearranged trading plan, have far outstripped those of other Tesla directors. A spokesman for Denholm said Tesla paid board members in a manner that was ‚Äúcompletely aligned with shareholder interests.‚Äù</p>

          <p>The Kurdish militant group PKK announced it would end its "work under the name of PKK," potentially impacting Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. The PKK's disarmament could reassure Turkey, which has accused the SDF of being a PKK proxy. The deal between the SDF and Damascus could be facilitated by a successful peace process between Turkey and the PKK. Resolving the PKK-Turkey conflict could lead to a Turkish military withdrawal from Iraqi territory. However, some PKK supporters may not be happy with the decision, potentially leading to continued fighting.</p>

          <p>The "de minimis" tariff rate on low-value parcels from China will come down to 54% from 120%, the White House said in an executive order Monday, after reaching an agreement with Beijing over the weekend. The so-called de minimis package loophole had long allowed Chinese e-commerce firms to ship low-value goods to U.S.-based customers duty-free. The end of the de minimis exemption has upended the business models of companies like Shein and Temu, leaving U.S. consumers unable to procure affordable fashion from the popular e-commerce sites.</p>

The book follows researchers who have studied the paisa mutation, which causes the illness in nearly everyone who inherits it. Smith also tells the stories of some members of the 6,000-person clan who participate in research trials, donate loved ones‚Äô brains, and care for one another while bracing for their turn. Through the characters she speaks with over six years, Smith suggests that forgetting might be more than just an existential loss; it might also be a chance to explore other forms of humanity that are grounded in feeling, presence, or touch.</p>
