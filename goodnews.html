          <p>Meta is aggressively pursuing AI talent, reportedly attempting to acquire Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence and later targeting its CEO, Daniel Gross, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman after the acquisition failed. Meta will also get a stake in NFDG, Gross and Friedman's venture capital firm, as part of the deal, with both men joining Meta to work on AI products. This move is part of a broader AI talent war among major tech companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, all vying to develop advanced large language models and achieve artificial general intelligence. The competition includes offering substantial signing bonuses and compensation packages to lure top AI engineers and researchers. (not investment advice) Optimism in the industry remains relatively high as companies continue to invest in AI research and development, suggesting that technological advancement is still possible.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, which made landfall in Mexico's Oaxaca state as a Category 3 hurricane, has weakened to a tropical storm, leaving flooded streets and damaged infrastructure. Although wind speeds have decreased, officials are still cautioning about the risk of life-threatening flooding and mudslides, particularly in areas with steep terrain. While there have been no immediate reports of deaths, two hospitals have been damaged, and over 123,000 users in Oaxaca experienced power outages, some of whom have had service restored. The storm underscores the importance of disaster preparedness and infrastructure resilience in coastal regions prone to extreme weather events.</p>

Cadman noted that Doodle saved the day, barking and growling at the bear until it left the premises.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate reached 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, increasing pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to raise interest rates. The figure exceeded economists' expectations and is above the BOJ's 2% target, marking the 38th consecutive month of inflation exceeding this benchmark. Despite the rising inflation, the BOJ has maintained its interest rates at 0.5%, while Governor Kazuo Ueda has indicated that the central bank will continue to raise rates once underlying inflation is convincingly near 2%. (not investment advice) These economic indicators suggest that Japan's central bank may face increasing pressure to adjust its monetary policy in the near future.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted an injunction requested by 20 Democratic-led states, arguing that the administration was unlawfully holding federal funds hostage to coerce them into adhering to Trump's immigration policies. The states contended that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. This ruling highlights the ongoing legal battles between states and the federal government over immigration enforcement and funding.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution, with a decrease of up to 47% in the share of waste consisting of plastic bags collected during coastal cleanups. The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full bans, while partial bans were the least effective. California's experience with plastic bag regulations highlights the importance of policy design, as initial bans led to an increase in thicker plastic bags. The research suggests that stricter laws and fewer loopholes can make a measurable difference in curbing plastic pollution.</p>
