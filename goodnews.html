          <p>House Democrats are appealing to Attorney General Pam Bondi to prevent the closure of the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office established during the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The office, known as the "peacemakers program," focuses on preventing and resolving racial and ethnic conflicts and civil disorders. The Democrats' letter emphasizes the agency's role in combating violence and ensuring the safety of places of worship, particularly after recent attacks. The Community Relations Service has a history of mediating racial tensions, including after police shootings and during the trial of Derek Chauvin, and its potential closure raises concerns about the nation's ability to address future unrest.</p>

          <p>A group of protesters mistakenly gathered outside Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's mansion, believing that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was holding a press conference there. However, the actual press conference took place more than half a mile away, where Noem addressed the state's sanctuary policies and highlighted cases of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Pritzker responded with a statement defending Illinois' policies, creating a stark contrast between the two administrations' approaches to immigration. The protesters' efforts to disrupt the event were ultimately in vain, as they were directing their anger towards an empty target.</p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly withdrawing Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's nomination for U.S. Surgeon General following complaints from right-wing activist Laura Loomer and questions about her credentials. Loomer criticized Nesheiwat's medical degree and her pro-vaccine stance, despite her later opposition to vaccine mandates for children. The withdrawal follows scrutiny of Nesheiwat's public profile, which listed a medical degree from the University of Arkansas when she received it from American University of the Caribbean. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News medical contributor, is the sister-in-law of Mike Waltz, recently nominated as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for North Carolina's state Supreme Court, has conceded to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs, ending his six-month effort to challenge the election results.

This outcome is considered a significant victory for Democrats in the state and increases their chances of regaining the majority of the court in the future.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, Hilaria Baldwin addresses the controversy surrounding accusations that she faked a Spanish accent. She defends her speech, attributing it to "code-switching," a common tendency among bilingual speakers, and mentions her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which can affect speech. Baldwin recounts the online backlash and media scrutiny she faced in 2020, stating that it was "miserable trying to explain it on the world stage." The memoir marks her return to public life since the accent accusations and her husband's involvement in a fatal on-set shooting.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators has sent a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., expressing concerns that cuts to the agency could negatively impact the Indian Health Service (IHS). The senators highlight the IHS's role in providing care to over 2.8 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, a vulnerable population already facing health disparities. They warn that the hiring freeze and cuts to other HHS agencies serving Native communities are exacerbating existing staffing issues. The senators urge Kennedy to ensure that IHS programs have the resources and staffing necessary to fulfill their missions.</p>
