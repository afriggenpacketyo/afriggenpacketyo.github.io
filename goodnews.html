          <p>Labor Day, celebrated on the first Monday of September, honors the contributions of American workers and marks the unofficial end of summer. Originating from the labor movement in the late 19th century, the federal holiday means that government offices, banks, and the postal service will be closed. Most major retailers and grocery stores are expected to remain open, though some, like Costco, will be closed, and others may have limited hours, so shoppers are advised to check with local establishments beforehand.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced the expansion of the NYPD's Quality of Life Division, a program targeting issues like homeless encampments and public drug use. Despite a recent fatal shooting, Adams expressed confidence in the city's ability to manage crime independently, stating the expansion is unrelated to President Trump's federal crackdown in Washington, D.C. While acknowledging the need for federal help to stop the flow of illegal guns, he maintained that NYC's crime statistics demonstrate local success.</p>

In one, two childhood cancer survivors who were treated for leukemia together at age four rediscovered each other 17 years later as first-year medical students. In another remarkable account, an Arkansas hairstylist's sharp eye and persistence led to the early detection of skin cancer on her client's scalp, ultimately saving her life. Both narratives underscore the profound impact of shared experiences and the importance of paying close attention to others.</p>

          <p>Conservative network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems to resolve a defamation lawsuit over false claims made about the 2020 election. The settlement follows a similar, larger case between Dominion and Fox News, and comes after a judge ruled that Newsmax had indeed defamed the voting machine company. Despite the settlement, Newsmax issued a statement maintaining that its coverage was fair and conducted within professional journalistic standards.</p>

          <p>The US Open has revamped its mixed doubles tournament, attracting a star-studded field of top singles players with a new pre-tournament schedule and a $1 million prize. High-profile pairings include Carlos Alcaraz with Emma Raducanu and Novak Djokovic with Olga Danilovic, generating significant buzz for an event often overlooked. However, the changes have drawn criticism from doubles specialists, many of whom were unable to enter the 16-team draw because entry was based on singles rankings.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill proposes awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Ed Dwight, America's first Black astronaut candidate and, at 91, the oldest person to have traveled to space. After facing prejudice that ended his NASA career in the 1960s, Dwight became a successful entrepreneur and a nationally acclaimed sculptor focused on Black history. This honor would recognize his pioneering achievements in both aviation and art, celebrating a lifetime of breaking barriers and contributing to American culture.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain How Reinvesting Stock Dividends Can Significantly Boost Long-Term Returns</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts recommend using dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a simple yet powerful strategy to enhance portfolio growth over the long term. Instead of receiving dividends as cash, a DRIP automatically uses the funds to purchase more shares of the same stock, often including fractional shares. This process harnesses the power of compound interest, significantly increasing an investment's total return over time compared to price appreciation alone, as demonstrated by the performance of S&P 500 ETFs.

          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best time for seniors to consider a reverse mortgage is typically in their late 60s to early 70s. This financial tool allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly repayments, but waiting allows for access to a larger loan amount. The decision should be based on individual circumstances, including long-term financial goals, other retirement income sources, and a firm commitment to aging in place, as moving triggers loan repayment.
