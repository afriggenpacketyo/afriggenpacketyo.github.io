          <p>Verizon has named former PayPal CEO Dan Schulman as its new chief executive officer, replacing Hans Vestberg, who has led the telecommunications company since 2018. Schulman, who has served on Verizon's board since 2018, is tasked with redefining the company's trajectory by focusing on market share growth and improved financial metrics. Vestberg will remain on the board and serve as a special advisor to ensure a smooth transition, particularly for the pending acquisition of Frontier Communications.

Feldman explained the withdrawal was necessary to update the company's prospectus with improved financials, a revised strategy for the evolving AI landscape, and information about new investors from a recent $1.1 billion funding round. The company, known for producing large-scale chips that compete with Nvidia's GPUs, has also expanded into cloud services by operating its own AI data centers.

          <p>Lithuania is developing "TechZity," a large-scale startup hub in its capital, Vilnius, with the ambitious goal of making the startup sector contribute 25% of the country's GDP by 2030. The €100 million project aims to house 5,000 workers and foster innovation by creating a dense, creative environment. This strategy follows the success of Lithuania's fintech sector, which thrived due to favorable regulations and direct access to the central bank. However, challenges remain, including access to capital and the need for more skilled personnel, particularly in the defense tech sector.</p>

These figures represent the biggest opening week in the UK since 2017 and Swift's personal best sales week in the U.S. The album also set a new record for single-week vinyl sales, with 1.2 million copies sold, bolstered by the release of eight collectible variants. This commercial success stands in stark contrast to the general decline in album sales across the music industry.</p>

          <p>Nike CEO Elliott Hill acknowledged that the company's turnaround will "take a while" as it works to return to profitable growth. In his first year, Hill has focused on reversing his predecessor's strategy by shifting focus back to wholesale partners instead of prioritizing direct-to-consumer digital sales. The company is also restructuring internally to focus on individual sports categories to reignite innovation, an area where critics say Nike has fallen behind. Despite early signs of progress, the company's stock has fallen about 12% over the last year amid declining sales and macroeconomic pressures like tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

New Zealand's performance was lackluster, with their batting lineup collapsing to lose seven wickets for just 44 runs after being in a strong position.

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates, spurred by the Federal Reserve's first rate cut of 2025, has made homeownership more affordable. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.34% from nearly 7% at the beginning of the year. For a $550,000 mortgage, this decrease translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of about $3,419, which is over $200 less per month compared to January's rates. This reduction in borrowing costs provides significant savings for new buyers and creates potential refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners who previously secured higher rates.
