        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has once again rejected an effort by former President Donald Trump to have a defamation lawsuit filed by the exonerated "Central Park Five" dismissed. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit was filed by the five men‚ÄîYusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, and Korey Wise‚Äîwho were wrongfully convicted in a 1989 assault case. They allege Trump defamed them by falsely claiming during a presidential debate that they had killed someone and pleaded guilty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a significant backbench revolt that forced a U-turn on welfare reform, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has described fixing the "broken" benefits system as a "moral imperative." Speaking at a party conference, he affirmed that the government would protect the welfare safety net but would not allow it to become a "snare" for those able to work. The government had to alter its plans to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) after facing a potential defeat in the Commons. Despite the concessions, some Labour MPs and the Unite union are still pushing for more changes.</p>

          <p>Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, a pioneering couple in Maryland's fight for marriage equality, are reflecting on the 10th anniversary of the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. Although their 2004 lawsuit was unsuccessful in court, their public advocacy helped pave the way for Maryland to legalize same-sex marriage by referendum in 2012, two years before the Supreme Court's decision. The couple shared their personal struggles, from being denied access in a hospital delivery room to fighting for health insurance for their children. They expressed concern over recent efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, calling such movements "unnecessary and cruel."</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University has invented a specialized printer to create braille labels for a Baltimore brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a way to print braille on plastic beer labels that commercial printers couldn't handle. The students designed the machine to be operated by BISM's blind and low-vision employees, featuring open hardware for tactile interaction. The invention will be used for an annual fundraiser beer, "Blind Spot," brewed by Checkerspot Brewing Company to support individuals with vision loss.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed at new record highs, navigating a week that began with significant geopolitical risk following U.S. military action in Iran. The market initially reacted with fear, but quickly shrugged off concerns, betting that the conflict would not escalate into a wider war that could impact economic growth or corporate earnings. A key factor was the rapid decline in oil prices after an initial surge, which eased inflation fears. Additionally, despite mixed signals from the Federal Reserve, investors are increasingly pricing in the likelihood of three interest rate cuts by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New genetic research on skeletons from √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a 9,000-year-old Neolithic city in modern-day Turkey, suggests it may have been a matriarchal or matrilineal society. By analyzing DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses, researchers found that where biological connections existed, they were traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to their birth homes. The study also noted that grave goods were five times more common for females, reinforcing the idea of a society where maternal lineage was central to social structure.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor lacerations to her leg and foot in what officials believe was likely a bite from a juvenile shark at Jones Beach, New York. The woman was in waist-deep water when the incident occurred but did not see what bit her. After examining photos of the non-life-threatening injuries, experts concluded the bites were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Swimming was temporarily suspended, but patrols by drones and lifeguards will continue through the summer, even as officials emphasize that unprovoked shark bites remain extremely rare worldwide.</p>

The strong performance was attributed to recent car upgrades, including a revised front suspension, and the Red Bull Ring's characteristics suiting the McLaren.

The parent company, Stellantis, stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect.
