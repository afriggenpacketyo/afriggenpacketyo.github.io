        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves reports that the UK economy is 'beginning to turn a corner' after experiencing a 0.7% growth in the first three months of the year, surpassing analysts' forecasts. This growth was primarily fueled by increased consumer spending and business investments. While Reeves acknowledges the ongoing cost of living crisis for many families, she remains optimistic about the economy's trajectory, noting that the UK is poised to be the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during this period. However, some economists caution that this growth rate may not be sustainable due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased employer taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall inflation has cooled down, certain everyday items like coffee and beef continue to experience rapid price increases. Coffee prices have soared nearly 10% year-over-year due to droughts in major coffee-producing regions like Vietnam and Brazil, impacting global supply. Beef prices are also up due to a supply shortage stemming from drought conditions in 2022, which led to ranchers selling off more cattle than usual. Other items experiencing price hikes include car repairs, driven by the increasing complexity of modern vehicles, and men's and women's outerwear, potentially influenced by shifting consumer tastes and specialty brands.

          <p>The New York Times analyzes winning Eurovision entries since 2000, identifying key ingredients for success. These include singing about personal liberation, using English lyrics, alluding to folk music, and creating an over-the-top stage performance with fire or pyrotechnics. The article advises against dramatic key changes and novelty acts, noting that while some folk elements can add flavor, pure folk songs don't win. The analysis highlights past winners like Conchita Wurst, Ruslana, and Lordi to illustrate these strategies, emphasizing the blend of musical and visual spectacle needed to capture the Eurovision crown.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell sharply following President Trump's comments in Doha, Qatar, suggesting that the U.S. and Iran were close to securing a nuclear deal. The prospect of a deal raised expectations that economic sanctions on Tehran could be lifted, increasing global oil supply.

          <p>The New York Times reports on the complex political dynamics surrounding the Eurovision Song Contest, despite the competition's official stance of neutrality. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) faces challenges in maintaining impartiality amid geopolitical tensions, such as Israel's participation amid the Gaza conflict and Russia's exclusion following the invasion of Ukraine. Broadcasters in some countries have called for debates on Israel's participation, while the EBU emphasizes that Eurovision is a contest between broadcasters, not nations, and requires participants to refrain from political statements. The article highlights the difficulties in defining what constitutes a political statement and the ongoing efforts to balance entertainment with geopolitical sensitivities.</p>

          <p>During a traffic stop in Vallejo, California, police discovered half a pound of methamphetamine in the vehicle of 50-year-old Clifford Vincenty, leading to a search warrant at his residence.

Animal Control safely removed the animals, and the spider monkey was placed in the Oakland Zoo, while Vincenty faces additional charges related to the possession of exotic animals.

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the Trump administration's challenge to birthright citizenship, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, focusing primarily on the use of nationwide injunctions. The administration argues that federal judges overstepped their authority by issuing universal injunctions against the policy, which aims to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants. Legal experts and advocates are divided on whether nationwide injunctions are necessary to prevent manipulation of the legal system or if they unduly limit the executive branch's ability to implement policies.</p>

          <p>Axial Seamount, an underwater volcano located 300 miles off the coast of Oregon, is expected to erupt this year, potentially creating a hotspot for marine life. The volcano's impending eruption will heat seawater to over 700 degrees Fahrenheit and release minerals through hydrothermal vents, creating a chemical energy-based ecosystem. While the eruption is not expected to impact humans due to its depth and distance from shore, it will likely trigger small earthquakes. The site is closely monitored by the Ocean Observatories Initiative, making it a key location for studying underwater volcano forecasting.</p>

          <p>A UK political opinion poll tracker reveals that the Labour party's lead has diminished since their landslide victory last summer, with the Reform party gaining ground. Reform even held the lead in voting intention for the whole of February. The data, compiled from various pollsters, indicates shifts in support across different demographics and regions, with Reform gaining traction among younger voters. Support for the Conservatives remains robust with pensioners, but Farage‚Äôs grip is tightening in this age group as well. The analysis also tracks Prime Minister Starmer's approval ratings and explores potential seat projections for Reform in future elections.</p>
