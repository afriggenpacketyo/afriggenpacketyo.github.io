          <p>The upcoming film "Superman," directed by James Gunn, aims to present a more relatable version of the iconic hero. Actor David Corenswet, who plays the lead, and Gunn explain that this Superman is not indestructible and experiences loneliness, wanting to connect with humanity despite his alien origins. The film explores his vulnerability and sense of humor, with Gunn noting that in a world full of meanness, Superman's defining rebellious trait is his unwavering goodness. Corenswet embraces the iconic role, acknowledging it may define his career but feeling it is a worthwhile endeavor to embody such a positive character.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologist and "Shark Week" host Forrest Galante advises beachgoers to remain respectful of sharks but not to succumb to hysteria, noting the 50th anniversary of 'Jaws' has fueled fear. He explains that recent tracking of large sharks, like the great white 'Contender,' creates alarm, but these animals have likely followed the same routes for years unnoticed. Galante emphasizes that sharks do not intentionally hunt humans and offers practical advice to minimize risks, such as avoiding swimming at dawn and dusk, staying away from marine-rich areas like river mouths, and not wearing shiny jewelry which can mimic bait fish.</p>

Jeffries explained that their districts do not overlap and he has never had a substantive conversation with Mamdani.

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to partner in tackling obesity by making healthy food more appealing to customers. Under the strategy, retailers will decide on methods such as offering promotions, adjusting loyalty point incentives, or changing store layouts to encourage healthier shopping habits. Health Secretary Wes Streeting described the approach as a collaborative effort, differing from past "nanny state" policies. The initiative is part of a broader 10-year plan for the NHS, aiming to reduce obesity rates, which currently cost the health service ¬£11 billion annually.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples therapy suggests that answering "no" to four specific questions may indicate unrecognized unhappiness in a relationship. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, if they can be their authentic selves, if their partner is genuinely curious about their inner world, and if their partner takes accountability for mistakes. The article argues that healthy relationships require collaborative problem-solving, freedom of self-expression, sustained curiosity, and mutual responsibility. A consistent negative response to these points could signal that a relationship is on autopilot or mired in unhealthy dynamics.</p>

He described securing a majority for his ruling coalition, comprising the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito, as a "must-attain" goal but acknowledged it will be challenging. The election is seen as a public verdict on his minority government, which is grappling with issues like persistent inflation, stagnant wages, and economic uncertainty. The Kyodo News poll indicated that half of the respondents do not want the ruling coalition to maintain its majority in the upper house.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the narrative of a "sex recession," this article argues that Gen Z is spearheading a new sexual revolution defined by progressive politics and a reevaluation of traditional norms. While data shows young people are having less partnered sex than previous generations, they are also the most diverse in terms of gender and sexual identity and are highly politically engaged. The piece suggests that Gen Z's approach to sex is shaped by the overturning of Roe v. Wade and a desire to dismantle restrictive gender expectations. They are reframing concepts like virginity and fighting for sexual and reproductive freedoms with unprecedented activism.</p>

          <p>A new report from Vanguard shows a strong correlation between income and retirement savings, with higher earners accumulating significantly larger 401(k) balances. For instance, workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 have a median balance nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. The data highlights that despite economic uncertainty, many Americans continue to prioritize long-term savings. The study also found that automatic enrollment in company retirement plans has a major positive impact, with auto-enrolled employees having median balances roughly 60% higher than those who had to opt-in voluntarily.

Especially in a startup environment, Jain explains, every team member must be able to identify a problem, devise a solution, and then actively implement it.

The AI compares the stock market to a giant store where you can buy tiny pieces of companies, called shares, which companies sell to raise money for growth. It outlines the two main ways to make money: buying shares at a low price and selling them higher, or receiving dividends, which are small payments from a company's profits. The explanation also covers the risk of losing money if a company's stock price falls, simplifying complex financial concepts for a broad audience.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the Labour government is in a "better position" to pass its welfare reforms after making major concessions to avoid a backbench rebellion. The government was forced into a U-turn on its flagship bill after more than 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Key changes include limiting Pip cuts to new claimants and indexing the health-related component of Universal Credit to inflation. Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled but defended the reforms as necessary for the long-term sustainability of the welfare system.</p>
