          <p>London Pulse has won its first-ever Netball Super League championship, defeating the two-time defending champions Loughborough Lightning with a 53-45 victory in the Grand Final. The win at London's O2 Arena completes a treble for the team, which also topped the regular season table and won the Netball Super Cup. The Pulse's victory was built on a formidable defensive performance by player of the match Funmi Fadoju. The team's solid foundation allowed them to control the game's pace and restrict Lightning to their lowest score of the season.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, historian and filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most significant events in world history, as it introduced the concept of the citizen. He emphasized that the nation's founding was a messy, divisive "civil war" and that understanding this complexity makes the founders' ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued that the founders' vision requires active, educated citizenship and an ability to hold complex, sometimes contradictory, views of historical figures. He suggests this historical perspective offers optimism for navigating today's polarized political climate.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday morning. While tropical storm warnings have been canceled, the system is still expected to bring heavy rain to the Carolinas through Monday. Forecasters anticipate rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with localized amounts up to 6 inches, raising concerns about potential flash flooding as the storm moves inland. South Carolina's emergency management division had warned residents of possible minor coastal flooding and isolated tornadoes as the system approached.</p>

          <p>Two people were rescued from their SUV by courageous bystanders just moments before the vehicle was engulfed in a massive explosion in Herriman, Utah. The SUV had crashed into a Domino's Pizza restaurant, rupturing a gas line that subsequently ignited. Video of the incident shows the building erupting in a fireball shortly after the rescue. The two occupants of the vehicle, along with others involved in the three-vehicle accident, were hospitalized. The explosion destroyed the Domino's and caused significant damage to adjacent businesses, but miraculously, no one was injured by the blast itself.</p>

          <p>With a key deadline for new tariffs approaching, White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett indicated that the "rough outlines" of several international trade deals are becoming clear. He stated that news on finalized agreements would be forthcoming this week, with existing deals with the U.K. and Vietnam serving as potential models for other nations. Hassett suggested that President Trump's threat of high tariffs has successfully incentivized countries to negotiate and has spurred a "race" to move business activity into the U.S. The administration remains open to last-minute negotiations before the deadline passes.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris claimed his first-ever home victory in a chaotic and rain-affected British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Norris inherited the lead after his teammate Oscar Piastri, who had led for much of the race, was handed a 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety car restart. The win reduces Norris's deficit in the drivers' championship and was described by him as a moment of "pure joy, pure emotion." The race also saw Nico Hulkenberg achieve his first-ever podium finish in his 239th start, holding off Lewis Hamilton in the final laps.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified the administration's stance on trade negotiations, stating that countries without a finalized agreement will see tariffs "boomerang back" to their April levels on August 1. He framed this not as a new deadline but as a firm date for implementation, putting the onus on trading partners to conclude deals if they wish to avoid the levies. This announcement provides a more concrete timeline for the expiration of the 90-day tariff pause, adding pressure on ongoing international talks. Bessent also hinted that several major announcements regarding trade could be expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have argued for significant structural changes to counter growing drone threats. Citing the crucial role of unmanned aircraft in recent conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, they suggest the PLA will likely need to establish specialized counter-drone units. The analysis proposes that in the near term, existing units, such as electronic warfare divisions, could be upgraded with AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming capabilities. This reflects a strategic shift to adapt China's military posture to the realities of modern, technology-driven warfare.</p>
