          <p>President Trump verbally attacked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" for not lowering interest rates. Trump asserted that a 2-percentage-point rate cut would save the U.S. $600 billion annually.  This criticism follows recent economic data suggesting lower-than-anticipated inflation. Trump's comments intensified pressure on the Federal Reserve.</p>
