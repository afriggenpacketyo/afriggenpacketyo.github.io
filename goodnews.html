The first system has an 80% chance of forming into a tropical depression by late week, while the second has a 50% chance, with both currently moving west-northwestward. Forecasters note that while the climatological peak of the season has passed, tropical activity is expected to increase as environmental conditions become more favorable, a trend likely to continue into early October.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has upgraded its global economic growth forecast for the current year to 3.2%, citing unexpected resilience in the first half of 2025. The U.S. growth forecast was also lifted to 1.8%, supported by strong AI-related investment, though this is a slowdown from 2024. However, the organization warns of significant risks ahead, including high policy uncertainty and the yet-to-be-fully-felt effects of elevated U.S. tariffs, which could dampen investment and trade moving forward.

          <h2>Scientific Community Debunks Claimed Link Between Tylenol and Autism</h2>

          <p>Following President Trump's assertion that Tylenol causes autism, this article provides a scientific perspective explaining why the claim is unfounded. Researchers state that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder linked to thousands of genetic variants and potential environmental factors, not a single medication. Experts argue that the rising number of autism diagnoses is primarily due to increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria. The scientific consensus remains that extensive studies have shown no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism.</p>

          <p>After more than nine years of negotiations, the European Union and Indonesia have concluded a free trade agreement, a process reportedly accelerated by the global trade uncertainty caused by U.S. tariff policies. The deal will eliminate most tariffs on EU exports like car parts and agricultural goods while opening Indonesian markets to investment in sectors such as electric vehicles. For Indonesia, the pact will make about 80% of its exports to the EU tariff-free, providing wider access to the bloc's 280 million consumers and strengthening economic ties.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service in England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis if a patient's symptoms persist or worsen after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. Her family hopes the guidance will improve patient safety by prompting earlier referrals and second opinions, particularly for younger patients whose serious illnesses are sometimes overlooked.</p>
