          <p>US conductor Leon Botstein and The Orchestra NOW (T≈åN) are using music to deliver a message about the importance of democracy in Germany, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Botstein warns against the ease with which evil can become legal, emphasizing the need for constant work to maintain freedom. T≈åN's performance in Nuremberg Congress Hall, a site built by the Nazis, aims to reckon with the past while celebrating music by Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, whose works were banned by the Nazis. Botstein sees music as a crucial tool for free thinking and a means to combat authoritarianism, which he believes is increasingly relevant in today's world.</p>

          <p>With gold prices rising, financial experts are offering varying perspectives on how investors should allocate their gold investments. Some advisors suggest increasing gold allocations to as much as 25% due to economic uncertainty, while others recommend maintaining traditional allocations of 10% to 15%. The best approach depends on individual financial situations, risk tolerance, and economic outlook, with factors like rising national debt, inflation, and global instability influencing decisions. Experts generally advise against decreasing gold allocations unless liquidity is urgently needed, and recommend dollar-cost averaging as a strategy for increasing gold exposure over time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England has lowered UK interest rates to 4.25%, the fourth cut in the past year, citing a slowdown in inflation. Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned about the unpredictability of the global economy due to US tariffs. The Bank considered a larger cut but decided against it due to concerns about the global trade war's impact on economic growth. This decision coincides with the anticipated announcement of a tariff deal between the UK and US, which Bailey believes will reduce uncertainty. Future rate cuts are expected to be gradual, reflecting divided opinions among the rate-setting committee members.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the science behind mRNA vaccines and their potential in medicine, while also addressing growing political opposition. Despite the discovery of mRNA in 1961 and its successful use in Covid-19 and RSV vaccines, concerns about safety have led to political scrutiny and efforts to limit or ban these therapies. Experts emphasize that mRNA vaccines cannot alter DNA and that side effects are generally mild and short-lived. Research continues to explore mRNA's potential in treating cancer, cardiovascular disease, and genetic disorders, offering hope for diseases where other technologies have failed.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the U.S. Surgeon General. Means, known for her advocacy of Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda, replaces Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Means, a co-founder of the health app Levels, aligns with Kennedy's views on the influence of the food and drug industry and the importance of addressing the root causes of chronic diseases. While praised by some for her qualifications and communication skills, Means has faced skepticism from Kennedy's anti-vaccine base due to her perceived lack of early criticism of mRNA vaccines.</p>

          <p>Britain is set to announce a trade deal with the United States, offering potential relief amidst global economic uncertainty and recent tariff increases. While the extent of the agreement remains unclear, economists caution that it is likely to provide only a small boost to the British economy, which is still vulnerable to external shocks. The deal is expected to support sectors like the auto industry and lift consumer and business sentiment, but its impact on the overall economy may be limited due to the skew towards services in trade flows. The Bank of England cut interest rates to 4.25 percent, citing trade uncertainty as a factor.</p>

          <h2>Americans Favor Real Estate and Gold as Long-Term Investments, Financial Advisors Disagree</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 09:20:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup report indicates that many Americans believe real estate and gold are the best long-term investments, while financial advisors recommend stocks. Advisors caution that this preference is driven by hype rather than fundamentals, emphasizing that the stock market generally offers higher returns and diversification. While real estate and gold can appreciate over time, they are also less liquid than stocks. Financial advisors suggest exploring real estate investment trusts (REITs) as a way to gain exposure to real estate without concentrating assets.</p>
