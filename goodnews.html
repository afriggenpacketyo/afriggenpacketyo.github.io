          <p>Tesla's board is seeking shareholder approval for a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could reach a value of $1 trillion over the next decade. The plan involves awarding Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching an $8.5 trillion market capitalization and significant production targets for vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. This proposal follows a Delaware judge's decision to revoke his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 after a legal challenge from investors. The board frames this new package as crucial for retaining Musk's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

The partnership, which historically centered on politics and defense, is now expanding to include areas like artificial intelligence and agriculture.

Drawing a parallel to the historical context of World War II and the UN's founding, the author emphasizes that peace and security must coexist for all nations to avoid repeating cycles of conflict. The piece argues that despite geopolitical complexities, the fundamental principles of the UN Charter, such as maintaining international peace and respecting sovereign equality, provide the necessary framework. It posits that diplomacy is the only sustainable path to ending the devastating conflict.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is renovating approximately 1,000 of its U.S. locations by the end of 2026, with a focus on creating more inclusive and welcoming spaces. The redesigns will feature more seating, cozier aesthetics with dark wood paneling, and accessibility improvements like less harsh lighting for customers with light sensitivity. This initiative is part of a broader strategy under CEO Brian Niccol to restore Starbucks' reputation as a "third place" for customers between home and work. The company aims to reverse previous decisions that discouraged lingering, such as removing seats and outlets, to combat a recent sales slump.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse, also known as a "blood moon," will be visible on September 7, 2025, to observers in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. This astronomical event occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that envelops the moon. The moon appears reddish-orange because some sunlight filters through Earth's atmosphere, with longer red wavelengths reaching the lunar surface. Unlike a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse is safe to view with the naked eye and can last for a longer duration.</p>

          <p>South Korea's national soccer team faces the USMNT with several key questions surrounding its roster and strategy. Star player Son Heung-min, now with LAFC, may see his role change as coach Hong Myung-bo considers a new captain. The team is also set to debut Jens Castrop, a German-born midfielder who will be the first foreign-born player to represent South Korea, potentially setting a new trend for the national program. With other key players like Lee Kang-in and Kim Min-jae struggling for playing time at their European clubs, the friendly offers a chance for a much-needed fresh start.</p>

          <h2>How Taxpayers Can Maximize the Increased $40,000 SALT Deduction Limit for 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 07:58:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent legislation increased the cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. Tax experts advise that filers in high-tax states can use strategies to maximize this benefit, such as prepaying fourth-quarter state income taxes or "lumping" property tax payments into one year. However, higher earners should be aware of a phaseout that reduces the deduction for those with a modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000. The SALT cap is scheduled to revert to $10,000 in 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a White House dinner, Google CEO Sundar Pichai publicly thanked President Donald Trump for the "constructive dialogue" that led to a "resolution" in the company's landmark antitrust case. The exchange occurred after a federal judge ruled against breaking up the company, a decision that added $230 billion to Alphabet's market capitalization. During the conversation, President Trump incorrectly stated that the Biden administration had prosecuted the lawsuit, which was actually initiated during his own first term. Pichai also praised the Trump administration's AI action plan, signaling a cooperative relationship between the tech giant and the White House.</p>

Schneider, a career politician with little prior environmental policy experience, is taking a pragmatic approach, aiming to work calmly behind the scenes to build international partnerships and implement effective domestic policies without engaging in overly politicized debates.</p>
