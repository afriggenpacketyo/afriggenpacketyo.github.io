          <p>Glorya Kaufman, a philanthropist whose immense generosity reshaped the dance landscape in Los Angeles, has passed away at the age of 95. Her contributions included a historic $20 million gift to establish a major dance series at the Music Center and a donation to create the USC Kaufman School of Dance. Kaufman's support enabled world-renowned dance companies to perform in L.A. and nurtured new generations of dancers. Born in Detroit, she dedicated herself to philanthropy after her husband, KB Home co-founder Donald Kaufman, died in 1983, leaving a lasting legacy across the city's cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple will increase its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total four-year commitment to $600 billion. The investment is expected to create 20,000 new jobs and includes plans for a smart glass manufacturing line in Kentucky and a server facility in Houston. President Trump praised the move as a significant step toward ensuring iPhones sold in the U.S. are also made in the country. This announcement follows previous pressure from the administration, including threats of tariffs on iPhones manufactured abroad.</p>

Badenoch also discussed losing her faith in God after reading about the Josef Fritzl case, though she still identifies as a "cultural Christian." She reflected on encountering low expectations for Black students in the UK during the 1990s and expressed her determination to lead the Conservative Party to success despite recent setbacks.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel returned to the Hollywood Bowl for a performance marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The program featured a unique pairing of Duke Ellington's symphonic poems and Maurice Ravel's jazz-influenced piano concertos, performed by pianist Seong-Jin Cho. While the orchestra's rendition of Ellington was praised for its energy, the review notes that the vastness of the Bowl was less suited to the subtleties of Ravel's work. The return was also bittersweet, as the upcoming visit by Dudamel's Venezuelan orchestra has been canceled due to travel issues.</p>

          <p>After their home was destroyed in the Palisades Fire, David and Jacquie Israel decided to embrace a new adventure by traveling across the United States in an RV. The couple, who saw the loss of their home as a sign from the universe to go exploring, have spent over 10 weeks on the road with their two dogs. They describe the journey as a healing experience, allowing them to meet new people and see the country's beauty. Rather than focusing on division, they have found that their interactions on the road have reinforced their belief in the kindness and connectivity of people across America.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans for a significant crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetic industry to enhance public safety. Under the new proposals, high-risk procedures like non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. Additionally, clinics offering treatments such as Botox and dermal fillers will need to obtain a license by meeting strict safety and training standards. The move, which has been welcomed by the industry, aims to protect consumers from "dodgy practitioners" and follows growing concerns over dangerous complications and a recent death linked to an unregulated procedure.</p>

          <p>The signing of South Korean superstar Son Heung-min is being viewed as a strategic move by LAFC to significantly expand its global brand, similar to how Carlos Vela connected the team with the local community. Son's immense popularity in South Korea and across Asia presents a major opportunity for the MLS club to increase its international name recognition and commercial reach. While he is expected to be a world-class performer on the field, his value extends to building a global fanbase and attracting international attention. This move solidifies LAFC's ambition to be a prominent club on the world football stage.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts that a record number of 18-year-old students will be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their required grades. Dr. Jo Saxton stated that uncertainty around international student numbers is making universities keen to enroll domestic undergraduates, who offer more financial stability. This increased flexibility from universities means more offers have been made this year, which will likely translate into more direct acceptances and fewer places available through the clearing process for students receiving their results next week.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his rare two-way talent in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, delivering his best pitching performance as a Dodger and hitting a home run. Ohtani pitched four innings, allowing only one run and striking out a season-high eight batters, while also hitting his 39th homer of the season. Despite his strong effort, the team's bullpen could not secure the win, giving up four runs in the final five innings, leading to a 5-3 loss. The performance highlights the ongoing challenge for Ohtani to excel as both a pitcher and hitter, a feat rarely attempted since Babe Ruth.</p>

          <p>Financial markets are anticipating that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4% on Thursday, which would be its fifth reduction since last August. A lower base rate would decrease monthly mortgage costs for homeowners on variable-rate deals but would also result in lower returns for savers. The expected cut comes despite inflation being above the Bank's 2% target, but signs of a cooling UK labor market may be influencing the decision. The Bank will also release new economic forecasts alongside its rate announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have found new evidence indicating that people returned to live in Pompeii after its devastation by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The research suggests that some survivors, unable to relocate, came back and established a precarious settlement among the ruins, possibly living there until the 5th century. These inhabitants likely lived in the upper floors of buried homes and salvaged valuable materials from the site. This discovery challenges the long-held image of Pompeii as a city completely abandoned after the eruption, revealing a more complex history of survival and reoccupation.</p>
