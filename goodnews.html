          <h2>Ageism Concerns Arise for Chinese Tech Workers at 35</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 21:00:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many tech workers in China fear the 'curse of 35,' where they risk layoffs due to age discrimination. This term originated on social media and reflects a growing trend of companies preferring younger employees, with many job listings explicitly stating candidates should be no older than 35. This practice is fueled by a tight job market and a perception that older workers are less adaptable or demand higher salaries, leading to concerns about career longevity for those in the tech industry. The 'curse' affects various sectors, with tech being particularly susceptible due to its fast-paced and innovative nature.</p>

          <p>The 151st Kentucky Derby showcased a dazzling array of hats, from traditional designs to elaborate fascinators, despite heavy rain. Designer Steven Stolman emphasized the importance of a hat complementing the wearer, noting the decline in trained milliners and the risks of online hat purchases. First lady of Kentucky, Britainy Beshear, sported a pink-and-white ensemble paired with a hand-blocked sinamay hat. The crowd of 147,406 embraced the sartorial tradition, proving that some customs endure regardless of weather, as attendees found ways to incorporate rain gear into their outfits while maintaining the event's signature style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Democratic Party is grappling with the question of whether its leaders are too old, as some members push for a mandatory retirement age for state and local officeholders. The debate stems from concerns about leaders holding onto power past their prime, referencing instances like Dianne Feinstein's declining health while in office. A resolution calling for exploring a mandatory retirement age will be considered at the statewide party convention, sparking heated discussions about ageism and the value of experience. While the proposal faces significant hurdles, it reflects a broader national conversation about generational change in politics and the fitness of elderly leaders.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, the newly elected Prime Minister of Canada, is preparing to confront Donald Trump's protectionist policies and perceived threats to Canadian sovereignty. Carney, who previously served as a central bank governor, plans to use his economic expertise to navigate the trade war and advocate for Canadian interests. His campaign focused on unifying Canadians against external threats, drawing support from both left-leaning voters and Quebec separatists concerned about American dominance. Carney's victory was unexpected, as his Liberal Party was initially trailing significantly in the polls before Trump's imposition of tariffs and suggestions of a US-Canada merger.</p>

The reopening is a positive step for the community, as the distillery is an iconic part of Frankfort's identity and a major employer.

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel 'Conclave,' which was adapted into an Oscar-winning film, draws parallels between the process of selecting a new Pope and the TV show 'The Traitors.' Harris suggests that the dynamics of a conclave, where cardinals secretly vote to choose a new leader, share similarities with the show's premise of identifying 'traitors' among a group. He argues that the ancient, secretive ritual in the Sistine Chapel is an effective method for selecting the right person to lead an organization, a process that political parties should emulate. Harris expresses his view that women should be included in the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope.</p>
