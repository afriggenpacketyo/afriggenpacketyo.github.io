          <p>Canada Goose reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' estimates, leading to an increase in the company's shares. However, the luxury retailer withdrew its fiscal year 2026 outlook, citing macroeconomic uncertainty and dynamic consumer spending patterns due to the unpredictable global trade environment. Despite the lack of a financial outlook, Canada Goose expressed confidence in its brand strength, financial position, and ability to adapt to changing conditions. The company is expanding into non-winter categories, including rain jackets and warm-weather clothing, and recently launched its eyewear collection online.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for allegedly providing false statements to Congress regarding his decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This inquiry follows accusations from House Republicans who claimed Cuomo intentionally misrepresented data related to nursing home deaths. The investigation centers on Cuomo's March 2020 directive that initially required nursing homes to accept patients who had tested positive for COVID-19, a policy later rescinded amid concerns it accelerated outbreaks. Cuomo's spokesperson asserts that he testified truthfully and that the investigation is politically motivated.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Rachael Bedard discusses the implications of President Biden's metastatic prostate cancer diagnosis and his visible decline. She emphasizes that while the diagnosis itself doesn't reveal the cause of his decline, it provides insight into how he might cope with serious illness. Dr. Bedard argues that leaders in powerful positions have a responsibility to acknowledge the realities of aging and plan for potential health challenges. She concludes by expressing hope for Mr. Biden's health while suggesting he could have better prepared for potential decline earlier in his term.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how large language models (LLMs) are becoming more interpretable, allowing researchers to understand the "beliefs" these models hold about their users. Researchers at Harvard have found that LLMs track characteristics like gender, socioeconomic status, education level, and age, using these assumptions to tailor their responses. The article highlights the potential for these models to perpetuate stereotypes and the need for transparency and control over the assumptions they make. It suggests that users should be empowered to correct misimpressions and ensure that LLMs prioritize autonomy and agency.</p>

Rising costs and inflation are impacting consumers' ability to afford fast-food, and McDonald's reported a 3.6% drop in sales, attributing it to tariffs.

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dismissed farm minister Taku Eto over a controversial remark about receiving so much rice from supporters that he doesn't need to buy any, amid soaring rice prices. Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture chief, hoping to restore public trust. The dismissal came after opposition lawmakers criticized Eto's comment as insensitive, given rising inflation and wage stagnation. The gaffe occurred shortly after the Ministry of Agriculture decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's trip to the Middle East was successful due to his focus on using the American private sector as an instrument of national power. By bringing business leaders and emphasizing commercial partnerships, Trump positioned the U.S. differently than previous administrations. He also showed a willingness to navigate Middle East politics without being constrained by domestic concerns, allowing him to make decisions that other presidents might have avoided. The article suggests that Trump's approach resonates with both Gulf Arabs and Middle America, who are weary of military entanglement and nation-building projects.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that people should not be able to camp without permission. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public a right of access for open-air recreation, including camping. The Dartmoor National Park Association expressed delight and relief at the ruling, while campaigners called for extending the right to wild camp to other parts of England. The article also notes the importance of responsible camping and respecting landowners and farmers.</p>
