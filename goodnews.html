          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of people in common-law relationships chose not to legally marry due to the requirement to adopt the same surname, a law unique to Japan. The survey highlights that around 40% of people in their 20s would consider legal marriage if separate surnames were permitted. The survey estimates that over half a million people in common-law relationships wish to marry but are deterred by the current law, which also denies common-law couples benefits like spouse tax deductions and inheritance rights. This article underscores the ongoing debate between those advocating for individual rights and conservatives prioritizing traditional family values.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with nearly 12,000 new coffee shops opening in the past year, driven by increased accessibility and price competition. President Xi Jinping's endorsement of domestic beans has further fueled this expansion. While the market grows, Starbucks' market share has declined significantly due to competition from new entrants offering diverse business models and flavors. This growth is particularly concentrated in second-tier and emerging first-tier cities, indicating a shift in coffee culture beyond major urban centers.</p>
