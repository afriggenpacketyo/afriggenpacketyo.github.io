        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco, despite the city experiencing a significant post-pandemic resurgence, largely propelled by the artificial intelligence boom. Crime rates have fallen dramatically, and tourism and residential real estate are on the rise, with venture capital funding for AI surpassing previous records. Mayor Daniel Lurie and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who initially supported Trump's idea, have since publicly stated that additional federal troops are unnecessary, emphasizing local law enforcement's successful efforts. The city's chief economist notes a cleaner, safer environment and abundant economic opportunities, though challenges like high office vacancies and homelessness persist. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "No Kings" protests, among the largest one-day demonstrations in U.S. history, signify broad public opposition to President Trump's perceived authoritarianism and aim to counter despair among opponents. The slogan's broad appeal unites diverse groups, providing an outlet for citizens and a warning to wavering Trump supporters and institutions. While not immediately altering the political landscape, these mass movements are crucial for maintaining momentum through future elections, potentially reconstituting an anti-MAGA majority. Trump's strong reactions, including an AI-generated video depicting him as "King Trump" attacking protesters, suggest the protests are effectively getting under the White House's skin.</p>

          <p>A potential mass shooting was successfully averted at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport thanks to the quick actions of law enforcement and a crucial tip from the suspect's family. Billy Joe Cagle, 49, of Cartersville, was arrested after his family reported he was livestreaming threats to "shoot up" the airport. Officers located a Springfield AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his truck parked outside the South Terminal. Cagle, a felon with documented mental health challenges, was taken into custody unarmed inside the terminal, where investigators believe he was scouting the area. Authorities lauded the community and inter-agency collaboration for preventing a tragedy.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to hold, not trade, Apple stock, citing its recent surge to a record high and its role in lifting the broader market. He highlighted the iPhone 17 lineup's strong demand and features like improved selfie technology as evidence of Apple's superior product cycle. Cramer criticized traders for being swayed by negativity, missing the rally, and pointed to analysts now raising estimates due to Apple's momentum across new devices, including a potential foldable iPhone. He suggested Apple could monetize AI integration similarly to its Google search deal, generating substantial margins without building its own AI model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has completed a round of radiation therapy to treat an aggressive form of prostate cancer, marking a significant and positive step in his treatment journey. Biden, who will turn 83 next month, finished several weeks of therapy at Penn Medicine, with his daughter Ashley posting a video of him ringing the traditional "bell" for completing treatment. Diagnosed in May with advanced prostate cancer (Gleason score 9) that had metastasized to his bones, this completion is an encouraging sign, though further assessment of his progress is needed to determine future treatment. Prostate cancer is a common condition, and Biden also underwent skin cancer surgery in September 2025.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: West Urged to Reframe China's Rise to Avert Conflict, Challenging Historical Parallels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 17:30:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that to avert potential conflict, the West must critically re-evaluate its perception of China, moving beyond a "mirror" view that projects Western historical patterns of aggression onto China's rise. Drawing on the concept of Thucydides's Trap, the article contends that applying Western and Japanese histories of conquest to China's 5,000-year, land-bound cultural DNA is a conceptual misstep. China's history, shaped by geography and a defensive posture within its fertile heartlands against nomadic incursions, suggests a different trajectory than one of inevitable maritime expansion and rivalry. The author advocates for understanding China through its own unique historical and ecological context to foster a more accurate and peaceful engagement.</p>

          <h2>Cannabis-Infused Beverages Gain Popularity as Americans Reduce Alcohol Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 17:19:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cannabis-infused beverages, containing THC and/or CBD, are rapidly gaining popularity in the U.S. as Americans consume less alcohol, with Gallup reporting the lowest drinking rates since 1939. These drinks, marketed as nonalcoholic alternatives, are projected to grow from $1.1 billion to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035. While offering zero calories and sugar, doctors warn of potential side effects like anxiety, paranoia, and impaired memory, especially for teens and those with certain health conditions. Despite a patchwork of state regulations, major retailers like Target are testing sales, signaling a significant shift in consumer preference towards cannabis drinks as a social alternative.

          <h2>Decommissioned Confederate Statues Transformed into Art Exhibition in Los Angeles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 17:15:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Decommissioned Confederate statues, including a massive monument of General Robert E. Lee that sparked deadly protests in Charlottesville, are now central to a new art exhibition in Los Angeles. Curated by Hamza Walker, "Monuments" displays these melted-down or graffitied figures alongside contemporary art, challenging the "Lost Cause" ideology that romanticizes the Confederacy. The exhibition directly contrasts with President Trump's executive order to reinstall such monuments, asserting that they promote white supremacy. Artist Kara Walker's "Unmanned Drone," a headless, zombie-like sculpture of Stonewall Jackson, aims to reframe the mythological legacy of Confederate figures, with the melted bronze ingots set for further artistic transformation.</p>
