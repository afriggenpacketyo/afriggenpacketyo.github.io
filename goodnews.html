          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India, which includes an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders. Opposition parties argue this could disadvantage British workers, but the government claims the deal will boost trade and economic growth. The Scotch Whisky Association anticipates a significant increase in exports to India due to lowered tariffs. The agreement aims to facilitate trade between the two countries by reducing tariffs on various goods and services.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares jumped after the company indicated that sales of its weight-loss drug Wegovy are expected to improve in the latter half of 2025, due to a decrease in the availability of compounded alternatives. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit, although Wegovy sales slightly missed analysts' expectations. Novo Nordisk attributed the reduced sales forecast to competition from compounded weight loss drugs in the U.S. during the early part of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
