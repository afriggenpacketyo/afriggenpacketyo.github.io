          <p>Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times, announced his intention to take the newspaper public within the next year, aiming to democratize its ownership. He stated this move would allow the public to have a stake in the paper, ensuring it truly represents the voices of the people, regardless of political affiliation. While specifics on the investment arrangement, such as an initial public offering, were not provided, this initiative comes as the news industry faces significant financial challenges. Soon-Shiong, a billionaire known for his pharmaceutical and biotech ventures, seeks to secure the long-term future and broad appeal of this influential publication through wider public involvement.</p>

          <p>After 38 months of legal resistance and profound grief, the Uvalde CISD school board has unanimously voted to release the investigation records pertaining to the devastating Robb Elementary mass shooting. This pivotal decision follows a recent appeals court ruling favoring news outlets seeking transparency regarding the widely criticized law enforcement response to the 2022 massacre, which claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers. Families of the victims, who have endured unbearable pain and unanswered questions, hailed the vote as a long-overdue step toward healing and accountability. Board members collectively apologized for their prior inaction, signaling a commitment to rebuilding trust through greater transparency and compassion.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang officially announced the commencement of a monumental dam project on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which transforms into the Brahmaputra River downstream. This ambitious undertaking is set to become the world’s largest hydropower facility, boasting an estimated investment of approximately 1.2 trillion yuan (US$167 billion) and an anticipated annual electricity generation capacity of 300,000 gigawatt-hours. The announcement immediately triggered significant stock surges in China’s infrastructure construction and hydropower sectors, with state-owned developers and hydro equipment companies experiencing substantial price gains. This massive project underscores China's commitment to large-scale infrastructure development and energy production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to host Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the White House to strengthen security and economic ties amidst escalating tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. Discussions will focus on China's assertiveness in the South China Sea, a contested area where Manila and Beijing have clashed. Tariffs are also a key agenda item, with Trump threatening 20% duties on Filipino goods unless a trade deal is reached. Both leaders emphasized their commitment to mutual defense and a secure Indo-Pacific, with the Philippines open to zero tariffs on some U.S. goods.</p>

          <p>The development of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles, often considered the "holy grail" of sustainable driving, is gaining renewed momentum with major automakers and cell producers setting aggressive commercial production timelines. These batteries promise significantly higher energy density, faster charging times, and enhanced safety compared to traditional lithium-ion cells. While some companies are initially focusing on semi-solid batteries as a bridge technology, mass production of full solid-state solutions is anticipated before the end of the decade. This progress could significantly transform the EV market, despite lingering challenges like high production costs and continuous improvements in existing lithium-ion technologies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 win against the Minnesota Twins, largely propelled by a few powerful hits despite ongoing offensive struggles throughout July. Shohei Ohtani contributed a two-run homer in the first inning, while Will Smith hit two solo home runs, marking his first multi-homer game since last July and raising his National League-leading batting average. Andy Pages added another insurance shot in the seventh inning. While the team's overall batting average remains low this month, their four home runs marked a significant improvement in power. Closer Tanner Scott exited the game with an apparent forearm injury, adding concern for the bullpen ahead of next week’s trade deadline.</p>

          <p>UBTech Robotics, China's leading manufacturer of humanoid robots, plans to raise approximately HK$2.41 billion (US$307 million) through a share placement in Hong Kong. This strategic move, representing about 6.39% of the company's enlarged issued share capital, aims to provide capital for business operations, research and development, project construction, and the repayment of loans and interest. The company has actively pursued follow-on fundraisings since its listing at the end of 2023, securing nearly HK$2 billion in the past 12 months. Despite these efforts to secure funding for growth, UBTech shares experienced a drop of about 5.6% following the announcement of the placement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the first targets of new sanctions against people-smuggling gangs this week, including gang leaders and companies supplying small boat equipment. This "world-first" financial action, central to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's plan to disrupt English Channel crossings, aims to freeze assets and impose travel bans on those involved. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the sanctions will target individuals who profit from human misery and drive irregular migration. The move comes as the government faces increasing pressure to stem the flow of migrants, which has seen a nearly 50% increase this year, and amid calls for stronger measures to address a perceived "public safety crisis."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ana Schnabl, a writer from the Balkans, expresses profound frustration over the publishing industry's persistent expectation for authors from her region to focus solely on themes of war, trauma, and political conflict. She recounts an encounter with a US publisher who explicitly advised her to explore "culturally or historically problematic" issues, implying that stories must have "explanatory or illustrative value" for American readers. Schnabl argues this perpetuates a narrow, victim-centric view of Balkan literature, overlooking diverse narratives about universal human experiences such as love, loss, and the mundane realities of life. She advocates for publishers to embrace a broader range of authentic voices that challenge established perceptions and expand global literary understanding beyond simplistic regional tropes.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced "substantial changes" to the compensation scheme for thousands of victims of the infected blood scandal, aiming to restore trust after a heavily critical public inquiry report. Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds stated the changes would cost an additional £1 billion on top of the £11.8 billion already set aside. Key amendments include allowing payments to be passed through the estate of family members who die before their own claim is settled, a reversal of previous rules. Victims' groups "cautiously welcomed" the announcement, noting that some issues, like the level of compensation for hepatitis victims and recognition of psychological harm, still require further consultation.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that despite widespread criticism, Donald Trump's universal tariffs may have a "silver lining" by inadvertently prompting nations to address their own self-defeating internal trade barriers. The article posits that the economic drag from these long-standing domestic restrictions could equal or exceed the impact of Trump's imposed tariffs. Examples from Canada and China indicate significant movement in removing such barriers, while the European Union's progress is less clear, potentially prioritizing defense spending over internal commerce and trade. This perspective argues that the tariff crisis is unexpectedly fostering greater economic freedom and efficiency within targeted countries, leading to beneficial internal reforms.

While the Odyssey offers more cargo space and horsepower, the Sienna provides a compelling balance of practicality, reliability, and value, backed by Toyota's strong reputation.
