          <p>A source close to negotiations indicates that Hamas and other Palestinian factions are likely to accept a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Gaza. The 20-point proposal, presented by President Trump, calls for a swift ceasefire, the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid. The plan also outlines a future for Gaza governed by an interim administration of Palestinian technocrats, with an international "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. Several key Muslim-majority nations have already issued a joint statement welcoming the proposal, signaling broad regional support for the diplomatic effort.</p>

          <p>Veteran goalkeeper Craig Gordon, 42, has been named to the Scotland national football squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Greece and Belarus. This marks his return to the team after recovering from a neck injury that has kept him out of action since May. Gordon, who has 81 caps for his country, replaces his Hearts teammate Zander Clark in the squad. Head coach Steve Clarke has opted for a smaller squad for the crucial home matches, which will be played at Hampden Park in early October.</p>

          <p>Since Son Heung-min's arrival at Los Angeles Football Club, he and teammate Denis Bouanga have formed the most lethal attacking duo in MLS, scoring 17 consecutive goals between them, a new league record. Their on-field chemistry has silenced concerns about their similar playing styles and has propelled LAFC on a four-game winning streak. Bouanga, who now has 23 goals this season, credits Son's elite reputation and presence with elevating his own performance as he chases the league's golden boot.

The band members emphasized that this is a final celebration of their career, not a reunion tour with new music. The announcement follows a positive public reaction to their recent documentary and will provide fans a last chance to see them perform their six UK number-one hits together.</p>

          <p>Arsenal centre-back William Saliba has committed his future to the club by signing a new five-year contract, ending speculation of a potential move to Real Madrid. The 24-year-old French international credited manager Mikel Arteta and his staff for his development, stating his belief that they can help him become one of the best defenders in the world. Saliba has become a cornerstone of Arsenal's defense since his debut in 2022, making 105 league appearances. The extension is seen as a major boost for the club as they aim to win major trophies.</p>

          <p>In Nepal, a two-year-old girl named Aryatara Shakya has been chosen as the new Kumari, or "living goddess," a centuries-old tradition revered by both Hindus and Buddhists. She was carried from her home to a temple palace in Kathmandu, which will be her residence until she reaches puberty, at which point she will return to mortal life. The selection process requires girls to meet strict criteria, including having unblemished features and showing no fear of the dark. The former Kumari, now 11, has retired, and the government now provides a small pension to help former goddesses readjust to normal life.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-led ceasefire proposal for Gaza represents the most serious effort to end the conflict, backed by broad international and Arab support. The plan details an immediate hostage-prisoner exchange and a framework for Gaza's reconstruction under a transitional body, potentially leading to a reformed Palestinian Authority taking control. However, significant hurdles remain, as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasizes indefinite security control, while Hamas faces pressure to accept terms that require its disarmament. The deal's success hinges on navigating these conflicting interests, with the potential for it to collapse if either side feels its core objectives are not met.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in the UK in a case connected to what is believed to be the world's largest single seizure of cryptocurrency. The Metropolitan Police recovered 61,000 bitcoin, currently valued at over £5 billion, which were the proceeds of a massive investment scam in China that defrauded over 128,000 victims between 2014 and 2017. Qian fled China and attempted to launder the funds in the UK by purchasing property. The conviction follows a complex, seven-year investigation into the global money laundering operation.</p>

          <p>A German court has sentenced Jian Guo, a former aide to far-right AfD politician Maximilian Krah, to four years and nine months in prison for spying for China. Guo was found guilty of passing confidential documents from the European Parliament to Chinese intelligence services and monitoring Chinese dissidents in Germany. The case has heightened concerns across the European Union about China's espionage activities. Krah, who is now a member of the German parliament, claimed he was unaware of his aide's activities, though he himself is currently under a separate investigation.</p>
