          <p>President Trump approved the acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel, reversing his earlier opposition.  The approval is contingent on Nippon Steel's commitment to significant investments in U.S. steelmaking and the issuance of a "golden share" to the U.S. government, granting it veto power over key decisions.  The deal, creating the world's third-largest steelmaker, was previously blocked due to national security concerns. The decision concludes a politically charged saga.</p>
