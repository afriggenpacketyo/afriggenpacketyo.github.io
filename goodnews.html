          <p>Bitcoin reached $100,000 following President Trump's announcement of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking its highest level since February. The price of Bitcoin increased by over 4%, while other cryptocurrencies like Ether, Solana, and Dogecoin also experienced rallies. The announcement boosted stocks broadly, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising nearly 400 points. Since early April, Bitcoin has risen by approximately 16%, outperforming gold and the S&P 500, indicating renewed investor confidence and market momentum.</p>

          <p>A Standard Chartered analyst apologized for his previous prediction of Bitcoin reaching $120,000 by the second quarter of 2025, stating that this target now appears too low. The analyst noted that U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen significant inflows, indicating growing institutional investment. Factors such as MicroStrategy's increased Bitcoin purchases and investments from sovereign wealth funds are driving the cryptocurrency's price surge. This revised outlook reflects a shift in market dynamics, with flows now dominating the Bitcoin narrative.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England reduced interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5% and signaled potential further cuts in the coming months. The decision was influenced by concerns about the global trade war's potential impact on UK economic growth, although the recent UK-US trade deal was welcomed. While the rate-setting committee was divided on the extent of the cut, the overall path for rates is expected to be downwards. This move aims to balance tackling inflation with supporting economic growth, providing relief to mortgage holders but also impacting savers.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio has assumed an unprecedented four roles within the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, acting director of USAID, acting head of the National Archives, and acting national security advisor. This consolidation of power has raised questions about whether one person can effectively manage such a diverse portfolio of responsibilities. While some see it as a sign of President Trump's trust in Rubio, others worry about the workload and the potential for conflicts of interest. The reshuffling follows a broader shake-up inside the National Security Council, compounding the stakes.</p>

          <p>Experts say that using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt could make sense, but it's not always the best option. If credit cards are charging over 20% interest, and long-term market returns are averaging 8% to 10%, paying off the debt offers an immediate and higher return. But if balances are low, on a 0% promotional rate, or being managed effectively, the money might be better used to build savings, invest, or tackle other financial priorities.</p>
