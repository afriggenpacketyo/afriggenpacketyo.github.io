          <p>Costco has entered an agreement with drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members at a substantially reduced price. Members with a valid prescription who are paying out-of-pocket can purchase a four-week supply for $499, approximately half the typical cost. This initiative aims to provide an affordable and authentic alternative to the cheaper, unregulated compounded versions of the drugs that have become prevalent due to high demand and limited insurance coverage. The move could significantly increase access to these medications for a wider population.</p>

          <p>After two decades of extensive restoration work, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been opened to the public in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. The 3,000-year-old tomb is one of the largest in the necropolis and features exquisite wall paintings, although its contents were looted long ago. The Japanese-led restoration project involved over 260 specialists who worked to combat severe deterioration and conserve the site to the highest international standards. The tomb includes a main burial chamber for the king and two additional chambers for his queens.</p>

However, the group indicated that other parts of the deal require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian national framework. In response, President Trump stated he believes Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE" and urged Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages. The Israeli Prime Minister's office confirmed it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan, with indirect talks expected to begin soon in Egypt.</p>

Kudus, who joined from West Ham for £55m, has been an influential playmaker, already providing four assists this season before finding the net himself. Manager Thomas Frank expressed his happiness for the midfielder, calling him the team's best offensive player so far. Pundits like Wayne Rooney have praised Kudus for his strong start, highlighting his dribbling ability, strength, and work rate as key assets for the team.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been officially added to the Los Angeles Dodgers' roster for the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. This marks his return after being left off the wild-card series roster, ensuring he will likely pitch in what could be his final postseason before his anticipated retirement. Kershaw is expected to provide a steady, experienced presence out of the bullpen, addressing a need for the team after younger relievers struggled in the previous round. The Dodgers also added left-hander Anthony Banda to bolster their pitching depth against the Phillies' lineup.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated strong performance, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reaching record highs despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The healthcare sector saw significant gains, while technology and utilities also performed well, partly driven by the infrastructure demands of artificial intelligence. According to the article, the market has largely treated the shutdown as a non-event for now, focusing instead on corporate earnings and economic fundamentals. Investment activity mentioned includes purchasing more shares in Nike and Boeing while trimming positions in Bristol Myers Squibb. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets trading near record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to consider increasing their exposure to overseas markets. Dave Nadig of ETF.com noted that American investors exhibit a strong "home bias," potentially missing out on better value and long-term growth opportunities abroad, particularly in emerging markets like China and India. Kevin Carter of EMQQ Global highlighted India's favorable demographics and rapid growth as drivers of consumption, mirroring the trend seen in China over the past two decades.

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher shared the story of how he left a management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a small online bookstore called Amazon. He recalled that Bill Gates called it one of the stupidest decisions he had ever heard, but Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's vision and customer-centric obsession. Bezos confidently predicted that if they did everything right, Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000. Risher found the opportunity to be part of such rapid, groundbreaking growth incredibly compelling, and Amazon ultimately surpassed that revenue goal a year ahead of schedule.</p>
