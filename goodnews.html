          <p>Experts at a tech conference emphasized the need for nations to build "sovereign AI" to maintain strategic autonomy and cater to local languages and cultures. Many current prominent AI models are English-based, creating a dependency on foreign technology and perspectives. Panelists suggested that emerging economies, particularly in Southeast Asia, can leverage open-source models and cloud computing services like Amazon Web Services to democratize access and foster their own AI ecosystems. This approach helps create a collective energy for innovation and ensures technological benefits are more inclusively distributed globally.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers saw a surprising return to growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, largely driven by an increase in new export orders. This contrasts with the official government PMI, which showed a third consecutive month of contraction, though the two surveys poll different types of firms. The resilience is partly attributed to exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariff hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed significant housing legislation aimed at accelerating construction by easing environmental regulations under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Governor Gavin Newsom championed the bills, even using a "poison pill" provision in the state budget to ensure their passage despite opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions. The new laws exempt most urban housing projects from CEQA review and streamline the process for other developments, a move experts call one of the most consequential reforms to the 55-year-old environmental law. Proponents believe this will unlock numerous stalled housing projects across the state.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some of the 4,000 National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to help prepare for California's wildfire season. The troops were federalized by President Trump to protect federal property amid protests against ICE, a move contested by Governor Gavin Newsom. State officials had warned the deployment could deplete firefighting resources during a peak season. The proposal suggests moving 200 Guard members from their controversial law enforcement support role to assist with the state's pressing need for wildfire response personnel.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine helps prevent inflammation and the aging of multiple organs. It does this by inhibiting a specific enzyme, effectively acting as a messenger that translates physical activity into physiological benefits. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of how exercise promotes longevity and could inform future anti-aging strategies.</p>

He points to the success of stocks like Robinhood and Reddit as examples of this "idea market," where investors are drawn to compelling stories and potential future growth, even if current earnings are not immense. Cramer argues these investors are less concerned with Federal Reserve policy and are more focused on individual companies they believe could become the next big thing. (not investment advice)</p>

In an interview, he attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including Amazon and its third-party sellers making forward buys and deploying inventory in advance to avoid the duties. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace, with over two million sellers, helps keep prices down as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share. This provides a buffer for customers against the immediate impact of the trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
