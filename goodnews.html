          <p>New England Patriots first-round draft pick Will Campbell has doubled down on his draft-day promise that he would be willing to die for quarterback Drake Maye. The 21-year-old left tackle reiterated his emotional statement, calling Maye "my guy" and standing by his words. Campbell's status for the upcoming season opener is currently listed as questionable due to an ankle injury. He was selected fourth overall in the NFL Draft with the expectation that he will be the franchise's cornerstone blindside protector for years.</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after Thomas Tuchel was appointed as the manager of England's national football team, analysts are still assessing the team's identity and tactical direction. Having managed only four games, Tuchel's tenure has seen fewer matches and debut players compared to his predecessors over a similar timeframe. The article examines his tactical shifts, including a preference for a 4-4-1-1 formation and a more physically imposing, ball-dominant style of play. While some statistics show signs of a more aggressive approach, the overall performance is still under scrutiny ahead of upcoming World Cup qualifiers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's effort to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was illegal. The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocks the administration's attempt to revoke legal protections and work permits for these individuals. In his ruling, Chen criticized the "unprecedented" manner and speed of the decision by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, stating it violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The Justice Department is expected to appeal the ruling, which impacts a program designed to protect migrants from countries facing war or natural disasters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a game against the Houston Astros, New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone requested that umpires inspect a bat used by outfielder Taylor Trammell due to its "discoloration." Following a review, the bat was confiscated and sent to the league office for further inspection to determine if it violates MLB rules against colored bats. Astros manager Joe Espada stated the bat was simply worn down, while Trammell expressed confusion and defended his character, saying he would never cheat. The incident occurred during a ninth-inning rally by the Astros, which ultimately fell short in an 8-4 Yankees victory.</p>

          <p>The Adams County coroner has officially ruled that paranormal investigator Dan Rivera died of natural causes related to a known history of cardiac issues.

          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are reflecting on Giorgio Armani's legacy not just as a designer but as a brilliant businessman who built a global empire.

A key to his success was maintaining full control over his brand, allowing him to ensure a consistent vision of sophisticated, accessible luxury across his diverse product lines.

While the city did record the highest total number of homicides last year, its homicide rate per capita ranked tenth among large U.S. cities.
