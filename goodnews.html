While the departure is bittersweet for fans, Sunny remained nearby, perching atop a tree, with parents Jackie and Shadow expected to continue providing protection and guidance. Eaglets face a perilous first year, but if Sunny survives, she could live 15 to 30 years in the wild.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has pardoned Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., two shark divers previously convicted of theft for freeing sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's longline off the Florida coast. The men, who believed the line was illegal, were charged with theft after freeing the marine animals from a licensed research fishing line. Despite avoiding prison time, the felony convictions restricted their rights, including voting and owning firearms. The pardons effectively erase the convictions, with attorneys for Mansell and Moore expressing gratitude and emphasizing the unjust nature of the prosecution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has paused its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision provides older borrowers, many of whom rely on fixed incomes, additional time to address their debt and avoid reduced benefit checks. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are in default and potentially receiving Social Security benefits. The administration's move offers a temporary reprieve, allowing borrowers to explore options for getting current on their loans.</p>

          <p>Analysts are comparing Pop Mart's success with its collectible character Labubu to that of Sanrio's Hello Kitty, suggesting the Chinese toymaker could redefine cultural exports. Labubu's popularity has surged, attracting fans like David Beckham's family and boosting Pop Mart's stock. The character's appeal lies in its lovability rather than its connection to Chinese culture. JPMorgan Chase notes similarities between Labubu and Hello Kitty in character design, business model, and merchandising, with Pop Mart experiencing significant international sales growth.</p>

          <p>NPR is inviting parents to share the songs they sing to their babies, inspired by a Yale University study that found singing to infants improves their moods and overall well-being. The study, which surveyed parents about their babies' happiness levels, showed that infants who are sung to more frequently are generally happier throughout the day. NPR encourages parents to upload recordings of themselves singing to their babies, emphasizing that any song is suitable, not just traditional lullabies.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg discusses the Broadway play "John Proctor Is the Villain," which has been causing emotional reactions among women in the audience. The play, set in a high school during the MeToo movement, explores themes of feminism, guilt, and justice through the lens of Arthur Miller's "The Crucible." The play's power lies in its ability to transport viewers back to a time when MeToo felt alive with possibility, offering a glimpse of hope that is now in short supply. The play has received many Tony nominations this year.</p>
