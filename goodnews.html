          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested 18 individuals in the UK's largest-ever operation targeting phone theft, dismantling a gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen phones to China in the last year. The sophisticated criminal network allegedly paid street thieves up to £300 per handset, which were then sold for as much as £4,000 in China. The entire investigation was triggered when a single victim on Christmas Eve electronically tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport. This operation addresses a dramatic rise in phone thefts, which have become a highly lucrative criminal enterprise in the capital.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has firmly denied speculation that her newly released album, "The Life of a Showgirl," will be her last, calling the idea "shockingly offensive." In an interview with BBC Radio 2, the singer addressed fan theories that her recent engagement to Travis Kelce would lead her to step away from her music career. Swift emphasized that her fiancé is supportive of her passion for making art and that their respective careers as performers in large stadiums create a strong connection between them. She reassured her global fanbase that she has no plans to stop making music after getting married.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Earnings on CDs and High-Yield Savings Accounts Amid Fed Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 16:07:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve beginning to cut interest rates, savers are weighing whether a certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account (HYSA) offers better returns for their money. While current rates for both are similar, a CD provides a guaranteed return due to its fixed rate, protecting savers from future rate drops. An HYSA offers more flexibility for withdrawals but has a variable rate that will likely decrease as the Fed continues its easing policy. For a $10,000 deposit, the earnings over a year are nearly identical at current rates, but the CD locks in that rate for its entire term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock surged after announcing a major partnership with OpenAI, which includes a deal for OpenAI to potentially acquire a 10% stake in the chipmaker. As part of the agreement, OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's AI graphics processing units over several years, a move aimed at securing the massive computing power needed for its advanced AI models. This strategic alliance positions AMD as a key competitor to Nvidia in the AI chip market and reduces OpenAI's reliance on a single hardware supplier.

          <p>Homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) may find them more affordable as the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates. A HELOC's variable interest rate means that monthly payments can decrease as market rates fall, making it an attractive option in the current economic climate. For a $150,000 HELOC, current monthly payments are estimated to be between $1,424 and $1,811, depending on the repayment term. Unlike a fixed-rate loan, homeowners only make payments on the amount they actually borrow, providing flexibility for financing needs like home renovations. (not investment advice)</p>

This is the court's first conviction related to the genocide in Darfur, which occurred over 20 years ago. Judges found Abd–Al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, was personally involved in mass killings, gang rapes, and torture as part of a government-backed plan to suppress a rebellion. The verdict is a landmark moment for international justice, though arrest warrants for other Sudanese officials, including former president Omar al-Bashir, remain outstanding.</p>
