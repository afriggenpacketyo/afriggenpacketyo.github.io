        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit, Evernorth, has reached a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower the cost of popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound. The agreement aims to make these medications more accessible to employers and their workers by capping monthly out-of-pocket costs at $200 for members. This initiative targets clients who currently do not cover the drugs due to high costs, while also offering simplified pre-authorization processes. The deal could reduce costs for existing Evernorth clients offering weight loss drugs by up to 20%.</p>

          <p>As Pacific Coast Highway is set to reopen after months of closures due to fire damage, a dispute has emerged between state and city officials regarding security plans for the affected area in Pacific Palisades. The state claims it is unaware of the city's security strategy despite multiple outreach attempts, while a spokesperson for Mayor Bass asserts that a strict security plan is in place. The affluent coastal enclave has remained closed to the public since the January wildfire, and the reopening of PCH necessitates the establishment of new security checkpoints.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite inflation concerns, travelers can save money on summer vacations by leveraging deals on airfares and hotel rates, which are currently lower than last year. NerdWallet's analysis indicates that overall travel costs are down 2% compared to Memorial Day weekend a year ago, though ride-share fares and entertainment expenses have increased. To mitigate these rising costs, travelers are advised to be flexible with travel dates and destinations, set a budget for dining out, and utilize credit card points and airline rewards. By employing these strategies, Americans can still enjoy their summer trips while managing expenses effectively.</p>

          <p>Irwin, a pet kangaroo, was captured after escaping in Durango, Colorado, for the second time, with police using a new method of pursuit. The kangaroo, named after Steve Irwin, was first caught as a baby in October 2024 and has now shown his escapist tendencies as an adolescent. Kangaroos are legal to own in Colorado, which has an eclectic list of exotic animals allowed as pets. The capture occurred when an officer approached Irwin in a narrow corridor and caught him as he attempted to jump past.</p>

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings in Minnesota decided against banning the "tush push," a play popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles, despite a proposal from the Green Bay Packers. The vote to ban the play failed to reach the required 75% majority, with the Eagles and several other teams voting against the proposal. The Packers cited player safety and pace of play as reasons to ban the tush push, but the NFL has previously stated that no injuries have been reported on the play. The Eagles celebrated the outcome, posting highlights of the "tush push" on social media.</p>
