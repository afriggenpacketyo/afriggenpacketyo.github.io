        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shetland Islands officials are advancing plans to replace their aging and costly ferry system with a network of undersea tunnels, drawing direct inspiration from a similar successful infrastructure model in the Faroe Islands. The proposed project is seen as transformational, aiming to revitalize remote island life and bolster key local industries like salmon farming, which have been hampered by unreliable transport links. The council is exploring a funding model based on borrowing and user tolls, which could establish a new precedent for other remote Scottish communities seeking to improve their infrastructure and secure their economic future.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:03:37 EDT</div>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now constituting about 30-40% of all passenger cars in major cities and over 93% of new car sales in 2025. The country's success is attributed to a long-term strategy of strong government incentives, including VAT exemptions, reduced fees, and heavy investment in charging infrastructure. Additionally, high taxes on internal combustion engine cars have effectively phased them out of the market. This comprehensive approach has led to cleaner air and quieter cities, demonstrating a successful model for widespread EV adoption.</p>

          <p>A new district named Sickla in Stockholm, Sweden, is set to become the world's largest urban development built primarily from wood, with a $1.25 billion investment from developer Atrium Ljungberg. The project will cover 2.7 million square feet, featuring homes, offices, and schools constructed with cross-laminated timber, a more sustainable alternative to steel and concrete. This initiative aligns with Sweden's cultural connection to forestry and aims to showcase a model for sustainable construction, significantly reducing the carbon emissions typically associated with the building sector. The first residential units are expected to be completed by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it will soon resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. The sales were previously halted in April due to U.S. export controls designed to limit Beijing's access to advanced technology. The reversal follows lobbying efforts by CEO Jensen Huang and a recent meeting with President Trump, where Huang reaffirmed Nvidia's commitment to American job creation. This development is seen as a significant win for Nvidia, allowing it to reinforce its market leadership in China.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations and keeping the country on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. However, this represents a slowdown from the first quarter's 5.4% expansion, and underlying data reveals weaknesses, including slowing retail sales and a deepening slump in the real estate market. While the strong GDP figure may reduce immediate pressure for large-scale stimulus, officials acknowledge the need for stronger support to stabilize the property sector and boost consumer income to sustain spending.

          <p>Chinese commercial space company Space Pioneer has successfully completed a critical ground-based stress test on its Tianlong-3 rocket, a year after a similar test resulted in an explosive failure. The test simulated key mission phases, including lift-off and flight, with the rocket's nine-engine first stage holding up under all conditions. This marks a significant step forward for the company, which aims to develop a reusable rocket comparable to SpaceX's Falcon 9. The previous incident in 2024 saw the rocket unexpectedly lift off and crash, creating a large fireball.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Tel Aviv University have discovered the first evidence that animals respond to sounds produced by plants, potentially opening up a new field of ecological study. The research found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic distress noises, suggesting the moths could perceive the plants as unhealthy. While the sounds are outside the range of human hearing, they can be detected by many insects and some mammals. This groundbreaking discovery suggests a previously unknown layer of communication and interaction within ecosystems.</p>

However, many of the corporation's biggest shows are produced by independent companies or its commercial arm, BBC Studios. Stars employed by these entities, such as the hosts of "Strictly Come Dancing" or actors in major dramas, do not appear on the list, providing an incomplete picture of talent pay at the broadcaster.</p>

The department issued a public appeal for help, detailing the route the deputies had taken when the weapon went missing. A resident of Lennox found the black, hard-shelled carrying case, initially thinking it contained a musical instrument, and responsibly turned it in to a local sheriff's station.
