          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 07:28:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the company behind the CrushAI app, for using artificial intelligence to generate nude images of individuals from clothed photographs. The lawsuit aims to prevent CrushAI from advertising its apps on Meta's platforms, as the company believes this violates its policies against non-consensual intimate imagery. Joy Timeline reportedly attempted to circumvent Meta's ad review process, prompting Meta to take legal action and enhance its technology to detect such ads. Meta will also share information about entities violating its policies with other tech companies through the Tech Coalition's Lantern Program, focusing on child safety. Meta is committed to protecting its community from abuse and will take necessary steps, including legal action, against those who violate its platform policies.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren is urging President Trump to reverse course on the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to cut government spending, suggesting he adopt her policy proposals instead. This follows a public disagreement between Trump and Elon Musk regarding government spending cuts. Warren, along with Representative Melanie Stansbury, outlined DOGE's failures and provided recommendations to save over $2 trillion over 10 years. Warren's suggestions include cracking down on prescription drug middlemen, eliminating waste in federal charter school programs, and reforming the estate tax exemption. The letter comes after Musk expressed regret for some of his posts about President Trump, indicating a potential shift in their relationship.</p>

          <p>The backlog in routine hospital treatments in England has decreased to its lowest level in two years, with the waiting list dropping to 7.39 million at the end of April. However, the NHS has not met its target of seeing 92% of patients within 18 weeks for nine years, with the current rate just below 60%. The government has prioritized meeting this target and announced above-inflation rises for the NHS in the coming years. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting stated that the NHS is on the road to recovery, with further investment and reforms planned to build on this progress.</p>

          <p>A study of Brazilian football fans suggests that the collective rituals surrounding the game, such as marching to the stadium and pre-match chanting, can be more emotionally intense than the game itself. The article suggests that football is a collective ritual and a public theatre of identity. The author suggests that football elicits a wide range of emotions and psychological states. The author concludes that, in an increasingly individualistic world, football's collectivities and communitarian cultures are more valuable than ever.</p>

Nvidia plays a key role in the development of driverless vehicles, providing both hardware and software solutions for AVs.

The latest eruptive episode was preceded by gas-pistoning, and scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are monitoring the activity. The USGS has set up livestream videos to monitor the volcano. The USGS warned that high levels of volcanic gas can have far-reaching effects downwind and can cause respiratory and other problems, as well as other hazards like Pele's hair.</p>
