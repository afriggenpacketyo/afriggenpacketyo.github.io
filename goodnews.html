          <h2>Taiwanese Dollar Fluctuates Amid Speculation of U.S. Pressure and Central Bank Intervention</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 07:40:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taiwanese dollar experienced a pullback after a historic surge, leading to speculation about pressure from Washington to strengthen the local currency. Despite the recent weakness, the Taiwanese dollar remains significantly up against the U.S. dollar for the year, driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt. The central bank's actions are under scrutiny, with some analysts suggesting that exchange rates may be part of U.S.-Taiwan trade conversations. The article notes that the central bank has been intervening to curb excessive inflows, but analysts are skeptical of any meaningful intervention so far.</p>

          <p>DoorDash announced its acquisition of restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion, alongside first-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations, causing shares to dip. The all-cash deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025 and aims to enhance DoorDash's ability to build world-class services that increase its potential to grow local commerce and support its financial goals. The company also reported total orders of 732 million for the quarter, an 18% increase year-over-year, though slightly below analyst expectations. DoorDash anticipates second-quarter adjusted EBITDA between $600 million and $650 million.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, recently released after being detained during a citizenship interview, asserts that President Trump will not silence him. Mahdawi, a green card holder, was detained under a rarely used law citing "adverse foreign policy consequences" due to his leadership in protests against the Israel-Hamas war. He views his release as a "light of hope" for other detained student activists and criticizes the Trump administration's rationale as "laughable." Despite the ordeal, Mahdawi plans to continue protesting and advocating for justice and peace.</p>

          <p>King Charles III unveiled his official coronation portrait, painted by Peter Kuhfeld, depicting the monarch in his regalia from the crowning ceremony, aiming for a more positive reception than his previous portrait. The sunlight from a nearby window makes the crown appear to glisten. Alongside it, Queen Camilla's portrait by Paul Benney was revealed, portraying her in a photorealistic style wearing her silk coronation dress. The immediate reaction to Kuhfeld's work was more favorable than the previous portrait, with commenters praising its beauty and lack of red hues.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% jump in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, but warned that U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively impact earnings this year. The company posted a net profit of 412 million euros ($466.3 million) for the first three months of the year. Ferrari cautioned that the introduction of U.S. tariffs on EU cars imported into the U.S. could negatively impact the firm's profitability this year. The president imposed a 25% tariff on automotive imports into the U.S. in early April. Ferrari said in late March that it would raise prices by 10% on certain models in response to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, during a recent visit to the U.S., expressed interest in adopting aspects of American gun culture in Israel. Ben-Gvir, a long-time advocate for wider distribution of firearms, visited a shooting range and a gun store, noting his surprise at the quantity and types of weapons available. He believes that expanding access to firearms would give citizens a greater sense of security and the right to defend themselves. Gun culture in Israel has changed since the Oct. 7 massacre, with a rise in applications for firearm permits and streamlined processes.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala, raising a record $31 million, officially opened the Costume Institute‚Äôs exhibition ‚ÄúSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,‚Äù examining 300 years of Black fashion and the history of Black dandyism. The show and the party have a different feel than its planners may have intended because the political landscape looked very different when the Met announced the show in October. Kamala Harris, the first Black woman ever to top a major-party ticket, was in the final weeks of her campaign for the White House. The Costume Institute has never had a Black curator, and the Met has its own history of racism. Despite many D.E.I. initiatives after 2020, the fashion world failed to make good on its promises.</p>

Morgan insists this is not a "split" but a "grown up modern government" and patriotic. She said the Welsh government's "red Welsh Labour way" was working for the people of Wales, with free prescriptions, a cap on social care and high recycling rates.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz failed to be elected German chancellor Tuesday, after he fell short of securing a majority in a shock first-round parliamentary vote. Merz needed at least 316 votes to become chancellor and only 310 members of parliament voted in his favor. Germany's Bundestag has a total of 630 members. The result marks an unanticipated setback for Merz who was widely expected to secure the necessary votes and be officially sworn in later in the day. Despite the setback, Merz is still expected to eventually be elected chancellor, economists and analysts said Tuesday.</p>

Even if Chinese authorities wanted to quickly diversify away from the dollar, few options of high-grade and liquid foreign assets exist wherein to park China‚Äôs US$3.2 trillion official foreign exchange reserves.
