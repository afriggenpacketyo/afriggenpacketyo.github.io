        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the reasons why some seniors prefer Medigap despite Medicare Advantage's lower premiums and extra perks. Key factors include the freedom to see any doctor accepting Medicare nationwide, more predictable out-of-pocket expenses for chronic conditions, and fewer administrative hurdles like prior authorizations. The choice ultimately depends on an individual's health needs, travel habits, and financial situation, balancing Medigap's stability against the bundled benefits often found in Medicare Advantage plans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four months after U.S. strikes against Iranian military targets, which critics warned could trigger a wider conflict, the Middle East is experiencing a period of relative quiet. Proponents of a more assertive foreign policy now argue that the decisive action successfully restored deterrence, leading to reduced attacks from Iranian proxies and culminating in a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. While some analysts maintain the strikes were a diplomatic gamble that undermined trust, others credit the show of strength with preventing further escalation from Tehran.</p>

          <p>According to the World Health Organization, smoking prevalence in Southeast Asia has significantly decreased over the past two decades, dropping from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020. This public health success is attributed to strong government policies, including higher taxes, advertising bans, and smoke-free public spaces in countries like Singapore and Thailand. However, the region now faces the growing popularity of e-cigarettes, particularly among adolescents, creating a new regulatory dilemma for governments balancing public health with political and economic pressures.</p>

          <p>John Furner, CEO of Walmart U.S., stated that the resurgence of American manufacturing is a strategic priority that benefits both the company and the country. He noted that nearly two-thirds of products sold by Walmart are already made, grown, or assembled in the U.S., and the company is increasing these investments, such as with a new beef processing facility in Kansas. While global sourcing remains crucial for certain products, Furner emphasized that strengthening domestic production enhances supply chain flexibility and creates American jobs.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced plans for "targeted action" to address cost-of-living challenges in the forthcoming Budget, potentially including cuts to the VAT on energy bills. Speaking in Washington, Reeves emphasized the shared responsibility of the government and the Bank of England to lower inflation, which is forecast to be the highest among G7 nations. Despite an estimated £22 billion fiscal gap, she reiterated her commitment not to raise rates on income tax, VAT, or National Insurance, suggesting any tax increases would focus on those "with the broadest shoulders."

          <p>Cardiff is set to become one of the first UK cities to implement a parking premium for sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and other large vehicles after the council's cabinet approved a new 10-year parking strategy. The plan aims to reduce congestion and air pollution by introducing a surcharge for residential parking permits based on vehicle weight, with the heaviest vehicles being ineligible for permits altogether. The changes also include scrapping residential permits in the city center and creating new permit types for carers and NHS workers.</p>

The four-hour descent required him to navigate 50-degree steep gullies and even abseil down a 200-meter section of bare rock. The achievement serves as a tribute to Nelson, who died in a mountaineering accident three years ago.</p>
