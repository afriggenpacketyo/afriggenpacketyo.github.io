          <p>Phil Robertson, the founder of Duck Commander and star of "Duck Dynasty," has died at the age of 79. Robertson, a former football player, created the duck-call business that led to his family's reality TV fame. He was briefly suspended from the show in 2013 for controversial statements, but was later reinstated due to fan pressure.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old provision in U.S. customs law. This rule allows importers to calculate duties based on the initial sale price between a manufacturer and a vendor, rather than the inflated price from an intermediary. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving an overseas producer and intermediary, carried out independently with proof the item is destined for the U.S., along with documentation of the first sale price. While it requires trust between parties and additional complexities, the potential cost savings make it a worthwhile strategy, especially for higher-value consumer goods (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world's first ship dedicated to salmon farming in June, marking a significant step in the country's efforts to reduce reliance on imported seafood. The Su Hai No 1 vessel, costing $83.6 million, is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. Unlike traditional systems, this vessel can relocate to avoid adverse conditions and features an onboard processing facility, ensuring fresh salmon delivery to domestic markets within 24 hours.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep allows the brain to clear harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, reveals that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ) acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," promoting restorative slumber. This breakthrough offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, potentially opening avenues for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

          <p>Wild chickens have become ubiquitous in Miami, establishing themselves in residential areas and even the downtown core. While some consider their crowing a nuisance, many residents have embraced them as an unofficial city mascot.

In Little Havana, rooster statues symbolize the area's culture, and locals often welcome the birds into their yards.

The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers. The decision follows the appointment of a new farm minister after his predecessor's resignation. The average supermarket rice price reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg in early May.</p>
