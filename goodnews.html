          <p>The offshore yuan experienced a rise in value against the US dollar as reports of progress in US-China trade talks circulated, even though specific details remained undisclosed. China's central bank set the fixing rate for the onshore yuan at 7.2066 against the US dollar, reflecting market optimism fueled by expectations of constructive outcomes in the negotiations between the world's two largest economies. Both sides indicated substantial progress, with a joint statement anticipated soon, raising hopes for a reduction in tariffs that have disrupted global supply chains and increased recession risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced an executive order to lower medication costs by tying Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. The 'most favored nation' policy aims to ensure fair treatment for the U.S. and reduce healthcare costs, though it is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it would stifle innovation. The proposal, similar to one attempted during Trump's first term but blocked by courts, would impact certain drugs covered by Medicare Part B, potentially saving the government trillions, although the exact figure is unclear. The move targets pharmaceutical companies' lobbying efforts and aims to address the disparity between U.S. drug prices and those in other wealthy nations.</p>

          <p>Global markets reacted positively to reports of progress in trade negotiations between the United States and China, although details of the discussions remained limited. Asian stocks saw gains following the meetings in Geneva, where U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted 'substantial progress.' Analysts anticipate that an initial agreement may involve a reduction in tariffs, which currently stand at levels high enough to effectively block trade between the two countries. Economists have warned that the ongoing trade war could significantly increase the possibility of an economic downturn, and the meetings raised hopes that trade barriers could eventually be lowered.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has defended the potential acceptance of a luxury plane from Qatar's royal family, characterizing it as a 'transparent' deal, despite accusations of bribery and corruption. Qatar acknowledged discussions about a possible transfer of a plane for Trump's temporary use as Air Force One, but denied that it was a gift. Trump confirmed the plan on his Truth Social platform, stating that the Defense Department is receiving a free 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One temporarily, a move that Democrats criticize as unnecessary.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily suspending imports of cattle, horses, and bison through southern border ports due to the northward spread of New World Screwworm (NWS) in Mexico.

The USDA said that NWS was recently detected in remote farms with minimal cattle movement as far north as about 700 miles from the U.S. border, and the suspension will continue monthly until containment is achieved.</p>

He believes a deal is likely, with both sides realizing the current path is harmful and expressing willingness to negotiate.

          <p>Japan's universal health insurance system, known for affordability and support for its long-lived population, faces serious strain from a shrinking workforce and aging population, becoming entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust in government. The Ishiba government seeks to secure funds for child-rearing by cutting medical system costs, but faced backlash after proposing to increase the burden on high medical cost patients, leading to a freeze on the plan until after the upper house election.</p>

Researchers who led the trial said both drugs had a role, but Mounjaro may help those with the most weight to lose. Both drugs trick the brain into making you feel full so you eat less and instead burn fat stored in the body - but subtle differences in how they work to explain the difference in effectiveness.</p>
