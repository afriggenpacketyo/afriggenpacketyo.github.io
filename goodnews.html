          <h2>Trump Administration Seeks Supreme Court Review of Tariff Legality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 23:03:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court ruling that deemed many of his tariffs illegal, arguing that the decision undermines U.S. trade policy and economic leverage. The administration asserts that the tariffs are essential for promoting peace and economic prosperity, while a group of small businesses challenging the tariffs expresses confidence in prevailing before the Supreme Court. The administration is seeking an expedited review, citing the need for a swift resolution to avoid jeopardizing ongoing trade negotiations and diplomatic efforts. The case centers on whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorizes the tariffs and whether the law unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority to the president.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced gains, mirroring a tech-driven rally on Wall Street, even as economic anxieties persist. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 both saw increases, with the latter boosted by positive household spending data. Global bond markets remain in focus, with U.S. 30-year Treasury yields rising after a court ruling challenged the legality of the Trump administration's tariffs. Overnight in the U.S., the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a slight decrease, contributing to the mixed global economic outlook.

          <p>China is providing aviation training to representatives from Southeast Asian countries as part of its effort to promote its domestically manufactured civilian aircraft, including the C919. The training course covers various aspects of civil aviation management, including safety, airworthiness, and new technologies. This initiative aligns with China's broader economic cooperation with Southeast Asia and aims to challenge the dominance of Airbus and Boeing in the large jet aeroplane market. China's small C909-model regional jets have already been operating in Southeast Asia for the past decade, accumulating a significant number of passenger trips.</p>

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is exploring a potential bid to return to the Senate in New Hampshire, positioning himself as a top recruit for the GOP. With Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen not seeking reelection in 2026, the seat is open, and Sununu, part of a prominent political family, is weighing his options. While New Hampshire has favored Republicans in gubernatorial races, Senate contests have proven more challenging for the party. Sununu stated he would "seriously consider a run" and make a decision by the end of next month, emphasizing his desire to represent the state's values and work across party lines.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have recovered a painting looted by the Nazis during World War II. The "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century work by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was discovered in an online real estate listing in Mar del Plata. The painting had belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before being seized by the Nazis. The discovery was prompted by Dutch journalists researching Nazi lawyer Friedrich Kadgien, who had escaped to Argentina after the war. Authorities have placed Patricia Kadgien and her husband under house arrest, and are investigating other potentially stolen artworks.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University was unlawful, deeming it an ideologically motivated attack. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that the administration imposed the freeze in retaliation for Harvard's refusal to comply with demands that violated First Amendment protections. The ruling vacates the freezing orders and prohibits the Trump administration from enforcing them. The judge found little connection between the affected research projects and antisemitism, and said the termination was arbitrary. </p>

          <p>China is making significant progress in the development of artificial intelligence "agentic frameworks," with tech giants like Tencent and ByteDance entering the field. Tencent recently open-sourced its Youtu-Agent framework, following ByteDance's release of its Coze Studio platform in July. These agentic frameworks provide tools for building, deploying, and managing AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks for users. This development reflects China's growing capabilities in the AI sector and its competition with U.S. players like AutoGen and OpenAI Swarm.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers need to significantly increase their deliveries in the coming months to achieve their break-even targets amidst intense competition. Companies such as Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr have reported reduced losses in the second quarter due to increased sales driven by discounts. To meet its break-even goal by the fourth quarter, Nio needs to double its monthly deliveries to 50,000 EVs. Analysts emphasize that these companies must cut losses as raising fresh funds becomes challenging due to concerns about overcapacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked President Trump from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, finding "no invasion or predatory incursion." The court ruled that the situation with the Tren de Aragua gang does not meet the definition of either an "invasion" or a "predatory incursion." The Trump administration argued that the gang's members were engaged in an incursion through "mass illegal migration," but the court rejected this argument. The appellate judges granted a preliminary injunction, blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas.</p>
