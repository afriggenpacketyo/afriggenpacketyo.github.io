          <p>Amid rising prices for Halloween costumes, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes from thrifted materials. For nine years, he has spent his own money to collect, redesign, and distribute thousands of free costumes to children. Waggoner's initiative ensures that children can experience the joy of Halloween regardless of their family's financial situation. His efforts have inspired others in the community to donate their old costumes back to his cause, fostering a cycle of giving.</p>

          <p>In response to recent market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager recommends income funds that utilize options-based strategies for risk-averse investors. These funds are designed to offer more structural protection and provide income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes. The manager notes a growing demand for such strategies that can provide defense against equity drawdowns and diversifying income sources. He advises investors to seek out ETFs managed by institutional professionals and to be cautious of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager to commit, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more likely to accelerate relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that financial savings was a primary motivator for men. Experts suggest that beyond economics, men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships for their primary social and emotional support. This dependency can lead to lower psychological well-being when they are single, making them more inclined to seek commitment.</p>

The incident involved Flight 2652 arriving from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which struck the horizontal stabilizer of the other aircraft. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the moving plane, who were able to deplane normally after a delay. This event adds to recent concerns about aviation safety following several other runway collisions and near-misses at U.S. airports.</p>

          <p>Repair work has commenced to restore the main power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has relied on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs. The plant, Europe's largest, is under Russian control but requires a stable power source to cool its reactors and prevent a potential nuclear incident. This marks the 42nd time power lines to the facility have needed restoration since Russia's full-scale invasion began.</p>

          <p>Job seekers are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence tools to create professional headshots for platforms like LinkedIn, offering a fast and affordable alternative to traditional photography. Services such as HeadshotPro and Canva's new feature allow users to generate polished profile pictures for under $50, which some users claim has led to a significant increase in recruiter engagement. However, the trend has raised ethical questions, with career experts warning that poorly executed AI headshots can appear inauthentic and harm a candidate's prospects. Recruiters emphasize that authenticity is crucial, even as it becomes harder to distinguish AI-generated images from real photos.</p>

Founded by Desmond Carter, the group aims to combat the rising suicide rates and the cultural stigma that often prevents Black men from seeking help. Participants discuss pressures related to masculinity, systemic racism, and economic disparities in a supportive environment. Psychologists note that such spaces are crucial, as Black men are less likely to seek mental health care and often face substandard treatment when they do, highlighting a critical need for culturally competent support systems.</p>

Goldman Sachs also reported record third-quarter revenue, driven by its dealmaking division, while BlackRock's results were bolstered by growth in its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The week also saw industrial firms Honeywell and DuPont release details regarding their upcoming corporate spinoffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cities across the globe, including New York, London, and Montreal, are increasingly redesigning streets to prioritize bicycle transportation, leading to cleaner and quieter urban environments. By implementing infrastructure like parking-protected bike lanes, safer intersections, and cyclist-specific traffic signals, cities are making biking a more accessible and less stressful option for residents. This shift away from car-centric planning offers numerous benefits, including reduced carbon emissions, improved air quality, and better public health outcomes. The growing popularity of e-bikes is further expanding the reach and appeal of cycling for daily commutes and recreation.</p>
