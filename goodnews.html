          <p>NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Connor Zilisch, 19, sustained a broken collarbone after an accident during his victory celebration at Watkins Glen. After winning the race, Zilisch was climbing onto the roof of his car when he slipped and fell headfirst onto the ground. He was transported to a hospital but later confirmed via social media that he was recovering and that CT scans of his head were clear. The incident capped an eventful day for the driver, who had been involved in a wreck with a teammate earlier in the race before fighting back to secure his sixth win of the season.</p>

England's Jofra Archer took two wickets for 16 runs, while New Zealand's Michael Bracewell claimed three for 10, restricting Phoenix to a low score of 106-7. In response, Brave's batsmen chased down the target with ease, as Leus du Plooy finished with an unbeaten 48 runs. The comfortable win, achieved with 19 balls to spare, places Southern Brave at the top of the league table alongside the defending champions.</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, who died at the age of 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," described him as a leader who dared to venture to places others would not. Lovell famously commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which was forced to abort its lunar landing after an oxygen tank explosion. The crew's safe return to Earth became known as a "successful failure." In his tribute, Hanks praised Lovell's voyages as being fueled by the challenge of being alive, not for fame or riches.</p>

In the women's category, the award was shared by international teammates Giulia Gwinn and goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger, who both received 145 votes.

          <p>With earnings season winding down, Wall Street is now focused on this week's key inflation data, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI). These reports are critical as they will heavily influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions. Following a weak July jobs report, traders are now largely expecting a rate cut in September, but a surprisingly high inflation reading could shift expectations again. Investors will be closely watching for any price pressures stemming from tariffs, although the full impact of the most recent levies is not yet expected to be reflected in the data.

          <p>The Japanese practice of 'forest bathing,' or shinrin-yoku, is gaining widespread popularity as a method for lowering stress and improving focus. The mindfulness technique involves immersing oneself in nature and connecting with the environment through all senses. Certified forest therapy guides lead sessions that encourage quiet reflection and meditation, which can be an emotional and calming experience for participants. Experts note that the benefits can be achieved even through short, 15-minute sessions in a local park or backyard, emphasizing disconnection from technology to fully engage with the natural surroundings and counter the stress of modern life.</p>

          <p>A plane passenger's TikTok video went viral after she filmed the person sitting behind her repeatedly reaching forward to close her window shade. The passenger, Tori Wils, had purchased a window seat to enjoy the view on her flight to North Carolina. After a brief, non-confrontational exchange where she asked the woman to stop, they laughed about it and the issue was resolved. The video sparked a widespread online debate about airplane etiquette and personal space, with many commenters, including a flight attendant, affirming that control of the window shade belongs to the person in the window seat.</p>

          <p>Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece "Sunset Boulevard" is being celebrated on its 75th anniversary, recognized for its enduring impact and caustic critique of Hollywood. The article explores the film's legacy, featuring interviews with 97-year-old actress Nancy Olson, who co-starred, and Andrew Lloyd Webber, who adapted it into a successful stage musical. The story of the faded silent film star Norma Desmond continues to resonate, with a recent Broadway revival starring Nicole Scherzinger winning a Tony Award. The film's themes of aging, obsession, and the cruelty of the entertainment industry remain as relevant and powerful today as they were in 1950.</p>

          <p>In a humorous commentary, author David Sedaris reflects on the modern phenomenon of being prompted to tip for services where minimal human interaction occurs. He recounts an experience at an airport breakfast spot where he ordered and paid via a screen, yet was still presented with options to tip 15%, 20%, or 22%. Sedaris humorously questions who the tip is for when he has done most of the work himself. He wryly observes the social pressure to select a higher tip percentage to avoid feeling like a cheapskate, weaving in reflections on his immigrant grandparents and the evolving nature of service and gratuity.</p>

          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that developing a personal brand is a crucial career strategy, especially for those who are naturally less outspoken. She explains that a personal brand is simply what people know you for, and it allows individuals to shape the narrative about their skills and talents rather than being underestimated. Chan, who built her own brand through consistent content creation on LinkedIn, advises starting with small, regular actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one update a week. She emphasizes that building a brand also happens offline through social and hobby groups, which can lead to unexpected career opportunities.</p>

          <p>A review of Frances Wilson's new biography, "Electric Spark," re-examines the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic writer obscures her identity as a significant modern religious author. The article posits that Spark, a Catholic convert, used her novels to explore theological themes, particularly the relationship between an omniscient God and humanity, by playing with narrative form. Wilson's biography focuses on the fantastical and formative aspects of Spark's life, including her work in psychological warfare during WWII and a nervous breakdown, which deeply influenced her unique literary style and her obsession with themes of truth, fiction, and divine judgment.</p>

The article notes the evolution of lighthouses, from their artistic immortalization by painters like Edward Hopper to their eventual automation.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists unanimously advise that individuals with high blood pressure should never take licorice root supplements. The supplement contains glycyrrhizin, a compound that can dangerously raise blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium, straining the cardiovascular system. This warning extends to other forms of licorice, including teas and candies, as consuming even small amounts regularly can lead to serious health complications like arrhythmias. Instead of supplements, doctors recommend proven methods for managing blood pressure, such as following the DASH or Mediterranean diets, exercising regularly, and getting adequate sleep, and consulting a physician before starting any new supplement.</p>

These autonomous agents can automate routine but critical tasks like detection, analysis, and investigation, freeing up human analysts to focus on more complex threats. Cybersecurity firms are now offering "agentic teammates" that can handle tasks like monitoring executive travel or quarantining suspicious emails, thereby multiplying the capability of human security teams. While the technology is still evolving, experts believe it is essential for defenders to adopt AI to keep pace with the rapidly advancing capabilities of cybercriminals. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," delves into the enduring literary trope of strange and mystical sisters who challenge societal norms. The novel, set in the 18th century, features five sisters accused of witchcraft and transforming into dogs, serving as a vehicle to explore why femininity is often perceived as a menace. The reviewer notes that literature has a long history of using sister groups, from Macbeth's weird sisters to the Bennet sisters, as a test for more central characters. While "The Hounding" sometimes states its themes too bluntly, it effectively uses the trope to question why female power is feared and persecuted.</p>
