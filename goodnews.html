        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has been declared fit to resume playing on the second day of the third Test against India at Lord's. Stokes experienced a right groin issue on the first day while batting, raising concerns about his ability to continue in the crucial match. After receiving on-field treatment and bowling before the start of play on Friday, he was cleared to continue his innings. The decision provides a significant boost for England, though his vice-captain noted the importance of managing Stokes's physical condition carefully given his history of injuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, held a crucial vote to appoint three new judges to the Federal Constitutional Court. The process highlighted political tensions, as electing a judge requires a two-thirds majority, potentially making the conservative bloc reliant on votes from the far-right AfD party. The Social Democrats nominated two law professors, while the conservatives proposed a federal labor court judge. The vote occurred as the upper house, the Bundesrat, considered a major corporate tax cut package aimed at boosting the German economy, reflecting a busy day in German federal politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a first for the sport of golf, organizers of The Open have installed a Spidercam system above the 18th green at Royal Portrush. This advanced wire-cam technology, common in stadium sports, will provide unique aerial perspectives of the championship's final hole. The installation, a result of a year-long planning project, aims to enhance the broadcast experience for viewers worldwide by capturing the climactic moments of the tournament in unprecedented detail. While there were initial concerns about potential distractions for players, the innovation has reportedly been well-received and could be used in future major tournaments.</p>

          <p>The UK government has shelved immediate plans to alter the rules for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) following significant backlash from banks, building societies, and consumer advocates. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reportedly considering reducing the £20,000 tax-free allowance for cash savings to encourage more investment in stocks and shares. While the changes are on hold for now, they have not been completely ruled out for the future. The Treasury stated its ambition is to ensure savings deliver better returns and drive investment, but it will now consult further before pursuing reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool captain and England international Jordan Henderson is set to return to the Premier League by signing for Brentford. The 35-year-old midfielder will join the club on a two-year contract after mutually agreeing to terminate his contract with Dutch club Ajax a year early. The move is seen as a strategic one for Henderson, providing him a platform to remain in contention for the England national team ahead of the next World Cup. He will fill a key role at Brentford following the departure of former captain Christian Norgaard to Arsenal.</p>

          <p>The newly expanded 32-team Club World Cup has sparked debate over its place in an already packed football schedule. Critics point to player exhaustion, profit-driven motives, and the tournament's association with controversial figures like Donald Trump. However, proponents argue that the competition offers a unique platform for global football, bringing together diverse teams and passionate fanbases, particularly from South America. The tournament has produced memorable underdog victories and exciting matches, but it remains to be seen if skeptical European audiences will embrace it or view it as one tournament too many.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway saw a significant 54% year-on-year increase in June, a stark contrast to the company's declining sales across much of Europe. The surge is largely driven by the popularity of the revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian consumer demands for space, all-wheel drive, and value. This success comes despite a notable backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, with a survey showing 43% of Norwegian EV drivers would not buy a Tesla for political reasons. The data highlights Norway's unique position as the world's most EV-friendly market, heavily supported by government incentives. (not investment advice)</p>
