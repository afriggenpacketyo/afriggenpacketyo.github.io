          <p>Apple has committed to increasing its domestic investments by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total pledge to $600 billion. The announcement was celebrated by President Trump, who framed it as a success for his policy of encouraging companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. The move is seen as an effort by Apple to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs on its global supply chain, which relies heavily on overseas assembly. While Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that final assembly will remain abroad for now, the new investment will focus on expanding its U.S.-based component suppliers and creating 20,000 domestic jobs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new plans to regulate the non-surgical cosmetic industry to protect consumers from unqualified practitioners. Under the proposed crackdown, high-risk procedures like non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. Additionally, clinics offering treatments such as Botox and dermal fillers will need to obtain a license by meeting strict safety, training, and insurance standards. The move, which follows growing concerns over dangerous practices and a number of high-profile injuries and deaths, has been widely welcomed by industry safety groups as a crucial step to enhance public protection.</p>

          <h2>UK University Applicants Likely to Gain Admission Despite Missing Grades, Says Ucas</h2>

          <p>A record number of 18-year-old students in the UK are expected to secure a place at their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their required grades. The head of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) stated that uncertainty around international student enrollment is making universities keener to accept domestic undergraduates. This provides stability for their financial planning and teaching communities. The prediction comes as students await their A-level and other qualification results, suggesting a more flexible and competitive admissions landscape that favors UK-domiciled applicants.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of empty homes in England is steadily increasing, creating problems for local communities and representing a wasted resource amid a housing shortage. Government figures show over 700,000 empty homes, with more than 264,000 being vacant for six months or longer. Residents in areas like Bristol report that derelict properties attract crime, pests, and blight their neighborhoods. While charities are working to renovate some of these properties for the homeless, local government leaders are calling for stronger legal powers to take control of neglected buildings and bring them back into use more efficiently.</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Find Evidence of People Resettling Pompeii's Ruins After Eruption</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research suggests that survivors of the catastrophic AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii. Evidence indicates that a precarious settlement, likened to a camp or favela, emerged among the debris and continued until the 5th century. It appears that some people who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others, reoccupied the site, living without formal city infrastructure. Researchers believe they lived on the upper floors of buried homes and salvaged valuable objects from the ruins, a chapter of the city's history that was previously overlooked by excavations focused on the well-preserved artifacts.</p>

The successful pricing reflects rising investor interest in the space technology sector, following other recent public debuts. Firefly, known for its rockets and lunar landers, recently won a $177 million NASA contract and successfully landed its Blue Ghost vehicle on the moon earlier this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore has retired from the space agency, less than five months after returning from an unexpectedly long mission aboard the International Space Station. Wilmore, 62, was one of two test pilots on Boeing's inaugural Starliner flight last year, which was intended to be a week-long trip. Due to malfunctions with the Starliner capsule, his stay was extended to over nine months, with him and his crewmate Suni Williams ultimately returning to Earth via a SpaceX vehicle. A former Navy captain selected as an astronaut in 2000, Wilmore logged a total of 464 days in orbit over three missions.</p>
