          <p>A certified child life specialist and licensed therapist outlines effective methods for parents to say "no" to their children in ways that foster connection rather than conflict. The approach emphasizes turning denials into teachable moments by explaining the reasoning behind rules, particularly those related to safety and kindness. Offering children choices within established limits helps provide them with a sense of autonomy, while consistency in enforcing boundaries builds trust and teaches emotional regulation and self-control.</p>

          <p>Rick Senko, a 41-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has transformed his small-scale eBay resale operation into a wholesale business named Technsports, which generated over $6.5 million in revenue in 2024. Starting in 2008 while unemployed, Senko began by flipping a used cell phone and eventually pivoted to pre-owned clothing, recognizing a market inefficiency for valuable brands. His new business model involves buying used clothing in bulk and selling it wholesale to other resellers, a strategy that has proven more profitable and less time-intensive.</p>

This remarkable feat, the best bowling figures in the tournament's history, led to South Africa's collapse to 97 all out. Australia successfully chased the target with seven wickets and 199 balls to spare, securing their top spot in the group stage.

          <p>Billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud, founder of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain, has stated that the concept of work-life balance for entrepreneurs is "the biggest line of bulls--- that’s ever been created." He argues that building a successful business from nothing requires an intense, all-consuming work ethic, reflecting on his own journey of working up to 20 hours a day in the early years. Liautaud, who grew his company to over 2,600 locations before selling his majority stake, believes that true entrepreneurial success demands a grinder mentality without compromise.</p>

          <p>A vibrant 1943 Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, sold for 32 million euros (approximately $37 million) at a Paris auction, exceeding expectations. The painting, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat (Dora Maar)," had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over eight decades. The work captures a poignant moment towards the end of their tumultuous relationship, with experts noting its remarkably preserved, vivid colors and raw emotional expression.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach advises parents against attending their children's sports practices, suggesting it helps them develop resilience and internal motivation. The former soccer star argues that when children are not constantly looking to their parents for approval on the sidelines, they are more free to take risks and learn from mistakes. This autonomy can help them become self-starters, a trait crucial for success in adulthood. Instead, she recommends parents focus on praising acts of leadership and good sportsmanship during games.</p>

          <p>A West Virginia family has faced a series of shocking diagnoses after four of their six children were found to have Chiari malformation, a rare condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, was diagnosed after displaying symptoms like constant crying and developmental delays. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed with the condition, with three requiring brain surgery. The family traveled to New York for specialized care, and the successful surgeries have dramatically improved the children's quality of life.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has uncovered and dismantled the country's first known illicit factory producing weight loss drugs. The raid in Northampton resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight loss medicine by a law enforcement agency globally, with an estimated value over £250,000. Authorities seized thousands of unlicensed pens, raw ingredients, and manufacturing equipment, preventing potentially deadly, untested products from reaching consumers.
