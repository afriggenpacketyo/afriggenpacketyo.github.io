        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares jumped almost 19% following better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, significantly boosted by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit and a resurgence in its e-commerce business. The company reported a 78% increase in net income, largely due to gains from equity investments and the disposal of Trendyol, despite a decrease in income from operations. Alibaba's cloud division, crucial for monetizing artificial intelligence, saw 26% year-on-year revenue growth, while AI-related product revenue maintained triple-digit growth. Investors are rewarding Alibaba's strategic investments in AI and new e-commerce models amid intense market competition, reflecting confidence in its long-term growth trajectory.

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a broadly positive opening on Monday, with key indices such as Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 projected to see modest gains. This anticipated uptick follows a period of mixed trading in Asia-Pacific markets, where investors closely analyzed China's August manufacturing data, and precedes a relatively quiet day for economic releases in Europe. Regional markets concluded last Friday with declines, as traders absorbed recent European and U.S. inflation figures and weighed the implications for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Furthermore, ongoing assessments of India-China relations, discussed at the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, are adding a significant geopolitical dimension to the current economic landscape.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping urged members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) to strengthen artificial intelligence cooperation and reject a "Cold War mentality" during the largest-ever SCO summit in Tianjin. The gathering, attended by over 20 foreign leaders including Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi, saw Xi emphasize China's role as a global peacemaker amidst ongoing international tensions. He highlighted China's significant investments in other SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education programs. The article suggests that China's efforts to improve relations, particularly with India, could bolster Beijing's influence and further solidify a multipolar global order, with the summit expected to yield a joint statement on cooperation.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic successfully advanced to the US Open quarter-finals, achieving a dominant straight-sets victory over qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff with scores of 6-3, 6-3, 6-2, in a match lasting less than two hours. The Serb's performance was notable despite receiving medical attention twice during the match for concerns related to his neck and right forearm, raising questions about his physical condition. This win is historically significant, as it makes the 38-year-old Djokovic the oldest player in the Open era to reach the quarter-finals at all four Grand Slam events within a single season. He will now face American hopeful Taylor Fritz in the next round, continuing his quest for a record 25th major title while demonstrating remarkable resilience on court.</p>

          <p>Young people aged 16-21 in Wales will soon access £1 single bus tickets and £3 day passes as part of a new pilot scheme, expanding to include 5-15 year olds from November 3. This initiative, supported by £15 million from the Welsh government, aims to enhance access to education, training, employment, and leisure opportunities, aligning with calls for cheaper public transport for youth. The scheme, which involves all major bus operators on a voluntary basis, is available until September 2026. While welcomed by students for making travel more affordable and encouraging public transport use, an independent watchdog noted that overall satisfaction with bus value for money in Wales remains lower than in England and Scotland.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the private RatingDog purchasing managers' index (PMI) reaching 50.5, surpassing Reuters' estimates and indicating the fastest expansion since March. This improvement was largely driven by a recovery in new export orders, showcasing the resilience of external demand despite existing tariffs. However, the gains in overall output and new orders were more modest, suggesting domestic demand remains weak, while employment in the manufacturing sector continued to decline for a fifth consecutive month. The article highlights a cautious optimism, noting that the durability of this upturn depends on sustained export stability and a pickup in domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott commented on the surprising trade of All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, revealing he "wasn't surprised" by the move due to the perceived personal nature of negotiations between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Parsons' departure saw him secure an NFL record-setting four-year, $188 million deal with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the league. Prescott expressed contentment that the tension had been resolved, thus preventing further "headache and distraction" for the team. In return for Parsons, the Cowboys acquired two future first-round picks and All-Pro defensive tackle Kenny Clark, a strategic decision Jerry Jones framed as prioritizing both the team's immediate and long-term success.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has dramatically increased to an estimated $1.1 billion, now ranking as the fifth-largest prize in the game's history, after no single ticket matched all six winning numbers in Saturday's drawing. Across the United States, nine tickets successfully matched all five white balls, with a notable four of these sold in California, each securing a prize exceeding $1.1 million. The upcoming Monday drawing presents the potential winner with a choice between receiving periodic payments totaling the estimated $1.1 billion or opting for a lump sum payout of approximately $498.4 million, both calculated before taxes. This significant surge in the jackpot, following no winner since May 31, has generated considerable public excitement and increased participation, despite the daunting odds of winning the grand prize.</p>
