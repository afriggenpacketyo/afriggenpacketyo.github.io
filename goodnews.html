          <p>This article outlines several potential fees associated with a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) that can increase the overall cost of borrowing. While HELOCs can be an attractive option due to rising home equity, borrowers should look beyond the advertised interest rate. Potential charges include upfront application and appraisal fees, which can cost several hundred dollars each, as well as ongoing annual maintenance or inactivity fees. Borrowers may also face significant closing costs similar to a mortgage and early termination penalties if the credit line is closed within a few years. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to severely limit access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president's proclamation, which cited an "invasion" as justification, unlawfully overstepped executive authority. The judge found that federal immigration law and the Constitution do not grant the president the power to unilaterally supplant the existing asylum process established by Congress. The court has delayed the order's effect for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal the decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The decision by U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan blocks a plan to revoke the status in September 2025, well before its previously established expiration in February 2026. The judge stated that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, arguing that district courts cannot prohibit the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed a binding target for the EU to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. The proposal comes as much of Europe is experiencing a record-breaking heat wave, underscoring the urgency of climate action. However, the plan is controversial due to a flexibility clause that would allow member states to use international carbon credits to offset a portion of their emissions. Climate activists argue this outsources climate responsibility and undermines domestic investment, while some member states feel the overall target is too ambitious.</p>

          <p>India's captain Shubman Gill scored a patient century to lead his team to a solid position of 310-5 at the close of day one of the second Test against England at Edgbaston. After being put into bat, India was anchored by Gill's unflustered performance and an elegant 87 from opener Yashasvi Jaiswal. England's bowlers fought hard on a flat pitch, with Chris Woakes taking two key wickets, but a late 99-run partnership between Gill and Ravindra Jadeja ensured India ended the day in a strong position, looking to build a formidable first-innings total.</p>

Following a decisive 52-12 victory over the Queensland Reds, certain players like captain Maro Itoje and flanker Jac Morgan have solidified their claims for a Test spot with strong showings. Conversely, other players are facing increased pressure, and an injury to versatile back Elliot Daly has created uncertainty at the fullback position.

          <p>A new mission is being launched to locate Amelia Earhart's aircraft, which vanished during her 1937 attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Researchers, organized by Purdue University, believe a 2015 satellite image may show a piece of her plane on Nikumaroro, a remote island in Kiribati. The expedition team plans to travel to the island in November to investigate the object, which they believe was exposed after a cyclone shifted sand on the atoll. The effort is fueled by what organizers call strong evidence suggesting Earhart and her navigator may have crash-landed there.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that will set tariffs on Vietnamese imports at 20%, avoiding a much higher 46% levy that was scheduled to take effect. The agreement also establishes a steep 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at preventing exporters like China from bypassing duties. In exchange, Vietnam has agreed to eliminate all tariffs on U.S. products, opening its markets to American goods. The deal comes as part of a broader administration effort to renegotiate trade relationships based on what it calls reciprocity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is escalating its fight against the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that threatens livestock, wildlife, and pets. The plan involves breeding billions of male screwworm flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and then airdropping them over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males mate with wild females, whose eggs then fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This sterile insect technique successfully eradicated the pest from North America decades ago and is being revived as the parasite has reappeared in southern Mexico.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers considering a large Certificate of Deposit (CD), this article suggests asking three critical questions before committing funds. First, savers should evaluate whether a short-term or long-term CD is better, as current high rates on short-term options may outweigh the traditional advantage of long-term CDs. Second, one must assess their ability to keep a significant sum like $10,000 locked away without needing access to it, to avoid costly early withdrawal penalties. Finally, it is important to compare CDs to high-yield alternatives like savings or money market accounts, which offer comparable rates with more liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
