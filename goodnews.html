          <p>Daniel Noboa was sworn in as Ecuador's President for a second term, vowing to fight corruption, drug trafficking, and violent crime while fostering job creation and investment through private sector collaboration. The inauguration ceremony was attended by international delegates, including representatives from the U.S. and various South American countries. Noboa, who first assumed the presidency in November 2023, faces significant challenges including violence and high unemployment, necessitating political alliances to advance his agenda. Analysts suggest that maintaining a congressional majority will be crucial for passing legislation, especially concerning crime-fighting measures, while also emphasizing the need to address social issues like jobs, healthcare, and education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing new rules that could allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to meet construction deadlines. Under these plans, housebuilders would be required to commit to specific delivery time frames and submit annual progress reports to councils. Those who repeatedly miss targets could face penalties, including the loss of land and fines, with the goal of building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029. Housing charity Shelter supports the plans, accusing developers of deliberately delaying construction to inflate prices.</p>
