          <p>Trent Sweeney, the brother of actress Sydney Sweeney, humorously referenced the recent controversy surrounding his sister's American Eagle advertisement after his promotion to staff sergeant in the Air Force. He posted a photo of his promotion certificate with the caption, "It’s them good jeans," alluding to the ad's play on words between "genes" and "jeans" that drew some online criticism. The post was met with supportive and amused comments from followers, injecting a moment of levity into the debate. The article also notes the resurgence of a Baskin-Robbins ad featuring the actress.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace agreement at the White House, officially ending decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The U.S.-brokered deal establishes diplomatic relations and mutual respect for territorial integrity. A key component of the agreement is the creation of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, named after President Trump, which grants the U.S. exclusive development rights. The accord is seen as a significant geopolitical development, diminishing Russia's long-standing influence in the region.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that helped guide his crew safely back to Earth after an in-flight explosion, turning a potential catastrophe into a "successful failure." He was also a key member of the Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, from which he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis." Lovell's legacy is remembered for his courage under pressure and the inspiration he provided to millions.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. After alerting authorities and demanding deportations, it was revealed the boat was crewed by a team, including a former Royal Marine, rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. The crew found the incident hilarious, noting the "vigilante-style" response on the shore. Lowe later apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected the possibility of a U.S. military invasion, responding to reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to plan action against drug cartels in Latin America. Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on security issues, any presence of U.S. troops on Mexican soil is "absolutely rejected." The reports have stirred nationalist sentiment in Mexico, a country with a history of U.S. military intervention. The situation underscores the complex security relationship between the two nations, especially concerning the fight against powerful transnational criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are falling in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West, offering modest relief in a tight housing market. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from their 2022 peaks, a trend attributed to rising housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices due to limited supply and stricter building regulations. This regional divergence creates a varied experience for homebuyers and sellers across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials rose over 4% after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the second quarter, driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is essential for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and electronics, and the production increase signals progress toward profitability. The positive results follow a major investment from the Department of Defense, which recently purchased $400 million in preferred stock, making the federal government the company's largest shareholder and reinforcing its strategic importance.

          <p>The U.S. government, across both the Biden and Trump administrations, has provided significant federal assistance to bolster the domestic mining and metal refining industries to reduce reliance on foreign materials. An example is a former coal mine in North Dakota being repurposed to process nickel, a critical component for electric vehicle batteries, with the help of a $114 million grant from the Department of Energy. This bipartisan effort, which includes Pentagon involvement via the Defense Production Act, aims to secure domestic supply chains for strategic assets and counter China's dominance in the critical minerals market.</p>

          <p>For individuals in creative or screen-focused professions, incorporating short physical breaks throughout the day can be a powerful tool for overcoming mental blocks and improving mood. Author Kelly Corrigan advocates for simple tactics like three-minute dance breaks to music, which she calls the cheapest way to change one's emotional state. Other suggestions include taking phone calls while walking and tidying one's workspace to reset focus. The key insight is to work with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than fighting against them, treating movement as an integral part of the creative process.</p>
