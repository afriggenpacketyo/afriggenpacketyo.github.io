          <h2>Chinese Surgeons Achieve Successful Pig-to-Human Lung Transplant</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 22:48:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Surgeons at the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease in Guangzhou, China, have achieved a successful pig-to-human lung transplant, demonstrating the procedure's feasibility while acknowledging the need for substantial further testing. The genetically modified pig lung was transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient and remarkably maintained viability and functionality for 216 hours, or nine days, without showing signs of infection or rejection. This advancement in xenotransplantation is a significant step towards addressing the critical global organ shortage, especially considering the unique anatomical and physiological complexities that make lung transplants particularly challenging, including direct exposure to external air. Researchers emphasize that this success underscores progress in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies, though key challenges remain for clinical translation.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Singapore have made significant strides in developing remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, envisioning them as a miniature, agile army suitable for future disaster search and rescue missions. A recent article in Nature Communications detailed how the team has improved the control of these insect robots, enhancing their turning ability from 70 degrees to over 80 degrees, and verifying this precise control through a series of experiments. This "insect robot factory" concept aims to industrialize production, thereby reducing the mass production time and cost for practical applications. Reviewers lauded this "meaningful work" on insect-computer hybrid robots, highlighting their potential to navigate challenging disaster environments and contribute to humanitarian efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A district court judge in Utah has ruled that the state’s Republican-controlled legislature drew congressional boundaries in violation of voters’ rights, mandating that the map must be redrawn for the 2026 midterm elections. The current map, enacted in 2021, strategically divided Salt Lake County, the state's population center and a Democratic stronghold, among the four congressional districts, resulting in wide Republican victories. The ruling asserts that the legislature circumvented a commission established by voters specifically to ensure non-partisan district drawing. While Republican lawmakers have promised appeals, this decision creates significant uncertainty in a state previously considered a reliable GOP sweep, and could impact the national balance of power in the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>U.S. aviation giant Boeing and Korean Air have announced a substantial $36 billion deal for 103 passenger and cargo jets, a development that aligns with President Donald Trump's ongoing efforts to pressure trading partners into increasing business with American firms. This agreement was unveiled just hours after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met Trump in Washington to discuss U.S. tariffs imposed on the Asian country. The new jets are intended to modernize Korean Air's fleet as it merges with Asiana Airlines, ensuring its competitiveness, and the deal is expected to support some 135,000 jobs across the U.S. This purchase is part of a broader South Korean commitment to raise its investment in the U.S. to $26 billion, including a new robot production facility.

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have made a surprising move, trading veteran quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick. This trade comes as the Raiders were in urgent need of a backup quarterback after Aidan O’Connell fractured his wrist during the preseason, sidelining him for 6-8 weeks. Pickett, who has 25 starts under his belt, will now likely serve as the backup to Geno Smith, reuniting Smith with his former head coach Pete Carroll. The deal simplifies the Browns' crowded quarterback room, where Pickett had been competing with Joe Flacco and two rookies for a spot.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified new regulations for cordless hairstyling tools, mandating that those powered by lithium metal or lithium-ion batteries, or gas/butane fuel, are only permitted in carry-on bags. This restriction, which does not apply to traditional plug-in devices, is a critical safety measure designed to allow passengers or flight attendants to immediately react if these devices overheat or combust during a flight. Lithium-ion batteries, commonly found in various personal electronics, pose a significant fire risk, particularly in the cargo area of a plane where incidents might go unnoticed for an extended period. As an additional protective measure, these hair care tools must have a safety cover securely fitted over their heating element.</p>

Trading under the stock sign 6960, the shares first changed hands at HK$22.50, significantly above their offer price of HK$14.51 per share. Chairman Yang Rui attributed this success to the company "riding two tremendous waves": the advancements in artificial intelligence and the strategic goal of expanding overseas.

Approximately 80,000 attendees are gathering for the "global cultural movement" in the Black Rock Desert, which has previously experienced extreme weather, such as heavy rains in 2023 that caused significant travel delays due to muddy roads. While these conditions are considered normal for monsoon season in the area, slow-moving storms could produce more rain, though damp conditions might also help reduce the amount of airborne dust. The area is expected to dry up starting Thursday, offering some relief before the event concludes next Monday.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has been forced to postpone the 10th test flight of its giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket for the second consecutive day, this time due to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This marks another delay for the milestone mission, which aims to demonstrate critical fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year, including propellant leaks and engine shutdowns. A successful flight is crucial for increasing launch cadence and developing autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a key requirement for NASA's planned moon landing as early as 2027 and eventual flights to Mars. Despite thousands of remaining engineering challenges, including perfecting cryogenic propellant transfer in orbit, NASA's acting administrator remains optimistic about SpaceX's ability to meet its ambitious goals, citing their historical record of rapid progress.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding to U.S. schools, following a multi-state lawsuit that challenged its abrupt decision to freeze congressionally allocated funds. These vital funds, intended for a range of educational services including after-school and summer learning programs, teacher training, and support for English-learners, were initially withheld just weeks before the school year began, causing widespread uncertainty. While a White House spokesperson had vaguely cited instances of federal education money being "grossly misused to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda," the lawsuit, led by California's Attorney General, argued the administration illegally impounded funds designated by Congress. The restoration of these funds is a significant positive outcome, particularly for the approximately 1.4 million children, predominantly from low-income families, who benefit from these programs.</p>

Second, focus on building core and back strength through consistent exercises like pilates and yoga, rather than relying on external gadgets. Third, address mindset, recognizing that emotional and psychological stress significantly contribute to back pain, emphasizing that easing one's schedule can be as crucial as physical adjustments.</p>
