          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant decline following Iran's missile strike on the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, as there were no reported casualties, fostering optimism for de-escalation. U.S. crude oil futures fell by over 7%, closing at $68.51 per barrel, while Brent also decreased by a similar percentage to $71.28. The strike was in retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but Qatar confirmed its air defenses intercepted the missiles, preventing any casualties. Energy Secretary Chris Wright credited President Donald Trump's foreign policy for fostering a safer, more stable Middle East. Optimism for de-escalation in the Middle East conflict drove the price decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

The Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) instructed staff to remove the app from government devices, citing a lack of transparency in WhatsApp's data practices. Meta has responded, disagreeing with the CAO's characterization and emphasizing WhatsApp's encrypted nature provides a higher level of security than many approved apps. Acceptable alternatives to WhatsApp include Microsoft Teams, Signal, and Apple's iMessage, as the House prioritizes protecting sensitive data from potential cybersecurity risks.

          <p>Ford Motor Company is recalling over 197,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles from model years 2021-2025 due to a door latch issue that could potentially trap passengers inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) indicated that if the car's battery level is low, the door latches may remain locked, preventing occupants from exiting, particularly children. Ford is also recalling 120,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles in markets outside the U.S. The company plans to address the issue with a software update and is unaware of any injuries or accidents related to the faulty latches, as letters notifying owners of the safety risk will be sent out. This action follows another recall from the automaker last month regarding a software glitch with the rearview camera.</p>

Early users reported positive experiences with the service, but some road users and researchers observed the robotaxis appearing to violate traffic rules.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about the potential impact on the oil and gas industry, with experts speculating on the possibility of higher energy prices for consumers. While oil prices initially jumped, they later retreated as analysts believe Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for global oil supply. However, ongoing tensions could disrupt the energy market, potentially driving up prices for gasoline and other products. Experts suggest that Israeli strikes on Iran's oil facilities or attacks by Iranian proxy groups could further disrupt the flow of oil, pushing Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel. The conflict introduces uncertainty into the energy market.</p>

          <p>This Fox News article compares the Bush administration's approach to the Middle East during the War on Terror with President Trump's recent actions against Iran. It highlights the shift from regime change and ground wars to a strategy focused on decisive force to prevent Iranian nuclear proliferation. Steve Yates, a former Bush administration advisor, notes the world has changed significantly in 20 years, with China's rise and a shift away from globalism influencing Trump's approach. Trump's strategy emphasizes allies taking on more responsibility and using American force only when necessary to achieve specific objectives. The article suggests Trump's approach is more targeted and less focused on long-term occupation or remaking Iran.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Summer 2025 presents homeowners with opportunities to leverage their home equity for various expenses, but it is important to do so strategically to avoid financial risks. Homeowners should understand the differences between a home equity loan and a HELOC, as loans offer a lump sum with fixed interest rates while HELOCs provide a revolving line of credit with variable rates. Shopping around for the best rates and terms is crucial, especially with potential rate cuts on the horizon. It's recommended to use home equity for financially sound purposes, such as paying off high-interest debt, rather than discretionary spending like vacations. Prudent use of home equity can improve long-term financial health.</p>

Cramer noted that the global energy market's transformation, with increased U.S. oil production, has contributed to this measured reaction.
