          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor secured a third victory over Amanda Serrano, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a historic all-female event at Madison Square Garden. The bout, described as a tactical "chess match," ended in a majority decision with scores of 97-93, 97-93, and 95-95. Unlike their previous encounters, this fight saw a more strategic approach from both boxers, with Taylor's economical and precise counters ultimately proving decisive. Following the win, the 39-year-old champion acknowledged the historic nature of the rivalry but remained noncommittal about her future in the sport.</p>

          <p>Sedrick T. Stevenson, a fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and returned to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of a smiling Stevenson on the return flight, where he was under heavy guard by U.S. Marshals and other law enforcement to prevent another escape. Stevenson, who was wanted on multiple charges including firearm possession and assault, had initially evaded a contracted agent by boarding a light rail train. His recapture followed a month-long manhunt, with officials emphasizing that justice will eventually catch up with fugitives.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key research and development staff, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. The agreement includes compensation for the talent and a nonexclusive license for Google to use certain Windsurf technology, while Windsurf remains an independent entity. This move intensifies the AI talent war among major tech companies, following recent high-profile hires by Meta and Microsoft. The deal was struck after Windsurf's exclusive acquisition talks with OpenAI reportedly expired, highlighting the high demand for expertise in advanced AI coding tools.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing backlash for showcasing sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted when Prada presented the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, prompting criticism from fashion critics and politicians in India. Following the outcry, Prada engaged in talks with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans. This move is seen as a step toward respectful collaboration between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to halt immigration raids that rely on racial profiling in several Southern California counties. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit by the ACLU and other groups, which presented evidence of unconstitutional tactics. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's order prohibits federal agents from making arrests based solely on factors like a person's apparent ethnicity, accent, or presence at specific locations like car washes or day laborer sites. The decision is a temporary measure while the broader lawsuit, which also alleges denial of legal counsel, proceeds through the courts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege their voices were illicitly cloned and used on Lovo's platform after they were hired for what they were told was internal, academic work. While the judge dismissed claims that a person's voice itself can be copyrighted, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their recordings as training data will proceed. The case represents a significant development in the legal battles between creators and AI companies.</p>

          <p>Driven by a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies operating abroad, Chinese law firms are significantly expanding their international presence. The number of overseas offices for Chinese law firms has increased by 70 percent since 2018, reaching over 200 branches. These firms find that Chinese companies prefer their legal support, citing greater trust and cultural understanding. However, lawyers acknowledge that attracting non-Chinese clients is challenging amidst current geopolitical tensions. This expansion is seen as a crucial step for Chinese legal professionals to support the nation's global economic ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport in Michigan has secured a $14 million Airport Improvement Grant from the Federal Aviation Administration. The funding will support several key infrastructure projects, including runway construction, grading, and the relocation of the runway's lighting system. Airport officials stated that the grant is vital for a planned runway extension that will enhance safety, reduce flight delays, and minimize cancellations due to weight restrictions. Construction for these improvements is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2026 and is expected to be completed by the fall of the same year.</p>

          <p>Approximately 60 weight-loss drugs are currently under trial in China, positioning domestic firms to compete with popular GLP-1 medications like Ozempic in a market valued at over $150 billion. The patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is set to expire in China in 2026, much earlier than in other global markets. This is expected to pave the way for numerous generic versions, significantly increasing affordability and access for patients with obesity and diabetes. Analysts predict that the entry of up to 20 generic competitors will drive down prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A terminal operator at the Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project, despite a recent slowdown in port activity attributed to tariff-related trade uncertainties. The project will extend the quay and fill in 19 acres of water, increasing cargo-handling capacity by 50% and enabling the port to accommodate larger ships. Officials acknowledge the current downturn in global trade but express confidence in the long-term necessity of the infrastructure investment. The expansion comes as both the Port of Long Beach and the neighboring Port of Los Angeles have reported recent drops in container movement and exports.</p>

          <p>King Charles hosted his inaugural "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, bringing together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and philanthropists to celebrate his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The event featured a fire ceremony and discussions centered on the interconnectedness of all life and the need to work with, not against, the natural world. This philosophy underpins the King's decades of work on environmentalism, sustainable farming, and interfaith dialogue. Sources close to the King suggest this concept of harmony is a central part of his intended legacy, aiming to create a more sustainable world.</p>
