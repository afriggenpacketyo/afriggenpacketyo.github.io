          <h2>Elon Musk Expresses Regret Over Social Media Posts About Donald Trump</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk publicly stated his regret for some of his recent social media posts concerning President Donald Trump, acknowledging that they "went too far." This follows an explosive public dispute between Musk and his former close ally, Trump, which had fueled market concerns over Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict began over Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk claimed would undermine the work of DOGE and substantially increase the U.S.'s budget deficit. Trump had previously threatened consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates challenging the bill, though he later softened his stance. The regret comes after Tesla's shares took a hit following the conflict. The author's tone is one of neutral reporting on the situation. Optimism score must be between 0 and 100 and be a multiple of 5.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased its propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along the border with North Korea as part of President Lee Jae Myung's administration's efforts to de-escalate tensions. These broadcasts had been resumed in June of the previous year under Lee's predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, in response to North Korea's actions. The South Korean military stated that the halt is aimed at restoring trust and achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula. This decision follows a period of heightened tensions, including the exchange of trash-carrying balloons between the two countries, and reflects a shift towards a more pragmatic approach under the new South Korean leadership. The decision to stop the broadcasts is a move towards rebuilding mutual trust between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Mortgage application volume experienced a significant increase, rising 12.5% compared to the previous week, reaching the highest level in over a month after adjusting for the Memorial Day holiday. The Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index revealed this surge, though overall volume remains low historically. Despite a slight increase in the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, applications to refinance and purchase homes both saw substantial gains. This uptick may be attributed to a loosening housing inventory in certain markets, as supply is now considerably higher than the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores the cultural emphasis on romantic relationships over friendships and argues for the importance of prioritizing both.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the idea of "recession pop," referring to upbeat, bubblegum pop music from the time of the Great Recession, and whether music can predict economic downturns. It features an interview with Charlie Harding, cohost of Switched on Pop, who is skeptical about music's predictive power. Harding argues that while there was upbeat music during the Great Recession, there was also music of all kinds, and the genre is a slippery one. He suggests that the current interest in recession pop may be more about millennials aging out of being cool than about the economy.</p>
