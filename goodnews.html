          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Bitcoin 2025 conference, asserting the Trump administration's support for stablecoin legislation. Vance argued that stablecoins do not threaten the U.S. dollar's integrity but rather act as a force multiplier for the nation's economic power. He highlighted the administration's pro-crypto stance, contrasting it with previous Democratic concerns about conflicts of interest related to President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures. Vance emphasized the value of legitimizing stablecoins, referencing the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate digital assets and potentially unlock trillions of dollars in demand for U.S. Treasuries (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal court has blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, stating he overstepped his authority, which the Trump administration plans to appeal. Trump expressed frustration with Russia's slow progress in ending the war in Ukraine but isn't imposing new sanctions. Meanwhile, American and European conservatives are convening in Hungary for the Conservative Political Action Conference, seeing Viktor Orban's leadership as inspirational. There are parallels between Trump and Orban in style and substance, particularly in their handling of universities, raising concerns about democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's shares experienced a surge in premarket trading following a positive earnings report, triggering a rally in global semiconductor stocks. Despite taking a hit from U.S. semiconductor export restrictions to China, Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings and revenue boosted investor confidence. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to export curbs, but this did not deter overall positive sentiment. The rally extended to other companies like Tokyo Electron, SK Hynix, ASM International, and Qualcomm, highlighting Nvidia's influence as a bellwether for the semiconductor industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deceptively simple reform that could unlock more housing is the allowance of single-stair apartment buildings, a common design in Europe and Asia. In the US, building codes typically require two staircases for buildings over three stories, adding significant construction costs and limiting design flexibility. Advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings just as safe and could encourage the development of more affordable "missing middle" housing. Several states are considering or have already passed laws to allow single-stair designs in four- to six-story buildings, despite resistance from fire safety officials.</p>

          <p>The USWNT, fresh off their Olympic gold, now faces the challenge of moving forward without the dynamic 'Triple Espresso' trio of Mallory Swanson, Sophia Wilson, and Trinity Rodman. Injuries and pregnancies have sidelined the three stars, forcing coach Emma Hayes to explore new attacking options for the 2027 World Cup. The absence of the trio provides opportunities for emerging talents like Alyssa and Gisele Thompson, Michelle Cooper, and Ally Sentnor to step up and prove their worth. While the return of Triple Espresso remains a possibility, Hayes is focused on building a team that can contend with the world's elite regardless of their availability.</p>
