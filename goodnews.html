          <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers organization addressed concerns from fans who were upset by the appearance of Steelers players Mason Rudolph, Miles Killebrew, and former player Rocky Bleier at a Donald Trump speech at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania. The players presented Trump with a custom jersey, leading to criticism from fans who felt it was an endorsement of the former president. In a letter to fans, the Steelers clarified that the players' views do not necessarily reflect the views of the entire organization, emphasizing that players make their own individual decisions. The organization's response underscores the challenges sports teams face in navigating the intersection of politics and fan expectations.</p>

          <p>An American retiree living in Lisbon, Portugal, debunks three common myths about retiring abroad. He argues that living in a "laid-back" country doesn't necessarily equate to low stress, as expats often face administrative hurdles. Additionally, he notes that cost savings can be offset by added expenses and fluctuating currency exchange rates. Finally, making friends in a new country can be challenging, particularly in rural areas.
