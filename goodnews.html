          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to convene his cabinet to approve a proposed Gaza Strip ceasefire deal, following intense negotiations. The agreement, brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, outlines the release of all remaining hostages by Hamas in exchange for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners and an Israeli troop withdrawal to a designated "yellow line" in Gaza. Trump hailed the deal as a significant step towards lasting peace, with key Arab, Muslim, and European states, alongside the UN, offering supportive statements and commending mediation efforts. The cessation of fighting will commence after the Israeli government officially ratifies the agreement, which is expected soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Serial entrepreneur Ben Askins, co-founder of Gaia and author of "My Boss Is A Moron," identifies four critical red flags in job descriptions that can hint at a toxic workplace environment. These include confusing corporate jargon, the absence of a clear salary or salary range, vague job expectations, and the presentation of legally mandated offerings as special benefits or perks. Askins emphasizes that multiple such indicators suggest a company's carelessness or a fundamental misunderstanding of the role, leading to shifting goalposts for employees. He advises job seekers to leverage the job description stage, where they have the most control, to align a potential role with their personal negotiables and non-negotiables, preventing future dissatisfaction.</p>

          <p>A Kazakh government official is actively seeking greater infrastructure investment, especially along the Middle Corridor trade route, to solidify the country's position as a crucial land bridge between China and Europe. Asset Nussupov, Kazakhstan’s vice-minister of trade and integration, identified procedural differences in customs and logistics as current bottlenecks hindering efficient goods flow. He cited a recent World Bank report forecasting a tripling of trade volumes along the Caspian Sea section of the Middle Corridor by 2030, amounting to approximately 11 million tonnes annually. Nussupov underscored that achieving this projected growth, with Kazakhstan contributing the largest share primarily through exports, is entirely dependent on significant infrastructure development and investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have made a significant breakthrough by identifying the "master sex-determining gene" in central bearded dragons. This discovery is particularly noteworthy because, unlike mammals and birds where sex is solely genetically determined, the sex of these Australian lizards, much like turtles and crocodiles, is also influenced by incubation temperature. Specifically, male embryos can develop into females if incubated at temperatures of 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher. The research, published in the peer-reviewed journal GigaScience, involved sequencing longer DNA fragments to construct a nearly complete genome of the lizard, offering crucial insights into the complex environmental and genetic factors governing sex determination in this species.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump garnered significant international praise for his administration's pivotal role in brokering the first phase of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. World leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres, issued statements commending the agreement and Trump's diplomatic efforts. The deal outlines a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of remaining hostages by Hamas, alongside an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Israeli President Isaac Herzog went as far as suggesting Trump merits the Nobel Peace Prize for his "incredible leadership" in achieving this "historic and unprecedented" step toward Middle East peace.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has reported a better-than-expected profit forecast for the close of 2025, attributed to increasing airfares and sustained strong demand within the luxury travel segment. The airline projected adjusted earnings between $1.60 and $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter, surpassing analyst estimates. CEO Ed Bastian indicated an improvement in demand and a decrease in the surplus of flights, which had previously contributed to lower domestic fares earlier in the year. Revenue from premium travel, encompassing first class and spacious economy seating, surged by 9% in the third quarter. Delta also reaffirmed its full-year earnings per share forecast, signaling a robust financial outlook for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

Although net income saw an 11% decrease, adjusted earnings per share still surpassed analyst forecasts.

          <p>Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai has been honored with this year's Nobel Prize in Literature, recognized "for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art." The author, known for his postmodern explorations of existential and apocalyptic themes, expressed a mix of happiness and nervousness upon learning of the prestigious award. His acclaimed works include "Satantango," which was famously adapted into a seven-hour black-and-white film by Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr, and "The Melancholy of Resistance." The Swedish Academy lauded Krasznahorkai as "a great epic writer in the Central European tradition," noting his style is characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess, with the author himself describing his writing as "reality examined to the point of madness."</p>
