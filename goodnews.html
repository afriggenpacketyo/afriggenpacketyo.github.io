          <p>Approximately 60,000 runners participated in the 44th Great North Run, one of the world's largest half marathons, which follows a 13.1-mile route from Newcastle to South Shields. The event drew large crowds of over 200,000 supporters, along with celebrity participants like Joe Wicks and Tommy Fury. Event founder Sir Brendan Foster noted the run's growing popularity, particularly among younger people and women, with female participation reaching 49% last year.

          <p>In observance of National Grandparents Day, NPR collected advice from over 100 grandparents on embracing this new stage of life. Key suggestions include not interfering with their children's parenting styles, being present throughout the pregnancy, and embracing the role of a supporting player rather than a primary decision-maker. Many respondents described the love for a grandchild as a unique and profound joy, offering a "second chance" at the love of a newborn without the daily stresses of parenthood. Practical tips, such as keeping backup supplies at their home, were also shared to help ease the burden on new parents.</p>

          <p>With gold prices reaching new records and gaining over 35% this year, investors are increasingly turning to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Experts suggest that for most individuals, the most efficient way to gain exposure is through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), rather than owning physical bullion. This approach offers better liquidity, lower costs, and tax efficiency compared to storing physical bars or coins. Financial advisors generally recommend limiting gold allocation to a small portion of a diversified portfolio, typically under 3%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are set to face each other in the US Open men's final, marking the third straight Grand Slam final between the two emerging rivals. Their rivalry, dubbed 'Sin-caraz,' has been identified as the future of men's tennis, and this match will decide the year-end world number one ranking. Sinner, the current number one, has been dominant this season but faces questions about his fitness, while Alcaraz has demonstrated growing maturity. This final marks the first time in the Open era that the same two men have contested three Grand Slam finals in a single season.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has invalidated the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly overrode the will of the voters. In 2018, Utah citizens approved a proposition to create an independent redistricting commission, but lawmakers later gutted it and drew a map that heavily favored the GOP by dividing Salt Lake County. The ruling, which orders a new map to be drawn, is seen as a significant victory for anti-gerrymandering advocates. The decision pushes back against a trend of legislatures ignoring voter-led initiatives and has been met with predictable outrage from some Republican figures.</p>

          <p>The company Pray.com is using artificial intelligence to create cinematic video depictions of biblical stories, which have gained millions of views on social media, particularly among younger audiences. The videos, which style epic events like the Book of Revelation with a fantasy or action-movie aesthetic, are popular with viewers who find them engaging. However, some theologians and scholars are critical, arguing that this "edutainment" approach reduces the Bible to mere entertainment and strips the sacred texts of their transformative power. The company defends its work, stating it is a new way to bring the stories to life for a modern audience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to occur, offering a spectacular sight for observers across much of the United Kingdom. During the event, the full Moon will pass through the Earth's shadow, taking on a deep reddish color, a phenomenon often called a "Blood Moon." The visibility of the full eclipse in the UK will be limited by the timing of the moonrise, with eastern parts of the country getting the best and longest view. Astronomers advise finding a clear view of the horizon to witness the event, which is caused by the scattering of light through Earth's atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at age 15, has been canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his love of technology and video games, Acutis used his skills to create websites that documented miracles to spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His canonization was fast-tracked, a move seen by some as an effort by the Vatican to inspire faith in younger generations. His preserved body lies in Assisi, Italy, which has become a major pilgrimage site.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber who was on the FBI's most wanted list for 21 years, is facing an extradition hearing in London. He is accused of planting two bombs in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, with an animal rights extremist group claiming responsibility. After a high-speed chase, he vanished, abandoning a car that former FBI agents described as a "bomb-making lab." San Diego was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales last year, and U.S. authorities are now seeking his return to face trial.</p>
