          <p>A brain-dead Georgia woman, Adriana Smith, was kept on life support to continue her pregnancy and had her baby delivered via emergency cesarean section. The baby, named Chance, is in the neonatal intensive care unit and is expected to be okay. Smith was diagnosed with blood clots in her brain and declared brain dead in February. Her case sparked controversy after doctors stated that Georgia's abortion ban required her to be kept on life support, though the state's attorney general's office disputed this interpretation.

          <p>The Senate's tax bill proposes a $1,000 baby bonus for children born between 2024 and 2028, deposited into 'Trump accounts'. These accounts, similar to 529 college savings plans, offer tax-deferred growth and qualified withdrawals taxed as long-term capital gains. To be eligible, children must be U.S. citizens at birth, and both parents must have Social Security numbers. The government will deposit the initial seed money if parents do not open an account themselves, though parents may also opt out. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses several medical debt relief options, including negotiating with the provider, applying for hospital financial assistance, using a medical bill advocate, enrolling in debt consolidation or debt management programs, and considering debt settlement. Negotiating directly with the provider may lead to settling the debt for less or setting up a payment plan. Hospital financial assistance or charity care may reduce or eliminate the debt for low-income patients. Debt settlement can hurt your credit score and any forgiven debt may be considered taxable income. (not investment advice)</p>
