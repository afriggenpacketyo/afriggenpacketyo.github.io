          <h2>Scientific Study Finds Corn Plants Communicate to Adapt to Their Environment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that corn plants can communicate with each other by releasing a gas called linalool. This chemical signal prompts neighboring plants to alter their soil composition, which can affect both growth and defense against herbivores. The research, conducted in maize fields in China, observed that plants in the inner rows of dense fields suffered less pest damage but also exhibited reduced growth. This finding offers new insights into plant interactions and suggests that optimizing this communication mechanism could potentially be used to enhance pest resistance and improve crop yields in agriculture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of couples are choosing to include their dogs in their wedding ceremonies, treating them as integral members of the family. Dogs are taking on roles such as ring bearers, flower girls, and greeters, reflecting a cultural shift where pets are seen as best friends and sources of emotional support. This trend has led to the rise of specialized 'dog chaperone' services that manage the pets on the wedding day, ensuring they are cared for and prepared for their roles. For many couples, having their dog present is a non-negotiable part of their celebration, making the event more personal and joyous.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to court documents, Elon Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to participate in a $97.4 billion bid by his company xAI to acquire OpenAI in early 2025. The proposal was part of Musk's effort to prevent OpenAI, which he co-founded as a non-profit, from transitioning into a for-profit entity. The filing, part of an ongoing legal battle between Musk and OpenAI, states that Zuckerberg and Meta were approached with a letter of intent but ultimately did not join the financing consortium. This revelation highlights the intense strategic maneuvering and rivalries among major tech leaders as they compete for dominance in the artificial intelligence sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk and his social media company, X, have reached a settlement in principle with former employees who sued for $500 million in unpaid severance. The lawsuit was filed after Musk laid off approximately 6,000 workers, more than half the company's workforce, following his takeover in 2022. The plaintiffs argued they were denied promised severance packages, with some receiving only one month's pay or nothing at all. While the specific terms of the agreement have not been disclosed and require court approval, the deal marks a step toward resolving one of the major legal challenges stemming from the mass terminations.</p>

          <p>Julian Her, a 13-year-old from Northern California, caught a massive 63.7-pound white sea bass during a family fishing trip in Tomales Bay. The impressive catch is now being documented for submission to the International Game Fish Association to verify it as a new junior world record. The current record, set in 2002, stands at 59 pounds. The eighth-grader, who weighs only slightly more than the fish himself, successfully reeled in the giant bass after a significant struggle. The event has made the young angler a local celebrity and created a memorable, once-in-a-lifetime experience for his family.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, slowed to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month. This marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, though the latest figures show a cooling trend, partly due to easing rice prices. The "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy and is closely watched by the central bank, held steady at 3.4%. Despite the slight drop, some economists argue that the Bank of Japan is behind the curve in raising interest rates to combat sustained price pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has ordered the closure of the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility, citing severe and irreparable damage to the Florida Everglades. The ruling, a victory for environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, halts all further construction and mandates that no new detainees be brought to the site. Judge Kathleen Williams's 82-page order gives officials 60 days to wind down operations and remove all materials related to the detention camp. The decision is a significant setback for the Trump administration's immigration agenda, which had promoted the facility as a model for detaining and deporting migrants.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officials have eradicated a large illegal marijuana cultivation site within Sequoia National Park, removing nearly 2,400 plants and 2,000 pounds of trash. The operation was complicated by the presence of hazardous chemicals, including methamidophos, a highly toxic insecticide banned in the U.S. that poses a severe threat to wildlife and water sources. The illegal farm caused significant environmental damage by clearing vegetation, diverting a creek for irrigation, and creating illegal trails. This bust is part of an ongoing effort to combat large-scale drug trafficking operations that have been using the park's remote wilderness for decades.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt content and to cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without scientific backing. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given an 18-month period to comply with the new recommendations, after which the government may consider alternative measures if the industry fails to make sufficient changes to improve product healthiness.</p>

He highlighted the retailer's success in growing its top line, expanding margins, and managing the impact of tariffs while attracting shoppers with low prices.

          <p>In an effort to reverse six consecutive years of declining sales, Jeep has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Cherokee SUV. The new model, which was discontinued in 2023, marks the debut of Stellantis's first hybrid powertrain in North America, a 1.6-liter turbo-four system. The updated Cherokee is larger than its predecessor, offering 30% more cargo space and a modern, technology-focused interior. With a starting price of nearly $37,000, Stellantis hopes the iconic nameplate and new hybrid technology will help the brand reclaim its market share in the competitive midsize SUV segment amid broader company headwinds.</p>
