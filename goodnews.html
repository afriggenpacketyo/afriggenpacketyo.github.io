          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have clinched their 13th consecutive playoff berth after a 6-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants. The win was particularly significant as it occurred during the final regular-season home game for legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who recently announced his retirement. This achievement ties the Dodgers with the New York Yankees for the second-longest playoff streak in MLB history. While Kershaw had a no-decision, the team celebrated the accomplishment as they continue to pursue the National League West division title.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in an exceptionally turbulent qualifying session marked by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, was repeatedly interrupted by crashes, including those involving championship contenders Oscar Piastri and Charles Leclerc in the final part of qualifying. Verstappen managed to set the fastest time in the final moments after the last restart, positioning himself ahead of Williams' Carlos Sainz and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson. The chaotic conditions led to a mixed-up grid, with other top drivers like Lewis Hamilton starting further down the order.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene caused widespread devastation in the Appalachian Mountains, North Carolina resident John Saunby is building his dream home from the storm's rubble. Instead of letting the debris from his and other demolished properties go to a landfill, he has salvaged materials like porch posts and kitchen floorboards to construct a unique house. Saunby, a home builder, is using the project to realize a creative vision that includes Black Locust bark siding and tree trunk supports. The effort represents a story of resilience and resourcefulness in the face of natural disaster.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has secured a place in their seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two tries upon her return from a concussion. Despite a strong challenge from France, who trailed by only two points at halftime, England's dominance, particularly with their driving maul, proved decisive in the second half. The Red Roses will now face Canada in the final at a sold-out Twickenham's Allianz Stadium next week.</p>

Her employer secured her a one-bedroom apartment with a balcony for just 35,000 yen, or about $238 per month. Living in the countryside offers a different experience from Tokyo, with lower costs and a more traditional culture surrounded by rice fields. Smith is documenting her journey on social media to showcase a more typical, non-metropolitan experience of living abroad for other Americans considering a similar move.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime, to clear the country's significant asylum application backlog. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart stated this would allow for the rapid setup of temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and a doubling of asylum caseworkers. The party argues this decisive action is necessary to end the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers and to create a more efficient and humane system. The proposal is a key focus of the party's annual conference.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released and have returned to the UK after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for decades, were reunited with their daughter in Qatar following negotiations brokered by the Qatari government. The Taliban stated the pair had broken Afghan laws but never publicly disclosed the reason for their detention. Their family expressed immense relief, having previously raised concerns about the couple's deteriorating health in captivity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used its newly acquired "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, and laying off nearly 800 workers. The government gained veto power over such strategic decisions as a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned against the closure, the company reversed its decision and announced the facility would remain operational. This marks the first time the administration has exercised these powers, highlighting its increasing influence in private sector operations.</p>

She explained that a pivotal moment was learning about the suicide of Tyler Clementi, which inspired her to use her experience to help others who have been publicly shamed. Lewinsky emphasized the importance of reintroducing herself to the public in her own words and credited younger generations for re-evaluating her story with a new perspective on power dynamics. She now focuses on helping other women reclaim their own stories and insists on the possibility of creating a different ending.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked cautious optimism for more stable bilateral relations. Both leaders described the conversation as productive and constructive, covering topics from trade to the control of TikTok. Following the call, Trump announced plans for the two leaders to meet at the upcoming APEC summit and for him to visit China early next year. Despite the positive tone, analysts warn that significant points of friction, including Taiwan and potential U.S. tariffs, remain unresolved and could challenge the momentum.</p>

          <p>The United States military appears to have shifted its policy regarding public announcements of its warships transiting the Taiwan Strait. Under the previous administration, these freedom-of-navigation operations were regularly publicized as a message to Beijing, but there have been only three known, unannounced transits since President Trump returned to office. While Beijing has long criticized the "public hype" of these operations, some Chinese observers view the change as a tactical shift rather than a substantive change in U.S. policy. The U.S. has still confirmed the transits when questioned by the media.</p>

For many, the lower tuition fees overseas present a compelling alternative to accumulating significant student debt from U.S. institutions.

          <p>A leading dermatologist is reminding people that significant exposure to harmful UV rays can occur even when indoors. While windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin and are associated with accelerated aging and skin cancer. This "silent" exposure can happen without any visible burning sensation. For comprehensive protection, it is recommended to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, as this protects against both UVA and UVB radiation, especially when spending extended time near windows.</p>
