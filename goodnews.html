          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales after a final debate on the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill. The bill was backed by 314 votes to 291, marking a majority of 23, and MPs were given a free vote on the issue. The bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, proposes allowing terminally ill people over 18 to end their life under specific conditions, including a life expectancy of fewer than six months and approval from two independent doctors. The bill now proceeds to the House of Lords for further scrutiny as the debate on end-of-life choices continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by linguists at the University of Queensland analyzed nearly two billion words from online sources across 20 English-speaking regions and determined that Americans swear more frequently online than other English-speaking groups. The research, which excluded social media, found that Americans use curse words 0.036% of the time, compared to the British at 0.025%. Researchers suggest that the anonymity of the internet may contribute to Americans' more forgiving attitude toward online vulgarity. The study underscores cultural differences in acceptable language use and provides insights into human behavior and communication styles in online environments.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with a limited number of vehicles debuting on June 22. The initial rides will be in the Model Y and access is by invitation only, within a geofenced area of the city. Elon Musk has touted the driverless robotaxi for years, and analysts believe it could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization. The company plans to expand the service to Los Angeles and San Francisco later, but the success of the Austin launch will be crucial in determining the future of Tesla's autonomous vehicle endeavors.</p>

          <p>Residents of Maghera, County Londonderry, have expressed surprise at the installation of a large yellow box junction, measuring over 40 meters long, in the town center. The markings aim to improve traffic flow on the A29 Tobermore Road, a busy junction used by buses, lorries, and cars. While some locals recognize the need for traffic improvement, many find the size of the box excessive and confusing. One bar owner joked that it could become a tourist attraction, while the Department for Infrastructure has been contacted for comment on the unusual road marking.</p>

The songs delve into post-breakup grief, anger, and ambivalence, capturing the drama of experiencing life as a purely internal, self-directed struggle.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank could consider cutting interest rates as early as July, as he doesn't expect tariffs to significantly boost inflation. Waller stated that he and his colleagues should move slowly but start to ease monetary policy, given that inflation is not posing a major economic threat. His comments come after the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep interest rates steady, with expectations for two or three rate reductions this year. Waller's view contrasts with some officials who are waiting to assess the longer-term impact of tariffs on inflation and the labor market (not investment advice).</p>
