          <p>Japanese markets saw a notable surge, with the Nikkei 225 climbing 1.5%, following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement. Investors are now keenly observing potential successors, especially Takaichi Sanae, who is viewed as a growth driver due to her advocacy for deregulation and opposition to interest rate increases. Despite this market optimism, the Japanese yen weakened and government bonds continued their sell-off, reflecting concerns over persistent inflation, tighter monetary policy, and fiscal uncertainty, with some analysts forecasting prolonged instability into late 2025. This article also contextualizes Japan's situation within broader Asia-Pacific market movements and global economic indicators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative China-U.S. study, utilizing seismic data from NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has revealed the unexpected presence of a solid inner core within Mars, measuring approximately 600 kilometers in radius. This discovery challenges prior scientific assumptions about the planet's internal structure, as Mars was not expected to have cooled sufficiently to form such a core. The article notes that this proportion is similar to Earth's inner core, which forms as liquid metal solidifies under immense pressure and low temperatures. This finding could potentially reignite discussions regarding whether Earth was unique in its development of plate tectonics.</p>
