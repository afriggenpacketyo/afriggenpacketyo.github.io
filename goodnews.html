The case involved a Minnesota school district that allegedly failed to provide adequate accommodations for the girl's learning needs. Lower courts had previously ruled against the family, requiring them to demonstrate "bad faith or gross misjudgment" by school officials. The Supreme Court's ruling lowers this legal standard, potentially impacting future disability discrimination claims against schools.</p>

          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are common investment vehicles that offer diversified exposure to stocks or bonds, with both actively and passively managed options.

Investors should review a fund's prospectus to understand its objectives, risks, fees, and performance history before investing. ETFs generally have lower expense ratios and no minimum investment thresholds, making them an accessible option for beginners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Americans navigate retirement amid economic uncertainty, annuities are gaining traction for their predictable income streams. A $100,000 annuity purchased at age 70 could yield approximately $729 per month for men, $689 for women, or $620 for a joint life policy, based on current data. Monthly payouts are influenced by gender, annuity type, interest rates, optional features, and age. Annuities are suitable for those valuing guaranteed income, good health, and simplified financial management, but they lack liquidity and may have opportunity costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Cyrus's album is described as overly sophisticated and laden with signifiers of quality, undermining the point of the genre, while Rae's album is praised for its simplicity, experimentation, and focus on craftsmanship. The article suggests that pop stars are increasingly taken seriously, with emerging icons positioning themselves as complex auteurs, but Rae is throwing back to a time when pop didn't insist on its own importance.</p>
