          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into ticket sales for Oasis's reunion tour, Ticketmaster has agreed to provide fans with more transparent pricing information. The company will now announce 24 hours in advance if tiered pricing is used and offer more details about ticket costs during online queues. The CMA had raised concerns that Ticketmaster may have misled fans with unclear pricing, though it found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing." These changes aim to ensure consumers are not given the false impression that certain tickets are superior without added benefits.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 05:08:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The historical term "lavender marriage," once used to describe marriages of convenience for queer individuals to maintain a heteronormative public image, has been reinterpreted by Gen Z on TikTok. The modern trend involves young people seeking platonic partners to share financial burdens like mortgages and taxes, prioritizing stability and companionship over romance. While some critics argue this new usage trivializes the historical oppression faced by the LGBTQ+ community, the trend also reflects shifting societal views on relationships. It highlights a growing interest in decoupling marriage from romantic love in favor of practical, mutually beneficial legal partnerships.</p>

          <p>Amid rising pedestrian and cyclist fatalities in the U.S., transportation safety experts are emphasizing the importance of "defensive walking and cycling." Key recommendations include being highly visible and predictable, using designated crossings and bike paths, and avoiding distractions like headphones or phones. Experts also stress the importance of looking in all directions before crossing, as turning vehicles can pose a significant hazard. While drivers bear responsibility, the article suggests that pedestrians and cyclists can enhance their own safety by maintaining constant awareness and not assuming they have been seen by motorists.</p>

          <p>China's top envoy to India has stated that the long-standing boundary dispute between the two nations should not be the defining aspect of their overall relationship. Speaking at an event, the envoy emphasized the need for a long-term strategic vision and resolving differences through dialogue to avoid hindering broader cooperation. He called for strengthening multilateral ties and friendly exchanges as both countries navigate complex trade negotiations with the United States. The comments suggest a desire from Beijing to compartmentalize the border issue and focus on other areas of mutual interest.</p>

          <h2>Mallorca Experiences Record Tourism Numbers Despite Growing Local Protests</h2>

          <p>The Spanish island of Mallorca is on track for a record number of tourists this year, even as local opposition to mass tourism intensifies. Despite large protests and concerns about overburdened infrastructure, the number of visitors to the Balearic Islands is projected to exceed 19 million in 2025. Ironically, many local businesses report that their sales are down, partly attributing this to a significant drop in the number of German tourists. While some believe the protests have deterred visitors, others point to economic factors in Germany and rising prices on the island as more likely causes.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered beside a road in Barcelona, Spain, over 20 years ago has finally been identified as Liudmila Zavada, a 31-year-old Russian citizen. The breakthrough came through "Operation Identify Me," an Interpol-led campaign that publicly shares information about unidentified bodies to generate new leads. Turkish police matched the woman's fingerprints to their national database, leading to the identification, which was then confirmed by a DNA match with a relative in Russia. Spanish police are continuing their investigation into the suspicious circumstances surrounding her death.</p>

          <p>Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche has announced its ambition to become one of the top three global players in the lucrative obesity drug market. The company is advancing its experimental weight-loss injection, CT-388, to a phase III trial, the final stage before seeking regulatory approval. This move signals a serious challenge to current market leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Roche has been rapidly building its obesity treatment pipeline, including partnerships and acquisitions, with a goal of launching a suite of treatments by 2030 to compete in the fast-growing sector.</p>

          <p>State-affiliated buyers in China, collectively known as the "national team," held approximately $553 billion in domestic stocks as of June, reinforcing a recent bull run. This holding surpasses that of foreign investors and makes the state the second-largest holder after mutual funds, accounting for 4.8% of the publicly traded market capitalization. This intervention, which functions like an unofficial stabilization fund, aligns with leaders' goals of promoting financial stability and presenting the stock market as a reliable store of wealth amid a property downturn.

          <p>China is committed to expanding the global presence of its home-grown BeiDou navigation system, a rival to the U.S.-owned GPS. At a recent summit, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang stated that after 31 years of development, the system has entered a new phase of global expansion with improved service performance. Having already captured over 70% of the domestic market share in consumer devices like smartphones and wearables, Beijing is now focused on enlarging its "circle of international friends."
