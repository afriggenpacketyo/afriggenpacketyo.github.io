          <p>Negotiators from the United States and China have reached an agreement to de-escalate trade tensions that have risen in recent weeks.

This agreement follows a period of increased tension and reciprocal accusations regarding violations of the Geneva trade agreement, aiming to stabilize the relationship and foster a more cooperative trade environment. The deal seeks to address key issues such as Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports and U.S. restrictions on advanced tech sales.</p>
