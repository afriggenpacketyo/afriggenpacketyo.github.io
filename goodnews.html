        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Acclaimed opera tenor Rodell Rosel, a fixture in Chicago's music scene for two decades, believes opera is a universal art form that connects people through powerful emotion, even across language barriers. In an interview, he explained how the music allows audiences to feel the drama and that success in the art form, and in life, comes from embracing one's full identity. Rosel, who openly identifies as a gay man, also spoke about the importance of community and finding safe spaces, such as the group "Asians and Friends." He views his craft as a continuous learning process, akin to medicine or law, requiring constant work and dedication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has designed and built an innovative printer capable of adding braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a machine to handle materials that commercial braille printers could not. The students' invention features open hardware, allowing BISM's low-vision employees to operate it easily by touch. The device has already been used to print 400 labels for "Blind Spot," a beer from Checkerspot Brewing Company, for an annual fundraiser supporting people with vision loss.</p>

          <p>Doris Garcia, a 96-year-old woman from Colorado, has fulfilled a lifelong dream of meeting penguins, 70 years after she was denied the opportunity to see them in their natural habitat. In the 1950s, while working for the U.S. government in Argentina, she was invited on a research trip to Antarctica but was barred from going at the last minute simply because she was a woman. Her story moved Compassionate Hospice and the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance to arrange a special behind-the-scenes encounter with African penguins at the zoo. The event provided a joyful and long-awaited moment for Garcia and her family.</p>

          <p>Effective apologies from leaders require taking full responsibility, showing genuine empathy, and outlining a clear plan for corrective action, according to communication experts. The timing of an apology is crucial; waiting too long can suggest a lack of care, while speaking too quickly without a plan can erode credibility. Experts advise leaders to sound human and vulnerable without making the situation about themselves, as a scripted or emotionless delivery can appear disingenuous. Ultimately, whether for a major public crisis or an internal misstep, a successful apology builds trust by demonstrating that the leader cares and is competent to fix the problem.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn a return that can outpace rising costs. Current top CD rates significantly exceed national averages, with online banks often providing the most competitive yields due to lower overhead costs. Short-term CDs, particularly those with terms of six months to one year, are presently offering higher rates than longer-term options, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. To secure the best rates, experts advise comparing offers from various institutions, especially online banks, and considering a CD laddering strategy to balance high yields with long-term savings goals.

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, the current interest rate environment presents challenges, though securing an affordable loan remains possible. As of early July 2025, average rates for a 30-year mortgage are hovering just under 7%, while 15-year loans are slightly lower. Experts suggest that borrowers with strong credit scores are best positioned to qualify for favorable rates. To improve their chances, applicants should focus on strengthening their credit profile, paying bills on time, and shopping around to compare offers from multiple lenders, as rates and terms can vary significantly between institutions.

          <p>Gold remains a popular safe-haven asset for investors, particularly during periods of economic and market uncertainty. As of early July 2025, the price of gold stood at approximately $3,359 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant fluctuation. The value of the precious metal is influenced by a range of factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation, and interest rates. Geopolitical instability and currency movements, especially the strength of the U.S. dollar, also play a significant role in determining its price, making it a complex but historically resilient investment.

          <p>The UK government is planning to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents the legal right to bereavement leave following a miscarriage at any point before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only legally mandated for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve without having to return to work before they are ready. The proposed right would provide for at least one week of unpaid leave, with further details to be determined after a consultation. Campaigners have hailed the move as a major step forward in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement.</p>

The Dodgers, seeking to install a similar design in their clubhouse walkway, tracked Bennett down for her blessing and advice.
