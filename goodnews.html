The facility will breed millions of sterile screwworm flies to be released into the wild, preventing fertile flies from laying eggs. The flies have been detected as close as 700 miles from the U.S. border, prompting concerns among agriculture and cattle industry officials. The plan also involves converting a fruit fly breeding facility in Mexico into one for breeding sterile screwworm flies.
