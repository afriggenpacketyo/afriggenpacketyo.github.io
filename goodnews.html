          <p>Eric 'Butterbean' Esch, a 58-year-old former boxing champion, has announced he is returning for one more fight and has publicly challenged Jake Paul. In a commercial, Esch, who has overcome significant health issues that once left him in a wheelchair, criticized Paul for fighting retired opponents and stated he wants the match because Paul "runs his damn mouth too much." The challenge comes as Paul continues to build his boxing career, recently securing a unanimous decision victory over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. This unusual call-out adds another unique chapter to Paul's unconventional journey in the sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analytical article explores the historical and technical complexities of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), using the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as a contemporary example. It argues that preliminary assessments, like a leaked DIA memo suggesting minimal damage, are often unreliable and that a full picture takes considerable time to develop. The author posits that given the advanced U.S. platforms, precision munitions, and extensive intelligence on the targets, the damage was likely severe and has significantly set back Iran's program. The piece suggests that President Trump's declaration of "obliteration" is likely closer to the truth than the hasty critiques suggest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has secured a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a U.S. ban due to national security concerns. In a Fox News interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform, with more details to be revealed soon. The sale would require approval from the Chinese government, but Trump expressed optimism that President Xi Jinping would consent. This development comes after Trump repeatedly used executive actions to delay the enforcement of a law mandating the sale of TikTok by its parent company, ByteDance.</p>

          <p>YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul earned a unanimous decision victory against former middleweight champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. in a significant bout for his career.

Although Ch√°vez showed more aggression in the later rounds, it was insufficient to overcome Paul's early dominance. The win over a former world champion marks a key step in Paul's effort to establish himself as a legitimate fighter beyond his social media fame, as he continues to pursue more credible opponents.</p>

          <p>With a heatwave affecting many regions, animal welfare experts are urging dog owners to take special precautions to prevent their pets from overheating. The RSPCA warns that dogs are highly susceptible to heat-related illness from exercise, as they cannot regulate their body temperature effectively. Key advice includes avoiding walks during the hottest parts of the day, checking pavement temperature with the back of one's hand, and always providing cool water. Signs of heatstroke include heavy panting and lethargy, and if they appear, owners should cool the dog with water immediately and seek veterinary care.</p>
