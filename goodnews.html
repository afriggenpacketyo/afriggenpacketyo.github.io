          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains on Thursday, mirroring an overnight tech-driven rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, despite underlying economic anxieties. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 both rose, with Australian household spending showing strong growth. Global bond markets remain under pressure, as the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield surpassed 5% following a court ruling on Trump-era tariffs. The tech sector's performance was notably strong after a favorable Alphabet antitrust decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has initiated a 14-day aviation management workshop in Beijing for representatives from eight Southeast Asian nations, aiming to promote its domestically produced civilian aircraft, including the C919. This initiative seeks to capitalize on Southeast Asia's leading role in accepting Chinese aircraft deliveries, despite the global dominance of Airbus and Boeing. Experts view this as a strategic move to "break the duopoly" of Western manufacturers and deepen economic cooperation within the region. The training covers critical areas like safety management, airworthiness certification, and new technologies.</p>

The influential political figure is seen as a key recruit for Republicans, especially with Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen not seeking re-election in 2026. Sununu expressed his intention to appeal broadly across the political spectrum, including to President Trump's supporters. If he runs, he would face a GOP primary against Scott Brown and State Senator Dan Innis.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have successfully recovered "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century Italian painting by Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before his escape and subsequent death in 1940. The painting was discovered in an online real estate listing in Mar del Plata, belonging to the daughter of a Nazi lawyer who escaped to Argentina. Two individuals have been placed under house arrest, facing charges of concealment and obstruction of justice.</p>

Despite a 1% sales slip in the May-July period, executives now forecast low single-digit sales growth, attributing the positive shift to stronger product offerings and successful marketing. Sweeney's "Great Jeans" ad, which sparked viral debate and drew 40 billion impressions, notably led to her signature jeans selling out. The company also noted tariffs are expected to add costs, though these have been halved through negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration illegally froze $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, calling it an "ideologically-motivated assault." Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with Harvard's argument that the freeze was retaliatory, violating First Amendment protections after the university refused demands to alter diversity programs and screen international students for ideological biases. The ruling vacates the freezing orders, affirming Harvard's academic freedom and the importance of critical scientific research affected by the freeze.

Tencent recently open-sourced its Youtu-Agent framework, achieving a high score on a web traversal benchmark. This follows ByteDance's open-sourcing of its Coze Studio and Alibaba's Qwen-Agent earlier in the year. These developments position Chinese firms to compete with US players like AutoGen and OpenAI Swarm, enabling AI agents to autonomously perform complex tasks by planning and executing subtasks.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling there was "no invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had used this obscure wartime law to remove hundreds of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, some sent to a supermax prison in El Salvador. The court rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" constituted an invasion, stating it was not an "armed, organized force." This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy, with the ACLU hailing it as a win against executive overreach.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is urging UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider implementing various wealth taxes in the upcoming November Budget to increase investment in public services. General Secretary Paul Nowak suggested options such as taxes on online gaming and gambling companies, windfall profits from banks, and equalizing capital gains tax with income tax, or even a direct wealth tax. While the Treasury noted existing taxes on the wealthy, Nowak argued that banks have seen record profits and should pay their fair share. This push reflects a broader debate within the Labour movement on how to fund public services without breaching fiscal rules. (not investment advice)</p>

The DOJ, under the Trump administration, had sued the state to deny ballots to voters who hadn't provided specific identification details during registration. The new consent order allows these voters to provide the required information when casting a provisional ballot at the polling place, resolving the issue. This victory is seen as a pushback against the Trump DOJ's shift away from expanding voting rights, which had refocused on preventing voter fraud.</p>
