          <p>Twenty individuals, including eight adults and twelve juveniles, sustained injuries from a lightning strike while swimming at Dominion Beach Park near Lake Murray Dam in Lexington County, South Carolina. The incident occurred on a bright and sunny Tuesday afternoon when lightning struck a metal cable with buoys surrounding the swimming area. Eighteen people were treated on the scene, and twelve were transported to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, and officials expect all patients to recover. This event occurred during Lightning Safety Awareness Week, highlighting the dangers of lightning strikes, which have caused four reported deaths in the U.S. this year. The fire district noted that lightning can strike far from a cloud, and those present were fortunate the injuries were not worse. Dominion Beach Park is expected to reopen after safety assessments are completed.</p>

Lovullo expressed his support for Marte, emphasizing that he is not alone and that the heckler was "an idiot." Shortstop Geraldo Perdomo condemned the fan's behavior and called for Major League Baseball to take action.

          <p>The United States, after decades of mass incarceration, is seeing a significant decline in its prison population, potentially dropping by roughly 60 percent from its 2009 peak. This shift is attributed to the decline in crime rates since the 1990s, particularly among younger generations, leading to fewer young offenders entering the prison system. While COVID-19 initially accelerated decarceration, a subsequent crime spike threatened to reverse this trend, but crime has since fallen again. Policy recommendations include halting prison construction, supporting prison-closing commissions, and prioritizing compassionate release for elderly and sick inmates.</p>

This phase involves installing connectors to link the structure with the Santa Susana Mountains to the north and the Santa Monica Mountains to the south. The work will require burying overhead wires, moving water lines, stabilizing an underground creek, and constructing a tunnel over Agoura Road, while also preserving a grove of native oak trees. Partial closures of Agoura Road are expected to begin in early August and last for several months, with the project's completion date pushed to the end of 2026 due to weather delays.</p>

          <p>Constellation Energy announced that the former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania may restart in 2027, approximately a year ahead of schedule. The plant is being renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. The plant was shut down in 2019 for economic reasons. The reactor re-entering service was not part of the 1979 accident, but Constellation struck a deal last September to power Microsoft data centers, paving the way to reopen Three Mile Island.</p>

          <p>Republic, a New York-based investment startup, plans to offer users the opportunity to invest in private companies like SpaceX through tokenized shares on a blockchain network. The company will begin selling digital tokens representing shares of SpaceX this week and plans to expand the offering to other private companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Stripe. This move aims to provide retail investors access to pre-IPO businesses with investments ranging from $50 to $5,000.

          <p>Bumble, the dating app company, announced plans to lay off approximately 30% of its workforce, which equates to about 240 roles, as part of a strategic restructuring effort. The company aims to return to a "start-up mentality" in order to revitalize growth, as its stock has declined since its public debut in 2021. Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, who returned as CEO earlier this year, emphasized the need for decisive action to build a resilient and intentional company. The layoffs are expected to result in $13 million to $18 million in non-recurring charges, while generating annual cost savings of up to $40 million, which will be reinvested into product and technology development.</p>
