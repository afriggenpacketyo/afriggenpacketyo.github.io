          <p>Maiwand Banayee, a 45-year-old former Taliban fighter, has shared his personal story of deradicalization, hoping to prevent other teenagers from falling into extremism. Lured by promises of glory and an afterlife in the 1990s, Banayee, then 14, was radicalized in a Pakistani refugee camp amidst intense religious propaganda. He joined the Taliban in Afghanistan, enforcing their laws and promoting propaganda, but eventually questioned their cruelty. Now living in the UK and working with the NHS, he has written a book, "Delusions of Paradise," to warn about the dangers of radicalization, especially with the rise of religious schools in Afghanistan.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Overcoming Seasonal Mood Changes and "Autumn Blues"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 22:19:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many individuals experience seasonal mood shifts, often referred to as "autumn blues," characterized by tiredness, lethargy, and isolation. Counsellors explain that reduced sun exposure leads to less serotonin and more melatonin, affecting mood and sleep. Strategies to combat this include actively planning social engagements, avoiding excessive remote work, and maximizing natural light exposure at home. Additionally, light therapy, maintaining consistent sleep schedules with sunrise alarm clocks, and embracing the "cosy" aspects of the colder months through activities like hot baths and scented candles are recommended to improve wellbeing during these seasons.</p>

          <p>A detailed timeline reveals the monthslong, complex negotiations that led to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and the first phase of President Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza.

          <p>The hit BBC show "The Traitors," including its celebrity edition, captivates audiences by exploring themes of lying and deception, which psychologists suggest are deeply embedded in human nature. Professor Richard Wiseman notes that the show mirrors everyday life, where individuals constantly try to discern honesty from deceit, and that deception can paradoxically hold society together while also being exploitative. The article discusses how the show's format exposes the "illusion of co-operation" and how quickly loyalty can collapse under pressure. This analysis highlights the psychological intrigue and social experiment aspects that make the program so compelling to viewers.</p>
