          <p>In an interview, Representative French Hill advocated for the seizure and conversion of frozen Russian central bank assets to benefit Ukraine, building on the REPO Act. He also addressed the independence of the Federal Reserve, stating that while criticism of its policies is normal, he does not believe the president has the authority to fire the Fed Chair. Hill promoted upcoming House legislation aimed at creating clear regulations for digital assets, arguing it will protect consumers and establish the U.S. as a leader in financial technology innovation. He asserted that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are legitimate assets that can be considered for mortgage applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier secured his second victory of the 2025 Tour de France, winning stage nine in a bunch sprint to Chateauroux. The stage was animated by a long-distance breakaway from Mathieu van der Poel, who was caught just one kilometer from the finish line after a valiant effort. Van der Poel's attack was a tribute to a teammate's dream of reaching the Tour podium. Despite the dramatic stage finish, there were no significant changes in the general classification, with Tadej Pogacar retaining the yellow jersey.</p>

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal discussed a new bipartisan sanctions package designed to pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine. The proposed legislation would grant the president authority to impose tariffs up to 500% on countries that support Russia's war economy, specifically naming China, India, and Brazil as key targets. The senators emphasized strong European and NATO unity on the issue and also advocated for using seized Russian assets to help fund Ukraine's defense. They indicated that a major shift in U.S. policy, including increased weapons flow to Ukraine, is imminent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>James Gunn's 'Superman' has provided a significant boost to Warner Bros.' DC Studios, debuting with an estimated $122 million in North America and $217 million globally. The strong opening marks a successful launch for the studio's planned universe reboot, although some analysts noted a slightly softer-than-expected international performance. The film, which cost around $225 million to produce, overcame some right-wing criticism to earn positive reviews from both critics and audiences. This success is seen as crucial for DC after a series of commercially underperforming superhero films in recent years.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:32:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following negotiations with the global players' union, Fifpro, FIFA has agreed to introduce mandatory rest periods to combat player burnout and injury. The consensus includes a minimum 72-hour gap between matches and a three-week break at the end of each season. This agreement is a significant step for player welfare advocates, who had raised concerns and filed a lawsuit over the expanding fixture calendar, particularly with the launch of the new 32-team Club World Cup. While a victory for players, FIFA's statement also reiterated its commitment to creating more global competitions.</p>

          <p>This article provides financial guidance for a young adult who has received a significant financial windfall while also carrying a high-interest car loan. It weighs the pros and cons of paying off the $27,000 auto loan versus investing the money in the stock market. The piece suggests that paying off the 8% loan offers a guaranteed, risk-free return, which is a strong option. It also explores alternatives, such as investing a portion of the funds for potentially higher long-term growth and using the money to build an emergency fund or contribute to retirement accounts.

          <p>A recent scientific study is renewing the ongoing debate within the medical community about the experience of discontinuing antidepressant medications. The research has sparked fresh discussion regarding how common withdrawal symptoms are for patients who stop taking these drugs. It also re-examines the potential severity of these symptoms, a topic that has long been a point of contention among doctors, researchers, and patients. The findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of antidepressant treatment and its cessation, impacting both clinical practice and patient counseling.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump, the U.S. Secret Service is bolstering its protective measures with new technology, including military-grade drones and mobile command posts. These upgrades are a direct response to failures identified during the Butler, Pennsylvania rally, where the shooter operated a drone undetected and communication between agencies was fragmented. The new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, will allow for direct radio communication with local law enforcement. A Secret Service deputy director expressed confidence that these changes will prevent a repeat of the security lapses.</p>

          <p>Experts are actively refuting widespread and baseless claims, amplified by some politicians, that the recent deadly floods in Texas were caused by cloud seeding. Cloud seeding is a weather modification technique used to increase precipitation, but scientists state it is incapable of generating the massive, sustained rainfall that led to the disaster. This article explains that such conspiracy theories are not only untrue but also actively harmful, as they distract from the real causes of extreme weather, like climate change, and erode public trust in science and government during a crisis.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will soon unveil measures to make electric cars cheaper for consumers to buy. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct subsidies, she guaranteed that the upfront cost would be reduced to encourage the switch from petrol and diesel vehicles. The plan also includes a £25 million package for councils to install 'cross-pavement gullies' for easier home charging and £63 million for broader charging infrastructure. The move aims to boost EV sales, which are currently lagging behind government-mandated targets ahead of the 2030 ban.</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent political economist and adviser to Beijing, has argued that Chinese think tanks must become more 'self-centred' to effectively project the country's soft power. He contends that these organizations should develop an 'indigenous knowledge system' based on China's own practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic frameworks. According to Zheng, this approach would allow them to better explain Chinese policies and governance to the world and more accurately predict the nation's future trajectory. This shift would move them away from university-style analysis toward more practical, empirical policy research.</p>

If confirmed, this would mark a significant advance in China's space capabilities, demonstrating an autonomous satellite servicing feat that the United States has not yet accomplished.

She expressed frustration that it can take the BBC a long time to acknowledge a problem that is immediately apparent to the public.
