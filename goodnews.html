          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading after announcing a 250 billion yen share buyback and exceeding operating income estimates, although operating income decreased by 11% compared to the previous year. The company also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, which will be listed this year and classified as a discontinued operation. While Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was unenthusiastic, the company clarified that the estimated tariff impact did not reflect the recent trade deal between the U.S. and China. Sony has expanded from consumer electronics to include movies, music, and gaming consoles like the PlayStation. (not investment advice)</p>

Trust is a critical factor in hiring decisions, sometimes overshadowing other qualifications, and families often seek professionals who can combine roles, such as a chief investment officer and CFO.

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, although Witkoff's spokesperson denied the proposal. The plan involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. The proposal aims to provide a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and address concerns about Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices decreased in April, marking the first month-to-month drop since October 2024, with the average price for a dozen Grade A eggs falling to $5.12. Despite this decrease, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu that has wiped out flocks of egg-laying hens. Experts predict prices will continue to fall, but the progress of the virus is uncertain. Lowering egg prices has been a focus of President Donald Trump, with the U.S. increasing imports and investigating price gouging.</p>

Both countries have agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to discuss issues of mutual concern.

          <p>Chimpanzees in Uganda have been observed using medicinal plants to treat open wounds and other injuries, according to a study by University of Oxford scientists. Researchers filmed and recorded instances of the animals using plants for first aid, both on themselves and occasionally on each other. The study builds on previous findings that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate, and adds to evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy in the wild. The researchers also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals they weren't related to, adding to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy.</p>
