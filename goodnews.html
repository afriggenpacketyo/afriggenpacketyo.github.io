          <p>Global superstar Bad Bunny launched his three-month residency in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with an emotionally charged concert celebrating the island's heritage and folklore. The performance featured a diverse mix of musical styles, from club beats to salsa, and included tracks that address social injustices like gentrification in the U.S. territory. By returning to his roots and focusing on themes of resistance and pride, the artist is reinforcing his connection to his homeland. The show opened with a new, unreleased song, which fans speculate may remain exclusive to the residency.</p>

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made tennis history by becoming the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years. They defeated the unseeded team of Rinky Hijikata and David Pel in straight sets, 6-2 7-6 (7-3), on Centre Court. Their victory marks the first time two Britons have won a men's doubles Grand Slam since 1936. The achievement is particularly notable as both players teamed up less than a year ago, after their previous partners won the same title together at Wimbledon in 2024.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek has won her first Wimbledon title, delivering a commanding performance to defeat American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in under an hour. This marks the first time a women's final at the All England Club has ended in a "double bagel" victory since 1911. The win gives the 24-year-old Polish star her sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces. Anisimova, playing in her first major final after returning from a break for mental health, struggled with nerves and unforced errors.</p>

The host venues in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver have covered stadiums that will be prioritized for daytime kick-offs. Infantino also declared the revamped 32-team Club World Cup a major financial success, generating nearly $1.5 billion in revenue.</p>

This article suggests investors are now more accustomed to the administration's negotiating style and are focusing on the broader policy implications for corporate earnings. Key factors supporting the market include a deregulatory environment that encourages M&A activity and a permissive stance on AI development, which is driving growth across multiple sectors.

The campaigners have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, warning of their intent to take legal action. The Department for Education responded that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>

During a virtual court hearing from a high-security prison, he consented to the extradition process.
