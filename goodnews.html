          <p>European stock markets generally rose at the start of the trading week, with investors anticipating the U.S. Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting on interest rates. In contrast, shares for Danish wind energy firm Orsted fell by over 5% after it announced a plan to raise new capital by issuing shares at a significant 67% discount. The market is also monitoring U.S. President Trump's state visit to the U.K. and key economic data releases, including the U.K.'s latest inflation figures. Investors widely expect the Federal Reserve to implement an interest rate cut this week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After being dismissed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a group of climate experts is reviving the popular climate.gov website under a new, independent domain. The original government site was effectively dismantled by the Trump administration, which fired hundreds of staff and redirected the homepage, purging content related to diversity, equity, and disproportionate climate impacts. Led by its former manager, Rebecca Lindsey, the new non-profit site, climate.us, aims to restore all censored information and continue providing the public with trusted, timely data on climate change, free from political interference.</p>

          <p>The UK and US are set to formalize a significant agreement to accelerate the development of nuclear power, a move expected to be finalized during President Donald Trump's state visit. The partnership aims to boost energy security, create thousands of jobs, and attract billions in private investment for new nuclear technologies. Key projects include a plan by X-Energy and Centrica to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. The deal will also foster commercial collaboration, work towards ending reliance on Russian nuclear materials by 2028, and streamline safety certifications between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Despite falling to an 0-2 record, the New York Giants displayed a newfound competitiveness in a heartbreaking 43-40 overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Quarterback Russell Wilson delivered a stellar performance with 450 passing yards and three touchdowns, forming a strong connection with rookie receiver Malik Nabers. Although the team was ultimately undone by costly penalties and a late interception, their offensive firepower and fighting spirit marked a significant improvement from their season-opening defeat. The performance suggests that while the team's playoff chances are slim, they have become a more entertaining and promising team to watch.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data from China's central bank indicates a continuing trend of household savings moving into the nation's stock market, suggesting that the current equity rally may have further momentum. Deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and mutual funds, saw a significant increase of 1.17 trillion yuan in August. This shift is driven by low interest rates on traditional bank deposits, which are pushing investors to seek better returns in the capital markets. The earnings yield on China's largest companies currently stands at 5.5%, far exceeding returns from government bonds or bank deposits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is considering a proposal to repurpose its retiring coal-fired power plants into sites for advanced nuclear reactors, a project known as the C2N initiative. This strategy, put forward by a top state-owned energy firm, aims to accelerate decarbonization while preserving existing valuable infrastructure, particularly in coastal regions. With approximately 100 gigawatts of coal power capacity expected to be retired by 2030, converting these sites could offer a direct path to clean energy. Researchers suggest that using these established locations may also help in meeting safety requirements and gaining public acceptance for new nuclear facilities.</p>

Atlanta's offense was powered by running back Bijan Robinson, who rushed for 143 yards. Kicker Parker Romo was also perfect, converting all five of his field goal attempts in a game that saw only one touchdown, a late run by Tyler Allgeier.</p>
