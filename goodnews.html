          <p>During the WNBA All-Star Game warm-ups, players, including sidelined star Caitlin Clark, wore t-shirts with the message "Pay Us What You Owe Us" to highlight ongoing, tense collective bargaining agreement negotiations. The players argue that the league's booming business, evidenced by a new $2.2 billion media rights deal and high expansion fees, justifies increased salaries. Despite the public pressure and contentious talks, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert expressed optimism that a new, transformational deal will be reached before the current agreement expires on October 31st. The demonstration drew mixed reactions on social media but was praised by the players' association president.</p>

          <h2>New Research Explores the Science of Intentionally Changing Personality Traits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 09:13:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent scientific research suggests that personality traits, once thought to be fixed, can be intentionally redesigned through conscious effort. The article profiles writer Olga Khazan, who successfully worked to change aspects of her personality, such as high neuroticism and social anxiety, by engaging in activities like improv comedy. According to experts like Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala, individuals can alter their characteristic ways of thinking and behaving by consistently adopting new actions, essentially faking it until it becomes natural. This approach offers a new perspective on mental health, suggesting people can actively develop traits that support the life they wish to lead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events company Create & Cultivate, identifies a major red flag in job interviews as a candidate who arrives unprepared and lacks understanding of the company or the role. She emphasizes the importance of due diligence, often asking candidates for specific feedback on the company's current work to gauge their preparation and insight. Conversely, Johnson is most impressed by candidates who can provide genuine, constructive feedback on the business. She also values applicants who can openly discuss past mistakes and demonstrate problem-solving skills, which she considers crucial for a fast-paced startup environment.</p>

          <p>In an interview discussing her new memoir, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, reflects on her trailblazing career and the current political landscape. She recounts facing both racism, like a colleague singing "Dixie" to her, and sexism, which she argues is a more difficult challenge to overcome than racism in the U.S. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is struggling to effectively counter Donald Trump and warns of the backsliding on civil rights gains. Despite these challenges, she remains optimistic that Americans value democracy and will resist authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>This essay explores the complex and often-ignored history of Oklahoma, arguing that its story of land theft, racial violence, and reinvention is central to understanding the United States. The author recounts learning a sanitized version of the state's history, which celebrated pioneers while erasing the forced removal of Indigenous nations and the destruction of Black communities. The piece contrasts the state's historical injustices with its modern efforts to attract new talent through programs like Tulsa Remote. Ultimately, the article suggests that a true understanding of America requires confronting these contradictory legacies of ambition, betrayal, and the ongoing struggle over who belongs.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert argues that teaching children "self-connection," the ability to understand their own emotions and needs, is the most critical skill for lifelong success. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's feelings by saying "you're okay," can inadvertently teach them to distrust their inner voice. Fostering self-connection builds emotional resilience, supports healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence. The author provides practical tips for parents, including validating emotions, modeling self-awareness, and avoiding micromanagement to help children develop a strong and secure sense of self.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists believe they have found the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, a Portuguese warship captured by the notorious French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as 'La Buse,' in 1721. The ship was carrying a vast treasure, including gold, diamonds, and pearls, estimated to be worth over $138 million today. The wreck was discovered near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar, a known pirate hideout. While thousands of artifacts have been recovered, the bulk of La Buse's legendary treasure remains undiscovered, perpetuating a 300-year-old mystery that began when the pirate allegedly threw a cryptogram into the crowd at his execution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the Women's Euro 2025 tournament examines why the success rate for penalty kicks has dropped to a historically low 58.5%. Experts suggest a combination of factors is at play, including increased pressure on players due to the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight. Additionally, goalkeepers are now better prepared, using data analysis to anticipate takers' tendencies, as seen with Sweden's keeper Jennifer Falk, who had notes on her water bottle. The professionalization of the women's game has also led to physically more capable and smarter goalkeeping, making penalties a far less certain source of goals.</p>

          <p>Following a first-of-its-kind court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial police training center known as "Cop City." The records were obtained after a lawsuit by a digital news outlet and a research group, setting a potential precedent for the transparency of private police foundations nationwide. The released documents offer insights into the APF's operations, including its active lobbying of city council members to prevent a public referendum on the project. While a victory for open-records advocates, the ruling was narrow and did not declare all police foundations public agencies.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, known for treating diabetes and obesity, are showing significant promise as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder. Women with PCOS who have used these drugs report improvements in symptoms such as irregular periods, hair loss, and weight management difficulties. Researchers believe the drugs' effectiveness stems from improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn helps balance hormone levels and reduce testosterone. While larger clinical trials are needed, the initial results offer hope for a new, more effective way to manage the complex condition.</p>

          <p>In response to conservative criticism of the new Superman movie, acclaimed comic book author Grant Morrison highlights the character's progressive origins. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was depicted as a "champion of the oppressed" and a "socialist figure" who fought corrupt bosses and tore down slums. Morrison explains that the character's patriotic "American way" persona was a later development during World War II. He argues that Superman has always been an immigrant and a fighter for the downtrodden, a history that contradicts the narrow, nationalistic view some pundits are now promoting.</p>

While more than half use these tools regularly, the research indicates that teens are pragmatic, with 80% still prioritizing human friendships over AI interactions. However, the study raises concerns about the potential risks, as a third of teens have discussed serious matters with AI instead of people, and some have shared personal data.

After a difficult rookie season plagued by drops, Johnston showed significant improvement last year and says his confidence is at an all-time high. The offensive coordinator noted that while Williams' ability to win contested catches is not easily replaceable, the team is excited about its current group. The performance of Johnston, alongside star Ladd McConkey and promising rookies, will be critical for the team's passing offense this season.</p>
