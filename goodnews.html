          <p>SkillStorm CEO Justin Vianello discussed the federal government's struggles with hiring skilled workers in cybersecurity and tech, leading to potential national security risks. Vianello proposed allowing an on-ramp time of two to four months to custom-build teams with the right skills and certifications, accelerating IT transformation. He highlighted SkillStorm's Performance Acceleration Center for Excellence, which trains and deploys individuals, recovering the investment through hourly billing. Vianello emphasized the need to invest in domestic programs to address the shortage of cybersecurity experts and AI innovators, viewing it as a national security imperative.</p>

          <p>An innovative "ice battery" system is being used to cool buildings and lower energy costs. The system freezes water at night when electricity is cheaper, then uses the ice to cool buildings during the day, reducing cooling costs by up to 40%. Air conditioning accounts for a significant portion of global energy use, and this system helps alleviate stress on the power grid during peak hours. While currently implemented in about 4,000 sites globally, researchers are also exploring new materials that require less energy to store cooling power.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing an unseasonable series of thunderstorms, bringing with them the potential for fire-starting lightning strikes. The storms have produced significant thunder and lightning, but generally light rainfall, raising concerns about dry lightning igniting wildfires. While lighter rainfall has decreased the risk of debris flows in burn scar areas, heavier rains inland have prompted a flash flood warning for San Bernardino County. The storms are expected to continue through the evening before gradually exiting the region, with more typical June weather returning later in the week.</p>

The project, part of China's effort to export agricultural technology, uses air-foam drilling to tackle unstable aquifers and prevent well collapse, a technique now adopted by many Egyptian drilling companies. This partnership reflects a strategic alignment, with Chinese companies seeking overseas opportunities and Middle Eastern countries looking to Chinese expertise for development challenges. Saudi Arabia has also signed agreements with Chinese companies for projects in the environmental, water, agricultural, fisheries, and livestock sectors.</p>

The bill requires chatbot platforms to remind users every three hours that the virtual characters are not human and disclose that the chatbots may not be suitable for some minors. Platforms must also implement protocols for addressing suicidal ideation expressed by users, including providing suicide prevention resources. The legislation now heads to the California State Assembly.</p>

The removal of the asset cap allows Wells Fargo to pursue higher deposits, new accounts, and additional investment banking businesses.</p>
