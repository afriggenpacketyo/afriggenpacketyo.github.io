          <p>England and Canada, the top two ranked teams in women's rugby, are set to face each other in the World Cup final on Saturday. Tournament hosts England, who are fully professional and on a 32-match winning streak, are considered the favorites as they seek their third title. In contrast, the Canadian team is not professional and relied on a fundraising campaign to support their tournament preparations. The match is a rematch of the 2014 final, which England won, and marks a significant moment for the sport's global growth.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.4 earthquake centered in Berkeley rattled the San Francisco Bay Area in the early morning hours, waking residents across the region. The tremor, which occurred just before 3 a.m., was centered near the UC Berkeley campus and triggered the MyShake earthquake early warning application. While no major injuries were immediately reported, the shaking was strong enough to cause minor damage, such as dishes falling from shelves in some homes. The event serves as a reminder of the region's seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to Africa have surged by 25%, totaling $140.8 billion, as manufacturers seek alternative markets in response to U.S. tariffs. According to China's customs data, the growth rate of exports to Africa is two to four times faster than to other major regions like Europe and Asia. Analysts suggest that the significant tariffs imposed by the U.S. are a primary driver for this shift, compelling Chinese companies to redirect their goods to the African continent. This trend highlights the strategic adjustments in global trade patterns resulting from ongoing economic disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>FDA Approves Vagus Nerve Stimulator for Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment</h2>

          <p>An experimental device that stimulates the vagus nerve has received FDA approval for treating rheumatoid arthritis in patients who do not respond to medication. The implant, the size of a lima bean, delivers daily electrical pulses to the nerve in the neck, which helps regulate the body's inflammatory response by signaling the spleen to reduce cytokine production. While not a universal cure, clinical trials showed meaningful improvement in about 35% of a difficult-to-treat patient group. This approval marks a potential turning point for treating autoimmune diseases through the body's own neural pathways.</p>

          <p>This article presents a speculative vision of Berlin in the year 2050, shaped by current scientific projections for sustainable urban development. Through the daily life of a fictional character named Emilia, it imagines a city transformed by climate adaptation and innovation, featuring river swimming, widespread renewable energy, vertical farming of tropical fruits, and efficient public transport. The narrative highlights a society that has embraced circular economies, plant-based diets, and a collective responsibility for maintaining green infrastructure, reflecting on the activism and policy changes that made such a future possible.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed implementing mandatory, cigarette-style health warnings on social media apps to protect children's mental health from what it calls "addictive algorithms." The plan also includes a two-hour daily cap on accessing short-form video content, or "doomscrolling," for users under 18. Citing research linking excessive social media use to anxiety and sleep disruption, the party argues that these platforms should be treated with the same caution as products like tobacco and alcohol. The proposal aims to ensure young users are fully aware of the potential risks.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial conducted by Ascletis Pharma in the U.S. has shown that its drug candidate, ASC47, can significantly boost the weight loss effects of semaglutide, a popular GLP-1 medication. When used in combination, the treatment resulted in a 56% greater relative reduction in body weight compared to semaglutide alone over a four-week period. The study also indicated a substantial improvement in gastrointestinal side effects, with the incidence of vomiting dropping from 57% with semaglutide monotherapy to just 6.7% with the combination therapy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has successfully built and tested a giant, three-armed robotic system designed for maintenance work inside future nuclear fusion reactors, often called "artificial suns." The platform's main arm can handle a payload of 60 tonnes with a positioning accuracy of within 4 millimeters, a capacity that surpasses existing systems in the nuclear industry. This development marks a significant step forward in China's pursuit of fusion energy, as the robot can perform complex tasks in the hazardous, high-radiation environments of a reactor core.</p>

          <p>Sea moss, a type of red seaweed, has gained popularity on social media as a superfood with claims of benefits ranging from improved skin to better gut health, but scientific evidence remains limited. Dieticians note that while sea moss is a good source of fiber, antioxidants, and minerals, most health claims are based on small-scale or non-human studies. Potential risks include the accumulation of heavy metals from contaminated waters and excessive iodine intake, which can affect thyroid function. Experts recommend consuming sea moss as a whole food rather than in unregulated supplement form.</p>

          <p>Shares of companies within the Adani Group experienced a sharp increase, with Adani Power surging nearly 20% after a five-for-one stock split. The rally was further fueled by a decision from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which cleared the conglomerate of some allegations of stock manipulation and fraud that were made by short-seller Hindenburg Research in 2023. While SEBI's investigation into other allegations continues, the partial clearance has renewed investor confidence in the group's stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new video game 'Silent Hill f' is being hailed as one of the best and most ambitious entries in the long-running psychological horror series. Set in 1960s Japan, the game follows a teenage girl named Hinako as her personal struggles manifest in a decaying, monstrous version of her village. The review praises the game's ambiguous and layered narrative, which explores the role of rigid societal norms in a mental breakdown, as well as its artful cutscenes and relentless pacing. It is considered a triumphant return to form for the franchise.</p>

          <p>The opening foursomes session of the 45th Ryder Cup is poised to be a critical factor in determining the overall winner between Europe and the US. This alternate-shot format is considered the most demanding form of team play, and recent history shows that success on the first morning is a strong indicator of the final outcome. US captain Keegan Bradley has chosen to start with foursomes, a tactic that Europe successfully countered in Rome last year. Europe will rely on experienced pairings to silence the home crowd and gain an early advantage.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an "interim emergency measure." In an interview, Lee argued that while complete denuclearization remains the long-term goal, a freeze is a more realistic alternative for now, given that Pyongyang is producing numerous new weapons annually. This pragmatic stance reflects a shift in South Korea's approach, aiming to reduce tensions and re-engage North Korea in dialogue after a period of hostility under the previous administration.</p>
