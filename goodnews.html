          <p>East Los Angeles hosted its 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade, imbued with a spirit of defiance against the Trump administration's intensified immigration raids. Despite heightened fears following a Supreme Court ruling that expanded federal agent patrols, many attendees felt compelled to participate and assert their rights. Mayor Karen Bass publicly expressed strong solidarity with her Latino constituents, unequivocally condemning the ongoing raids as abhorrent and divisive. While the event saw slightly lower attendance than previous years, it powerfully emanated a collective sense of Latino joy, cultural pride, and determined resistance against perceived injustices, highlighting community resilience.</p>

          <p>Prominent Chinese scholar Zheng Yongnian advocates for China to independently develop its own artificial intelligence knowledge system, moving beyond its historical reliance on Western social science theories. He articulates significant concerns about "intellectual colonialism" in the rapidly evolving AI era, arguing that Western academic frameworks often prove inadequate for explaining the unique complexities of non-Western civilizations like Confucian, Islamic, or Indian societies. This article suggests that by fully embracing its distinct secular civilization, China can establish a more authentic and influential role in the international order, fostering a unique and self-reliant approach to AI innovation and global leadership.</p>

The Cincinnati Bengals also clinched a 31-27 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars, though their triumph was marred by a concerning toe injury to star quarterback Joe Burrow, who did not return to the game. Other notable results included the Seattle Seahawks' victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions' commanding performance against the Chicago Bears, and the Buffalo Bills' comfortable win over the New York Jets, shaping the early season standings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are gaining immense popularity as an alternative to traditional credit cards. An estimated 86.5 million Americans used BNPL in 2024, challenging the credit card industry by reducing transaction activity and utilization. Banks and financial institutions are wary because BNPL creates a "giant black hole" in understanding consumers' credit profiles, posing risks to assessing credit quality. This shift in consumer behavior impacts major revenue drivers for traditional lenders (not investment advice).</p>
