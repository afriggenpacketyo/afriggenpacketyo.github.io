          <p>Oracle has appointed Clay Magouyrk, its cloud infrastructure president, and Mike Sicilia, its industries president, as new co-CEOs, signaling a strategic shift in leadership. Current CEO Safra Catz will transition to an executive vice chair role on the company board. This move is designed to harness the specialized expertise of both executives, particularly in the rapidly expanding cloud and industry-specific software sectors, to drive future growth. However, the announcement was met with an initial dip in company shares during premarket trading, reflecting market participants' immediate reactions and ongoing evaluations of the new leadership structure and its potential impact on the technology giant's trajectory.</p>

India remains one of Saudi Arabia's top three oil customers, alongside Russia and Iraq. This article also refutes persistent rumors of Saudi Arabia moving away from the U.S. dollar for oil trade, underscoring the greenback's continued importance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid publicly praised Travis Kelce's "passion" after the tight end was involved in a second consecutive sideline confrontation with his coach during the team's 22-9 victory over the New York Giants. The latest incident saw Reid bump Kelce's shoulder amidst a heated exchange in the second quarter, prompted by the Chiefs' sluggish offensive performance. Despite these emotional displays, Reid downplayed the events, asserting his comfort with Kelce's intense commitment to winning. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes also reiterated the strong, underlying relationship between the coach and player, framing these moments as characteristic of elite athletes.</p>

          <h2>London Gatwick Airport's Second Runway Expansion Receives Government Approval</h2>

          <p>London Gatwick Airport has received approval from Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander for its £2.2bn privately-financed plan to bring its Northern Runway into regular use as a second runway. The expansion, which involves moving the existing runway 12 meters, aims to increase annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s, creating thousands of jobs and billions in investment. While hailed by the government as a "no-brainer for growth," the project faces strong opposition from the Green Party and local groups concerned about climate impact, noise, and infrastructure strain. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate concerns.</p>

          <p>A U.S. congressional delegation, led by Democrat Adam Smith, has held meetings with Chinese Premier and Defense Minister, marking the first reported visit by House members since 2019. The primary objective of these high-level discussions is to recalibrate the bilateral relationship across diplomatic, economic, and security dimensions, critically aiming to re-establish military communication channels. These channels were notably shut down by Beijing in 2022 following former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. The U.S. delegation conveyed its commitment to opening lines of communication on peace and security, a sentiment echoed by China's defense minister, who expressed hope for increased mutual understanding between the two nations' militaries.</p>

          <p>Build-A-Bear Workshop has become a notable success story in the retail sector, achieving record-breaking revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025 despite facing macroeconomic challenges such as tariffs and reduced mall foot traffic. CEO Sharon Price John credits this performance to proactive strategies, including tariff mitigation and expanding the brand's presence beyond malls into diverse venues like cruise ships and amusement parks. A key driver of its growth is also the strong nostalgic appeal to adults, a demographic increasingly embracing "kidulting" and personalization trends, as evidenced by high rates of adult teddy bear ownership.

          <h2>Understanding Key Differences Between ETFs and Mutual Funds for Investors</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article elucidates the key differences between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, providing essential insights for investors aiming to diversify their portfolios. A fundamental distinction lies in their trading mechanisms: ETFs are traded like stocks on an exchange, allowing for real-time pricing throughout the day, whereas mutual fund transactions occur once daily at the market's close. Financial experts highlight that ETFs offer a significant tax efficiency advantage, often bypassing the capital gains distributions that mutual fund shareholders might incur, thanks to their unique "in-kind" transaction process. Moreover, ETFs typically present lower expense ratios, positioning them as a more cost-effective investment choice, especially within taxable brokerage accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Citi Private Bank survey reveals that family offices, investment firms for the ultra-wealthy, maintain optimism for their returns, with most anticipating 5-10% or higher for 2025. Seven out of ten family offices are still keen on direct investments in private companies, often driven by bullish long-term trends like AI and infrastructure. However, there's a noticeable retreat from early-stage startup and seed funding, with a preference for growth-stage investments due to perceived lower risk. North American family offices, in particular, are increasing interest in secondary sales, leveraging their reliable cash flow to acquire illiquid assets when institutional investors divest.

          <p>James Love, a 54-year-old builder, has been acquitted of burglary charges concerning the daytime theft of a Banksy "Girl With Balloon" print, valued at £270,000, from a central London gallery. Love was implicated as the getaway driver, while his co-defendant, Larry Fraser, admitted guilt to smashing the gallery's front door and absconding with the limited-edition artwork. Love maintained in court that he was unaware of Fraser's criminal intentions until after the theft, expressing anger upon discovery. Crucially, he later assisted police in recovering the stolen print, which was found at a block of flats in the Isle of Dogs.</p>
