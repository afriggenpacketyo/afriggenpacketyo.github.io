          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 12:09:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, surpassing forecasts and reversing a 0.5% contraction from the first three months of the year. This growth was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports, a volatile factor influenced by President Trump's tariff policies, rather than underlying economic strength. While consumer spending saw a modest increase, a key measure of private domestic demand slowed, suggesting that the economy is cooling despite the strong headline number. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of online brokerage Robinhood have rallied 177% this year, making it the best-performing U.S. tech stock valued over $5 billion. This surge reflects the company's strategic transformation from a retail broker into a global fintech platform, marked by significant acquisitions like Bitstamp and WonderFi. The company is also expanding aggressively in Europe with new crypto products, including tokenized stocks and enhanced trading features. This rapid growth has pushed its market capitalization to $91 billion, just behind its rival Coinbase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed to dismiss all charges against restaurant company Fat Brands and its chairman, Andy Wiederhorn. The company and its executives were indicted in May 2024 on allegations of a $47 million "sham" loan scheme, including charges of wire fraud and tax evasion. This reversal by the Justice Department follows a significant leadership shake-up within the agency since the start of President Trump's second term. Wiederhorn, who has maintained his innocence, still faces a separate civil complaint from the SEC regarding the same alleged conduct.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The national median rent for apartments remained flat in July and was down 0.8% compared to the previous year, according to a new report from Apartment List. This weakness during the typically busy summer moving season is attributed to a record-high vacancy rate of 7.1%. The market is currently absorbing a massive wave of new construction, with more new multifamily units completed last year than in any year since 1986. This oversupply has created a more favorable market for renters, particularly in southern and western states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the "Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025," has been introduced to protect domestic jobs and increase transparency for consumers. The proposed legislation would require companies to disclose a call center worker's physical location and any use of AI, while also giving customers the right to be transferred to a U.S.-based agent. To discourage offshoring, the bill would make companies that move call centers overseas ineligible for certain federal loans and grants, creating a public list of such employers.</p>

The article notes that while the headline number was strong, it was significantly skewed by a sharp drop in imports related to tariff policies, while other indicators point to a cooling economy.

          <p>In the deep, dark trenches of the northwest Pacific, scientists have discovered a vibrant and extensive ecosystem thriving without sunlight. These communities, found at depths greater than 31,000 feet, are dominated by tube worms and clams that derive their energy from chemical reactions, a process called chemosynthesis. They are nourished by hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the seafloor. This groundbreaking discovery extends the known depth limit for such life by nearly 25% and shows how life can flourish in Earth's most extreme environments.</p>
