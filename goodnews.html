        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Renowned venture capitalist Michael Moritz has publicly supported Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan following calls for his resignation from former President Donald Trump. In a Financial Times piece, Moritz described the political attacks as "artless bullying" and expressed confidence in Tan's ability to lead Intel, citing his successful history. The controversy stems from concerns raised by Trump and Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's connections to Chinese companies. Despite the political pressure, Intel's board appears to be standing by Tan, who met with White House officials to address the concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has extended the deadline to reimpose high tariffs on Chinese goods, delaying the increase for an additional 90 days. This move provides a temporary reprieve in the ongoing trade dispute, preventing U.S. duties on Chinese imports from escalating to previous peak levels. The decision followed recent trade negotiations in Stockholm and reflects the administration's pattern of using tariff deadlines as a negotiation tactic. The extension offers continued, albeit uncertain, stability for businesses navigating the unpredictable trade policy landscape between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have extended their partnership with Netflix through a new multiyear, first-look deal for their company, Archewell Productions. This new arrangement gives Netflix the first right of refusal on their projects, offering more flexibility than their previous exclusive contract. The couple announced several upcoming projects, including a second season of Meghan's lifestyle show and a film adaptation of a novel. This deal solidifies their media presence in the U.S. as they continue to build their careers outside the British royal family.</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock rose after the company announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The movie theater chain reported revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million, or one cent per share. CEO Adam Aron attributed the positive performance to a recovering box office and the company's success in managing its debt maturities. The company also saw a 26% increase in attendance and record-high revenue per patron, signaling a potential turnaround after post-pandemic struggles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fears of 'Peak Mineral' for Green Energy May Be Overstated Due to Technological Innovation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 15:52:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores the growing concern over potential shortages of critical minerals required for the global transition to clean energy. A recent study suggests the world could face shortfalls of key minerals like lithium and cobalt, but the article argues these "peak mineral" fears may be premature. Technological advancements are rapidly creating substitutes, such as sodium-ion batteries replacing lithium and new chemistries that eliminate the need for cobalt. Just as innovation overcame "peak oil" predictions, new technologies, improved mining techniques, and material science breakthroughs could resolve mineral supply challenges for the renewable energy sector.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will shut down its dial-up internet service in the U.S. and Canada on September 30, marking the end of an era for many who first connected to the web with its distinctive sound. The service, which launched over three decades ago and was famously featured in the film "You've Got Mail," has been largely superseded by broadband technology. While fewer than 300,000 people in the U.S. still use dial-up, the move represents a nostalgic farewell to a foundational piece of internet history.</p>

          <p>Ford is investing $5 billion to overhaul its electric vehicle manufacturing process, aiming to produce more affordable models. The investment includes modernizing its Louisville Assembly Plant and building a new battery facility in Michigan. The company unveiled a new "universal EV platform" that it claims will streamline production, reducing parts by 20% and workstations by 40%. The first vehicle from this new system will be a five-seat, midsize electric truck set to debut in 2027 with a starting price of $30,000.</p>

          <p>This article provides a five-step guide for individuals whose bank accounts have been frozen by a debt collector, a common but jarring collection tactic. The recommended actions include immediately contacting the bank to confirm the freeze, reviewing the court judgment for errors, and identifying and claiming any exempt funds like Social Security benefits. It also suggests negotiating directly with the debt collector for a settlement or payment plan. For overwhelming debt, the article advises considering professional debt relief services or consulting a bankruptcy attorney. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Full-Size Pickup Trucks Remain Highly Profitable for Automakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 15:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ranking fourth in U.S. market share, the full-size half-ton pickup truck segment is a major profit driver for automakers. An analysis highlights three key reasons for this: exceptionally high profit margins per vehicle, the ability to leverage their platforms for other profitable vehicles like full-size SUVs, and exceptionally strong brand loyalty among owners. Ford's F-Series and Chevrolet's Silverado dominate the segment, and the global market for these vehicles is projected to continue growing. This sustained profitability underscores the strategic importance of pickups to manufacturers' bottom lines.</p>

          <p>In an unusual arrangement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will give the federal government 15% of the revenue from their sales of specific AI chips to China. This agreement was a condition for receiving the export licenses needed to sell Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were previously restricted. Former President Trump confirmed the deal, stating he negotiated it directly with Nvidia's CEO. This revenue-sharing model is a novel approach to export controls, balancing national security concerns with the desire for U.S. companies to compete in the critical Chinese market.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced via a Truth Social post that gold will not be subject to tariffs, directly overriding a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs decision had indicated that certain gold bars from Switzerland would face a 39% duty, which caused the precious metal's price to hit a record high. Following Trump's announcement, gold futures fell sharply. The reversal provides clarity and relief to the precious metals market, which had been concerned about the potential impact on the international flow of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of their China-related chip revenue with the U.S. government is being viewed by analysts as an unusual but pragmatic deal. For investors, securing access to the lucrative Chinese market is seen as a net positive, as 85% of revenue is better than zero. The move, described as a "tax for doing business in China," is characteristic of former President Trump's transactional approach but is unlikely to be replicated in other sectors. The deal creates short-term certainty for the chipmakers but raises long-term questions about future government intervention in their business. (not investment advice)</p>
