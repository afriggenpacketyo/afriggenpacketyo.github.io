        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from The Atlantic explores the idea of intentionally creating small, joyful moments to improve daily life, moving beyond the fleeting happiness of vacations. The author shares their personal quest to "romanticize" life through simple acts like reading physical books, savoring a mocktail, and making small, pleasing purchases. The piece also includes anecdotes from colleagues who find delight in various routines, from tending to houseplants and journaling about gratitude to starting the day with group chats or listening to curated music playlists. The central theme suggests that actively seeking daily joy is a more fulfilling pursuit than simply enduring life's challenges.</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has achieved a significant milestone, joining the list of the 20 most valuable companies in the United States after its stock more than doubled in 2025. The company's market capitalization has reached $375 billion, surpassing established giants like Home Depot and Procter & Gamble. This surge is driven by strong investor confidence in its artificial intelligence offerings and its expanding contracts with the U.S. government. Despite its high valuation, the company's revenue remains a fraction of other firms in the top 20. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Metro D (Purple) Line in Los Angeles is set to reopen after a 70-day closure required for a major expansion project beneath Wilshire Boulevard. During the shutdown, crews worked to connect the existing subway with the first phase of the new extension, which will add three new stations and is now 98% complete. This phase, connecting downtown to the Westside, is expected to open in 2025. The overall project aims to add seven new stations, with the full line scheduled for completion by the 2028 Summer Olympics, significantly expanding transit options for one of Metro's most heavily used routes.</p>

          <p>Tesla is reportedly planning to launch an invite-only robotaxi service in the Bay Area, a move that would place it in direct competition with established players like Waymo. According to an internal memo, the testing could begin as soon as this weekend, following a similar launch in Austin, Texas. The expansion comes as CEO Elon Musk increasingly focuses on autonomous technology to drive the company's future amid declining electric vehicle sales. The vehicles will still use human co-pilots for monitoring, as Tesla faces regulatory scrutiny and a DMV lawsuit over its self-driving claims.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed the U.S. Education Department to release more than $5 billion in federal grant funding that had been withheld from states. The funds, which support a wide range of programs including teacher training, English language instruction, and adult education, were frozen in late June for a review of their alignment with White House priorities. The decision to withhold the money, which had already been appropriated by Congress, caused significant financial strain for school districts and drew bipartisan criticism, prompting lawmakers and states to lobby for its release ahead of the new school year.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times argues that the public ridicule of the executive and HR head caught on a kiss-cam at a Coldplay concert is a healthy societal response. The author contends that the widespread humor does not stem from moral superiority but from a recognition of shared human fallibility and a societal respect for the institution of marriage. Countering arguments that the public shaming was disproportionate, the writer suggests it reflects a culture that still takes marital vows seriously. The column concludes that such jokes are a harmless reflection of these underlying values.</p>
