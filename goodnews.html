          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported better-than-expected first fiscal-quarter earnings but announced a projected $700 million revenue loss in the current quarter due to new export controls on AI chips to China. Despite these regulatory challenges, AMD CEO Lisa Su highlighted the company's strong product portfolio and tailwinds in other areas. The company's data center segment, driven by demand for Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, saw significant growth. AMD expects continued investment in AI infrastructure and its chips are being used to train AI, and a major AI model developer is using AMD chips to deploy their service, a process called inference.

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration said that starting Wednesday, it will no longer accept IDs that don't comply with Real ID requirements. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday told lawmakers what will happen when passengers present their ID to a TSA officer. If it's not compliant, they may be diverted to a different line, have an extra step, but people will be allowed to fly. The TSA said people without an acceptable ID may have to have their identity verified by providing information such as their name and current address. Optimism Score: 70</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of California legislators has released a letter urging the state‚Äôs congressional delegation to protect the Head Start program and reject proposed Trump administration cuts. The letter, signed by over three-quarters of state lawmakers, expresses deep alarm over cuts to the federal early childhood program. California receives $1.5 billion annually for Head Start, providing child care, education, medical care, and nutritious meals to over 80,000 low-income children. Due to recent cuts, nearly 1000 Head Start employees in California have already received pink slips. Optimism Score: 65</p>
