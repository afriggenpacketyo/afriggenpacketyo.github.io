          <p>The fire brigade in Wiesbaden, Germany, was dispatched four times for suspected gas leaks that were actually caused by the potent smell of durian fruit. In one instance, the odor from an Asian supermarket was spread through a shopping center's ventilation system, prompting multiple emergency calls. A separate incident in a residential building was also traced back to a neighbor who had brought the fruit home. Despite the confusion, no actual gas leaks were detected in any of the cases, highlighting the fruit's notoriously strong and deceptive aroma.</p>

          <p>As part of its 15th and largest Arctic science expedition, China has successfully completed its first manned deep dive beneath the polar ice. The operation was also the world's first coordinated mission involving both crewed and uncrewed submersibles in the polar region. Using a fleet of advanced research vessels, including the icebreaker Xue Long 2, researchers gathered extensive data on biodiversity, ocean hydrology, and water chemistry. This achievement marks a significant milestone in China's polar research capabilities and its growing presence in the strategically important Arctic.</p>

          <p>Hosted by Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan from Oklahoma, the podcast "I've Had It" has emerged as a significant voice on the political left, attracting millions of followers and high-profile Democratic guests. The show is known for its profane, direct, and humorous style, offering a stark contrast to more traditional political commentary and providing a space for liberals to commiserate. Initially an entertainment podcast, it pivoted to politics, embracing a combative approach that the hosts believe is necessary to counter the right-wing media ecosystem. Their success highlights a demand for more aggressive and personality-driven content on the left.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated she is "not afraid" despite facing routine protests, death threats, and a recent assassination attempt targeting her colleague, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. She explained that she approaches such pressures with a businesslike emotional discipline, refusing to let fear or criticism influence her work or personal life. Barrett also discussed her new book and her judicial philosophy of originalism, emphasizing that she strives to interpret the law based on the Constitution's original meaning, separate from her personal feelings or political pressures. She asserted this framework guides her decisions on all cases, including those involving former President Trump.</p>

          <p>At 70 years old, marine biologist Elvira Alvarado, known as "the mother of Colombian corals," is pioneering the use of in-vitro fertilization to save Colombia's endangered coral reefs. With over half of the Caribbean's coral lost since the 1970s due to climate change and disease, her mission is critical. Alvarado and her team collect coral eggs and sperm during the brief annual spawning event, fertilize them in a lab, and then transplant the hatchlings to regenerate damaged reefs. By selecting genetic material from more resilient corals, they aim to build reefs that can better withstand warming ocean conditions.</p>

          <p>The recent, sudden popularity of disparate items like Labubu toys and Dubai chocolate is a product of algorithm-driven social media platforms like TikTok. Unlike past fads such as Beanie Babies, which had traceable origins in marketing and new commerce platforms like eBay, today's trends often lack clear cultural context. They succeed because their visually stimulating nature grabs attention in a fast-scrolling environment. This phenomenon can lead to the "infantilization" of consumer culture, but it also reflects a desire for shared, physical experiences that bridge the gap between online and offline reality.</p>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting its strategy from that of well-meaning activists to a more confrontational, "eco-populist" force. Polanski has promised to "pick fights" to gain attention and cut through a splintered political landscape, a tactic some members believe is necessary to combat voter disillusionment. The party is seeing record membership and aims to build on its 2024 general election success, where it won four seats. While some worry this new boldness could alienate rural voters, the leadership sees an opportunity to emulate the attention-grabbing tactics of parties like Reform UK.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has defended her deliberate and patient approach to policy-making, acknowledging it may come at a "price to pay" in opinion polls. Speaking ahead of her party's conference, she argued against rushing out announcements like Labour or Reform UK, stating her focus is on getting policies right to avoid future problems. Badenoch insisted that this methodical strategy would "pay off eventually," despite the party losing support to Nigel Farage's Reform party. She emphasized that her goal is to "do politics differently" by prioritizing substance over short-term political gains.</p>

          <p>The prominent medical publisher BMJ Group has retracted a study from March 2024 that claimed apple cider vinegar could lead to dramatic weight loss. The retraction follows significant concerns raised by scientists about the quality and implausibility of the research, which had reported that participants lost about 9% of their body mass in 12 weeks. Nutrition experts were skeptical from the outset, and the retraction reinforces long-standing doubts about the product's purported health benefits. The incident also highlights systemic issues in academic publishing, as it took over a year for the journal to act on the concerns raised.</p>

At a recent conference on speculative fiction in Suzhou, authors expressed mixed feelings about AI's creative capabilities. Some find it useful for brainstorming and overcoming writer's block, while others are concerned about copyright infringement and the psychological impact of AI approaching human-level writing ability. The discussion highlights the particular shock felt by emerging writers, who now face a creative landscape being fundamentally reshaped by technology.</p>

Young protesters identify with the anime's core themes of freedom, justice, and challenging corrupt authority.

Raquel is the great-great-granddaughter of Samantha Parkington, one of the original historical characters, linking a new Mexican American story to the brand's legacy. While the character's narrative is praised for exploring a blended identity, her physical appearance has drawn criticism for being nearly identical to a previous Latina doll, Maritza Ochoa. This has raised concerns that Mattel is presenting a narrow image of Latinas, failing to reflect the community's diverse range of skin tones and features.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has seen significant transformation, including a modernized training facility and its first major domestic trophy in 70 years. However, the club's growth has been more gradual than some expected, largely due to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules, which limit spending and prevent the owners from leveraging their full wealth. While revenue and staff have grown, the club must find creative ways to increase commercial income to compete with top rivals. The takeover continues to draw criticism from human rights groups.
