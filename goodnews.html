          <p>Tattoos have become increasingly prevalent in American culture, with a third of adults now having at least one, signaling a shift towards greater acceptance and individuality. Despite this mainstream embrace, particularly among millennials, research indicates that some societal stigma remains, occasionally affecting perceptions in professional settings. Art institutions are beginning to recognize tattooing as a legitimate art form, though about a quarter of those with tattoos express some regret over their decision.</p>

Teachers at Lakeside High School report that the ban has created a better learning environment, reduced distractions, and allowed them to regain students' attention, which they felt was a "losing battle." The principal noted significant improvements in student conduct and engagement since the pilot program was introduced, reflecting a growing national trend.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have pledged to provide post-war security guarantees to Ukraine, which could include an international "reassurance force" on land, sea, and in the air. The announcement came after a Paris summit where European leaders sought to secure commitment from U.S. President Donald Trump for supporting Kyiv. The guarantees are intended to deploy once the conflict ends to prevent future aggression, a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed as a "serious concrete step."</p>

          <p>Following the tragic death of their daughter Chloe and others in a flash flood at Camp Mystic, a Texas family successfully advocated for new campground safety laws. The new legislation, prompted by the devastating event in a region known as "Flash Flood Alley," will prohibit cabins in flood zones and mandate warning systems and emergency training. The parents, who felt the deaths were preventable, hope these new state-level regulations will serve as a model for improving camp safety nationwide.</p>
