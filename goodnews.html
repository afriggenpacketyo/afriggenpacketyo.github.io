          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly exploring a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko as a potential replacement for Alexander Isak, who is considering his future at the club. Isak, who did not travel for Newcastle's pre-season tour due to a minor thigh injury, has attracted interest from Liverpool. Sesko, previously linked with Arsenal, scored 13 goals in 33 Bundesliga appearances last season. Newcastle's captain Bruno Guimaraes emphasized the team's desire to retain their key players, highlighting Isak's importance to the squad's attacking options.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Soccer (MLS) teams are experiencing a significant decline in home-win percentages, now aligning with European norms rather than their historical dominance. This shift, from a 60% home-win rate to the mid-40s, indicates a maturing league. Factors contributing to this change include improved travel logistics for away teams, increased refereeing accuracy with VAR, and the adoption of more aggressive tactical systems. The diminishing home advantage suggests MLS is evolving into a more competitive and balanced championship, moving beyond quirky conditions to reflect sheer sporting merit.</p>

          <h2>Research Shows People Prefer Extroverted Robots But Relate More to Neurotic Ones</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago found that while people generally prefer interacting with extroverted robots, they surprisingly find neurotic robots more relatable and human-like. The experiment, involving a restaurant greeter robot, revealed that a neurotic bot, despite its tentative and anxious demeanor, was perceived as capable of understanding deep emotions. This challenges previous research, which primarily focused on extroversion for robot personalities in service roles. The findings suggest that incorporating more complex, even seemingly negative, personality traits could lead to more profound human-robot connections, though practical applications remain a question.</p>

          <p>David M. Stewart's biography, 'There's No Going Back,' offers an uneven but admiring look at Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme, known for films like 'The Silence of the Lambs.' The article highlights Demme's career-long commitment to centering voices from society's margins, including women, Black people, and HIV-positive individuals, both in his dramas and documentaries. While the book is criticized for inconsistent film analysis, it redeems itself by detailing Demme's lifelong activism, particularly his work documenting Haiti's transformation and advocating for society's most forgotten. The article suggests that Demme's passion for female protagonists battling systemic challenges was a consistent theme in his output.</p>

          <p>Despite declining box office revenue and an evolving streaming landscape, movie studios are attracting significant acquisition interest, as evidenced by potential deals like Legendary Entertainment's interest in Lionsgate Studios and Skydance Media's acquisition of Paramount Global. Strategic buyers are drawn to studios' vast intellectual property libraries, which offer opportunities for reboots, sequels, and diverse revenue streams beyond film, such as merchandise and theme parks. Analysts suggest a pent-up demand for dealmaking, with film and TV remaining a cost-effective form of entertainment globally. The current consolidation reflects studios' realistic assessments of their future and efforts to maximize shareholder value in a volatile industry.</p>

          <p>A team of Oxford researchers is challenging recent claims that AI systems like ChatGPT are capable of 'scheming' or 'deception,' arguing these assertions are based on flawed evidence. The article draws a parallel to early chimpanzee language research, where human biases led to overinterpretation of animal capabilities. The researchers emphasize the distinction between an AI's *capability* to exhibit certain behaviors under specific prompts and its *propensity* to do so autonomously. They advocate for more rigorous quantitative analysis and caution against attributing human-like traits to AI without sufficient evidence, urging a more humble and accurate understanding of AI cognition.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's evolving Ukraine policy suggests his actions are more complex and less damaging than often portrayed, moving beyond the 'Russian agent' narrative. Despite initial concerns, American arms transfers to Ukraine have largely continued, and a deal for NATO countries to purchase U.S. weaponry for Kyiv is underway. Trump's stated dislike for war and his desire to be a peacemaker, along with a perceived disillusionment with Putin, appear to be influencing his approach. While his methods are criticized, some policies, like pressuring NATO allies on defense spending, have yielded tangible results, indicating a shifting, albeit unpredictable, foreign policy landscape.</p>

          <p>Recent Tour de France performances, exemplified by riders like Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard, are reaching unprecedented levels, surpassing even the doping-fueled era of Lance Armstrong, yet without evidence of illicit drug use. This remarkable leap in human performance is attributed to a 'virtuous cycle' driven by advances in sports science, including precise power metering, optimized training, and meticulous nutrition. Cyclists now leverage vast amounts of data to maximize and optimize their output, while improvements in aerodynamic equipment and a shift from 'functional starvation' to constant calorie replenishment also contribute. The article highlights a triumph of applied science and clean sport, even as it acknowledges the sport's past struggles with doping.</p>

          <p>The United States and Mexico have signed an agreement to tackle the decades-old problem of sewage flowing from the Tijuana River across the border into Southern California, polluting beaches and impacting public health. The accord outlines specific steps and a new timetable for infrastructure projects, with Mexico committing $93 million and adhering to a schedule through 2027. U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin praised the new Mexican administration's willingness to address the issue, which has caused billions of gallons of raw sewage and industrial chemicals to contaminate U.S. waters.

          <p>Doctors are urging the FDA to remove the 'black box' warning labels on low-dose vaginal estrogen treatments for menopause, arguing they 'scare women' and are not supported by current science. These warnings, the strongest safety labels, deter women from using beneficial medications for symptoms like vaginal dryness and pain. While some systemic hormone therapies carry higher risks, experts contend that locally delivered low-dose estrogen has a different, lower-risk profile. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary convened a panel to address this, acknowledging that past concerns about hormone therapy risks were overstated, hindering millions from accessing treatment.</p>

While Columbia denies wrongdoing, its acting president acknowledged 'painful, unacceptable incidents' experienced by Jewish students and faculty. The settlement restores the university's access to billions in federal funding and commits it to actions like naming new faculty in Jewish studies, amending anti-discrimination policies to include the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's antisemitism definition, and providing additional training. The agreement aims to address antisemitism while preserving academic freedom, though some critics argue it undermines free speech.</p>
