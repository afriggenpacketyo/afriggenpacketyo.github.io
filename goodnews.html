          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, secured a decisive reelection victory, four years after white officials allegedly locked him out of the town hall following his unopposed 2020 win. This week's election, the town's first in decades, was held under a federal settlement after Braxton and other Black residents sued over the town's history of non-democratic, "hand-me-down" governance. Braxton's overwhelming win is seen as a restoration of democratic representation in the majority-Black town, finally allowing him to serve with a clear public mandate.</p>

He reflects on the overwhelming emotion of witnessing his son receive opportunities he once only dreamed of, made possible by the sacrifices of his family and the generosity of others. The experience underscores for him the profound miracle of being a present father and the hope that every child deserves such a start.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz cruised into the fourth round of the US Open with a dominant straight-set victory over Italy's Luciano Darderi. Despite playing in a morning session, which he admitted he is not used to, the Spanish star showed no signs of sluggishness, winning 6-2, 6-4, 6-0. Alcaraz briefly received treatment on his right knee during the second set but stated afterward that the issue quickly resolved and was not a cause for concern as he continues his campaign for the title.</p>

          <p>For seniors looking to tap into their home's value without giving up low mortgage rates, several refinancing alternatives are available. The article explains three primary methods: reverse mortgages, which are exclusive to homeowners 62 and older and do not require monthly repayments; home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate; and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line. Each option allows homeowners to leverage their equity while keeping their existing mortgage intact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans currently living in the United States. The court upheld a lower court's ruling, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely exceeded its authority by attempting to terminate the protections. This decision provides a significant, albeit potentially temporary, reprieve for individuals who fled crisis in their home country and have been permitted to live and work legally in the U.S.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers, Governor Gavin Newsom, and rideshare companies Uber and Lyft have struck a significant deal on legislation that will permit drivers to unionize. The compromise allows drivers to engage in collective bargaining over pay and working conditions while officially remaining independent contractors. This agreement pairs the unionization bill with another measure, backed by the companies, that will lower their insurance coverage requirements, marking a major breakthrough in the state's long-running debate over gig worker rights.</p>
