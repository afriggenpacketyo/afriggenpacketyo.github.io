          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her continued detention violated her First Amendment rights. Ozturk was detained for six weeks after the Trump administration revoked her student visa based on an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war. The judge stated that the government's only evidence against her was the op-ed and that her detention could chill the speech of millions of non-citizens. The ACLU celebrated her release, emphasizing the importance of free expression.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended the idea of raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans to provide tax cuts for lower-income earners, stating that it is "good politics." Trump dismissed comparisons to George H.W. Bush's broken "no new taxes" promise, arguing that Bush lost due to Ross Perot, not the tax issue. He acknowledged concerns that Democrats would criticize him for raising taxes but maintained that it could benefit those in lower income brackets. The article highlights the political considerations and potential impact of Trump's tax proposal.</p>
