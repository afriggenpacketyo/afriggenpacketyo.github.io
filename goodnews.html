        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Target's CEO, Brian Cornell, has cautioned about the potential for significant cost increases due to tariffs, expressing a reluctance to raise prices unless absolutely necessary. The retail giant reported a decline in sales for the most recent quarter, attributing this downturn to consumer apprehension regarding tariffs and a negative response to the company's adjustments to its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. Sales decreased by 2.8% compared to the same period last year, falling short of analysts' expectations. Cornell emphasized the challenging environment faced by the company and its commitment to supporting American families in managing their budgets.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team will be without seamer Jofra Archer for the upcoming one-day international series against the West Indies, as he recovers from a right thumb injury. Archer sustained the injury while playing for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. He will be re-evaluated in the coming weeks to determine when he can return to the field. Luke Wood, a left-arm seamer from Lancashire, has been called up to replace Archer in the ODI squad, having already been part of the T20 group.

          <p>As of May 21, 2025, the price of gold is $3,302.23 per ounce, according to American Hartford Gold. The article explains that the price of gold is influenced by various factors, including supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and as a hedge against inflation. The relationship between gold prices and interest rates is inversely proportional, with lower interest rates making gold more attractive. Given the fluctuating nature of gold's spot price, investors and enthusiasts should closely monitor these factors to make informed decisions regarding their gold investments.

          <p>Yamanashi Prefecture, which shares Mt. Fuji, is contemplating charging rescued hikers for helicopter deployments, prompted by a recent surge in off-season emergencies. This action arises from growing demands for the prefecture to tackle accidents caused by imprudent climbing. The prefecture intends to examine the feasibility of implementing this change, deliberating whether to confine the paid rescue service to the off-season and extend it to other mountains beyond Mt. Fuji. Concurrently, Yasutomo Suzuki, the governor of neighboring Shizuoka Prefecture, has appealed to the central government to explore avenues for covering the expenses of rescue operations.</p>
