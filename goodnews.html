          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-to-4 decision due to Justice Barrett's recusal, upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling, blocking the state from using public funds for St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, a religious charter school. The tie vote means the lower court's decision stands, but it sets no national precedent on the constitutionality of states sponsoring religious charter schools. The lack of a majority leaves the broader legal question unresolved, particularly concerning the First Amendment and government funding of religious institutions. The issue is expected to return to the court in the future, especially with the court's conservative leanings, and the next ruling will depend on Justice Barrett's views.</p>

          <p>David Brooks challenges the populist narrative that America's economic woes stem from neoliberal globalization, arguing this account is historically inaccurate. He contends that the era between the Clinton and Obama administrations was not a libertarian free-for-all, but rather a period of balanced dynamism and solidarity. Brooks notes that deindustrialization and wage stagnation occurred primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, before the rise of neoliberal globalism. He also argues that foreign competition's impact on American workers is often exaggerated, citing studies that show job losses from Chinese imports were largely offset by job gains due to higher exports.</p>

          <p>A new observational study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, commonly used as weight loss drugs, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. Researchers compared GLP-1 drugs to DDP-4 inhibitors, another type of diabetes medication without the same weight loss effect, in over 170,000 adults with obesity and diabetes. The study found that patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause. While the results were not statistically significant for men, women treated with GLP-1s had an 8% lower risk of obesity-related cancer and a 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality.</p>

The bill would add genetic information to the definition of personally identifiable information in the bankruptcy code, requiring consumers to affirmatively consent to the sale or lease of their genetic data after a bankruptcy case commences. It also mandates companies to provide prior written notice of the use, sale, or lease of genetic information during bankruptcy, and requires the deletion of any genetic information not subject to a sale or lease.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing "Trump accounts" for newborns, providing $1,000 to every eligible child born in the U.S. between 2025 and 2029, to be invested in the stock market. Families could contribute up to $5,000 annually, and funds could be used for prescribed costs like a down payment on a home, education, or starting a business. Withdrawals before age 18 would be restricted, and withdrawals for unapproved expenses would be subject to penalties. Experts suggest broadening approved expenditures and improving tax structures to better benefit lower-income families.</p>

          <p>With the start of June approaching, individuals burdened by debt may want to reevaluate their financial strategies and explore potential relief options. Experts recommend first re-evaluating budgets for opportunities to make extra payments and then being realistic about the ability to pay down debt independently. Exploring various debt relief types, from bankruptcy to credit counseling, is essential to determine the most applicable solution. Finally, borrowers should prepare required documentation, such as proof of financial hardship, to streamline the application process for chosen debt relief programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction against the Trump administration, preventing the termination of legal status for certain international students. The judge found that the students were likely to succeed in their challenge to the administration's actions, which the plaintiffs alleged were a part of the "Student Criminal Alien Initiative". The injunction blocks immigration authorities from arresting or jailing the plaintiffs and requires the administration to reinstate certain international students' legal status.</p>
