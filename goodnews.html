          <h2>Apple Seeks Stay in Epic Games Contempt Ruling, Citing Substantial Financial Costs</h2>

          <p>Apple is appealing a court decision finding them in contempt for violating an earlier order in the Epic Games case, arguing that compliance would cost the company substantial sums. The ruling requires Apple to allow developers to include links within their apps that direct users to external payment options, bypassing Apple's commission fees. Apple contends that developers are already exploiting this order to reduce consumer choice and damage Apple's business. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney hailed the ruling as forcing Apple to compete, while Apple claims it has complied with the original court order and will appeal the contempt ruling.</p>

          <p>Kavan Markwood, the Pittsburgh Pirates fan who fell 21 feet at PNC Park, is recovering "ahead of schedule" according to doctors and family. Markwood sustained injuries to his skull, brain, spine, ribs, and lungs, but is now off the breathing machine and out of intensive care. Doctors believe cognitive rehab will be critical, but he can talk, walk, and perform simple tasks, though pain is still evident. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is investigating the fall, and the Pirates say Markwood showed no signs of intoxication at the time of the fall.</p>
