          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of the 2025 Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish on stage 17 from Bollene to Valence. The final kilometers were marked by heavy rain and a crash that involved key sprinters Tim Merlier and Biniam Girmay. Milan's win further solidified his lead in the points classification, extending his advantage for the green jersey.

          <p>The New York Giants have officially named veteran quarterback Russell Wilson as their starter ahead of training camp, according to head coach Brian Daboll. Wilson, signed in the offseason, won the position over free-agent acquisition Jameis Winston and first-round draft pick Jaxson Dart. The move is part of the team's effort to overhaul its quarterback position following a difficult previous season. While Wilson is set to begin the season under center, the team's management noted that the situation remains competitive, with Dart representing the future of the franchise.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which reportedly includes lowering U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports to 15% and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the United States. President Trump described the deal as "massive," stating it would open Japan's markets to U.S. goods like cars, trucks, and agricultural products. Following the announcement, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the reduced auto tariff.

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that countries can be sued for their contributions to climate change, including historical greenhouse gas emissions. The non-binding decision is seen as a major victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly the Pacific island states that initiated the case. The court stated that countries have legal obligations under international law to protect the climate system and must pursue the most ambitious possible emission reduction plans. Legal experts believe this ruling could pave the way for future compensation claims against historically high-emitting nations.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet has approved a new law designed to significantly speed up the procurement of weapons and equipment for its military, the Bundeswehr. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius described the move as a "quantum leap" for national security, citing Russia as the most immediate threat to peace in Europe. The legislation aims to cut bureaucratic red tape by raising the value limits for direct contracts, allowing for faster purchasing without lengthy tender processes. The move is part of Germany's broader effort to bolster its defense capabilities and meet its NATO spending commitments.</p>

          <p>This article explains the financial implications of making only the minimum payment on a credit card balance, a common practice amid rising inflation. It breaks down the different formulas issuers use to calculate minimums, such as a flat percentage or a percentage plus interest, showing that a $2,000 balance could have a minimum payment between $40 and $60. Experts warn that this approach is costly due to compounding interest and significantly extends the repayment period. The article advises paying more than the minimum and outlines alternatives like balance transfers or debt consolidation for those struggling with debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uber is introducing a new feature in the U.S. that allows women drivers and riders to state a preference for being matched with one another. The tool, which will be piloted in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, is designed to give women more control and comfort while using the ride-hailing service. While a match is not guaranteed, the feature increases the likelihood of women being paired together. This initiative is an expansion of a similar program Uber has operated in other countries and represents the company's latest effort to address long-standing safety concerns on its platform.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a Marks & Spencer advertisement, ruling that the model featured appeared "unhealthily thin" and the ad was therefore "irresponsible." The watchdog cited the model's pose and clothing, including large pointed shoes that emphasized her slenderness, as contributing factors. The ASA ordered that the ad must not appear again in its current form and that M&S must ensure future imagery does not portray unhealthy body images. M&S stated it had stopped using the image but defended its commitment to inclusive and responsible promotion.</p>

          <p>This article offers advice for homeowners who are struggling to qualify for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) amid rising interest rates and tighter lending standards. Experts suggest that the primary reasons for denial often include high debt-to-income ratios, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score. To improve approval odds, they recommend asking the lender for the specific reason for denial, working to boost one's credit score, and reducing overall debt. The article also explores alternative financing options, such as home equity loans, cash-out refinances, or personal loans, for those who cannot secure a HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, two former traders jailed in the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal, have had their convictions quashed by the UK Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled that errors in the jury directions during their original trials made the convictions "unsafe." The men had long argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office, which brought the case, announced it would not seek a retrial, potentially opening the door for other convicted traders to appeal.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence tool named Aeneas that can help historians analyze ancient Roman inscriptions by filling in missing text, suggesting a date, and identifying the geographical origin. The system works by drawing on a massive database of 176,000 known inscriptions to find relevant parallels, a process that would take a human scholar years. While AI is not a replacement for human expertise, tests showed that historians working in conjunction with Aeneas produced more accurate results than either could alone. The technology is being hailed as potentially "transformative" for accelerating the study of ancient history.</p>
