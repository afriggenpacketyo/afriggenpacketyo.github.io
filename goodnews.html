        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Tech's highly anticipated running back, Quinten Joyner, will be sidelined for the entire 2025 football season after suffering a non-contact torn ACL injury during a recent team scrimmage. Joyner, who transferred from USC, was slated to carry a significant portion of the offensive load for the No. 23-ranked Red Raiders, impacting their preseason expectations. Head coach Joey McGuire expressed deep regret for the player, acknowledging his professional approach and rapid adaptation to the team's system. This unfortunate setback necessitates other running backs to step up, forcing the team to adopt a "next-man-up" mentality as they prepare for the season.</p>

          <p>European soccer's top leagues have become a massive business, generating €20.4 billion in revenue during the 2023-2024 season, which has attracted significant American investment. U.S. investors now hold stakes in a majority of England's Premier League clubs, including four of the traditional "Big Six," driven by substantial revenue growth and the limited availability of high-value U.S. sports teams. This has led to soaring club valuations, exemplified by Manchester United's £5 billion valuation. However, the increasing prevalence of multi-club ownership models, favored by private equity, is drawing scrutiny and potential regulatory crackdowns from bodies like UEFA, posing future challenges for this investment trend.</p>

          <p>The Chinese 2D animated film "Nobody" has achieved an unexpected box office milestone, becoming the highest-grossing 2D animated movie in Chinese history, surpassing previous Japanese animated hits like "Suzume." This success signifies a notable shift in the Chinese animation market, previously dominated by Japanese productions. "Nobody," based on the 2023 online series "Chinese Bizarreries," has earned over 1 billion yuan by incorporating a unique ink-wash painting style, creating a distinctive Chinese aesthetic. The film's supervisor, Chen Liaoyu, emphasized its innovative use of ink to construct shots, highlighting the challenging details involved in its artistic execution and contributing to its widespread appeal.</p>

          <p>The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), representing 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants, announced a tentative agreement, ending a four-day strike that had severely disrupted summer travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily. The strike, which was declared illegal by the Canada Industrial Relations Board, saw union leaders initially defy return-to-work orders, emphasizing their resolve for fair compensation. Flight attendants had pushed back against the airline's 38% total compensation offer over four years, citing inflation and unpaid work during ground operations. The breakthrough in negotiations, assisted by a mediator, signifies a resolution to the contentious labor dispute and aims to address the flight attendants' core demands.</p>

The home improvement retailer reported a slight dip in net income despite a 5% rise in revenue, reflecting a "deferral mindset" among homeowners. Despite a sluggish real estate market and high borrowing costs, the company saw encouraging signs, including a rise in big-ticket transactions and improved sales trends throughout the quarter. Home Depot continues to expand its professional customer base through strategic acquisitions like SRS Distribution and GMS, aiming to diversify beyond DIY customers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Belgian cities, particularly Mechelen and the Flanders region, are actively implementing innovative natural solutions to combat the escalating challenges of extreme weather, including intense rainfall and prolonged droughts. The region's traditional infrastructure struggles to manage water, prompting a shift towards restoring natural wetlands and depoldering efforts to give rivers more space. These strategic interventions, part of plans like the Sigma Plan, aim to create controlled flood zones that efficiently store excess water during heavy rains and gradually release it during dry periods. Such initiatives not only mitigate flood risks and conserve water but also foster community engagement and enhance local ecosystems, offering a sustainable model for climate adaptation.</p>
