          <p>Amid economic uncertainty stemming from fluctuating trade policies, top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending several dividend-paying stocks as a source of stable income. This article highlights three such companies: energy giant Chevron (CVX), asset manager Rithm Capital (RITM), and telecommunications leader AT&T (T). Analysts from firms like Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital provide their reasoning, pointing to factors like strong quarterly performance, strategic acquisitions, and robust free cash flow. These stocks are presented as potential options for investors looking to bolster their portfolios with consistent dividend payments during a volatile period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence sector is generating wealth and creating new billionaires at a historic pace, surpassing previous tech booms. Startups like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Anysphere have achieved massive valuations through blockbuster fundraising, creating immense paper fortunes for their founders and early investors. This wealth creation is heavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, leading to a resurgence in its economy and real estate market. While much of this wealth is currently illiquid in private companies, the growth of secondary markets and future public offerings present a massive opportunity for the wealth management industry.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nineteen U.S. states are offering sales tax holidays in 2025, providing shoppers temporary relief from state and sometimes local taxes on specific items like school supplies and clothing. While politically popular, tax experts note that these events may not boost the economy as much as claimed, as consumers often just shift the timing of planned purchases. However, these holidays can provide meaningful savings for middle- and lower-income families, especially for significant expenses like back-to-school shopping. Financial advisors suggest that shoppers can maximize their savings by combining the tax holiday with store promotions, rewards credit cards, and online shopping portals for even greater discounts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of negativity bias, suggesting that both media outlets and human psychology are hardwired to focus on threats and problems, often obscuring genuine progress. It argues that beyond the constant stream of negative headlines, a quieter story of improvement is unfolding. As examples, the article points to the U.S. murder rate potentially reaching historic lows and the fact that fewer people globally died from extreme weather in the first half of 2025 than in any comparable period on record. The author posits that embracing realistic optimism is essential for fostering resilience and inspiring action to solve the world's major challenges.</p>

          <p>Scientists have determined that a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.5 billion years old, making it more ancient than our own planet. Researchers from the University of Georgia analyzed fragments of the object and identified it as a chondrite, the most common type of stony meteorite. The meteorite's dramatic entry into the atmosphere in June was witnessed across several states, accompanied by a loud boom. The discovery marks the 27th meteorite recovered in Georgia, and scientists hope to use the data to better understand the composition of asteroids and potential future threats.</p>

A new exhibition, "Libertad," will use technology and personal testimonies to tell the story of the Cuban exile experience. The article highlights the emotional return of Jorge Malagón Márquez, who first entered the tower as a traumatized five-year-old in 1967. The restored building, now owned by Miami-Dade College, aims to preserve the history of those who fled Castro's regime and to educate new generations about their search for freedom and the challenges they faced building new lives.</p>

          <h2>Trump's 'No Tax on Tips' Proposal Sparks Confusion and Questions Among Workers</h2>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new tax bill, marketed as "no tax on tips," is causing confusion among service industry workers who are unclear on its actual benefits. The measure provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income, which reduces taxable income but does not eliminate taxes entirely, as state and payroll taxes still apply. Key details remain ambiguous, including which specific occupations qualify and how different types of gratuities, like automatic service charges, will be treated. As tipping averages decline amid consumer fatigue, some workers feel the tax break is being misperceived and may not be as generous as it sounds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new book, "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley shares her personal journey with an eating disorder, advocating for a more realistic approach to recovery. She argues that the concept of a "full recovery" can be an unattainable and perfectionistic goal that leads to shame and secrecy during setbacks. Instead, she explores living in the "middle place" between acute illness and complete wellness, where slips are acknowledged and managed without derailing progress. This mindset shift, from an all-or-nothing approach to one of acceptance and forward momentum, has allowed her to build a full life while still navigating the challenges of her disorder.</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of wanting to reduce animal suffering while facing health issues that make a strict vegetarian or vegan diet difficult. It suggests a pragmatic, "reducetarian" approach, which focuses on minimizing harm rather than adhering to an absolute moral rule. The article recommends several strategies, such as choosing pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products and preferring larger animals like cows over chickens to reduce the number of lives impacted. It also advises consumers to be wary of misleading welfare labels on food packaging, offering a balanced perspective for those trying to align their diet with their values.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece advocates for the development of a permanent, nuclear-powered human settlement on the Moon, framing it as a vital and wondrous achievement for space exploration. The author notes that NASA's interim head has directed the agency to place a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the lunar surface by the end of the decade, a necessary step for a sustainable base. The push is partly motivated by geopolitical competition, as China and Russia are collaborating on their own, more powerful lunar reactor. A moon base is presented as a more accessible and democratic goal than Mars, potentially serving as a global commons for scientific research.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of a "Day Zero" water crisis due to climate change diminishing traditional water sources, Southern California is planning major investments to ensure future supply. Water agencies are pursuing a diversified strategy that includes building a massive wastewater recycling facility, enhancing stormwater capture, and potentially desalination. These efforts aim to create a more resilient, local water supply for the 19 million people in the region, reducing reliance on increasingly unreliable imported water from the Colorado River and Northern California. The challenge lies in implementing these costly projects while keeping water affordable for the public.</p>

          <p>Cities like Los Angeles are exploring the "sponge city" model, an urban design philosophy that mitigates flooding by making surfaces more absorbent rather than flushing water away. This article highlights a successful project in Bangkok, where an old factory site was converted into a park with wetlands that capture and clean millions of gallons of stormwater. This nature-based approach contrasts with traditional "gray" infrastructure like concrete channels, offering benefits like replenishing groundwater and creating recreational green spaces. While L.A. has programs to fund such projects, progress is slow due to bureaucratic hurdles and high costs, presenting challenges to large-scale implementation.</p>
