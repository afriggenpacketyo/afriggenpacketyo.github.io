          <p>Independent UK Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe publicly misidentified a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post, prompting him to alert authorities. After HM Coastguard confirmed the crew was rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research, Lowe issued an apology. He subsequently pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause, while reiterating his strong stance on deporting undocumented immigrants. The rowers, one of whom is a former Royal Marine, reportedly found the incident "hilarious."</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he will host a peace summit at the White House for Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. The two nations have been in conflict for decades over the disputed Karabakh region, which recently saw an exodus of over 100,000 ethnic Armenians following an Azerbaijani offensive. Trump stated on social media that the meeting would be an "official Peace Signing Ceremony," crediting his administration's engagement for the breakthrough.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This cultural commentary reflects on the widespread popularity of male singers named Bobby during the 1960s, a phenomenon rooted in "Robert" being a top baby name in previous decades. The author humorously recalls a childhood where songs like "Bobby's Girl" and "Run Bobby Run" seemed ubiquitous. The piece lists numerous chart-topping artists of the era, including Bobby Vee, Bobby Vinton, and Bobby Rydell, who became teen idols. The author notes that this trend faded by the 1970s, as musical tastes evolved and he personally transitioned to listening to artists like Bob Dylan.</p>

          <p>A 75-year-old man in Southern California is facing a bizarre mystery after his 1958 Cessna Skyhawk was stolen from an airport, only to be found at another airfield days later. After he removed the battery to disable it, the plane was stolen again and discovered at a third airport with a new battery installed. Flight tracking data revealed the unknown pilot took the aircraft on several joyrides, suggesting they are a trained aviator familiar with the plane's mechanics. Police have no leads, and the owner is left confused as to why someone would steal his plane only to maintain and return it.</p>

His ideal day begins with meditation and a workout, followed by a search for the city's best sandwiches at spots like Mamie or Bodega Park. In the afternoon, he enjoys boba tea at a park, a cherished ritual he once shared with his late dog. The day concludes with an early dinner with friends at a favorite Filipino restaurant, Lasita, which reminds him of home, before winding down with a game of "Mario Kart."</p>

          <p>In a podcast interview, George Friedman, founder of Geopolitical Futures, analyzes the current state of global affairs and U.S. foreign policy through a realist lens. Friedman argues that President Trump's actions represent a deconstruction of the post-WWII international system, which he sees as an obsolete 80-year cycle. He views the current political turmoil as a normal, albeit chaotic, "storm before the calm" that precedes a reinvention of America's role in the world. Friedman also discusses the wars in Ukraine and the unlikelihood of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, asserting that America's internal crises often lead to periods of regeneration and stability.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) has arrested a 22-year-old Iranian man in Birmingham on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration. The arrest is a direct result of a BBC investigation that used undercover reporters and fake identities to expose a violent people-smuggling gang operating in France and the UK. The BBC's work began after witnessing an incident in which five people, including a seven-year-old girl, were trampled to death during a chaotic boat launch. The NCA stated the suspect is believed to be part of an organized crime group and that their investigation is ongoing.</p>

Countries like Japan, South Korea, and Australia are setting ambitious targets to attract this talent pool, while European universities, facing financial pressures and demographic shifts, are also ramping up recruitment efforts. The article notes that while Europe has historically been a popular destination, students from countries like Vietnam and Malaysia are increasingly choosing to study closer to home due to improving educational quality in Asia. The current restrictive academic climate in the U.S. may also create an opportunity for other nations.</p>

          <p>For the first time, the U.S. Track and Field Championships fully integrated Paralympic events, showcasing disabled athletes on the sport's biggest national stage. While a symbolic victory for equity, the article questions whether the U.S. is investing enough to ensure competitive success when the Paralympics come to Los Angeles in 2028. Athletes and advocates point to a history of second-rate venues and lagging financial support compared to their Olympic counterparts. To compete with dominant nations like China, they argue the U.S. must build a stronger development pipeline to bridge the gap between junior and elite international competition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to accelerate its plans to deploy a nuclear fission reactor on the moon by 2030 to power a future human base. Officials state that nuclear energy is essential for a long-term lunar presence, as solar power is insufficient during the two-week lunar night. The plan is also driven by a desire to lead in space exploration as China and Russia pursue similar goals. While a lunar reactor would operate similarly to those on Earth, some scientists express concern over the ambitious timeline and high costs, estimated at around $3 billion over five years.</p>

          <p>South Korea has launched a major national project, involving corporate giants like SK Telecom and LG, to develop its own foundational artificial intelligence model. The initiative aims to create a self-sufficient AI industry, leveraging the country's strengths in semiconductors, software, and research to compete with the U.S. and China. This push is driven by the concept of "AI sovereignty," the idea that nations should control their own critical digital infrastructure to avoid reliance on foreign entities. The first open-source model from the project is expected by the end of the year, positioning South Korea as a key player in the global AI landscape.</p>
