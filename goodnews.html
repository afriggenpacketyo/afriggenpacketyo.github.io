          <p>Second lady Usha Vance has commended first lady Melania Trump for a "peace letter" she sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling her a "trailblazer" and a "role model." In the letter, Mrs. Trump urged the Russian leader to protect children and future generations, stating he could "singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter." Vance expressed her admiration for the first lady's focus on children's welfare during an event for her own Summer Reading Challenge program. The letter was reportedly hand-delivered ahead of a U.S.-Russia summit.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the massive monetary penalty, exceeding $500 million, imposed on former President Donald Trump and his company in a civil business fraud case. The court ruled that the fine violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against "excessive fines." However, the ruling upheld the original judge's finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by inflating asset values to secure better financial terms. The nonmonetary sanctions, designed to curb the company's business practices, were also upheld.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Nearly Half of U.S. Adults Order Kids' Meals to Save Money and Reduce Portions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 15:22:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates a growing trend where nearly half of American adults are opting to order from restaurant kids' menus. The primary motivations cited for this behavior are saving money and preferring smaller portion sizes amid rising food costs. According to a survey by Lightspeed Commerce, 44% of adults have ordered children's meals, which are typically cheaper and simpler than standard adult menu items. This consumer shift comes as some restaurant chains report slowing sales, suggesting heightened economic pressure on diners.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by AI and cloud computing, is creating a significant demand for skilled trade workers like electricians and HVAC technicians. However, the supply of these workers is shrinking as older generations retire and fewer young people enter the trades, leading to an estimated 400,000 unfilled positions in the U.S. This labor shortage poses a threat to the operational capacity of data centers and other industries competing for the same talent. Some solutions being explored include aggressive union recruitment and new technology to improve efficiency.</p>

          <p>The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) has officially broken its single-season attendance record, drawing more than 2.5 million fans to games so far in 2025. The league announced that this new milestone was achieved in fewer games and with fewer teams than the previous record set in 2002, highlighting significant growth in the sport's popularity. This achievement comes as the WNBA plans a major expansion, aiming to increase from 15 teams to 18 by 2030, driven by surging public demand and investment in women's professional basketball.</p>

          <p>Fujifilm's new biologics manufacturing plant in North Carolina illustrates the significant time and investment required for pharmaceutical companies to increase U.S.-based production. The facility, which took five years and over $3 billion to build, is opening as the Trump administration threatens tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing. The article notes that the complexity of building and getting regulatory approval for such plants makes it difficult for the industry to quickly pivot its supply chains. Despite the challenges, many drugmakers are expanding U.S. operations, driven by tax policy changes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of existing homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to the previous month, defying analyst expectations of a decline. According to the National Association of Realtors, the increase was likely driven by a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when the sales contracts were signed. Housing inventory also grew, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw only a slight 0.2% year-over-year increase, suggesting the market may be at an inflection point. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is being used by wealthy investors to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets held in taxable accounts. The process involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a new or existing exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it is launched to the public. This allows the investor to postpone the tax liability that would normally be triggered by selling the original assets. While the strategy can be effective, it is subject to strict diversification rules and can limit an investor's future flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic shift, senior officials from Syria and Israel have held direct, face-to-face talks in a US-brokered summit in Paris. The discussions focused on de-escalating tensions, reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement, and providing humanitarian aid to Syria's Druze minority. These are the first such high-level talks in 25 years, occurring after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime and a period of increased Israeli military strikes in Syria. While normalization is a long-term goal, the immediate focus is on establishing security along their shared border.</p>
