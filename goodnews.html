          <p>China is shifting from direct government loans to Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models to finance infrastructure projects in Africa. This involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing. The shift is evident in projects like Nairobi‚Äôs mega-highway, the stalled railway, and Zambia‚Äôs Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway. This approach allows Chinese contractors to recoup their investments through toll fees and operating rights over extended periods, addressing African governments' debt concerns.</p>

These efforts reflect a broader trend in Europe to increase military spending and modernize armed forces in response to growing security concerns and geopolitical instability, especially after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
