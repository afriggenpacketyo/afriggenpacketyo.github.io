          <p>George, a cat recovering from being neutered at an animal hospital in Lakeland, Florida, escaped from his crate and scaled a fence. Despite employees' efforts, George made his way back home, a journey of three miles through several subdivisions and around lakes. Cat behavioral specialists suggest that cats have evolved to find their way home using a combination of scent, visual markers, and possibly geomagnetism. George's owner expressed relief and emphasized the importance of human touch for the beloved pet, while joking about George's resourcefulness.</p>

          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove stated that another Scottish independence referendum could occur if there is overwhelming public support for it, echoing similar sentiments from SNP leader John Swinney. Gove, who oversaw relations between the UK and Scottish governments, cautioned against complacency among supporters of the union, emphasizing the need to continually demonstrate that the UK is working. While Gove believes that the likelihood of a second independence vote depends on the SNP's ability to improve public services, Swinney maintains that it is unacceptable for Westminster to thwart the independence movement.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents, have garnered a new wave of support due to shifting public opinion influenced by pop culture and a greater understanding of trauma and sexual abuse. Once vilified, the brothers' claims of sexual abuse are now being re-examined, potentially offering them a chance at parole. A judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, and their fate now rests with the California Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom. The case reflects a broader shift in societal views on criminal justice, rehabilitation, and the treatment of abuse survivors.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and individuals over 12 with high-risk medical conditions. This decision limits access to the vaccine for healthy individuals under 65 and requires the company to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects, which could cost tens of millions of dollars. Experts express concerns that these restrictions, influenced by skepticism about vaccines, may hinder vaccine availability and public confidence, while the FDA maintains that the safety of the vaccine must be clear.</p>

          <p>A Shropshire photographer, Andrew Fusek Peters, has spent a decade capturing the beauty and diversity of back garden wildlife in Britain. His images, taken primarily in his own garden and local village, aim to celebrate everyday stories and reveal the beauty of birds, mammals, and insects living alongside humans. Despite facing skepticism from some photographers, Fusek Peters has captured rare images, such as a hare feeding her leveret on a lawn, and perfected techniques to photograph birds in mid-flight. His work serves as a rallying cry to transform manicured spaces into wildlife-friendly havens.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's last operating nuclear power reactor was shut down on Saturday, marking the end of four decades of nuclear power generation on the island. This move aligns with the government's policy to phase out atomic energy, although the feasibility of achieving this goal remains uncertain. The No. 2 reactor at the Maanshan power plant in southern Pingtung County ceased operations as Taiwan aims to transition away from nuclear power following the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan.</p>

The summit is expected to yield a joint declaration on shared foreign policy priorities, a security and defense pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. However, the extent of the economic reset remains limited by the UK's red lines against rejoining the customs union or single market.</p>
