          <p>Despite signs of a cooling labor market and slowing economic activity, Wall Street strategists are increasingly optimistic about the stock market's prospects. Several strategists have defended their S&P 500 year-end targets, citing the potential easing of tariff concerns. Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson suggests that a moderate slowdown in growth is already priced into the market. Goldman Sachs' equity research team notes that soft economic data is recovering, which typically precedes a rise in the S&P 500, even if hard data weakens. (not investment advice) </p>
