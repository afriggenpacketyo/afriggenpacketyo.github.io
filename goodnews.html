          <p>Ten Americans held in Venezuela have been freed and are returning to the U.S. following a complex prisoner swap involving Venezuela and El Salvador. The deal saw El Salvador repatriate 252 Venezuelan nationals, who had been deported from the U.S. and detained in a Salvadoran prison, in exchange for the release of the Americans and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners. U.S. officials described the negotiations as tense and "down-to-the-wire," but stated the agreement was humanitarian in nature and did not involve discussions about sanctions relief for Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent trip to China, which included talks with Premier Li Qiang and a CEO roundtable, demonstrates Canberra's strategy of navigating its complex international relationships. Analysts suggest Australia is attempting to maintain its crucial economic ties with China while simultaneously managing its security alliance with the United States. This balancing act is seen as a pragmatic approach in a region where making a binary choice between the two superpowers is considered unrealistic for many nations.</p>

          <p>Shares of fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged more than 10% in extended trading after it was announced that it will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron, with the change taking effect before trading opens on July 23. Stocks often experience a rally upon being added to a major index, as index funds must purchase the shares to rebalance their portfolios. The inclusion reflects Block's significant market capitalization of about $45 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has formally requested that a federal judge unseal grand jury transcripts related to the case against deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The move follows a directive from President Trump and comes after public backlash to a recent DOJ memo that concluded its review of the case. In its court filings, the department argued that releasing the material is justified by significant public interest and the administration's commitment to transparency. The final decision rests with the judges overseeing the cases in New York and Florida.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has updated its internal practices to prevent engineers located in China from providing technical support for its U.S. defense and government cloud clients. The change is a direct response to security concerns raised in a ProPublica report about the potential cybersecurity risks of such arrangements. The company's Azure cloud division has significant government contracts, and the new policy aims to ensure that no China-based teams offer technical assistance for the Department of Defense's cloud services.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is in ongoing negotiations with the United States to avoid a potential 32% tariff on its exports, a measure announced by the Trump administration in April. The U.S. had paused the tariffs for 90 days to allow for discussions with major trading partners, including the key semiconductor-producing island. Analysts believe the lack of a final decision indicates that both sides are actively working towards a deal to keep any new tariffs at a manageable level, given Taiwan's critical role in the U.S. tech supply chain.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans support U.S. efforts to return to the moon and eventually send astronauts to Mars. Approximately two-thirds of the public favor these space exploration goals, with younger Americans showing particularly strong enthusiasm. The survey also found that the 1969 moon landing is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. These positive views on space exploration generally transcend partisan and ideological divides.</p>

          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor experienced a massive 189% surge this week, driven largely by social media posts from hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, whose firm EMJ Capital took a new position in the stock, publicly speculated that it could be a "100-bagger," leading to a retail investor frenzy. The dramatic rally comes after the company's stock had fallen to under $1, prompting a proposal for a reverse split to maintain its Nasdaq listing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a background on the Druze, a religious sect with origins tracing back about 1,000 years as an offshoot of Ismaili Shiite Islam. Most of the world's one million Druze reside in Syria, with significant communities also in Lebanon and Israel. Their religious practices are largely secret, and a core social principle is the mutual defense of their community members. In Syria, the Druze have historically navigated a path of survival and have recently been involved in violence, leading to skepticism about the country's new leadership.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler has taken the lead at the 153rd Open Championship after shooting a 6-under-par 64 in the second round, the lowest score of the tournament so far. His performance puts him at 10-under par, one stroke ahead of England's Matt Fitzpatrick. Despite previously downplaying the significance of winning, Scheffler's dominant play has created an air of inevitability around his pursuit of the Claret Jug.
