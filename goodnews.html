          <p>Danish club FC Midtjylland has gained a significant edge in European football through its pioneering and meticulous focus on set-pieces, a strategy implemented since 2014. The club tracks its dead ball goal difference prominently, having consistently scored at least 10 more goals from set-pieces than conceded in their championship-winning seasons. This innovative approach has led to the development of numerous set-piece specialists who are now sought after by top clubs across Europe. As they prepare to face Nottingham Forest in the Europa League, Midtjylland's methodical training and recruitment emphasize this often-underestimated aspect of the game. The article highlights how their unique methodology prioritizes replicable routines over elaborate tricks, fostering a club-wide culture of set-piece excellence.</p>

          <p>James Slipper, Australia's most capped rugby player, will retire from international duty following the Wallabies' upcoming Test against New Zealand, marking the end of a remarkable 16-year career. The 36-year-old prop recently made history by becoming the first player to reach 150 Tests for Australia, having represented his country in four World Cups and captained the team 15 times. Slipper expressed immense pride in his career, calling representing the Wallabies the "single proudest achievement" of his rugby journey and a dream lived since childhood. His departure leaves a significant legacy, with the article celebrating his dedication and consistent contribution to Australian rugby over many years.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca's decision to list American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on Wall Street is seen as a strategic move to attract a broader global investor base and access larger capital pools in New York. While the company insists its UK listing, headquarters, and tax residency will remain unchanged, this development contributes to ongoing concerns about a trend of major companies, including former FTSE 100 members, shifting primary listings away from London. The article details several high-profile defections from the London Stock Exchange in recent years, driven by factors like cost savings, market access, and a focus on North American sales. Critics suggest the UK government should address these issues, possibly by removing the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax, to enhance London's competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England has implemented a ban on price and multi-buy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free" deals, for unhealthy food and drink in supermarkets and large high street shops. This measure, delayed due to the cost-of-living crisis, is a key step in the government's comprehensive strategy to combat rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Public health experts widely welcome the move, arguing that such promotions encourage overspending and normalize unhealthy purchasing habits, disproportionately affecting deprived areas. Evidence from a previous ban on unhealthy product placement at checkouts suggests that these restrictions can lead to a significant reduction in sales of less healthy items, supporting the new policy's potential impact.</p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its offshore energy infrastructure, with its total subsea pipeline network now exceeding 10,000 kilometers, accelerating efforts to secure energy resources. This major milestone was reached with the installation of a deep-sea pipeline section in Bohai Bay, which now hosts the country's densest underwater oil and gas network, spanning over 3,200 kilometers. The national subsea pipeline length is projected to surpass 13,000 kilometers by 2030, further strengthening China's energy transport capabilities and ensuring long-term supply. These pipelines are also designed with the capacity to accommodate green fuels like hydrogen and shale gas, offering greater flexibility for a more diversified and cleaner energy mix in the future.</p>

          <p>As of today, all GP practices in England are required to offer online appointment bookings from 8:00 to 18:30, Monday to Friday. This government-mandated initiative aims to alleviate the "8am scramble" for phone appointments and enhance patient access to non-urgent services, symptom descriptions, and call-back requests. Despite concerns from the British Medical Association about potential missed serious health problems, ministers are proceeding, citing sufficient financial support for implementation. This move is part of a broader digital transformation of the NHS, intended to free up phone lines for urgent cases and reduce pressure on A&E units, improving overall patient experience.</p>

This shift challenges decades of conventional wisdom emphasizing college degrees, as tuition costs rise and unemployment for recent college graduates ticks up.
