          <p>Dallas Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty during a preseason game despite not playing. While standing on the sideline in street clothes, a sprinting official, who was watching the play, collided with Lamb from behind. Lamb was knocked down but appeared uninjured, laughing about the incident afterward. The penalty was assessed against the Cowboys for making contact with an official during the game.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Rams' 31-21 preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys, several key players made a strong impression. Rookie running back Blake Corum demonstrated his readiness for a larger role, rushing for 32 yards and two touchdowns, suggesting he could help lighten the workload for starter Kyren Williams. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also had a solid performance, completing 16 of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, reinforcing his confident showing during training camp.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 'quiet luxury' trend of understated, logo-free high fashion is giving way to a resurgence of 'loud luxury,' characterized by bold branding and distinctive designs. Major fashion houses like Gucci, Burberry, and Versace are shifting their creative direction to inject novelty and reignite consumer interest amid slowing sales. This sartorial shake-up aims to attract weary shoppers and reverse the fortunes of brands that struggled while more discrete, ultra-luxe labels thrived. Analysts see this as a potential turning point for the industry, moving away from subtlety to more visible and statement-making styles. (not investment advice)</p>

The mission, involving NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov, was significant for relieving a previous crew that had been stranded on the International Space Station. This marked NASA's first Pacific splashdown in 50 years. The crew spent 146 days in space, orbiting the Earth over 2,300 times and contributing to ongoing international cooperation in space exploration.</p>

Brands like Trip, which recently had an ad banned for making unproven health claims, formulate their drinks with supplements like Lion's Mane and L-theanine. However, dietitians question whether the small amounts of these ingredients can produce the advertised effects, noting that research is still in its infancy. A psychologist suggests that the feeling of calm may come from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself rather than the drink's contents, highlighting a debate over marketing versus scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>Singer Ed Sheeran's recent description of himself as 'culturally Irish' has ignited a debate about identity, heritage, and belonging in 2025. Despite being born and raised in England, Sheeran cited his Irish grandparents, passport, and formative musical experiences in Ireland as the basis for his connection. The discussion reflects a complex, evolving understanding of what it means to be Irish, particularly for the diaspora and in post-Good Friday Agreement Northern Ireland. Experts note that identity is increasingly seen as more fluid than just citizenship, encompassing cultural affinity, personal history, and blended traditions.</p>

          <p>The new adaptation of 'War of the Worlds' starring Ice Cube has been widely panned by critics, earning a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes upon its release. This critical reception has sparked a familiar online conversation about the unique appeal of 'so bad they're good' films. Some moviegoers are drawn to universally disliked films out of curiosity, finding them more interesting and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. The phenomenon highlights how movies that fail spectacularly can build cult followings, offering an unintentionally entertaining experience for audiences who enjoy their flaws.</p>

          <p>Apple shares experienced their largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's visit to the White House, where President Donald Trump announced the company would be exempt from future tariffs on imported chips due to its commitment to investing in American manufacturing. This news assuaged investor fears that tariffs could significantly harm Apple's profitability. The positive momentum was also supported by a strong quarterly earnings report from the company two weeks prior. (not investment advice)</p>
