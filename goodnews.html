Ellie Kildunne, the reigning World Player of the Year, was instrumental with two tries and two assists, showcasing her dazzling skills and confirming her status as a tournament highlight. While the team celebrated its 28th consecutive victory and a strong start, head coach John Mitchell highlighted areas needing refinement, such as midfield passing and defensive intensity, preparing for more challenging opponents ahead. This impressive performance signals England's formidable presence and ambition in the ongoing tournament, setting a high bar for their rivals.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists and divers have successfully retrieved ancient artifacts, including a sphinx statue and Roman coins, from the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Abu Qir Bay near Alexandria, Egypt. These historic treasures date back over 2,000 years to a sunken city, believed to be an extension of ancient Canopus, which thrived during the Ptolemaic dynasty and Roman Empire. The consistent damage to the statues, notably missing heads and feet, is attributed by experts to a major natural disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami, indicating the city's sudden demise. This significant discovery not only enriches understanding of Alexandria's deep historical past but also underscores the ongoing challenges the modern city faces from rising sea levels.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to unveil its first consumer-ready smart glasses with a display, codenamed Hypernova, and an accompanying wristband controller at its annual Connect conference next month. The Hypernova glasses will feature a small digital display in the right lens, primarily for simple information like text messages, and are expected to cost around $800, sold in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The wristband, utilizing CTRL Labs technology, will allow gesture-based control, serving as a key input component for future full AR glasses. While Meta has low sales expectations for Hypernova due to its increased weight and thickness, this launch marks a significant step in the company's ambitious push into augmented reality wearables.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly finalizing new three-year media rights deals with NBC, Netflix, and ESPN, strategically aligning all major rights to expire after the 2028 season. Under the proposed terms, NBC is set to acquire all Sunday night games and wild-card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix will secure the rights to the popular Home Run Derby for about $50 million per year. ESPN will gain a brand-new package worth $550 million, encompassing MLB TV, in-market games for five local teams, and a new midweek national game package. These agreements are seen as beneficial for MLB, fostering new partnerships and potentially enhancing both monetary returns and broader audience reach in a shifting media landscape.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) achieved its first new record high since 2021, surging significantly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's annual address at Jackson Hole hinted at potential interest rate cuts. Powell's comments, suggesting that policy adjustments may be warranted, triggered a substantial "short squeeze" in the crypto market, with approximately $120 million in ETH short liquidations occurring within a single hour. This market reaction indicates a rapid repositioning towards easing monetary policy, bringing renewed momentum to risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Companies focused on accumulating ether also experienced notable gains, signaling a surge in institutional interest in the Ethereum blockchain, largely driven by the increasing prominence of stablecoins.

          <p>Alphabet shares surged over 3% on reports that Apple is in early discussions to integrate Google's Gemini AI models into an updated version of its Siri assistant, potentially launching as early as next year. Apple reportedly inquired about Google building a custom artificial intelligence model, especially as Apple has struggled to define its own AI strategy while Gemini consistently leads in key benchmarks. These high-stakes talks are particularly significant as Google faces a potential U.S. judge's ruling on its alleged search monopoly, which could directly impact its lucrative search deals with Apple. A potential collaboration could dramatically enhance Siri's capabilities, allowing it to perform advanced functions like summarizing videos, leveraging Gemini's robust multimodal strengths.</p>

          <p>House Democrats have introduced a new bill aiming to establish precise legal thresholds for advanced chips that would necessitate congressional approval before being exported to China. The proposed legislation defines specific performance benchmarks for chips, including total processing performance, memory speeds, and interconnect speeds, that would trigger a mandatory review process. Representative Krishnamoorthi stated the bill seeks to end China's unfettered access to cutting-edge chips, which he argues fuel its military modernization, surveillance, and influence campaigns. This measure faces significant legislative hurdles to become law, requiring bipartisan support in both the Republican-led House and Senate, underscoring persistent national security concerns and the complex debate over technology control.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. government has acquired a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, a deal finalized after a meeting with CEO Lip Bu Tan following Trump's earlier call for Tan's resignation over alleged ties to China. This $8.9 billion investment will be funded by unallocated grants from the CHIPS and Science Act and the Secure Enclave program, making the government one of Intel's largest shareholders. The administration aims to boost domestic chip production and maintain technological leadership against China, though critics express concern about the blurring lines between the public and private sectors. This intervention is a significant step in the Trump administration's strategy to reshape major tech companies and secure national interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is strategically positioned to play a crucial role in enhancing climate resilience within the Greater Bay Area, a highly dynamic economic region encompassing over 86 million people. With increasing integration, the area faces significant shared risks from extreme weather events, making robust climate adaptation an essential economic imperative to safeguard trade, attract investment, and sustain growth. The article suggests establishing a cross-border early warning platform, pooling comprehensive meteorological data, and implementing common infrastructure standards as logical starting points for this regional effort. Investing in resilient infrastructure can yield substantial economic benefits, protecting vital sectors like transport, ports, and power plants from climate volatility, and potentially setting a global benchmark for other coastal megaregions.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu is advocating for other Grand Slam tournaments to adopt a revamped mixed doubles format, similar to the innovative version introduced at the US Open, which she thoroughly enjoyed playing alongside Carlos Alcaraz. The US Open controversially moved mixed doubles to the qualifying week, heavily favoring singles players and offering a substantial $1 million prize, which she believes led to significant fan engagement and attention. Raducanu, who feels in a "much better place" mentally after past struggles since her 2021 US Open victory, has regained considerable confidence from consistent high-level play this summer. She also discussed her positive working relationship with new coach Francisco Roig, noting his unique connection to the sport.</p>

          <p>Wall Street saw a significant surge after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at potential interest rate cuts during his Jackson Hole address, causing the Dow to climb over 800 points. However, Powell also cautioned that the neutral interest rate might be higher than in the 2010s, implying rates may not return to pre-pandemic lows. This long-term instability means borrowing costs, like mortgages, could remain elevated, impacting housing affordability. The Fed is navigating a "curious kind of balance" in the labor market and observing the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs, setting the stage for a potential rate cut as early as next month despite broader economic uncertainties.
