          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 16:09:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have determined that the modern potato originated from the hybridization of an ancient tomato species and a non-tuber-producing wild potato from Chile around nine million years ago. A study published in the journal Cell explains that a key gene from the tomato ancestor enabled the development of starch-rich tubers. This genetic mixing provided the necessary components for the potato to form its characteristic underground stems. The discovery resolves a long-standing puzzle about the popular vegetable's lineage and demonstrates how interspecies breeding can drive the evolution of new traits.</p>

          <p>Shares for Meta and Microsoft saw significant gains after both tech giants reported earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, largely fueled by their substantial investments in artificial intelligence. The companies announced plans to continue their high levels of capital expenditure on AI infrastructure, with Meta raising its spending forecast and Microsoft projecting figures well above estimates. Analysts view this spending boom as beneficial for chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom. While some experts expressed slight apprehension about the scale of Meta's spending, the overall market reaction was strongly positive. (not investment advice)</p>

This successful IPO is seen as a strong signal that the tech IPO market is reviving after a prolonged slowdown.

India's batters struggled to assert dominance against the unpredictable attack, leaving neither side with a clear advantage heading into the second day of play.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with a plan to construct a 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the White House grounds, a project President Trump has envisioned for over a decade. The estimated $200 million cost will reportedly be covered by Trump and other private donors, with construction set to begin in September. The new venue, which will replace the current East Wing, is designed to host 650 guests for seated events, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity. For years, Trump has criticized the use of tents for large functions like state dinners.</p>
