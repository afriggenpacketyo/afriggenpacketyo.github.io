          <p>"Buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services are rapidly expanding in popularity, with projections indicating 91.5 million American users by 2025, offering consumers a flexible, often interest-free alternative to credit cards. This surge in BNPL adoption, however, is causing apprehension among traditional banks and credit card companies. They are concerned about the diversion of transaction activity and utilization, which are key revenue drivers, and the significant gap BNPL creates in understanding consumers' overall credit quality. This article highlights the ongoing disruption BNPL poses to established financial models and the evolving landscape of consumer lending. (not investment advice)</p>
