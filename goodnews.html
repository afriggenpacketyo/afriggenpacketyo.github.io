          <p>Palantir increased its revenue projections for the year, indicating a significant rise in both commercial and government revenue, especially in the artificial intelligence sector. CEO Alex Karp noted a 'tectonic shift' in the adoption of AI software, reflecting the company's central role in providing operating systems for modern enterprises. The company's commercial revenues saw a 71% increase, and government sales jumped 45%, driven by U.S. defense sector adoption. Despite the positive report, Palantir's shares experienced an after-hours dip of approximately 8%.</p>

          <p>The Army has temporarily suspended all helicopter training flights around the Pentagon after two commercial flights had to perform go-arounds due to an Army helicopter's training mission. The FAA said the Black Hawk helicopter took a scenic route, prompting the diversions, but Army officials disputed this account. The incident occurred less than a month after the FAA increased staffing and oversight for the DCA air traffic control team, which had previously restricted nonessential helicopter operations. The pause is pending an investigation into the incident.</p>
