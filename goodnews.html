          <p>Nearly 200 demonstrators have completed a 14-day, 160-mile march from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C., to protest actions by the Trump administration and advocate for democratic principles. The "We Are America" marchers, ranging from children to the elderly, were greeted by supporters and members of Congress upon their arrival in the nation's capital. The march was organized to build a movement to hold leaders accountable for what they see as threats to democracy, including mass firings at government agencies. Participants carried a version of the U.S. Constitution created by children, which they presented to lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Veteran actress Glenn Close, 78, has revealed that appearing fully nude in her new movie, "The Summer Book," was her own idea. In an interview, she explained that she felt the act of walking nude in a forest was something her character would do when alone, noting that Finnish culture is more comfortable with nudity. The film, based on a novel by Tove Jansson, centers on the relationship between a young girl and her grandmother as they grieve a family loss. Close stated that she felt so comfortable during the scene that she didn't want to put her clothes back on afterward.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The future of TikTok in the United States may depend on a licensing agreement for its highly coveted algorithm, a key sticking point in negotiations between Washington and Beijing. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block the sale of the algorithm, which is credited with the app's massive success in intuiting user preferences. A potential deal could involve a U.S. entity licensing the technology from parent company ByteDance, allowing the app to continue operating while addressing U.S. national security concerns. However, questions remain about how such an arrangement would prevent potential data access or content manipulation from China.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Signs Legislative Package to Address Climate Change and Energy Costs</h2>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a comprehensive package of climate and environment bills designed to lower energy costs and support California's transition to clean energy. The legislation extends the state's cap-and-trade program to 2045, which is expected to generate billions of dollars to lower utility bills and fund public transit projects. A controversial component of the package allows for a limited number of new oil wells in Kern County to stabilize gasoline supply as refineries close. The bills also establish a framework for a Western states electricity market to facilitate the sharing of renewable energy like solar and wind power.</p>

          <p>The Canadian women's rugby team delivered a stunning upset, defeating the six-time world champion New Zealand Black Ferns 34-19 to advance to the World Cup final. The victory ended New Zealand's 11-year, 4,063-day undefeated streak in the tournament, marking a seismic moment for the sport. Canada, a team that had to fundraise to even attend the tournament, dominated the first half and successfully held off a second-half response from the defending champions. The performance was hailed as a "fairytale" and a tactical masterpiece, setting up a final showdown at Twickenham Stadium next week.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has thrown out President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the 85-page complaint "decidedly improper and impermissible." U.S. District Court Judge Steven Merryday criticized the filing for its "abundant, florid, and enervating detail," which violated federal rules requiring complaints to be simple and concise. The judge noted that the first 79 pages were unnecessarily long for a two-count complaint. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file a shorter, amended version of the lawsuit, with a new limit of 40 pages.</p>

          <p>Over 100 members of the Writers Guild of America East demonstrated outside Disney's New York headquarters to protest the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". The writers carried signs accusing Disney and its network ABC of censorship and capitulating to political pressure from the Trump administration and the FCC. The protest highlights growing anger within the creative community over the network's decision, which followed calls from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr for action against Kimmel. The union argues that threatening broadcast licenses over content sets a dangerous precedent that could chill free expression across all network television.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal regarding TikTok's U.S. operations, though a final agreement has not yet been reached. Following a phone call, Trump stated that a deal is "well on its way" and that he received Xi's approval, though Chinese state media offered a more reserved account of the conversation. The ongoing negotiations are aimed at resolving U.S. national security concerns over the popular video app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The framework of a potential deal involves ByteDance divesting its U.S. business to American investors to avoid a nationwide ban.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have proposed a new community policing initiative that would establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this would increase police visibility, build public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. To fund the plan, the Lib Dems suggest abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, which they claim would free up sufficient cash. The policy announcement comes as the party gathers for its annual conference, aiming to appeal to voters concerned about community safety.</p>

          <p>After being locked out for several years, NBA star Kevin Durant has finally regained access to his Coinbase cryptocurrency account. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed on social media that the account recovery was complete, just days after Durant and his agent had publicly joked about the situation at a conference. Durant originally purchased bitcoins on the platform in 2016 when the price was significantly lower than its current value. The high-profile case has drawn attention to customer service issues at the cryptocurrency exchange, prompting the CEO to state the company is focusing on improving customer support.

This fundraising effort highlights the massive investor appetite for companies developing foundational AI models, placing xAI's valuation in a similar tier as rivals like Anthropic. Musk later denied the report on his social media platform X, calling it "fake news." If the funding round proceeds, the capital would likely be used to acquire the expensive GPUs needed to build out data centers and compete in the AI arms race. (not investment advice)</p>
