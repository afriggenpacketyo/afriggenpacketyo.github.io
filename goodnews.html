          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices surged to record highs following the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's selection of staunch conservative Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. Takaichi, known for her pro-stimulus economic stance, is expected to advocate for continued accommodative monetary policy from the Bank of Japan. This political development signals a potential shift towards expanding investment and demand through public-private partnerships, which analysts anticipate will further bolster the Japanese economy. The yen weakened against the dollar, reflecting market reactions to the new leadership and its potential economic direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lesley Stahl recounted her experience interviewing the "band" Spinal Tap, rather than the actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, for the sequel "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues." The actors remained fully in character, improvising dialogue and humorously interacting with Stahl, who admitted to being "beyond confused" by the immersive experience. Director Rob Reiner praised their spontaneous comedic talent, comparing it to jazz musicians playing off each other, emphasizing the lack of a traditional script. The article highlights that both "Spinal Tap" films were made without a script, relying on outlines and extensive editing to create the final narrative, a pioneering approach for the mockumentary genre.</p>

          <p>Rob Reiner reflected on his extensive film career, from his directorial debut with the improvised "This is Spinal Tap" to its upcoming sequel. Starting as an actor on "All in the Family," Reiner transitioned to directing, pioneering the mockumentary style without a script. The article highlights his personal struggles, including feeling misunderstood by his father, which influenced scenes in films like "Stand By Me." Reiner's career includes iconic movies such as "The Princess Bride" and "A Few Good Men," with the latter's ending changed after he met his wife. Despite his success, Reiner admits he still feels uncertainty about how his films will be received.</p>

          <p>Families dealing with rare vaccine injuries are turning to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a government "no-fault" court designed to provide compensation without proving manufacturer negligence. The article highlights the case of Jacob Thompson, who developed severe epilepsy after a childhood vaccination, receiving a $2.1 million judgment and a lifetime annuity. Established in the 1980s to prevent vaccine shortages caused by civil lawsuits, the program has paid out nearly $5 billion but faces criticism for significant delays, with a backlog of over 3,000 cases. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advocates for expanding the injury table and streamlining the process.</p>

          <p>China is heavily investing in AI and robotics, aiming to produce high-end chips and challenge Nvidia's long-standing dominance in the global market. Despite US export restrictions, Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei have unveiled new chips, with Huawei announcing a three-year plan to compete directly with Nvidia. While some experts caution about the lack of transparent data for Chinese chip performance, Nvidia acknowledges the "undeniable" competition. The article highlights China's vast talent pool and intense domestic competition as strengths, but also notes the state-led approach can hinder disruptive innovation. Most experts agree China remains reliant on the US for the most powerful chips, but the gap is rapidly shrinking.</p>

          <p>India is actively working to attract skilled professionals back home, spurred by President Trump's decision to significantly hike H-1B visa fees to $100,000. Policymakers in Delhi view this as an opportune moment to engineer a "reverse brain drain," particularly in technology and other innovative industries. While anecdotal evidence suggests some Indians are considering relocation due to a hostile US immigration environment, experts warn that large-scale reverse migration will be challenging without concerted government effort. The article highlights the rise of Global Capability Centres in India and the increasing interest from Indian students and senior executives in returning to their homeland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has unveiled significant housing market reforms designed to cut costs, reduce delays, and halve failed property sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated the changes would "fix the broken system," potentially saving first-time buyers an average of £710 and shortening transaction times by up to four weeks. Key proposals include legally requiring sellers and estate agents to provide upfront information about a property's condition, leasehold costs, and chain details. The article also mentions the potential introduction of binding contracts to prevent late withdrawals, aiming to reduce the estimated £1.5bn annual cost of failed transactions and boost professional standards across the sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mohamed Salah's limited defensive contributions are emerging as a tactical "problem" for Liverpool, particularly against stronger opponents, according to this article. While his freedom to stay high up the pitch has made him a prolific scorer, the players behind him are failing to provide adequate cover, leading to defensive overloads on the right flank. The analysis suggests that manager Arne Slot likely instructs Salah not to track back, but the team's setup is not compensating effectively, resulting in a lack of control in games. Despite Salah's attacking form concerns, the article believes his goals will return, emphasizing the need for better team balance and patience.</p>

          <p>Martin Powers, a historian, discusses how imperial China's political ideas, often reflected through visual art, offer insights into contemporary Western societies. He emphasizes that public images provide valuable evidence of normative societal understandings, illustrating concepts like the Han dynasty prime minister's focus on national policy over local unrest. Powers argues that art "participates" in political debate by conveying ideas about intergroup relations, such as the portrayal of dominant and subordinate figures in aristocracies. This article explores how these historical visual representations can reveal fundamental concepts of authority and privilege, informing our understanding of political structures across different cultures and eras.</p>

          <p>This article explores the stock market's unexpected resilience despite potential headwinds like government shutdowns, attributing it partly to a "Trump put" where the president intervenes to prevent market crashes. It highlights a speculative bull market driven by a new generation of buyers chasing parabolic moves in tech stocks, particularly data center plays and quantum computing companies, often ignoring traditional valuation metrics. The author, Jim Cramer, notes the unparalleled rise of Nvidia and its integral role in the fourth industrial revolution, despite persistent skepticism. He advises investors to take some profits off the table, even in a seemingly magical market, to secure gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China, having been the world's largest exporter for 16 years, should now pivot its economic strategy to become the world's largest importer within the next five to ten years. As China's leadership prepares for the 15th five-year plan, the article emphasizes the imperative to accelerate the transition to a consumption-driven economy. This strategic shift would address structural imbalances that have long prioritized investment and exports over domestic demand, carrying profound geopolitical and economic implications for the nation and its trading partners. The author suggests this new course is crucial for China to achieve its ambition of becoming a "modern socialist country."</p>
