          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense after a difficult start to the month. Despite being without shortstop Mookie Betts, the team continued its recent trend of higher-scoring games. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who hit a two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who had a multi-hit game. The win marks the team's third in four games, providing a positive sign as the MLB trade deadline approaches.</p>

This influx of expertise is intended to fuel the expansion of China's quant sector and enhance its use of artificial intelligence.

          <p>Tesla is planning to expand its car service to the San Francisco Bay Area, initially offering rides to employees' friends and family and select public members. However, California regulators have clarified that the company is not authorized to operate a robotaxi service with autonomous vehicles on public roads. According to the California Public Utilities Commission, any service offered by Tesla must use non-autonomous vehicles with a human driver in control at all times. This regulatory stance contrasts with CEO Elon Musk's recent teases of expanding the company's fledgling robotaxi service.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is preparing for a crucial hearing in her trademark dispute with the cosmetics giant L'Oréal. The conflict began when Rebecca Dowdeswell tried to re-register the trademark for her salon, 'nkd,' which L'Oréal opposed, citing potential consumer confusion with its 'Naked' makeup line. Dowdeswell, who has spent over £30,000 in legal fees, argues there has been no evidence of confusion in her 15 years of trading. The case will be decided by the UK's Intellectual Property Office later this year.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has experienced its warmest and sunniest spring on record, leading to a noticeable increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, wasps, and butterflies. The warm weather created ideal conditions for aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, to thrive. While this has been a boon for some species, experts caution that the accompanying lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year. The positive conditions this year are a stark contrast to 2024, which was declared a 'butterfly emergency' due to low numbers.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the city of Chicago over its sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, alleged that Chicago's ordinance limiting cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents unlawfully thwarts federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion to dismiss the case. Chicago's mayor and Illinois's governor both praised the decision, affirming the legality of the city's Welcoming City Ordinance and its role in public safety.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the story of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 with the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The exhibit focuses on the 'Hollywood Ten,' a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It highlights how the anti-Communist fervor extended beyond Hollywood, impacting many ordinary Americans, and raises questions about free speech and the consequences of holding unpopular political views.</p>

          <p>A feature article examines Donald Trump's multifaceted relationship with golf, portraying it as a business venture, a competitive outlet, and a key networking tool. Unlike other presidents who used the sport for diversion, Trump integrates it into his professional and political life, owning numerous courses and using them to forge connections with world leaders and political allies. The article notes that while his passion for the game is clear, his time on the course is also transactional, providing a private venue for discussions away from public scrutiny. It also touches on conflicting accounts of his skill and sportsmanship.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. The program involves capturing and relocating dozens of sheep from the last remaining disease-free herd to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent check on the relocated herd revealed positive signs of survival and reproduction, with newborn lambs spotted among the group. This success brings hope for the recovery of the iconic species in the region.</p>

          <p>An article explores the scientific basis for popular health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and taking 10,000 steps a day. Experts suggest that while these benchmarks are useful guides, there is often room for individual variation and a more holistic approach is beneficial. For instance, while adequate sleep is critical, thirst is a reliable indicator for hydration needs for most people. The consensus is that consistency in healthy habits is more important than rigidly adhering to specific numbers, which can sometimes add unnecessary stress.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on the unique physiological needs of female athletes, who were once treated as 'mini-men.' Researchers are studying how factors like breast biomechanics, the menstrual cycle, and a higher susceptibility to certain injuries, such as ACL tears, impact performance. This growing body of research is leading to practical applications, including better sports bra design to improve running stride and open discussions about period tracking to optimize training.

          <p>An asteroid named 2024 YR4, once considered a potential threat to Earth, may instead be on a collision course with the moon in 2032. While an Earth impact has been ruled out, scientists are now studying the consequences of a lunar strike from the 200-foot-diameter space rock. A collision could create a visible flash and a large crater, sending lunar debris toward Earth, which could pose a risk to satellites and any potential lunar infrastructure. This scenario is prompting planetary defense experts to consider expanding their monitoring to include threats to the moon.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after 'Big Brother' first aired in the UK, some psychologists and social experts are suggesting that reality television may have positive societal effects. The genre has historically been more demographically diverse than other media, offering viewers a glimpse into different social landscapes and perspectives. By featuring ordinary people and their unfiltered emotions, shows can spark national conversations on complex topics like mental health, disability, and coercive control. While the welfare of contestants remains a serious concern, the article argues that reality TV can serve as a tool for greater social understanding.</p>
