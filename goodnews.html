        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are giving strong consideration to signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. The move would mark a return to the franchise for the 40-year-old, who was instrumental in the team's "Lob City" era from 2011 to 2017. Frank emphasized the team's desire to enhance its ball-handling and playmaking capabilities, viewing Paul as a valuable addition to a roster that includes James Harden and newly signed Bradley Beal. The team believes Paul could accept a reserve role and provide crucial depth and experience.</p>

          <p>Germany's women's national football team secured a spot in the Euro 2025 semifinals by defeating France 6-5 in a dramatic penalty shootout. The German squad played with only ten players for over 100 minutes after an early red card was issued to defender Kathrin Hendrich. Despite the numerical disadvantage and falling behind on an early penalty, Germany equalized before halftime and held on through extra time. Goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger emerged as the hero, making a crucial save in the shootout after having scored a penalty of her own.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of reducing sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030. This announcement follows recent data showing a 60% increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024, sparking public outrage over environmental damage and rising water bills. The pledge is part of a broader government plan to reform the water sector, which also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and cutting phosphorus pollution. The plan comes as a major review of the industry is set to be published.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a concert in San Francisco when a prop she was riding malfunctioned mid-air. While performing her song "Roar" on a large mechanical butterfly suspended above the audience, the prop suddenly dropped several feet. Videos show the singer was momentarily startled but quickly recovered and continued her performance without interruption. After the song concluded, Perry humorously commented on the incident, demonstrating professionalism in handling the unexpected situation during her ongoing "The Lifetimes Tour."</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler has positioned himself for a decisive victory at The Open Championship, holding a four-shot lead after the third round at Royal Portrush. Scheffler played a steady, bogey-free round of 67, moving to 14-under par for the tournament. A win would mark his fourth major title and move him three-quarters of the way to a career grand slam. His closest competitor is Li Haotong, while other contenders like Matt Fitzpatrick and Rory McIlroy face a significant deficit heading into the final day.</p>

          <p>Germany has signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the United Kingdom, signaling a strategic pivot toward closer European cooperation, particularly on security matters. This new pact focuses on defense and arms collaboration, creating a trilateral alliance with France known as the "E3." The partnership is seen as a response to the threat from Russia and uncertainty about future U.S. security guarantees for Europe under a potential Trump presidency. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized that while this enhances European defense, it supplements rather than replaces the U.S. security umbrella.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to joining Barcelona after a deal in principle was reached between the clubs. The 27-year-old has been an outcast at Old Trafford since last December and was told to train separately from the first team. Barcelona's interest comes as they seek to strengthen their forward line after failing to sign other targets. The move is expected to be an initial loan with an option to buy, a financially advantageous arrangement for the Spanish club given their ongoing economic constraints.</p>

          <p>A new study from Johns Hopkins University has found a significant association between the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Researchers discovered traces of HCV in the choroid plexus, the protective lining of the brain, in postmortem samples from individuals with these conditions. While the virus was not found in the brain tissue itself, its presence in the lining was linked to altered gene expression in the hippocampus. This finding suggests a potential pathway for how infections could influence mental health and may open new avenues for treatment.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, led by army officer Claus von Stauffenberg. The attempt, known as "Operation Valkyrie," involved planting a bomb in Hitler's military headquarters, but the dictator survived with minor injuries, and the subsequent coup failed. While the conspirators were once viewed as traitors, they are now largely honored as heroes of the German resistance, with the anniversary serving as a day of remembrance. The historical context of the plot continues to be debated, including the conspirators' motivations and their vision for a post-Nazi Germany.</p>
