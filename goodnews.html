          <p>Hamas has communicated its acceptance of key parts of a Gaza peace plan outlined by the US president, including the release of all hostages. However, the group indicated that other aspects of the proposal require further negotiation. U.S. officials view the response as a positive step, while Israel is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan, which involves an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed-upon line. The deal aims to establish a lasting peace and transfer Gaza's administration to an independent Palestinian body.</p>

The protests, led by the Awami Action Committee, were driven by public anger over high living costs and benefits for the political elite.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has found a more fulfilling and financially manageable life by relocating to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. He lives comfortably on approximately $4,000 a month from VA disability, the GI Bill, and teaching English, paying just $850 for a two-bedroom apartment in a modern high-rise. Ryan contrasts this with his experience in the U.S., where he felt unmotivated and trapped in a cycle of financial pressure. In Vietnam, he feels free from "survival mode," allowing him to focus on personal happiness and future goals.</p>

          <p>After undergoing a comprehensive, 20-year renovation project, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III in Egypt's Valley of the Kings is now open to the public. The massive tomb, belonging to a ruler of the 18th Dynasty, was discovered in 1799 but had been looted. The Japanese-led restoration focused on preserving intricate wall paintings depicting the pharaoh and ancient Egyptian gods. This reopening is part of Egypt's broader strategy to revitalize its tourism sector, a crucial source of foreign currency, ahead of the Grand Egyptian Museum's inauguration.</p>

          <p>After being unable to secure corporate employment due to a felony conviction, Dawon Matthews created his own opportunities and now runs a food truck business in Houston that generates over $1 million in annual revenue. Matthews, 32, initially started a cleaning company and a junk removal service before venturing into the food industry with Goodies Soul Kitchen. He strategically targeted the late-night market and focused on excellent service, a model that proved highly successful. Matthews is also committed to providing employment opportunities for other former felons, judging them on their skills rather than their records.</p>

          <p>David Risher, now the CEO of Lyft, recounted leaving a successful career at Microsoft in 1996 to join a small online bookstore called Amazon, a move Bill Gates called "the stupidest decision." Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's compelling vision, which included an intense focus on the customer experience and a bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000. Risher was impressed by Bezos's hands-on approach and the opportunity to be part of building a transformative company. Amazon ultimately surpassed Bezos's revenue prediction a year early, validating Risher's risky career change.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist shares a parenting practice she started when her children were born: creating an email address for each child and sending them messages. These emails serve as a digital time capsule, capturing memories, stories, and feelings on birthdays, during special moments, and even through difficult times. The expert notes that this practice helps preserve a child's history and a parent's voice, which can become an invaluable keepsake later in life. She suggests the account can be shared with the child at a milestone age, like 18, or serve as a legacy of love if tragedy strikes.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's new album has sparked intense fan speculation that the track "Actually Romantic" is a diss track aimed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The song addresses another singer who writes about hating Swift, which fans have linked to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife." In a film accompanying the album, Swift described the track as a "love letter to someone who hates you," finding it flattering that someone would devote so much attention to her. Neither artist has confirmed the speculation, but it has fueled online debate about a potential rivalry.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired an approximate 2% stake in the software company Workiva. Irenic is urging the company to enhance its operational efficiency, improve corporate governance by collapsing its dual-class share structure, and explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale. The firm argues that despite strong revenue growth and a high customer retention rate, Workiva's lack of profitability has led to its stock trading at a discount compared to its peers. Irenic has also requested two new board seats to help oversee these proposed changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Urenco's uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico, the only one of its kind in the U.S., is ramping up production to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This revival is driven by the need to power AI data centers and a U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports, which previously supplied 20% of the nation's needs. The facility is expanding its capacity by 15% to help fill the supply gap, but industry leaders warn that the entire nuclear fuel supply chain, from mining to conversion, requires significant expansion.

Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative and a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is known for her hard-line views and hawkish stance on China. Her election is seen as a move by the LDP to win back conservative voters after recent election losses.

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with an early-stage form of the disease after she insisted on receiving early screenings. Although initially told she was too young, a high-risk assessment led to a mammogram and a breast MRI, which detected two suspicious masses that were confirmed to be cancerous. Her case highlights the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, especially as breast cancer rates are rising in women under 50. Her oncologist credits her persistence with catching the cancer at a highly treatable stage.</p>

          <p>The late primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, fundamentally changed humanity's understanding of its place in the natural world. Her journey began in the 1960s when, without formal training, she immersed herself in the lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania. Her revolutionary discovery that chimps make and use tools blurred the line between humans and other animals, forcing a redefinition of what it means to be human. Her friendship with a chimp named David Greybeard symbolized a new potential for interspecies understanding and fueled her lifelong dedication to conservation.</p>

He credits his 13-year-old golden retriever, Daisy, as the driving force behind his rapid progress, wanting her to live out her final years in their home. Koerner expedited the process by using his own funds instead of waiting for insurance and by being relentlessly persistent with contractors and county officials.
