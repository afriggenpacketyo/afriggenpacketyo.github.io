        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Organizers at Wimbledon have issued an apology after the electronic line-calling system on Centre Court was mistakenly deactivated during a fourth-round match. The error resulted in three missed calls in a single game between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal, with one particularly crucial point having to be replayed. Pavlyuchenkova, who ultimately won the match, expressed frustration, questioning why the chair umpire did not overrule the system's failure. The All England Club attributed the incident to human error and has since reviewed its operational procedures.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has indicated that a new oil pipeline to the British Columbia coast is highly likely to be designated as a project of national importance. In an interview, Carney stated that while the proposal must come from the private sector, the economic scale of the opportunity makes it a strong candidate for fast-tracked approval. This comes after Canada passed a bill to speed up the approval process for major natural resource projects. The move is part of Canada's broader strategy to diversify its energy exports and reduce economic dependence on the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent publicly advised the billionaire to stay out of politics. Speaking on CNN, Bessent remarked that while Musk's cost-cutting principles were popular, Musk himself was not, and suggested that the boards of his companies likely disapprove of his political ventures. The comments highlight the growing rift between Musk and the Trump administration, which intensified after Musk criticized the president's major tax and spending bill. Bessent's remarks imply pressure on Musk to return his focus to his business enterprises.</p>

          <p>The BRICS nations issued a joint declaration at their Rio summit condemning recent military strikes on Iran and the rise of unilateral trade tariffs, though the document carefully avoided directly naming the United States or Israel.

On trade, it criticized measures that "distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules," a clear reference to U.S. policy.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won a chaotic, rain-affected British Grand Prix for his first-ever victory at his home race in Silverstone. The win came after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who had led for much of the race, received a controversial 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety-car restart. The dramatic race, which featured multiple incidents and changing weather conditions, also saw Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg achieve a surprise first-ever podium finish. The result tightens the drivers' championship race between the two McLaren teammates.</p>
