          <p>The article discusses the closure of a US duty-free loophole for low-value packages, impacting online retailers like Shein and Temu.  This loophole, known as the "de minimis" exemption, allowed for the import of goods worth less than $800 without duties or taxes.  President Trump's administration closed the loophole to protect American businesses and combat illegal imports. This action will likely lead to price increases for US consumers.</p>
