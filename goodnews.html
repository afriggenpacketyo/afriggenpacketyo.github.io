        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Startup Neurable has partnered with Master & Dynamic to release headphones equipped with a brain-computer interface that monitors brainwaves to measure focus. The technology uses EEG sensors and AI algorithms to detect when a user's attention wanes and suggests taking a break. While not capable of reading thoughts, the interface can identify brain states associated with focus, distraction, and potentially even early signs of health issues like depression or Alzheimer's. This innovation represents a step toward non-invasive neurotechnology for the mass market, moving health tracking from measuring consequences to analyzing root causes in the brain.</p>

This early release is intended to identify and fix potential bugs that have caused significant problems in previous application cycles. Financial aid experts have welcomed the move, stating a longer testing window will lead to a smoother process for students and families. The FAFSA is a critical gateway for accessing federal student loans, grants, and work-study programs, making a streamlined application process essential for college-bound students.</p>

          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force conducted a perilous mid-winter medical evacuation to rescue three people from McMurdo Station, an American research base in Antarctica. The nearly 20-hour mission was carried out in 24-hour darkness and sub-zero temperatures, requiring the crew to use night vision goggles to land on a manually prepared ice runway. U.S. officials described the operation as "nothing short of heroic," praising the crew's courage and precision. Such high-risk flights are among the most challenging due to the extreme and unpredictable Antarctic weather conditions, making this successful rescue a remarkable feat.</p>

          <p>Global semiconductor giants like TSMC, Samsung, and Nvidia may be positioned to avoid the worst of President Trump's proposed 100% tariffs on imported chips due to their significant investments in U.S. manufacturing. Trump has indicated that companies building or committed to building facilities in the United States will be exempt from the new duties. This has caused a rally in the stocks of chipmakers with a substantial U.S. footprint, as investors bet that their multi-billion dollar commitments to domestic production will shield them from the steep import taxes. The policy highlights a strategic push to onshore critical technology manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to terminate thousands of previously approved grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities was unlawful. The ruling allows a lawsuit, filed by Oregon Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils, to proceed. In his decision, the judge stated that the groups were likely to succeed in their claim that withholding the congressionally appropriated funds is unconstitutional, as the power of the purse belongs exclusively to Congress. This legal victory is a significant step for humanities organizations that have already suffered staff layoffs and program cancellations due to the funding cuts.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have detected a candidate gas giant planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, the closest sun-like star to Earth. This star system was famously the setting for the fictional moon Pandora in the movie "Avatar." The potential planet orbits within the star's habitable zone, where temperatures could theoretically support life, and scientists suggest it could have moons. While the planet's existence requires further confirmation, the discovery is a thrilling development for astronomers and science fiction fans alike, bringing a popular fantasy one step closer to reality.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of three key financial tools for retirees: Social Security, annuities, and reverse mortgages. It explains that while Social Security provides a foundational income, it is often insufficient on its own. Annuities can offer a guaranteed income stream, acting like a personal pension, but may come with high fees and limited liquidity. Reverse mortgages allow homeowners to tap into their home equity but reduce the value of their estate and involve significant costs. The best strategy often involves a balanced combination of these tools tailored to an individual's specific financial situation and retirement goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The global oil market is largely dismissing President Trump's threats to impose heavy secondary tariffs on countries that purchase Russian energy, with oil prices closing lower. Traders appear to believe the threats are a negotiating tactic and that the administration will not risk the significant spike in global energy prices that would result from a full-scale implementation. The administration's recent 25% tariff on India for buying Russian oil was much lower than the 100% originally threatened, reinforcing market skepticism. Analysts suggest Russia will resist making major concessions, betting that Trump will avoid actions that could hurt American consumers at the pump. (not investment advice)</p>

He acknowledged potential issues with Australia's batting lineup but argued that England's bowlers would also face challenges. The prediction sets the stage for a highly anticipated series, with England seeking its first Ashes series win since 2015 and its first Test victory in Australia since 2011.</p>

          <p>This article argues that while President Trump's current tariff policies are broad and haphazard, tariffs themselves are not inherently bad economic tools. When used strategically, they can protect domestic industries from unfair competition, such as from state-subsidized foreign companies or those with poor labor standards. Effective tariff policy requires targeting specific industries for clear reasons, like national security or supply chain stability, and should be paired with complementary investments like research funding. In contrast, Trump's approach is criticized for its conflicting rationales and for being a standalone measure rather than part of a comprehensive industrial strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists at Pompeii have found new evidence indicating that some survivors of the 79 AD Vesuvius eruption returned to the devastated city. These individuals likely lived in precarious, informal settlements among the ruins, unable to afford relocating elsewhere. The findings suggest a post-eruption phase where the city was not entirely abandoned but became what the site's director called a "precarious and grey agglomeration." This new understanding challenges the long-held narrative of Pompeii's complete and immediate abandonment, revealing a more complex story of survival and reoccupation in the aftermath of the cataclysmic event.</p>
