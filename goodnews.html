          <p>Stephen Curry's dominant fourth quarter performance, scoring 14 of his 22 points, helped the Golden State Warriors defeat the Houston Rockets 103-89 in Game 7 of their first-round playoff series. Buddy Hield contributed 33 points with nine three-pointers, setting an NBA record for a Game 7. Despite Houston's Alperen Sengun recording 21 points and 14 rebounds, the Rockets struggled with their shooting, ending their season after failing to capitalize on their home-court advantage. Rockets coach Ime Udoka expressed disappointment but urged the team to use the loss as motivation for future improvement.</p>

          <p>China‚Äôs offshore yuan has strengthened, surpassing the 7.2 level against the US dollar, driven by optimism that the US and China will begin negotiating a rollback of tariffs. Experts suggest that the two countries may reduce some of their tariffs, which are considered unsustainable, but caution that negotiations will be lengthy and volatile. Despite renewed interest in Chinese assets, global investors are waiting for tangible signs of China's ability to withstand challenges from Washington before increasing their investments.

          <p>Two Chinese scientists assert that "Shi‚Äôs Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world‚Äôs oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years. The study, published in Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics, suggests the catalogue was created around 335BC, making it the earliest known human record of the stars. Researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the approximate years of observations. Previously, the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece was considered the oldest.</p>

          <p>New evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, contrary to the popular association of roses with red. The study examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that their common ancestor likely had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets.
