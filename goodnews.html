          <p>The latest Henley Passport Index names Singapore's passport as the most powerful in the world, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 countries. This marks a consistent top performance for the nation, while Japan and South Korea hold the second position. The report highlights a continued downward trend for the United States and the United Kingdom, which have fallen to 10th and 6th place, respectively. The index, which assesses travel freedom based on data from the International Air Transport Association, shows a strong dominance of European and key Asian countries in the top tiers.</p>

          <p>Shares for major Japanese auto manufacturers, including Toyota and Honda, experienced significant gains after reports that the U.S. would lower auto tariffs from 25% to 15%. Toyota's stock jumped nearly 12%, while others like Mazda and Mitsubishi saw even larger percentage increases, reflecting the industry's relief. The auto sector is a critical component of Japan's economy, and recent months had seen a sharp decline in vehicle exports to the U.S. under the higher tariff rate. This development provides short-term assurance for an industry facing intense international competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing reciprocal tariffs of 15% and reportedly lowering the duty on Japanese auto imports from 25%. President Trump claimed the agreement would involve a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and open Japanese markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. The deal is a major development for Japan's economy, where auto exports to the U.S. are a cornerstone. The announcement follows a period of tense negotiations and provided a significant boost to Japanese markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams secured a historic victory at the DC Open, defeating Peyton Stearns 6-3, 6-4 to become the second-oldest woman in the Open Era to win a tour-level singles match.

The only player to win a match at an older age was Martina Navratilova. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, showcased glimpses of her classic power and skill, advancing to the second round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed relief pitcher Tanner Scott on the injured list with elbow inflammation, though the team is optimistic he will avoid a season-ending injury. Scott, who signed a large contract in the offseason, exited a recent game after feeling a stinging sensation in his forearm. While his performance has been inconsistent, losing him for the year would be a major blow to a bullpen already dealing with multiple injuries. The situation underscores the team's need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the upcoming trade deadline to bolster their pitching staff.</p>

          <p>A powerful and tragic photograph taken by Stanley Forman in 1975, showing a woman and a young girl falling from a collapsed fire escape in Boston, is being remembered for its profound impact on public safety. The image, which won a Pulitzer Prize, depicted the death of 19-year-old Diana Bryant, while her 2-year-old goddaughter survived by landing on top of her. The photo's widespread publication shocked the public and spurred immediate action from city officials. Within months, Boston implemented new regulations requiring all fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years, a change that had a ripple effect across the country.</p>

Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that served in the American War of Independence, it was later sold and repurposed as a whaling ship before wrecking in a storm in 1788. The identification was the result of a collaborative effort between archaeologists, scientists using tree-ring dating, and local community researchers.
