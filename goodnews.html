          <p>President Xi Jinping of China is scheduled to visit Russia to mark the end of World War II in Europe and to reinforce strategic ties between the two nations. The visit, spanning from Wednesday to Saturday, occurs as China seeks to bolster support against U.S. tariffs and amidst potential thawing relations between Russia and the U.S. During the trip, Xi will attend a parade in Moscow commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany and engage in "strategic communications" with President Vladimir Putin. Both leaders are expected to sign several bilateral agreements, further solidifying the political mutual trust and strategic coordination between China and Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers and students at Yuelu Academy of Hunan University in China recreated a rice dish based on the 2,000-year-old "Shi Fang" manuscript, which contains ancient Chinese cooking practices. The students used wooden steamers and clay pots to prepare the rice, soaking it and steaming it in stages. Unlike modern rice, the ancient rice was described as "loose yet elastic" and had a lower sugar content. The project allowed students to connect with traditional Chinese culture and appreciate the culinary practices of the Han Dynasty.</p>

          <p>Native American women from southeastern Indigenous nations are reclaiming the tradition of inchunwa, or traditional tattoos, through efforts like the Inchunwa Project. The tattoos, which were once common but faded after colonization, are now being revived as a way to honor ancestors and set the groundwork for future generations. Receiving inchunwa is a deeply personal and community-supported process, with designs often inspired by pottery, shell carvings, and other artisan works. The tattoos represent a commitment to community, personal growth, and cultural revitalization, with the practice helping to foster a deeper understanding within southeastern communities.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to resist pressure from President Trump to cut interest rates, focusing instead on maintaining price stability. Despite Trump's calls for rate cuts and mounting fears of an economic slowdown, recent data showing a healthy jump in April payrolls supports the Fed's decision to hold rates steady. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge indicates that price pressures are easing, but higher U.S. duties on imports pose a risk to this progress. Uncertainty surrounding trade policies and global economic conditions remains a dominant factor influencing the Fed's decisions.</p>

Apple views its streaming service as part of a broader subscription services business, with Apple TV+ contributing to the overall brand experience.
