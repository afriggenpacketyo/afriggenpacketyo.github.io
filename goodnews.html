          <p>Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun conducted a European tour, visiting France and Germany, marking the first such visit in over four years, and pledged to intensify security exchanges with European countries and enhance China's role in United Nations peacekeeping operations. During meetings with his counterparts, Dong Jun engaged in discussions on bilateral relations and pledged to strengthen defence cooperation. His French counterpart, S√©bastien Lecornu, noted the frank dialogue on topics including maritime navigation, nuclear proliferation, stability in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East security situation, and the pursuit of peace in Ukraine. This diplomatic effort underscores China's ambition to be seen as a defender of global order amid geopolitical tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a fall in exports attributed to uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies. Despite the contraction, domestic demand showed a positive trend, growing by 0.6%. This GDP data arrives as Japan engages in ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., with potential impacts from U.S. tariffs remaining a concern. Analysts expect a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. to mitigate tariff effects, suggesting the Bank of Japan will likely maintain its current monetary policy, anticipating a rate hike later in the year.</p>

          <p>The LA 2028 Olympics committee has partnered with Archer Aviation to provide an air taxi service during the Olympic and Paralympic Games, aiming to offer spectators a way to bypass the city's notorious traffic.

However, Archer Aviation is still awaiting certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration, and it is unclear how much each trip would cost, but Archer Aviation's founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said he wants to keep prices comparable to a high-end Uber.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Northern California's commercial Dungeness crab season faces disruption due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. To mitigate this, some fishermen are using high-tech systems involving remote-controlled pop-up balloons to retrieve crab cages, reducing rope usage and whale entanglements. While effective, the technology is costly, posing a financial challenge for an industry already struggling with losses. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the crab season to protect migrating whales, but fishermen using the experimental pop-up technology can continue fishing, balancing economic needs with environmental protection.</p>

          <p>New York University (NYU) has withheld the diploma of a graduate who used his commencement speech to accuse the U.S. of supporting "genocide" in Gaza. Logan Rozos condemned the "atrocities currently happening in Palestine" during his speech, prompting cheers and some boos. NYU stated it "strongly denounces" and was "deeply sorry" for the remarks, accusing Rozos of abusing a privilege to express personal political views. The university is pursuing disciplinary action, as Rozos' speech adds to the ongoing debate about free speech and pro-Palestinian advocacy on college campuses.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Fossils of Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, show a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These horses lived 17,000 years ago and were slightly larger than existing wild horses. The study found that multiple migrations occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges in both directions across the Bering land bridge.</p>

          <p>The CDC is considering shifting COVID vaccine recommendations to focus on older Americans and those with chronic health problems, mirroring practices in other countries. New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated shots this fall, potentially including the seasonal flu vaccine. This shift is driven by concerns about the benefits of annual boosters for younger, healthy individuals and questions about the pediatric vaccine's approval status. While some experts support targeted vaccination, others fear it could undermine vaccine infrastructure and access, particularly for those who rely on CDC recommendations for insurance coverage.</p>
