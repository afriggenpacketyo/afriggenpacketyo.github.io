          <h2>Federal Reserve Holds Rates Steady Amid Rising Economic Uncertainty and Stagflation Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 14:09:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, remaining in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, citing increased uncertainty in the economic outlook. The Fed's statement acknowledged the volatility in trade policy, particularly President Trump's tariffs, which pose risks of both higher unemployment and inflation, potentially leading to stagflation. While the economy has shown resilience with job growth and a stable unemployment rate, inflation has been ticking lower, nearing the Fed's 2% target. The Fed will remain patient as it calibrates monetary policy amidst these fluctuating economic signals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, homeowners are weighing the options of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Traditionally, a home equity loan was favored during rate pauses due to its fixed interest rate, providing protection against potential rate increases. However, with potential rate cuts on the horizon, a HELOC, with its variable rate, may be more advantageous as rates are expected to fall. Currently, HELOC rates are lower than home equity loan rates, potentially offering savings over the repayment period.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rate Outlook Amidst Fed's Rate Pause</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 14:04:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady raises questions about the future of mortgage rates. While the Fed's actions influence the broader interest rate environment, mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield, which is affected by factors like inflation, economic growth, and investor sentiment. A rate pause could create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, especially if it signals potential rate cuts later in the year. Prospective homebuyers and homeowners should improve their credit scores, shop around for offers, and consider options like rate buydowns to secure competitive mortgage rates.</p>
