          <p>The article discusses how BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are challenging established European automakers in the small car market. BYD launched its Dolphin Surf compact hatchback in Europe at a competitive price, potentially disrupting the segment. Analysts note this move as a declaration of intentions from BYD, exploring the small car segment in Europe. The introduction of affordable Chinese EVs presents an opportunity for European consumers but also poses a threat to European carmakers struggling to produce competitive small cars. The competition is expected to intensify as more Chinese EVs enter the European market.</p>

          <h2>India's Forgotten Brush with Presidential Rule During Indira Gandhi's Emergency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 18:02:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how Indira Gandhi's government considered shifting India from a parliamentary to a presidential system during the Emergency in the mid-1970s. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, Gandhi's advisors proposed centralizing executive power and curtailing the judiciary's role. The push for a stronger presidency aimed to overcome the constraints of parliamentary democracy. Although the proposal never fully materialized, it influenced the Forty-second Amendment Act, which expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. The article sheds light on a little-known chapter in India's political history and the ambitions of Gandhi's government during a period of authoritarian rule.</p>
