          <p>India's women's cricket team achieved a landmark T20 series win against England, claiming victory with a game still to play. In the fourth match at Old Trafford, India comfortably chased down England's modest total of 126-7, winning by six wickets. India's openers provided a strong start, and despite a mid-innings slowdown, Captain Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues guided the team to victory. This marks the first time India's women's team has won a T20 series in England, highlighting the tourists' disciplined bowling and fielding throughout the matches.</p>

          <p>Chicago White Sox starting pitcher Adrian Houser demonstrated remarkable resilience during a game against the Toronto Blue Jays. After the first inning, Houser was seen vomiting in the team's dugout but returned to the mound to continue pitching. This is not the first time Houser has played through such an episode, having done so in two separate instances while with the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite the illness, he pitched six innings, contributing to the team's effort to end Toronto's 10-game winning streak in a game the White Sox were leading.</p>

          <p>Amid the catastrophic flooding in Central Texas, a story of heroism has emerged involving Matthew Crowder, who rescued a sleeping family from rising waters. On his way to work before dawn, Crowder noticed a home in imminent danger and, despite emergency dispatchers advising the family to stay put, he helped them evacuate. He recalled telling dispatch, "Send help or not, I have work to do," as he recognized the immediate peril. The family lost their home and possessions, but Crowder's actions highlight the community spirit and bravery shown during the disaster.</p>

          <p>The price of bitcoin reached a new record high, briefly surpassing $112,000, buoyed by a strong rally in the technology sector led by Nvidia. As a risk asset, bitcoin often moves in tandem with growth-oriented stocks, and investor optimism appeared to drive both markets higher. Despite trading in a narrow range for weeks, the cryptocurrency's surge comes as institutional and corporate adoption continues to grow. Analysts suggest that positive momentum from upcoming crypto-related legislative discussions could fuel further upward price movement in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

The meeting occurs as the administration has cut foreign aid and questions loom over the renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act.

          <p>The price of gold has experienced a modest decline, dropping about 4% from its recent highs and prompting questions about whether this is an opportune moment for investment. The article suggests this dip may be temporary, citing the metal's long-term upward trend and upcoming economic events that could influence its value. It argues that waiting could risk being priced out permanently, as analysts anticipate gold could eventually reach $4,000 per ounce. The piece also highlights gold's traditional role as a hedge against inflation and a tool for portfolio diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia became the first company ever to briefly achieve a market capitalization of $4 trillion, driven by soaring investor demand for its generative AI hardware. While the stock's value settled slightly lower by the end of the trading day, the milestone underscores the company's dominant position in the artificial intelligence boom. The surge has been remarkable, with Nvidia's value growing from $2 trillion to over $3 trillion in just a few months this year. This growth has occurred despite geopolitical tensions and U.S. export curbs that have impacted sales to China. (not investment advice)</p>

Davidtz, who herself grew up in South Africa during apartheid, discusses how the project is a way to process the institutional racism she witnessed. The film explores a white family's crumbling privilege from the perspective of an 8-year-old child, examining the casual bigotry of the era.</p>

          <p>Former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning has stated he is no longer interested in purchasing a minority stake in the NFL team, primarily because he has been priced out. With NFL franchise valuations soaring, Manning noted that even a 1% stake in a team valued at $10 billion becomes a very large number. He also mentioned that ownership could create conflicts of interest with his broadcasting role on ESPN's "ManningCast." The Giants, co-owned by the Mara and Tisch families, are exploring the sale of a minority stake amid renewed investor interest in the league.</p>

          <p>A new spending bill signed into law by President Trump includes an increase to the maximum child tax credit, raising it from $2,000 to $2,200 per eligible child, effective in 2026. The legislation extends the credit, which was set to revert to $1,000 after 2025, and indexes the refundable portion to inflation. However, the bill does not expand eligibility rules, meaning the increase will primarily benefit middle- and high-income families who already qualify for the full amount. The change is projected to add approximately $817 billion to the federal deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has recommended relaxing a cap on riskier mortgage lending, a move that could help more first-time buyers get onto the property ladder. The proposal would allow individual banks to issue more than 15% of their new mortgages at loan-to-income ratios higher than 4.5, though an industry-wide cap would remain. Lenders like Nationwide have welcomed the change, stating it will assist those struggling with high rents and affordability tests. The recommendation follows a government call for regulators to find ways to stimulate economic growth amid changing interest rate environments. (not investment advice)</p>
