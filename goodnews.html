          <p>China's Cyberspace Administration, collaborating with financial regulators, has shut down over a dozen social media accounts for spreading false financial information and illegally touting stocks. The accounts operated on platforms like Weibo, Douyin, RedNote, and WeChat, and some misled investors by making provocative claims and touting stocks as guaranteed wins. This crackdown addresses growing concerns over financial influencers who use sensationalist headlines and questionable claims, misleading investors and disrupting the market. The CAC has urged the public to invest wisely, stay alert to risks, and avoid illegal financial activities.</p>

          <p>Royal Mail is under investigation by Ofcom and could face fines for failing to meet delivery targets, with almost a quarter of first-class post arriving late in the past year. The company missed the target for second-class post as well, delivering only 92.2% within the required three days. Royal Mail stated it is "actively modernising" and seeing results, but acknowledged there is "still more to do". Citizens Advice criticized the company for increasing stamp prices while failing to deliver post on time, especially as Ofcom considers relaxing delivery targets.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan's election as president of Romania was significantly influenced by the votes of ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship, who voted in record numbers. Conservative estimates suggest that over 500,000 of these voters supported Dan, contributing decisively to his victory. This outcome is significant for both Romania and Europe, as these groups prioritized liberal democracy and Romania's Euro-Atlantic path, even against the backdrop of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's support for a hard-right candidate with anti-Hungarian sentiments.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's legal battle over his personal security arrangements has reached a likely end after his appeal against the government's decision to remove his police protection was rejected. The courts ruled that Harry misunderstood how the Royal Family's protection system operates and that his decision to step back from royal duties created an exceptional circumstance. Harry argued that his birthright made him a target and that the state should account for this, but the courts sided with Ravec, the body responsible for royal security, which decided on a case-by-case basis for his protection in the UK.</p>

          <p>Birmingham City Council has obtained a court order to prevent the obstruction of waste vehicles leaving depots due to ongoing strike action by refuse workers. The council estimates that over 12,000 tonnes of uncollected waste have accumulated on streets this week, disrupting collections. The strike, represented by Unite, centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with the union blaming government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress. The court order, an interim injunction, is set to last until a further legal hearing takes place, as the council aims to uphold its public health duties.</p>

          <p>Germany has implemented stricter border controls, resulting in over 1,500 people being turned back since the measures were imposed two weeks ago. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that the stronger controls are effective, with a 45% increase in people attempting to illegally enter Germany being sent back. However, police have warned that the intensified border checks are unsustainable in the long term, and migration researchers have criticized the measures as ineffective and potentially illegal under EU law.

NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hailed this "pioneering new model of care" for offering the right support in the right setting.

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic affirmed that EU-US trade must be guided by mutual respect, not threats, and that the EU stands ready to defend its interests.

          <p>The idea of playing for and spending an entire career with the club you support is a dream for fans, but doesn't always work out for players. Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher noted that players don't always think like supporters. Chris Sutton, a Premier League winner with Blackburn Rovers, stated there is greater pressure when you are playing for your local club because of the attachment to the club, your family and the area. A lot of the time now, fans expect immediate success from these players coming through, and instant judgement has become the norm.</p>

          <p>Adrian Newey, who joined Aston Martin in March, stated that the team's quest to become competitive in Formula 1 will be hindered because "some of our tools are weak". Newey specifically mentioned the new simulator as a weak spot, noting that it needs significant work as it is not correlating well at the moment. He estimated that fixing the simulator would be a two-year project. Aston Martin is currently seventh in the constructors' championship after seven races this season.</p>

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan‚Äôs representative office, relocating it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, as it strengthens ties with Beijing. This move follows Somalia's ban on Taiwanese passport holders, seen as retaliation for Taiwan‚Äôs growing relations with Somaliland. Experts suggest Taiwan's diminishing presence in Africa underscores a deepening alignment between African nations and Beijing, driven by strong economic relations. Taiwan's only official diplomatic ally in Africa remains eSwatini, with limited countries hosting commercial or trade offices for the island.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms to alleviate consumer burden amid soaring rice prices. The reserve rice is expected to be available in stores by June, following criticism of the government's handling of rising prices. Koizumi intends to bypass auctions to control prices and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average rice price in supermarkets reached a record high in early May, driven by poor harvests and increased demand.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan amid geopolitical tensions and de-dollarization discussions. International businesses are actively seeking to diversify from the US dollar, and Hong Kong offers a range of capabilities like settlement, payment, hedging, and swaps. This trend aligns with China‚Äôs long-term strategy to mitigate risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling. An increase in yuan-denominated trades and investments would benefit Hong Kong's financial sector, particularly with strengthening ties between China and oil-rich Qatar.</p>
