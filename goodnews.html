          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense, which had been struggling, experienced a significant revival in an 8-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, successfully avoiding a series sweep. Manager Dave Roberts had challenged his team to exhibit more competitive at-bats and a disciplined two-strike approach, without abandoning their characteristic power hitting. Dalton Rushing delivered a crucial three-run home run that broke a 2-2 tie, while Freddie Freeman contributed two long balls, including a second in a pivotal five-run seventh inning. This article details how the team's improved execution at the plate and ability to generate baserunners led to a much-needed offensive outburst, propelling them back into a first-place tie with the Padres.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palmer Luckey, the founder of the defense technology company Anduril, is a strong proponent of AI-powered autonomous weapons, asserting that they are the inevitable future of warfare. He argues that the United States military has lagged in adopting advanced technology, suggesting a shift towards becoming the "world gun store" to arm allies and reduce American casualties. Anduril develops systems like the Roadrunner drone interceptor and autonomous submarines, which operate with artificial intelligence, although Luckey states they all include "kill switches" for human intervention. This article delves into his controversial philosophy, which posits that the deployment of such advanced, "smart" weapons can act as a deterrent, ultimately promoting peace by making adversaries hesitant to engage, despite significant ethical concerns raised by international bodies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nine Palestinian scholars in Gaza, including recipients of the prestigious Chevening scholarship, have been informed by the UK government about potential evacuation to pursue university studies. This article highlights the significant development, which follows months of campaigning on behalf of over 80 Palestinian students with offers from UK universities, many of whom have secured full funding. For individuals like Mahmoud and Mohammed, the prospect of leaving their families in a war-torn region for a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" is fraught with emotional difficulty. While this is seen as a positive step, considerable uncertainty persists for dozens of other scholars, and the process has drawn criticism for appearing to prioritize certain scholarship holders over others amidst the ongoing humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France has formally recognized over 70 medical miracles in the past 163 years, drawing more than three million pilgrims annually. This article details the meticulous process of the Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, where world-renowned doctors and researchers conduct extensive, often decade-long, investigations into thousands of reported cures. Under the guidance of Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, cases are scrutinized to determine if a cure is sudden, complete, lasting, and defies all current medical explanation. While historical rigor has been questioned, experts like Dr. Esther Sternberg have found the office's conclusions credible, and no one has successfully disproven their findings.</p>

          <p>Anduril Industries has unveiled its "Fury" unmanned fighter jet, an AI-powered aircraft designed to operate autonomously without a human pilot. Co-founder Palmer Luckey advocates for these "smart weapons," arguing they can significantly reduce American casualties by limiting human presence on battlefields, and are morally superior to less intelligent weaponry. This article details Fury's design as a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA), intended to work in conjunction with manned jets to detect enemies and provide protection. The use of readily available commercial components in its construction aims to facilitate easier and more cost-effective mass production, marking a substantial evolution in defense strategy with test flights slated for the current summer.</p>
