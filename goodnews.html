          <p>Amid rising tensions following an attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir, India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, as announced by Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar. The agreement was mediated by the United States, with President Trump initially announcing the ceasefire on social media and Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirming the efforts. Prior to the agreement, Indian officials reported attacks by Pakistan across 26 locations and troop movements into forward areas, while denying any damage to India's military infrastructure from Pakistani strikes. Tensions escalated after an April attack on Hindu tourists, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir led to escalating tensions and military conflict between India and Pakistan, with both countries exchanging missile and drone strikes. The rivalry, rooted in the disputed Kashmir region, has a long history of wars and cross-border fire. The countries agreed to a ceasefire after U.S.-led mediation talks, with President Trump announcing the agreement. The conflict stems from the partition of India in 1947 and ongoing disputes over the Kashmir region, which both nations claim in its entirety.</p>

          <p>The rapidly falling rates of family formation in the US and globally are becoming a partisan issue, posing a threat to addressing the looming demographic crisis. An aging and shrinking population could lead to a decreased quality of life, a smaller working population supporting a larger elderly population, and potential environmental consequences. Progressives should take family formation seriously and consider policies that add to freedom, improve people's lives, and align with liberal priorities, such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, and affordable healthcare, to address this challenge.</p>

          <p>A spear tip carved from bone, discovered in Russia in 2003, has been dated to 80,000 years old, indicating that it was created by Neanderthals rather than modern humans. The discovery challenges previous assumptions about Neanderthal technological capabilities, suggesting they developed advanced bone-working techniques independently of Homo sapiens. The spear tip, found in the Mezmaiskaya Cave, shows signs of craftsmanship and successful use as a hunting weapon. The scarcity of Neanderthal bone tools may be due to decay over time, without specific environmental conditions to preserve them.</p>

Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are doing well, leading normal lives without severe infections. The therapy is now under review with the Food and Drug Administration, with the goal of becoming a licensed treatment for others with LAD-1.</p>

During the space race, putting boots on the moon was the biggest prize ‚Äî but the other worlds in our solar system were calling, too.
