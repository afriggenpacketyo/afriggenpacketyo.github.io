          <p>Cracker Barrel is facing criticism from customers on social media over its recent restaurant remodels, which many feel abandon the chain's nostalgic, old-country aesthetic for a more modern look. In response, Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Moore stated that the changes are based on guest and employee feedback, aiming for a brighter, less cluttered environment with more comfortable seating. Moore assured patrons that beloved elements like rocking chairs and peg games will remain, as the company aims to refresh its brand for the future.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that gold will not be subjected to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have applied duties to certain gold bars from Switzerland. The initial ruling caused the precious metal to hit a record high, but prices fell following Trump's announcement on social media. The Swiss Precious Metal Association had previously warned that imposing tariffs on these specific gold bars, which are used to back COMEX futures contracts, could disrupt the international flow of physical gold.

This article explores several ways for homeowners to borrow against this equity, which can be a valuable financial resource amid high inflation and borrowing costs. Options discussed include home equity loans, which provide a lump sum at a fixed rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which offer a flexible credit line with potentially lower interest rates.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to delay the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese imports for another 90 days, preventing them from snapping back to peak levels. This extension, which pushes the deadline to mid-November, was an expected result of recent trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in Stockholm. The move provides temporary relief in the ongoing trade dispute, though it also continues a pattern of unpredictable trade policy adjustments that have created uncertainty for businesses.

          <p>AOL is officially shutting down its dial-up internet service, a technology that introduced millions of Americans to the online world in the 1990s. The service, known for its distinctive connection sound, has been largely superseded by faster broadband alternatives, with fewer than 300,000 users remaining. The company, which once dominated the internet market, announced that the dial-up option will no longer be available in the U.S. and Canada after September 30, marking the end of an era for the iconic brand.</p>

          <p>Shares of lithium mining companies, including U.S.-based Albemarle, experienced a significant surge after reports that Chinese battery giant CATL suspended production at its Yichun Project mine. The mine, which accounts for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecasted for 2025, halted operations due to an expired permit. This development has tightened an already constrained global supply, prompting investors to anticipate higher lithium prices and driving up the value of related stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that the auto industry's focus on large, long-range batteries to combat "range anxiety" has made electric vehicles too heavy and expensive for many consumers. The author suggests that a shift towards smaller, lighter, and more affordable batteries could be key to advancing EV adoption, particularly for second household cars or city dwellers. By producing cheaper EVs with around 150 miles of range, automakers could not only improve their profitability but also create a new market segment for practical, everyday electric cars.</p>

          <p>The global transition to clean energy could be hampered by future shortages of key minerals like lithium, cobalt, and tin, according to a new comprehensive study. Researchers found that even under moderate emission-reduction scenarios, the world could face shortfalls of up to 12 different minerals by 2100. However, the article notes that technological innovation is rapidly providing solutions, such as developing batteries that don't use cobalt and improving solar panel efficiency, suggesting that fears of "peak mineral" may be overcome just as "peak oil" theories were.</p>

          <p>For beginner investors considering gold, this article outlines three important factors to evaluate before entering the market. Prospective buyers should first assess their short-term financial goals, as gold is more of a wealth protector than an income generator. Secondly, they must be aware of the metal's current price volatility and high cost, which has surpassed record levels this year. Finally, investors should determine how much portfolio diversification they truly need, as gold's primary role is to act as a hedge against inflation and market instability.
