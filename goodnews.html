          <p>In a late-stage trial, Eli Lilly's daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients lose almost 12% of their body weight over 72 weeks. While the results were slightly below some Wall Street expectations, causing a drop in the company's stock, doctors lauded the data as a significant and promising outcome for an oral treatment. The pill offers a needle-free alternative to popular injectable drugs, potentially expanding access for patients hesitant about injections. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year, aiming for a global launch around this time next year.</p>

          <p>The probability of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller being named the next Fed chair has surpassed 50% on the prediction market Kalshi. This surge follows reports that President Trump's advisors are impressed with Waller's openness to adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts rather than just current data. Waller, who was nominated to the Fed by Trump in 2020, has recently dissented from the Fed's decision to hold rates, arguing the approach is overly cautious. His odds have now exceeded previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett on the platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets like private equity, cryptocurrency, and real estate in 401(k) retirement plans. This move could open up trillions of dollars in retirement savings to new, and potentially riskier, investment classes that have traditionally been excluded from such plans. The action is seen as a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for greater access to defined contribution plans. The news prompted a jump in the price of Bitcoin and private equity stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a Trump administration executive order to broaden the availability of crypto in retirement plans, this article explores the role of cryptocurrency ETFs for long-term investors. It highlights the explosive growth and record inflows into products like BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust, which offer exposure to digital assets without the need for a crypto wallet. The analysis contrasts standard crypto ETFs with more aggressive leveraged funds, which are designed for short-term trading and carry significantly higher risk. The piece advises that for steady, long-term exposure, non-leveraged ETFs that simply track the price of a token are the more suitable option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The global oil market is largely dismissing President Trump's threats to impose heavy secondary tariffs on countries that purchase Russian oil, with prices closing lower. Traders appear to believe the threats are a negotiation tactic and that the administration will ultimately back down to avoid a spike in energy prices. The administration recently targeted India, Russia's largest oil customer, with a 25% tariff, a much lower rate than the 100% initially threatened. Analysts suggest that if the U.S. were to enforce harsh sanctions that significantly curb Russia's ability to sell oil, it would remove supply from the market and cause gasoline prices to soar.

This strategic action helps Apple on the tariff front, potentially making its products cheaper than competitors like Samsung if they do not also increase U.S. investment.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece posits that the decline of politeness, exacerbated by online interactions and AI, is detrimental to personal well-being. The author argues that being polite, even to nonhuman entities like AI bots, reinforces positive behavior and can increase happiness and lower anger. Conversely, rudeness and sarcasm, whether expressed or consumed, contribute to a negative state of mind. The article suggests three rules for personal conduct: make courtesy a habit in all interactions, renounce snark, and respond to rudeness with dignity. Practicing politeness is framed as a countercultural act of personal freedom in an increasingly uncivil world.</p>
