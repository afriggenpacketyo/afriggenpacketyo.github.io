          <p>Pakistan announced its intention to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize due to his role in resolving the conflict between India and Pakistan. The nomination follows Trump's surprise announcement of a ceasefire that ended a four-day conflict between the two nations. While Pakistan credits Trump's intervention, India maintains that the ceasefire was a bilateral agreement. Trump has repeatedly claimed to have averted a nuclear war and expressed frustration at not receiving credit for it.</p>

          <p>The NHS plans to map the DNA of every newborn baby in England to assess their risk of hundreds of diseases, aiming to predict and prevent illness. This initiative is part of a government drive towards preventative healthcare, with ¬£650 million invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The scheme will involve sequencing complete DNA from umbilical cord blood samples, screening for single-gene disorders with effective treatments. The goal is to provide personalized healthcare, reduce pressure on NHS services, and help people live longer, healthier lives.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is urging the House of Lords not to block the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill has been passed by the House of Commons, but faces opposition in the Lords, with concerns raised about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals. Supporters argue the bill includes rigorous safeguards, while critics fear these safeguards could be eroded, potentially impacting disabled and older people who may feel like a burden.</p>

          <p>Japan has been quietly preparing for supply chain disruptions, particularly in rare earth minerals. Following China's export ban on rare earths in 2010, Japan invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects and reduced its dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. This proactive approach positions Japan as better prepared than most for China's recent export ban on several rare earth elements, though challenges remain in cutting dependency in certain key areas, highlighting the ongoing need for alternative sources.</p>
