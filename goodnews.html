          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury's has officially ended talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise subsidiary, Argos. The decision was made after JD.com reportedly sought to engage on a "materially revised set of terms and commitments." Sainsbury's concluded that the new terms were not in the best interest of its shareholders and has therefore terminated the discussions. The company reaffirmed its financial outlook, stating it still expects to deliver a retail underlying operating profit of approximately £1 billion for the 2025-2026 financial year.

          <p>Oblique Seville won the men's 100m final at the World Athletics Championship, becoming the first Jamaican man to claim a global 100m title since Usain Bolt in 2016. The victory, celebrated by Bolt in the stands, is being hailed as the start of a new era for Jamaican sprinting. Seville's win, achieved with a personal best time of 9.77 seconds, led a Jamaican one-two finish with Kishane Thompson taking silver. After previous disappointments in major finals, Seville's performance demonstrated his mental fortitude and fulfilled the long-held expectations that he could be Bolt's successor on the world stage.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, calling for unity to secure a second term in government.
