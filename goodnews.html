        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEOs of NPR and PBS are exploring options to challenge the Trump administration's executive order to cut off public funding to the news and media organizations. NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger have stated that potential funding cuts would disproportionately affect local stations and their audiences, particularly in rural communities where access to alternative news sources is limited. Maher noted that NPR has 246 member organizations with newsrooms in every state, and potential funding cuts would damage journalists covering their local communities, while Kerger said they have never seen a circumstance like this and are going to be pushing back very hard.</p>
