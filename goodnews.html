          <p>Ticketing marketplace StubHub is reportedly moving forward with its initial public offering, targeting a September launch after pausing plans in April. The company has filed an updated prospectus showing 10% revenue growth in the first quarter to $397.6 million, though its net loss also widened. This move comes as the IPO market shows signs of revival after a period of high inflation and interest rate hikes. StubHub, reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, faces significant competition from rivals like Ticketmaster and Vivid Seats in the online ticketing space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that gold will not be subject to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have applied duties to certain gold bars from Switzerland. The announcement was made via a Truth Social post, leading to a subsequent drop in gold futures prices. The customs ruling had indicated that 1 kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars, crucial for backing COMEX futures contracts, would face a 39% tariff. The Swiss Precious Metal Association had warned the duties could negatively affect the international flow of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford is pivoting its electric vehicle strategy toward affordability, announcing plans to produce a midsize electric pickup truck with a starting price around $30,000. This move represents a significant shift from its more expensive models like the F-150 Lightning and comes amid slowing EV demand and changing federal incentives. The company aims to compete with both gas-powered trucks and more affordable Chinese EVs by simplifying vehicle design and manufacturing processes. Despite the ambitious goal, Ford CEO Jim Farley acknowledged the historical difficulty of launching successful, profitable budget vehicles in the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners' tappable equity reached a new record of $11.6 trillion in the second quarter of 2025. This gives the average homeowner approximately $213,000 in accessible value that can be borrowed against while maintaining a 20% equity cushion. The article outlines three primary methods for accessing this equity: home equity loans, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and reverse mortgages for seniors. It highlights their relatively low interest rates compared to other forms of debt but also cautions that the home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester Originals secured their first win in the men's Hundred cricket season, defeating London Spirit by 10 runs, thanks to standout performances from two young players. On his debut, 20-year-old Ben McKinney provided a fast start, scoring 29 runs off just 12 balls. Later, 22-year-old bowler Sonny Baker delivered a crucial and economical spell, restricting the Spirit's chase and taking a key wicket. Despite a strong innings of 71 from Australian veteran David Warner for the Spirit, the Originals' total of 163-6 proved to be enough for the victory.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order delaying the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods for an additional 90 days, pushing the deadline to mid-November. The move follows recent trade negotiations in Stockholm and prevents U.S. duties on Chinese imports from reverting to their peak levels of 145%. Currently, the U.S. maintains a 30% tariff rate on most Chinese goods, while China has a 10% rate on U.S. products. The extension continues a pattern of unpredictable trade policy shifts that have characterized the administration's approach to the ongoing trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

The service, famous for its whirring connection sound, was a gateway to the internet for millions in the 1990s but has long been superseded by broadband. At its peak in 2001, AOL had over 30 million subscribers, but its user base has dwindled significantly, with fewer than 300,000 Americans reporting a dial-up-only connection in 2023. The company stated it routinely evaluates its products and decided to discontinue the legacy service.</p>

          <p>Lithium-related stocks experienced a significant rally on Monday following news that Chinese battery giant CATL suspended production at its Yichun Project mine. The mine's permit expired over the weekend, and the temporary shutdown prompted investor expectations of rising lithium prices due to a tighter supply. The Yichun mine accounts for approximately 4% of the forecasted global lithium supply for 2025. As a result, U.S. miner Albemarle's shares jumped 7%, and the Sprott Lithium Miners ETF surged 14% in response to the development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed the most massive black hole merger to date, an event so large it seemingly contradicts our current understanding of black hole formation. The resulting merger is estimated at 255 solar masses, originating from two black holes that were each in the "upper-mass gap," a size range where they are not believed to form from dying stars. The discovery, designated GW231123, was made using the LVK gravitational wave detector network. Adding to the mystery, both precursor black holes were also spinning at near-maximum speeds, making them the fastest-spinning black holes ever recorded by the collaboration.</p>

Based on current top rates, a one-year CD at 4.40% would earn $2,200 in interest, while a five-year CD at 4.15% could generate over $11,200. The article explains that while CDs lock up funds for a set term, they offer fixed, guaranteed returns and are FDIC-insured.
