          <h2>Federal Reserve Holds Steady Amid Trump's Tariff Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 17:16:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates, citing increased uncertainty due to President Trump's tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the labor market's strength but expressed concerns about potential risks of higher unemployment and inflation. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to assess the economic fallout from the administration's policies, including tariffs on goods from various countries, as the central bank grapples with conflicting goals of maintaining a healthy labor market and stable inflation. Powell emphasized the Fed's readiness to respond to economic developments, but dampened expectations of rate cuts in June.</p>

The corner of the White House typically used by first ladies remains largely unoccupied, and administration officials provide vague details about her presence in Washington. This absence has drawn comparisons to Greta Garbo, creating an unusual dynamic for the role of the first lady.</p>

          <p>The White House withdrew President Trump's nomination of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat for U.S. Surgeon General, and announced Dr. Casey Means as the new nominee.

Dr. Casey Means, an entrepreneur and wellness influencer, is close to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.
