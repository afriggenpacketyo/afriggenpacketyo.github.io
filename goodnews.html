          <p>Falling 10-year Treasury yields are bolstering technology stocks, with Broadcom and Nvidia seeing gains after a recent tough stretch. This market movement follows a weak August jobs report, which has increased expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. Separately, BlackRock's recent acquisition of $80 billion in client assets from Citigroup is seen as a positive, incremental win for its earnings outlook. Meanwhile, a Meta Platforms partnership with Anduril Industries has secured a U.S. Army contract for developing combat goggles, signaling a potential new revenue stream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run, a major half marathon in the UK, have issued an apology after finisher medals and merchandise mistakenly featured an aerial view of the wrong city. Instead of showing the race's location of Newcastle and the River Tyne, the design depicted the nearby rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. The Great Run Company humorously acknowledged the error, calling the items a "unique" keepsake. Despite the geographical mix-up, the event's founder encouraged runners to wear their medals with pride.</p>

The company, known for developing the AI software engineer "Devin," has seen its annual recurring revenue more than double since the purchase. The new funding was led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, placing Cognition among the top-valued AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic. This rapid growth highlights significant investor confidence in the combined potential of Cognition's and Windsurf's technologies.</p>

The "Birth Companions" program pairs nursing students with pregnant individuals to offer emotional, physical, and informational support during labor. This initiative, now in its 27th year, complements a new Maryland state law requiring hospitals to accommodate certified doulas. The program serves as a bridge between patients and medical staff, advocating for mothers' needs during childbirth.</p>

          <p>A business-led initiative to repeal a new $30 per hour minimum wage for hotel and airport workers in Los Angeles has failed to gather enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. The ordinance, approved by the City Council in May, schedules phased wage increases leading to $30 by 2028. Labor groups, who had campaigned for the wage hike, celebrated the outcome as a victory for working people against corporate interests. The failure of the referendum means the wage increase, which was on hold, can now proceed as planned.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected President Donald Trump's attempt to overturn an $83.3 million jury verdict for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court found no errors in the lower court's rulings and deemed the damages awarded to be fair and reasonable. Trump's legal team had argued the amount was excessive and that a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity should invalidate the verdict. The ruling affirms that Trump was liable for defamatory statements he made denying Carroll's accusation of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Despite England's consistent success in World Cup and European Championship qualifiers, many of these matches are perceived as dull and routine by fans and pundits. The team has lost only four World Cup qualifiers in the last 30 years, often dominating possession against lower-ranked opponents who employ defensive tactics. This article explores how this pattern of comfortable qualification often precedes disappointment in major tournaments. While the primary goal is to qualify, the lack of jeopardy in these preliminary games raises questions about their value as preparation.</p>

          <p>Two independent reports commissioned by the disaster-relief charity FireAid have found no evidence of misused funds, concluding that aid is reaching communities affected by recent wildfires. The charity, which raised nearly $100 million, had faced scrutiny from politicians and some residents over its grant distribution methods. An independent review by law firm Latham & Watkins affirmed that FireAid acted within its mission and had strong accountability measures. The findings aim to counter misinformation and restore confidence that donations were allocated to vetted nonprofit organizations providing direct relief.</p>

        </div>

          <p>While the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has recently dropped to a near one-year low, it remains significantly higher than pandemic-era levels. This article suggests several ways for prospective homebuyers to secure better loan terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and reducing revolving debt, which can significantly impact the offered interest rate. Additionally, providing a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can lead to more favorable terms and help borrowers avoid private mortgage insurance. (not investment advice)</p>
