          <h2>Supreme Court Unanimously Sides with Gun Manufacturers in Mexico Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of US gun manufacturers, dismissing a lawsuit filed by Mexico. Mexico had argued that these companies contributed to gun violence in Mexico by negligently supplying firearms to traffickers. The court's decision hinged on the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which generally shields gunmakers from liability for the misuse of their products by third parties. Justice Kagan's opinion cited the recent Twitter v. Taamneh case, emphasizing that merely providing a good or service does not equate to promoting criminal activity, and that for liability to attach, a merchant must take active steps to promote the resulting crime. The ruling underscores the limitations on holding gun manufacturers accountable for the illegal use of their products in Mexico.</p>

          <p>The latest installment in the John Wick franchise, "Ballerina," stars Ana de Armas as Eve, an assassin seeking vengeance for her family's murder. While the film delivers the series' signature action and stylish visuals, the dialogue is often clunky and detracts from the experience. De Armas is praised for her physical performance and convincing portrayal of a killer, and the fight choreography is creatively staged. Despite a predictable plot, "Ballerina" offers entertaining action sequences and expands the John Wick universe.</p>

          <p>The government has announced a change to free school meal eligibility, meaning any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be able to claim free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible and save parents ¬£500 a year. While welcomed, some argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would have a greater impact on child poverty. Concerns have also been raised about the impact on school funding.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is bringing back its popular V-8 Hemi engine for Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a decision to discontinue it amid tightening fuel economy regulations. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis admitted the decision to drop the Hemi was a mistake, citing slower than expected EV adoption. The announcement marks a reversal in automakers' plans, as the Trump administration seeks to unwind initiatives pushing the industry away from internal combustion engines. The Hemi will be offered as an option on most models, with Kuniskis expecting it to represent a significant portion of Ram 1500 sales.</p>
