          <p>President Trump's meme coin contest, offering tickets to an exclusive crypto dinner gala, concluded with potential winners including foreign investors. The leaderboard of top holders revealed wallets linked to foreign individuals and entities, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. While the coin's price has fluctuated, some investors profited immensely while many others lost money. The coin's website initially advertised a White House tour, but later changed it to a 'Special VIP tour' arranged by a third party. The White House maintains that President Trump is abiding by all conflict of interest laws. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data indicates that the U.S.-China trade war has pushed the global supply chain near its breaking point, with President Trump's tariffs significantly impacting North American and Asian manufacturing. The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index shows a steep decline in April purchasing activity after a rush to stockpile supplies. While the tariff pause provides some relief, manufacturers remain anxious about long-term risks associated with China. The data suggests that the supply chain volatility should serve as a warning about the potential consequences if the tariff pause is not extended permanently.</p>
