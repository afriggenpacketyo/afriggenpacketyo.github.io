          <p>A federal judge has thrown out Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the 85-page complaint was "repetitive," "superfluous," and violated court rules requiring a "short and plain statement." The judge characterized the filing as a "platform to rage against an adversary" rather than a legitimate legal complaint. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to submit an amended version that complies with the court's procedural requirements. A spokesperson for Trump confirmed they intend to refile and continue pursuing the case against the newspaper.</p>

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has stated his support for two more interest rate cuts before the end of the year, in addition to the one recently approved. He believes the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will be a temporary, "one-time effect," leaving room for the central bank to ease its monetary policy further. Kashkari's more dovish stance is based on a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite current inflation running above the Fed's 2% target. His view positions him as a proponent of more aggressive easing within the Federal Open Market Committee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland have unveiled a new joint framework aimed at addressing the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles. The deal, described as a significant improvement over previous legislation, seeks to establish a new Legacy Commission and a cross-border body for information retrieval. Irish Deputy PM Simon Harris and NI Secretary Hilary Benn presented the plan as a final opportunity to provide truth and reconciliation for victims. The framework has received a mixed reaction but is intended to heal diplomatic rifts and move past the contentious previous Legacy Act.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea next month. The confirmation followed what Trump described as a "very productive" phone call between the two leaders, which also covered trade, the war in Ukraine, and the sale of TikTok. Trump also stated he has agreed to visit China in early 2026, with Xi planning a reciprocal visit to the U.S. at a later date. This will be the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders during Trump's second term.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 13:39:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated that he does not believe President Trump's tariffs will have a significant inflationary effect on the U.S. economy. Miran, who was the lone dissenter in the recent vote to cut interest rates, argued for a larger half-point reduction, citing a lack of evidence that tariffs are driving macroeconomically significant price increases. He noted that there is no discernible difference in inflation rates between import-heavy goods and overall core goods. His perspective places him in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee regarding the economic impact of trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran clarified that he was not pressured by President Donald Trump on how to vote during the recent interest-rate meeting. Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than the committee approved, said he received a congratulatory call from the president but did not discuss his policy decision. The statement comes amid heightened concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence, as Trump has been openly critical of the central bank's policies and its chair, Jerome Powell.

Phillipson, who is campaigning for the party's deputy leadership, stated she wants to put child poverty at the center of her platform.

          <p>The United Kingdom's recent state visit for U.S. President Donald Trump, marked by royal pageantry and praise from Prime Minister Keir Starmer, aimed to solidify the "special relationship."

Some analysts argue that securing a strong leader-to-leader relationship is an important outcome in itself, providing a gateway for future policy achievements.

A $50,000 HELOC with a 10-year term now costs approximately $608 per month, down from about $640 a year ago, assuming the current average rate of 8.05% holds steady. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they adjust to changes in the central bank's policy.
