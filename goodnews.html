        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the FICO credit score, announced a new pricing model that allows it to license scores directly to mortgage resellers, bypassing credit bureaus. This change, aimed at eliminating unnecessary markups, caused FICO's stock to surge over 20% while shares of credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax declined significantly. The new plan offers lenders a choice between two pricing models, a move seen by analysts as a strategic effort to disintermediate the credit bureaus and improve FICO's own economic standing.

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker reflected on the decision to conclude the "Sex and the City" revival, "And Just Like That," suggesting it was best to end the series on a high note while leaving the door open for a potential return. Parker also discussed her ongoing work as a publisher with her book imprint, SJP Lit, which champions novels with significant emotional depth. She highlighted her latest book club selection, "I Am You" by Victoria Redel, a historical novel about two female artists in 17th-century Amsterdam.

          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, reporting 497,099 units delivered. This growth comes just as a key federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers in the U.S. expired. Despite the rise in deliveries, production saw a slight decline compared to the same period last year, and the company's stock fell following the report. The sales figures were partially impacted by a slump in Europe, which was offset by a rush of U.S. buyers trying to capitalize on the tax credit before it ended. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has confirmed that a decision is "coming up" on whether to replace the league's current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Clubs have criticized the existing rules, which limit losses to £105m over three years, for stifling investment. An alternative being considered is a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's regulations, which would cap spending on squad costs at a percentage of a club's revenue. A decision on the potential change is expected to be made at a meeting in November.</p>

          <p>For the eighth year in a row, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world according to the World Happiness Report. Experts suggest this ranking is less about daily joy and more about a high level of life contentment among its citizens. This contentment is attributed to a strong social safety net, with high taxes funding accessible public services like extensive libraries, and a deep cultural connection to nature. The Finnish model emphasizes societal well-being and opportunity for all, contributing to a stable and satisfying quality of life.</p>

          <p>This article explores the strong connection between physical exercise and happiness, explaining how different types of workouts can improve mental well-being. Aerobic activities like running are particularly effective at boosting mood-regulating neurochemicals, while strength training can increase self-confidence and yoga helps manage stress. The largest happiness gains are seen when sedentary individuals begin a regular routine, with studies showing significant reductions in depressive symptoms. The author recommends establishing a consistent habit, tailoring workouts to specific emotional goals, and practicing moderation to avoid the pitfalls of exercise addiction.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a post-tropical storm after striking Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane, bringing heavy rain and powerful winds to the island. While a tropical storm warning remained in effect, the worst conditions have passed as the system moves further into the Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center reported that hurricane-force winds were recorded on the archipelago, but no immediate reports of significant damage were made. Swells generated by Imelda are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>A man convicted of starting two wildfires in Southern California, including the 44,000-acre Line fire, has been sentenced to 16 years to life in prison. Justin Halstenberg was found guilty on nine counts of arson for the 2024 fires, which injured six firefighters and destroyed multiple structures in San Bernardino County. Investigators were able to link Halstenberg to the scene of the fire using data from an automatic license plate reader that captured his pickup truck's location. The district attorney praised the conviction, noting the long-term environmental and community impact of the man's destructive actions.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Purdue University are planning an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate a "visual anomaly" they believe could be the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost plane. The object, located in a lagoon on the island of Nikumaroro, was identified in satellite imagery and has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart disappeared. The team will use sonar and magnetometers to scan the site before attempting to dredge the object for identification. If confirmed, the discovery would provide a definitive answer to the 87-year-old mystery.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the history of conspiracy theories surrounding Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, arguing that they are fueled by public appetite for mystery rather than evidence. It details how the narrative of Earhart as a spy was promoted for profit, partly by her own widower, and solidified by a 1942 film. The author contends that the truth is more mundane: Earhart and her navigator likely ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific. The piece calls for remembering Earhart for her actual achievements as a pioneering aviator rather than the myths surrounding her death.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical unit of Occidental Petroleum, in a $9.7 billion all-cash deal. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition in three years and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash pile. Berkshire is already Occidental's largest shareholder, and this deal will allow Occidental to significantly pay down its debt and restart its stock buyback program. The acquisition of OxyChem, which manufactures chemicals for various commercial uses, is expected to close in the fourth quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article addresses the common misconception among investors, known as "low-price bias," that stocks with a lower share price have greater upside potential than more expensive ones. It argues that a company's underlying value, growth prospects, and fundamentals are far more important indicators than its nominal stock price. Using the example of choosing between a lower-priced stock and a higher-priced Nvidia in late 2023, the article demonstrates how focusing on fundamentals would have yielded vastly superior returns.

          <p>With the S&P 500 near all-time highs, some financial experts are advising investors to reconsider the passive "set-it-and-forget-it" strategy of exclusively investing in the index.

Instead of relying solely on the S&P 500, advisors suggest broadening investments to include total market index funds, small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weighted funds to achieve true diversification and mitigate risk.

The shift affects popular brands such as Gatorade, Cheetos, and Mountain Dew, with about 40% of its products currently containing synthetic dyes. The process is complex, requiring years to find stable, flavor-neutral natural alternatives like paprika, turmeric, and carob powder, and to secure regulatory approval.
