          <p>Airlines are poised to transform their outdated reservation systems into modern digital retail platforms, aiming for a customer experience akin to Amazon or Spotify. This evolution, spearheaded by companies like Flyr, will introduce features such as a universal shopping cart, enabling passengers to customize bookings with different seat classes, luggage, and even integrate non-flight services like hotels and car rentals in a single transaction. Riyadh Air plans to launch as the first "digitally native" airline, completely bypassing legacy systems, which signifies a major industry shift towards personalized offers. This strategic move is expected to significantly enhance airline revenue and improve distribution capabilities by 2026.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric carmaker Nio's Hong Kong-listed shares surged over 14% on Monday, marking their seventh consecutive session of impressive gains, following the highly anticipated unveiling of its new ES8 SUV. This latest model is strategically priced significantly lower than Nio's premium offerings, especially under a flexible battery subscription plan, positioning it as one of the company's most affordable vehicles to date. The launch comes amidst intense competition within China's dynamic electric vehicle sector, prompting Nio to proactively introduce cheaper brands to attract a broader customer base and expand its market share. Deliveries for the new ES8 are scheduled to commence in late September, indicating a positive outlook for the company.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific stock markets, including South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Nikkei 225, experienced notable gains on Monday, closely tracking positive movements on Wall Street. This widespread regional surge was primarily driven by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's signals that the central bank might begin easing monetary policy as early as next month, delivered during his widely anticipated annual speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Investors are now anticipating a more favorable economic environment with potential rate cuts, leading to a broad market rally across the region. Singapore's upcoming consumer price index reading for July is also being closely watched for further economic indicators. (not investment advice)</p>
