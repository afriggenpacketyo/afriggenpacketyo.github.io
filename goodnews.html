          <p>In a rare television interview, Prince William has opened up about the personal challenges he faced in 2024, calling it the "hardest year" of his life. This period was marked by the cancer diagnoses and subsequent treatments of both his wife, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and his father, King Charles. Speaking with Eugene Levy for the show "The Reluctant Traveler," the Prince of Wales reflected on overcoming adversity, stating that such tests are what shape a person. Both the King and Princess have since returned to public duties after completing their respective treatments.</p>

          <p>A 6-year-old girl named Imani Dell from Miami was diagnosed with a medulloblastoma, a fast-growing brain tumor, after her family noticed her eyes were crossed. What initially seemed like a minor issue led to an emergency room visit and a CT scan that revealed a golf-ball sized mass in her brain. Surgeons at Holtz Children's Hospital successfully removed the tumor and treated a dangerous fluid buildup. Following the surgery, Imani underwent 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of a year, and has now completed her treatment and is returning to school.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), designed to give pilots critical extra seconds to avoid runway collisions. Amid a rise in serious near-misses at U.S. airports, this technology provides automated audio and visual warnings like "Traffic on runway!" to prevent potential disasters. The system uses GPS-based ADS-B data to detect conflicts, and demonstrations have shown it could have provided up to 28 seconds of advance notice in past real-world incidents. While not yet required by regulators, some airlines have already adopted similar alert packages, viewing the investment as cheaper than an accident.</p>

          <p>The "dirty soda" trend, which involves adding flavored syrups and cream to a soda base, has exploded from its origins at the Utah-based chain Swig into a national phenomenon. Major corporations like PepsiCo, McDonald's, and Taco Bell are now innovating with their own versions, breathing new life into a previously sluggish carbonated beverage category. This trend is credited with helping reverse a decades-long decline in soda consumption by attracting younger consumers and tapping into the desire for customizable drinks. For restaurants, it's an easy and affordable way to offer a novel treat, leveraging existing soda fountains to drive sales.</p>

          <p>A commentary reflects on the complexities of the First Amendment by revisiting the 1977 case involving a neo-Nazi group's plan to march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors. The ACLU, represented by Jewish lawyer David Goldberger, defended the group's right to march, arguing that their true client was the First Amendment itself. The courts ultimately ruled the demonstration was protected speech, establishing a critical precedent. Goldberger reflects on the personal pain the case caused but maintains that free speech cannot only exist for agreeable ideas, as denying it for offensive content allows officials to censor any speech they dislike.</p>

          <p>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is celebrating its 50th anniversary, with its legacy kept alive by dedicated fan groups and "shadowcast" performers around the world. These groups recreate the film live in theaters as it plays, engaging in an evolved tradition of call-and-response and prop-based audience participation. For decades, the film has served as a refuge and a safe space for queer and neurodivergent communities, celebrating non-conformity and providing a unique, immersive experience. The dedication to "screen accuracy" in costumes and performance highlights the deep connection fans have with this enduring piece of cinematic history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is actively promoting an "ambitious" youth migration deal with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow young people aged 18-30 to live and work in the UK for two to three years, similar to existing agreements with countries like Australia and Japan. Reeves is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential economic benefits of this scheme into its forecasts. This could potentially reduce the need for future tax increases or spending cuts to address a projected fiscal gap.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent anecdote from Leonardo DiCaprio, who was advised to change his "too ethnic" name to "Lenny Williams" early in his career, sparks a reflection on identity in Hollywood. The column notes that Benicio del Toro faced similar pressure to become "Benny Del," contrasting with figures like Martin Sheen who did change their names. Through a fictional parable about an aspiring actor who constantly changes his appearance to match others, the article champions the importance of authenticity. It concludes that the success of DiCaprio and del Toro proves that being true to oneself is the real key to making it in show business.</p>

Canada, who are not fully professional and even fundraised to support their campaign, reached the final by defeating the defending champions and are seen as playing excellent rugby.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A simple self-check known as the "thumb test" could help identify individuals at a higher risk for an aortic aneurysm. The test involves placing your thumb across your flat palm; if the thumb extends beyond the edge of the palm, it may indicate joint laxity associated with connective tissue diseases like Marfan syndrome, which weaken blood vessel walls. Cardiologists caution that the test is not diagnostic and a positive result does not mean a person has an aneurysm, but it should prompt a conversation with a doctor about risk factors. While most aneurysm patients will have a negative test, it can be a useful clue.</p>

          <p>Former NBA stars like Michael Cooper, Kenny Anderson, and Robert Parish are reflecting on the intense pressure that comes with fame in professional basketball. They describe a world where every mistake is publicly scrutinized and fans can cross personal boundaries, from following players home to debating their salaries on television. Hall of Famer Michael Cooper noted the shift in pressure from being a role player on the "Showtime" Lakers to being the head coach of the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, where he was solely accountable for the team's results.

          <p>The American state fair, a tradition dating back to 1841, has evolved from its agricultural roots into a massive annual celebration of food, crafts, and entertainment. Originally established as competitions for farmers to showcase livestock and crops, fairs now serve as pop-up theme parks that contribute $30 billion to the U.S. economy each year. While agriculture remains a core component, modern fairs are famous for their amusement rides, live music performances by major stars, and a vast array of fried foods. They also continue to be a vital platform for local artists and crafters to display their skills.</p>
