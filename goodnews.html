          <h2>Health Experts Suggest Iron-Rich Alternatives to Red Meat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 12:47:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals reducing their red meat consumption due to associated health risks like Type 2 diabetes and cancer, nutrition experts highlight numerous alternative sources of iron. Plant-based options such as lentils, beans, tofu, pumpkin seeds, and spinach are highly recommended. Additionally, certain seafood like oysters, clams, and sardines provide excellent sources of this vital mineral. Dietitians note that pairing plant-based iron with vitamin C-rich foods enhances the body's absorption. Fortified breads and cereals also contribute significantly to iron intake in the American diet.</p>

          <p>Two artists from American Samoa, Su'a Uilisone Fitiao and Reggie Meredith Fitiao, are creating traditional artworks at the Field Museum in Chicago for a new exhibit opening in 2026. The project aims to expand the museum's Pacific collection beyond its current focus on Hawaiian artifacts. Su'a is carving an outrigger for a 19th-century canoe, a craft vital for fishing and travel, while Reggie is creating a 'siapo,' or bark cloth art, using natural dyes and tools. Their work highlights the deep connection between their culture and the natural environment, ensuring these ancient traditions are preserved and shared.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) has opened a new firefighter training center in Merced County to bolster its workforce. The Atwater Training Center, the fourth of its kind, will train up to 300 new firefighters and company officers annually. This expansion comes as the U.S. Forest Service faces a significant staffing shortage, with over 4,500 vacant positions. Cal Fire's budget and number of authorized positions have nearly doubled since 2017, reflecting California's increased investment in fire preparedness and response capabilities.</p>

          <p>Kathy Ball-Toncic, who escaped the World Trade Center's North Tower on 9/11, is now preparing for her first Pan-Mass Challenge after surviving both breast and colorectal cancer. Her cancers are potentially linked to the toxic dust exposure from the attack, a connection recognized by the WTC Health Program for thousands of survivors. After enduring extensive treatments that left her physically drained, she found renewed purpose in setting a new athletic goal. This charity bike ride celebrates her recovery and raises funds for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where she received her life-saving care.</p>

The 33-year-old Chelsea player sustained the injury in June but started in all six of the Lionesses' matches. Medical experts suggest the injury was likely a stress or fatigue fracture rather than a complete break, which would have made playing impossible. Her ability to perform at an elite level despite the injury has been called 'remarkable' and is considered a testament to her mental resilience and the effective management by England's medical team.</p>

It is important to avoid strenuous outdoor activities during peak sun hours, wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, and take cool showers. Recognizing the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke is critical, as heat stroke requires immediate emergency medical attention by calling 911.</p>
