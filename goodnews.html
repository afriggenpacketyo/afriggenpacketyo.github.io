          <p>President Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released very shortly, as his administration continues to advocate for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The current proposal involves the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes amid reports that Israel's Mossad intelligence agency is seeking U.S. support for a plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to other countries. The administration has been signaling that a broader ceasefire agreement is imminent.</p>

          <h2>Argentine Actor Juan Pablo Di Pace Makes Directorial Debut with Personal Film 'Before We Forget'</h2>

          <p>Argentine actor Juan Pablo Di Pace, known for roles in "Fuller House" and "Mamma Mia!", has made his directorial and screenwriting debut with the film "Before We Forget." The movie explores a first love between two young men at an Italian film school, drawing from Di Pace's own adolescent experiences. Di Pace, who co-directed with longtime friend Andrés Pepe Estrada, emphasizes that the film is a universal love story rather than strictly an LGBTQ+ genre piece, focusing on tenderness and memory. The narrative shifts between the past and the present, where an adult version of the protagonist, played by Di Pace himself, reflects on his formative romance.</p>

          <h2>Vietnam Veteran Realizes Wartime Dream by Building Public Carousel in Colorado</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:43:57 EDT</div>

          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran, Scott Harrison, has brought to life a vision that helped him endure the Vietnam War. During his service, Harrison would listen to a music box and imagine a peaceful carousel in a mountain meadow to cope with the trauma of combat. After struggling with PTSD for years, he decided to make that vision a reality, purchasing a broken-down carousel in 1986 and spending 26 years hand-carving new animals for it. Now a nonprofit attraction in Nederland, Colorado, the "Carousel of Happiness" has delighted over a million visitors and provided Harrison with a profound sense of healing and purpose.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, landmark legislation creating the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan bill establishes consumer protections and clear legal definitions for these digital currencies, which are pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar to maintain a stable value. The law permits banks, nonbanks, and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins, a move the administration hails as a revolutionary step for financial technology that will strengthen the dollar's role in the digital age.

          <p>After days of criticizing the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, many prominent MAGA supporters are now rallying behind the president. The shift followed a Wall Street Journal story about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, which supporters decried as a media attack, and the administration's subsequent move to release grand jury testimony. Figures who had previously expressed disappointment are now praising Trump for taking action, unifying his base against a common adversary: the media. This development has temporarily cooled internal backlash, though it remains uncertain if the eventual document release will satisfy long-held demands for full transparency.</p>

          <p>A U.S. envoy has announced that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, have agreed to a ceasefire. The agreement, also supported by Turkey and Jordan, comes after recent Israeli airstrikes on Damascus, which Israel stated were to defend the Druze minority community. The U.S. envoy, Tom Barrack, urged all factions in Syria to lay down their arms and work towards building a new, united national identity. This development follows the recent toppling of the Assad regime by Islamist forces and a U.S.-brokered deal for Syrian government forces to withdraw from the southern province of Sweida.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to the White House physician. Dr. Sean P. Barbabella described the condition as benign and common, especially in individuals over 70, and confirmed that tests showed no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. CVI occurs when veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart, causing pooling and swelling. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise. The physician declared the president to be in "excellent health" overall, with the condition being mild and manageable.</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan backed by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its intention to create a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the site aims to attract companies in defense, robotics, aerospace, and other frontier tech industries, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. Project CEO Jan Sramek framed the proposal as a way to restore the state's legacy of innovation and production. The plan has been met with skepticism from some local residents, who question the necessity of building an entire new city for industrial development.</p>

The previous system involved U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervising the work of the more technically skilled engineers in China. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the old system "unacceptable" and announced a review of similar vulnerabilities across government systems, while Microsoft affirmed its commitment to secure practices.</p>

          <p>After several quieter years, wasps are making a significant comeback in the UK this summer, according to pest control experts and entomologists. The increase is attributed to a very warm and dry spring, which created ideal breeding conditions. While many people dislike social wasps for their stings and presence at outdoor gatherings, scientists emphasize their crucial ecological role as apex predators and natural pest controllers. Experts advise the public to remain calm and avoid swatting the insects, suggesting that leaving a small amount of a sugary substance away from picnic areas can serve as a useful distraction.</p>

The plot is loosely based on a 2004 tabloid story claiming Coleen threw her engagement ring away, sparking a treasure hunt. The show's creators stress that the play is a silly, medieval-themed caper and not a malicious satire, celebrating the couple's resilience and status as local icons.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland is expanding its RSV immunization program to protect premature babies, who are highly vulnerable to the common respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, will be offered to infants born too prematurely to have benefited from the vaccine given to their mothers during pregnancy. RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children, and this new single-injection treatment offers around 80% protection. Health officials emphasized that the move will help protect vulnerable infants and reduce pressure on the health service during the winter months, urging all parents to ensure their children receive recommended vaccinations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between gut bacteria and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria can over-activate an immune protein called STING in individuals who have a less effective version of a protective gene, OTUD3. This unchecked immune response leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and opens the door for developing more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway, rather than suppressing the entire immune system.</p>
