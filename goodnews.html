          <p>Former Obama speechwriter David Litt befriends his brother-in-law, a Joe Rogan fan, through surfing, highlighting the potential for connection across political divides. Litt's book, 'It's Only Drowning,' explores this unlikely friendship and the challenges of bridging cultural and ideological gaps. The article discusses how shared activities can provide neutral ground for understanding and connection in a deeply divided America. It also touches on the Democratic Party's struggles to connect with working-class voters and the need for more organic relationships with people outside of elite circles.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Pip Adam's novel 'Audition,' which uses outer space to explore alternative forms of human relation and escape Earth's prejudices. The story follows three giants hurtling through space, confined in a ship that gets its power from their speech. The author discusses how language can be corrupted and used as a means of exploitation, turning meaningful communication into distracting noise. Ultimately, the novel suggests that true possibility lies beyond the hard borders that separate and constrain life on Earth, offering hope for a new, unheard-of association.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban suggests two significant changes to improve the U.S. healthcare system, focusing on prescription drug pricing and healthcare payment systems. He proposes separating formularies from pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and forcing Medicare Advantage and Part D plans to buy from any provider offering a lower price than patients currently pay out of pocket. Cuban also suggests requiring providers to honor publicly listed cash prices, banning specialty drug pricing tiers, and making provider CEOs personally liable for billing fraud. These proposals aim to increase transparency and reduce costs in the healthcare system. (not investment advice)</p>

These moves aim to revamp Meta's AI organization after its Llama 4 AI models were not well-received. Meta is embedding AI across its business, from online advertising to the metaverse, and is competing with companies like Google and OpenAI in building fundamental AI models.

          <p>The Japanese and Indian governments are arranging for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Japan in late August to discuss adopting a next-generation shinkansen bullet train for a high-speed rail project in western India. The two leaders are also expected to revise the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to expand their security partnership amid China's increasing maritime prowess. The visit would be Modi's first since May 2023, and the leaders aim to strengthen communication ahead of a four-way summit with the United States and Australia under the Quad framework.</p>

          <p>The NHS plans to DNA test all newborn babies in England to assess their risk of hundreds of diseases. The scheme, part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness, will involve sequencing complete DNA using blood samples from the umbilical cord. The goal is to revolutionize prevention and provide faster diagnoses, with ¬£650m invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Experts caution that qualified professionals will be needed to interpret the data for patients and provide genetic counseling.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen has appealed to the House of Lords not to block a bill giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death, after it was backed by MPs. Critics, including Lord Shinkwin, express concerns about coercion of vulnerable people. The bill proposes that mentally competent, terminally ill adults with less than six months to live would be eligible for an assisted death, subject to multiple declarations, medical assessments, and a multi-disciplinary panel review. Dame Esther supports the bill, emphasizing its rigorous process and safeguards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been quietly preparing for supply chain resilience, becoming a canary in the coal mine for Beijing's mineral dominance. After China implemented an export ban on rare earths targeting Tokyo in 2010, Japan invested heavily into non-China rare-earth projects, stockpiling, recycling, and promoting alternative technologies. As a result, Japan's overall dependence on Chinese rare earths has dropped to below 60% from more than 90% at the time of the incident. Japan reportedly plans to further reduce its reliance on Chinese rare earth imports to below 50% this year.</p>
