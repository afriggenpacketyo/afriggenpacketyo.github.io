          <p>Researchers from the University of California Irvine have found that a combination of a green tea compound, epigallocatechin gallate, and a form of vitamin B3, nicotinamide, may protect against Alzheimer's disease. In lab tests on mouse neurons, the two substances boosted an energy molecule that helps the brain clear out damaging amyloid beta protein clumps, which are linked to the disease's progression. This discovery suggests a potential new pathway for treating age-related cognitive decline using widely available dietary supplements. However, the findings are preliminary and have not yet been tested in human trials.</p>

During a ceremony in Hong Kong, Science and Technology Minister Yin Hejun emphasized the revamped labs' role in supporting national development through innovation. This new doctrine involves clear mandates, direct funding from Beijing, and greater accountability to the government's science and technology agenda. The move, which affects around 500 labs nationwide, aims to streamline research efforts and create what are being described as technological 'war machines.'</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has responded to the controversy surrounding the cover art for her album “Man’s Best Friend,” which depicts her on her knees at a man's feet. In a television interview, Carpenter dismissed the criticism, stating that the image was not a topic of concern among her inner circle and that her intention was to explore themes of control and the lack of it. She explained that the artwork represents the humanity of making mistakes and knowingly entering situations that may end poorly but offer a lesson. Amid the backlash, Carpenter released an alternative, less provocative cover for the album.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1 billion for its upcoming Saturday drawing after no one won the grand prize on Wednesday. This marks the sixth time the game's top prize has reached the billion-dollar threshold in its 33-year history. The winner will have the option of a lump-sum cash payment of approximately $453.1 million or an annuity paid out over 30 years, both before taxes. The odds of winning the jackpot are about 1 in 292.2 million, and no one has claimed the top prize since a ticket in California won $204.5 million on May 31.</p>

          <p>Following her third-round exit from the US Open, British tennis player Emma Raducanu believes the world's top players have a "point to prove" when they face her. Her loss to Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina marked her fourth defeat in a major this year, all against elite opponents like Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka. Raducanu is now working with Rafael Nadal's former coach, Francisco Roig, to close the gap with the top tier. She identified improving her serve and the shot immediately following it as key areas for development to better compete against the game's most powerful players.</p>

          <p>Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic state representative from Pennsylvania, has embarked on a 105-mile, five-day march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. His solo protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he attributes to inaction by state Senate Republicans. Septa is facing a $213 million deficit, leading to service reductions that impact students, workers, and elderly residents. Kenyatta frames his march as part of a "time honoured American tradition" of protest, intended to highlight the starkly different priorities between the two political parties on the issue of public funding.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful. The judges found that the governing statute does not permit the homeland security secretary to unilaterally vacate a prior extension of TPS, which was granted by the previous administration. The court emphasized that Congress designed TPS to be a predictable and stable program, insulated from shifting political dynamics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded a strong August with a slight downturn, as the S&P 500 pulled back from a record high, ending a four-week winning streak. Despite the weekly loss, the index gained over 2% for the month. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the decline. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core PCE price index, rose to its highest annual rate since February, keeping price pressures a concern for investors. The market still largely anticipates an interest rate cut at the Fed's September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Salt Lake City couple experienced a surprise birth at the Burning Man festival in Nevada when the mother, who was unaware she was pregnant, went into labor in their RV. The phenomenon, known as a cryptic pregnancy, resulted in the birth of a baby girl named Aurora, who was about a month premature. Fellow festivalgoers, including an obstetrician and a NICU nurse who were camped nearby, rushed to assist before the infant was airlifted to a hospital in Reno for neonatal intensive care. The family, who was completely unprepared for a child, has started a GoFundMe to help with medical expenses and baby supplies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines but has significantly changed its guidance on who should receive them. Previously available to nearly everyone six months and older, the updated shots are now limited to individuals at higher risk for serious complications. This includes people aged 65 and older and those with other underlying health problems that make them more vulnerable to the virus. This shift in strategy marks a departure from the broad vaccination campaigns seen earlier in the pandemic, focusing protection on the most susceptible segments of the population.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's stock surged nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, largely driven by strong performance in its cloud computing division. Revenue for the cloud unit grew 26% year-over-year, an acceleration from the previous quarter, fueled by robust demand for AI-related products, which saw triple-digit growth. While the company's overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the cloud acceleration and a revival in its e-commerce business. The results indicate Alibaba's heavy investments in AI and new e-commerce models are beginning to yield positive returns. (not investment advice)</p>
