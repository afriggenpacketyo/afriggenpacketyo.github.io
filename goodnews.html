        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has stopped shipping products directly from China to the United States following the Trump administration's decision to close a tariff loophole. The de minimis exemption, which allowed low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import fees, has ended. As a result, Temu is now shipping all U.S. orders from local warehouses and has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform. The company claims pricing for U.S. consumers will remain unchanged despite the transition to a local fulfillment model.</p>

The article questions the validity of happiness metrics like the Cantril Ladder and explores the balance between affective and evaluative happiness, suggesting that contentment, rather than constant delight, may be key to Finland's high ranking.</p>

O'Sullivan, who has struggled with his cue, missed several shots, allowing Zhao to capitalize and secure the most significant win of his career.

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made substantial gains in English local elections, positioning itself as a significant challenger to the main political parties. The party has won over 660 council seats and seized control of eight authorities, including Conservative strongholds. Reform UK also secured its first mayoral contests in Greater Lincolnshire and Hull and East Yorkshire, with Farage claiming the party has surpassed the Conservatives as the main opposition to the Labour government. These results highlight the fragmentation of the British political landscape, with the combined projected vote share for Conservatives and Labour falling below 50%.</p>

The Clippers now have an opportunity to advance further in the playoffs, but their success hinges on Harden maintaining this level of performance. Harden's willingness to play extended minutes, despite fatigue, underscores his commitment to the team's success.</p>

The company projects continued revenue growth for the full year, and analysts foresee further upside potential for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the S&P 500 remains below its February high, and companies are struggling to forecast future performance due to trade policy uncertainty. The end of a provision allowing low-value shipments to evade tariffs and new taxes on imported auto parts add to the economic pressure. (not investment advice)</p>
