          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources has used a firefighting helicopter to haul abandoned boats off an uninhabited island in Puget Sound. The agency removed 14 vessels, its largest operation of its kind, to prevent further environmental disruption. The boats were found in hard-to-reach coves and mud, making an airlift the best option, and the federal grant allowed the state to clean up boats on Squaxin Island, which is of particular cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has shed light on the evolution of flight feathers, which allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers studied feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study suggests that the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift was essential to the evolution of birds, and most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria our bodies meet after birth can protect us from dangerous infections. The study shows that good bacteria, particularly Bifidobacterium longum, seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers collected stool samples from newborns in the first week of life and tracked them for two years, finding that babies with B. longum were less likely to need hospitalization for lung infections.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of an offshore oil operation near Santa Barbara. The ruling halts restart efforts on the operation‚Äôs onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without conducting any environmental review or public process, and the court‚Äôs order will remain in effect through at least July 18.</p>

          <p>Women using weight-loss injections are being advised to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Drug safety experts in the UK say it is not known whether taking the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. The UK drugs regulator is worried that popular GLP-1 medicines are not being used safely, as many people are buying them from unregulated sellers without any medical advice.</p>
