          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 14:01:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts since September 2024, renewing a $10,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account remains a surprisingly strong option for savers. Current CD rates, still comfortably around 4.50%, can yield significant interest, offering hundreds or even thousands of dollars over a few years. Crucially, CDs provide a fixed interest rate, protecting funds from the volatility of a declining rate climate, unlike traditional savings accounts. With another rate cut highly likely this month and more potentially later in the year, locking in a competitive rate now could be a final opportunity before rates drop considerably further, making this article a timely guide for financial planning.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched a pilot program designed to accelerate the rollout of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, or air taxis. Key industry players, Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation, are actively participating in this initiative, which will establish at least five public-private partnerships with state and local governments. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy underscored the program's importance in cementing America's status as a global leader in transportation innovation. This article highlights a critical step towards widespread air taxi service, with supervised trials anticipated to begin as soon as next year, paving the way for future commercial operations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Investing Club addresses a common investor question, advising that the price per share of a stock should not be the primary factor in investment decisions. Instead, investors should focus on underlying valuation metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, and the dollar amount invested, which determines exposure and potential risk/reward. The article highlights that technological advancements like fractional share trading make high-priced stocks accessible to regular investors, while dividend yield, not share count, determines payout. This perspective encourages a focus on fundamental company characteristics, growth opportunities, and management quality over superficial share price when making investment selections.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for leading a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 elections and "annihilate" democracy. The sprawling plot involved an online disinformation campaign and aborted plans to assassinate the newly elected president, culminating in the January 2023 riots in Brasília. Seven close allies from the military and security establishment were also convicted. This landmark ruling is a significant victory for Brazilian democracy, challenging historical norms of impunity and sending a powerful signal globally that leaders must be held accountable for undermining democratic norms, despite continued support from some domestic and international figures.</p>

          <p>A debate is unfolding among financial experts regarding the future of a record $7.6 trillion currently held in money market funds as the Federal Reserve prepares for its first interest rate cuts in a year. While some on Wall Street theorize this "wall of cash" could flow into riskier assets and fuel a stock market rally, money fund research firm Crane Data argues that such assets historically only decline when rates are at zero during severe economic calamities. The article highlights that a majority of these funds are institutional, which are less likely to move into the stock market. This discussion provides critical context for investors considering portfolio adjustments in a changing interest rate environment, emphasizing the differing views on market behavior.

          <p>An analysis of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) data reveals a significant long-term reduction in officer-involved shootings (OIS) since 1990, despite a recent three-day spike. The department's annual OIS average has dropped by 72% from 1990 levels, and 43% since new "command and control" training was implemented in 2018, which emphasizes restraint and coordination. The article argues that OIS numbers primarily track violent crime levels, not officer temperament, and that post-2018 reforms have consistently led to fewer shootings than crime rates would predict. This piece asserts that the LAPD demonstrates professionalism and restraint in its use of force, suggesting a positive trend in police accountability and training effectiveness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article revisits the 1985 congressional hearings where Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) advocated for warning labels on music with explicit lyrics, a movement fiercely opposed by musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister. Snider, a self-described Christian, argued adults already possess the necessary information to guide their children's music choices, while Gore championed "truth in packaging" for parental guidance. The PMRC's efforts ultimately led to the ubiquitous "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" stickers, which, anecdotally, sometimes boosted sales for artists like Ice-T. This historical piece explores the enduring debate over censorship, parental control, and the music industry's perceived influence on youth culture.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are striving to fix their inexplicably struggling offense, which ranked 30th in baseball during a five-week stretch, despite boasting a star-studded lineup. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman expressed disbelief at the slump, which followed a dominant first half. The team attributes the issues to a combination of nagging injuries, individual swing flaws, and a loss of focus on "team at-bats" and executing in leverage situations. With key players like Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts returning to form and Max Muncy back from injury, the Dodgers are emphasizing a renewed approach to competitiveness at the plate, hoping to avoid past postseason failures caused by offensive woes.

          <p>South African prosecutors have reopened a formal inquest into the 1977 death of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, 48 years after he died in police custody. Biko, a Black Consciousness Movement leader, was alleged to have been brutally tortured by police and died from a brain hemorrhage, despite initial claims of a hunger strike. The National Prosecuting Authority's landmark decision aims to finally hold individuals accountable, as no one was ever prosecuted despite former officers admitting to false statements at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
