          <h2>Egg Freezing Gains Popularity as Women Seek to Preserve Fertility Options</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 19:00:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of egg freezing is rapidly increasing among American women, who view it as a way to manage their biological clocks and delay motherhood for personal or professional reasons. While the procedure offers a sense of "insurance," fertility experts caution that it is not a guarantee of a future pregnancy, as success rates decline at each stage from thawing to implantation. The process is also financially prohibitive for many, with a single cycle costing over $12,000, and often not covered by insurance. Bioethicists raise concerns that this trend may pressure women to delay childbirth without addressing underlying societal issues.</p>

          <p>Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, suggests that artificial intelligence is on an exponential curve of progress and could achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) within a decade. In a "60 Minutes" interview, he demonstrated AI assistants like Astra, which can see, hear, and interpret the world with nuanced understanding. Hassabis believes these advanced systems could revolutionize science, potentially leading to the end of all disease and creating a future of "radical abundance." He also acknowledged the significant risks, emphasizing the need for robust safety guardrails and international cooperation to manage the powerful technology responsibly.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City metropolitan area, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the minor quake, which caused brief shaking and confusion but resulted in no reported injuries or significant structural damage. While earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, this event follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude quake that rattled the region in April 2024. Officials stated that a 3.0 magnitude event is not considered significant and that widespread reports of feeling the tremor are not unexpected.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, forcing the pilot to declare an emergency. The pilot of the Boeing 787 issued a mayday call while ascending, reporting a failure in the left engine. The aircraft safely returned to Dulles, where it was met by emergency crews. All 219 passengers and 11 crew members deplaned without injury. United Airlines confirmed a "mechanical issue" caused the diversion and subsequent cancellation of the flight, and is arranging alternate travel for the affected customers.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending a large ash cloud thousands of feet into the air. The eruption prompted an aviation alert for the sparsely populated region. This event occurred just days after a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off the coast, one of the largest ever recorded. Seismologists suggest the quake may have triggered the eruption, theorizing that its seismic waves could have disturbed the magma system of the already-primed volcano, pushing it into an active state.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office in its second weekend, earning an estimated $40 million. However, this represents a steep 66% decline from its strong debut, a more significant drop than other recent Marvel films. The weekend's new releases, the animated comedy "The Bad Guys 2" and the parody film "The Naked Gun," secured the second and third spots with $22 million and $17 million, respectively. Analysts noted that while the summer box office has had a strong start, its overall success will depend on the sustained performance of upcoming films.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has quietly overtaken California in the installation of new utility-scale solar capacity, driven largely by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop panels. State rules that fast-track development for smaller projects and favorable economics have fueled this boom, making solar a cheaper option than natural gas. However, the industry now faces significant challenges from new federal legislation that accelerates the rollback of solar tax credits, which is expected to sharply decrease rooftop installations. Grid constraints are also becoming an issue, requiring major investments in storage and infrastructure to sustain the growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on solid pitching and situational hitting rather than power to secure a winning road trip. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the shutout despite a tense bases-loaded situation in the ninth. The offense, which has been struggling, manufactured runs through aggressive baserunning, a swinging-bunt single from Shohei Ohtani, and timely RBI singles from Freddie Freeman. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team as they return home from a long nine-game stretch on the road.</p>

They are leveraging their public service backgrounds and openly criticizing the administration, a rare move for individuals from the traditionally non-partisan ranks of the DOJ, to appeal to voters.</p>
