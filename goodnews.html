          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in operating earnings for the first quarter, falling to $9.64 billion, compared to $11.22 billion in the same period last year; this decline was significantly impacted by a 48.6% decrease in insurance-underwriting profit, which fell to $1.34 billion from $2.60 billion the previous year. The conglomerate also faced a $713 million loss due to foreign exchange fluctuations, contrasting with a $597 million gain in the prior year. Warren Buffett cautioned that potential tariffs could further negatively affect the company's profits across its diverse business sectors including insurance, transportation, and retail.

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, a significant victory for his center-left Labor Party despite trailing in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. Voters chose stability amid global uncertainties stemming from the Trump administration, rejecting the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, who lost his parliamentary seat. Albanese emphasized Australia's commitment to addressing global challenges in its own way, distancing himself from overseas influences. While voters expressed concerns about the economy, both parties offered incremental solutions rather than addressing fundamental issues like reliance on the U.S. for defense and trade dependence on China.</p>

          <p>Inspired by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's public service announcement about atrial fibrillation, Warren Donaldson sought medical attention for his symptoms, leading to the discovery of a rare pericardiac cyst the size of an orange growing inside his heart. The cyst was compressing Donaldson's right ventricular outflow tract, causing shortness of breath and heart palpitations. Doctors performed open-heart surgery to remove the cyst and reconstruct his RVOT, allowing Donaldson to return to normal activities after recovery.
