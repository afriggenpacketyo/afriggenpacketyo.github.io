          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has declared she will "call out" the Labour government in Westminster when it harms Welsh interests. In a major speech, Morgan stated she will not remain silent if decisions from Westminster negatively impact Welsh communities, emphasizing the need for policies tailored to Wales' unique needs. She specifically urged the UK government to reconsider cuts to disability benefits and the winter fuel allowance, while also demanding greater benefits for Wales from wind power projects. Morgan's stance highlights the tensions between regional and national interests, even within the same political party.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that disputed ballots in the unresolved 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court race must remain in the final count, securing an electoral victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers stated that removing votes six months after the election would violate due process and equal protection rights. He ordered the state board of elections to certify the results, which showed Riggs winning by 734 votes over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin, though he delayed the decision for a week in case of appeal. The ruling prevents retroactive changes to voting laws that would disenfranchise targeted voters.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge that saw it reach multi-decade gains, fueled by speculation of pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. It weakened over 3% against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, following a 9% rally in the previous two trading days. Despite the recent decline, the Taiwanese dollar remains up over 8% this year against the greenback. The recent upward swings were largely driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt holdings.</p>
