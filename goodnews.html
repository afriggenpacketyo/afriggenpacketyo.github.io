          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is escalating his efforts to address homelessness by urging cities and counties to ban homeless encampments on public property. Newsom's initiative includes a model ordinance that municipalities can adopt, coinciding with the release of over $3 billion in state housing funds. While the ordinance doesn't specify criminal penalties, it aims to outlaw encampments, a move signaling a shift in the Democratic party's approach to homelessness. The governor emphasizes that no one should be criminally punished for sleeping outside without alternatives, as California grapples with a significant unsheltered homeless population.</p>

          <p>A listeria outbreak in the United States, linked to ready-to-eat food products, has sickened at least 10 people in California and Nevada, leading to hospitalizations and a voluntary recall by Fresh & Ready Foods LLC. Federal officials began investigating last year but reopened the case in April after finding listeria in samples from the company. The FDA found that six of the 10 people who got sick had been hospitalized before becoming ill with listeria, and Fresh & Ready Foods items had been served in at least three of the healthcare facilities where the patients had been previously treated. The recalled products were sold in several states at retailers, hospitals, hotels, and airports.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to revive a controversial policy to lower drug costs by tying the amount the government pays for some medications to lower prices abroad. The executive order will include actions to renew the ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äù policy, though the specific medications it will apply to remain undisclosed. The order directs agencies to crack down on discriminatory policies in foreign countries that suppress drug prices, and the Health and Human Services Secretary must set targets for price reductions.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the recent trade agreement with China marks progress in the U.S. reducing its reliance on Chinese products. While a complete break is unlikely, Bessent emphasized the importance of decoupling for strategic necessities, particularly after the pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in supply chains. The agreement involves suspending reciprocal tariffs, but broad-based 10% duties will remain in effect. Bessent also noted progress on the fentanyl issue, with Chinese officials showing increased willingness to assist in stopping the flow of precursor drugs.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt assured that any donation to the government is done in full compliance with the law and emphasized transparency.

          <p>John Cena, the WWE world champion, has partnered with Neutrogena to promote sunscreen use after being diagnosed with skin cancer. Cena had cancerous spots removed from his body during routine visits to the dermatologist, which made him change his lifestyle. Cena had always neglected SPF but is now using his platform to encourage others to use sunscreen daily, especially men, who are less likely to use it but more likely to die from melanoma. He emphasizes that skincare should be commonplace and that it's important to be proactive about skin health.</p>
