          <p>Chinese exports to Southeast Asian industrial hubs such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have seen double-digit growth in the first five months of the year, driven by rising consumer demand, offshore factory investments, and the need to offset losses from high US tariffs. These countries are becoming increasingly important trading partners for China, with closer economic and investment relations. Analysts suggest that some exports may be transshipped through Southeast Asia to bypass US tariffs, with factories adding enough local content to re-export goods as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia. This diversification reflects a strategic shift amid ongoing trade tensions. The article explores how Chinese manufacturers are adapting to global trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold by dealers, and less risky drug use among teens.
