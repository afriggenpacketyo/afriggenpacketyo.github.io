          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are navigating President Trump's increased tariffs by implementing mitigation strategies, such as diversifying sourcing and pushing costs back to vendors. While some prices have risen, the overall impact has been less severe than initially feared, with consumer spending largely remaining steady. Retail executives report selective price adjustments to avoid widespread increases and potential White House scrutiny. However, costs from duties are expected to continue through the fiscal year, affecting lower-income households more significantly.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda. As of Saturday evening, it was located about 405 miles south-southeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, moving north. Forecasters predict Fernand will strengthen over the weekend, potentially becoming a hurricane by Monday, but is expected to remain over the open ocean and move well east of Bermuda. NOAA had previously forecast an above-normal hurricane season for this year.</p>

          <p>Local politicians in Berlin-Mitte celebrated the renaming of Mohrenstrasse to Anton Wilhelm Amo Strasse, concluding a years-long effort for racial sensitivity. The change honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, an 18th-century African-born scholar and the first known Black philosopher and legal scholar at a German university. Despite a temporary court injunction, the renaming proceeded, with supporters emphasizing its significance as a clear sign of respect and diversity. This decision marks a step in addressing historically derogatory street names in Berlin.</p>

          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani has significantly out-raised his rivals in the New York City mayoral race, securing over $1 million between July and mid-August. Mamdani, who won the Democratic nomination, advocates for policies such as rent freezes, free public transport, and city-run grocery stores. Despite his anti-billionaire stance, he recently received a substantial donation from a hedge fund billionaire's daughter. Mamdani's strong fundraising and polling lead position him as a formidable candidate, despite ongoing political challenges from his opponents.</p>

          <p>Beirut's historic Hamra district is experiencing a cultural revival, symbolized by the reopening of Le Colisee cinema, defying Lebanon's deep economic and political divisions. Once a vibrant cultural hub, Hamra suffered during the civil war and subsequent economic collapse, with many businesses closing. This initiative, driven by civil society groups like the Tiro Association for Arts, aims to restore shared cultural spaces and foster unity. The cinema has even served as an emergency shelter, embodying the district's resilience and hope for a future beyond conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Los Angeles and 30 other "sanctuary" cities and counties. The ruling expands a previous decision, asserting that the administration's executive order to cut funding for jurisdictions limiting cooperation with federal immigration agencies is likely unconstitutional. The White House maintains its intention to appeal, arguing that sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and endanger citizens. However, the court deemed the funding cuts a "coercive threat" that violates the separation of powers doctrine.</p>

          <p>Ron Howard's new film 'Eden' recounts the true story of disenchanted Europeans who sought to create a utopia on a remote Galapagos island in the 1930s, only for their experiment to descend into petty power struggles and murder. The movie, starring Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, and Sydney Sweeney, is described as a lurid and entertaining exploration of survival-of-the-fittest. Despite its melodramatic tone and focus on broad strokes of personality, the film offers a charged ensemble performance and a compelling, if cynical, look at the human condition in isolation.</p>

          <p>David Mackenzie's new film 'Relay' is a smart, paranoid thriller that explores the anxieties of the digital age through the story of Ash, a solitary off-the-grid fixer played by Riz Ahmed. Ash specializes in helping whistleblowers disappear and navigate dangerous entities, using a traceless text-telephone service for communication. The movie is praised for its fresh premise, moving beyond the typical assassin narrative to delve into questions of uneasy peace with tormentors. As the story unfolds with clockwork precision and dizzying cat-and-mouse chases, it subtly examines the loneliness and moral complexities of Ash's chosen crusade.</p>

          <p>The US-mediated peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia, brokered by President Donald Trump, highlights a significant shift in geopolitics and Russia's diminishing influence in former Soviet Union states. While Russia officially welcomed the deal, some internal figures view it as a major humiliation. Countries like Azerbaijan are actively building new alliances with the US and Turkey, leveraging the 'window of opportunity' presented by Russia's engagement in Ukraine. This trend, coupled with China's quiet advancement in the region, suggests a multi-vector foreign policy approach by former Soviet states, challenging Moscow's traditional dominance.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience temperatures reaching 30C on bank holiday Monday, marking what could be one of the hottest summers on record. This warm spell, influenced by the remnants of Hurricane Erin, will be short-lived, with cooler, unsettled weather expected from Tuesday onwards. Large crowds are anticipated at major events like Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festivals. However, the heatwave brings concerns about travel delays, potential wildfires, and a significant shortfall in water, impacting agriculture and potentially leading to hosepipe bans into winter.</p>
