          <p>Oracle's stock surged 40% after the company reported an astounding $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, significantly exceeding analyst expectations and setting a historic gain since 1992. This performance positions Oracle to approach a $1 trillion market cap, driven by robust demand for its cloud infrastructure business and crucial access to Nvidia's graphics processing units amidst the artificial intelligence boom. Despite missing first-quarter revenue and earnings, the massive cloud backlog firmly establishes Oracle as a pivotal AI enabler in the rapidly expanding market. Analysts were "blown away" by the results, reiterating buy ratings and raising their price targets due to this momentous confirmation of the AI trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate Banking Committee approved President Trump's nomination of Stephen Miran, a top White House economic advisor, to the Federal Reserve Board by a 13-11 party-line vote. This advancement occurred a day after a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump from firing another Fed governor, Lisa Cook, and a week before the Fed board's crucial meeting on potential interest rate cuts. Trump has publicly demanded these cuts for months, criticizing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. If confirmed, Miran would serve until January 2026, but Democrats expressed concern over his plan to take an unpaid leave from his current advisory role rather than resigning.</p>

This new feature, anticipated to roll out as early as next year, will allow users in "most populated cities in the world" to book flights directly through the Uber app. The initiative follows Joby's recent acquisition of Blade Air Mobility, which already provides helicopter and seaplane services in areas like New York for approximately $195 per flight. This collaboration builds on an existing business relationship between Uber and Joby, dating back to 2019, to integrate aerial ride-sharing into the platform.</p>

The IPO successfully raised $1.37 billion, with $200 million directed to the company and the remainder to existing shareholders seeking to exit positions. Klarna, widely recognized for its "buy now, pay later" products, will list on the New York Stock Exchange under "KLAR," aiming to rebrand itself as a digital retail bank. Despite a widening net loss in the second quarter, the successful IPO reflects an increased market appetite for tech companies, though its plans were initially delayed by U.S. tariff announcements.

          <p>Amazon's Zoox has officially entered the U.S. robotaxi market, launching free rides on the Las Vegas Strip five years after its $1.3 billion acquisition. Zoox distinguishes itself with a custom-built electric robotaxi that lacks a steering wheel or pedals, designed from the ground up around the rider experience. While competitors like Waymo have a significant head start, Zoox plans to expand to San Francisco, Austin, and Miami, having already tested a fleet of 50 vehicles. The company has faced minor incidents and software recalls during testing but emphasizes safety, aiming for profitability and large-scale production from its new Hayward facility.</p>

          <p>U.S. wholesale prices, as measured by the Producer Price Index (PPI), unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, contrasting sharply with economists' expectations for a rise. This decline, particularly driven by a 0.2% drop in services prices, provides the Federal Reserve with significant breathing room to approve an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. The core PPI, excluding volatile food and energy, also dropped by 0.1%, further strengthening market expectations for the first rate cut since December 2024. This data, combined with recent weak jobs reports, reinforces the likelihood of an easing cycle, despite President Trump's continued criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are increasingly considering using home equity to pay off student loans, a strategy that can potentially simplify repayment and reduce interest rates, particularly for high-interest private loans. However, financial experts caution about the significant risks involved, as home equity loans are secured by the home, risking foreclosure if payments are defaulted on. Furthermore, federal student loan benefits, such as forgiveness programs, forbearance, and deferral options, would be irrevocably lost. Borrowers must also account for substantial fees and closing costs, making a careful comparison of all potential costs and benefits crucial before pursuing this option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2025 fall foliage season is underway, with new maps predicting peak color times across the U.S. based on comprehensive data models. Colors will appear earliest in northern regions, gradually sweeping south, with most of the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and much of the West reaching peak by mid-October. Regional forecasts suggest cooler, drier conditions may lead to more vibrant displays in the Northeast, while warmer, wetter weather could delay and subdue colors in the Pacific Northwest and Southeast. This year's patterns align with a broader warming trend, as fall temperatures have risen across nearly all contiguous U.S. counties since 1970.</p>

          <p>New draft guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advise both NHS and private fertility clinics to cease offering unproven "add-on" treatments, such as endometrial scratches, which can provide false hope.

Additionally, NICE recommends wider availability of fertility preservation services, including egg freezing, for individuals with medical conditions like severe recurrent endometriosis or those undergoing fertility-impairing treatments.
