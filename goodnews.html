The couple tied the knot on Saturday at a private vineyard in Santa Barbara, California, with 100 close family and friends, including their respective children, in attendance. Romance rumors between Baumgartner and Connor first emerged in July 2023 when they were spotted on vacation, and their relationship was publicly confirmed shortly after her divorce was finalized. Guests described the outdoor ceremony as "magical" and "authentic," filled with infectious joy and laughter, signifying a fresh start for the newlywed couple and their blended families.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring three significant market factors this week: escalating U.S.-China tensions, mounting concerns about credit quality, and the ongoing federal government shutdown's potential impact on economic sentiment. Earnings season is in full swing, with five Club names and approximately 80 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report results, offering crucial insights into corporate performance. Key economic data, including the September existing home sales report, will also be watched, as the government shutdown has delayed other official releases, creating an information void. These intertwined issues present a complex landscape for market participants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A five-day strike impacting hundreds of Kaiser Permanente clinics and hospitals in California and Hawaii has concluded, with the union expressing renewed momentum for bargaining. The United Nurses Assns. of California/Union of Healthcare Professionals (UNAC/UHCP) stated the fight for patient safety continues, despite no apparent agreement yet reached. Key points of contention include the union's request for a 25% wage increase over four years and increased staffing, while Kaiser cites above-market wages and the high cost of healthcare. Officials are set to resume negotiations, aiming to resolve the dispute that has affected patient care.</p>

          <p>A North Korean soldier successfully defected to South Korea on Sunday by crossing the rivals' heavily fortified land border, the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed taking custody of the soldier, who expressed a clear desire to resettle in the South. This marks the first reported defection by a North Korean soldier across this dangerous frontier since August 2024. The crossing underscores the persistent tensions between the two Koreas and the perilous nature of escaping the North, despite the DMZ being one of the world's most heavily guarded borders.</p>

          <p>The new film "Diamond Diplomacy" explores the long and complex relationship between the United States and Japan through the prism of baseball, tracing its history from Babe Ruth's 1934 tour to the present day. Featuring the journey of Shohei Ohtani and other Japanese players to Major League Baseball, the article highlights how baseball has served as a powerful cultural bridge. Ohtani's current status as a global icon and the face of MLB signifies a profound shift in cultural perception, making him recognizable even to those outside the sport.

          <p>A stranded goat beneath an arch of Longtown Bridge in Carlisle, Cumbria, triggered an emergency call-out after its initial rescuer got into difficulty in the water. Three fire crews, along with police and ambulance services, were dispatched to the scene to assist. Water-trained fire officers successfully pushed the goat onto the riverbank, where it was safely recaptured upriver, leading to a "satisfactory conclusion." The fire service later issued a public safety reminder, urging individuals never to attempt animal rescues themselves but to instead contact emergency services, who are properly trained and equipped for such hazardous situations.</p>

The squad includes new call-ups like former England Under-20s captain Emeka Ilione and 19-year-old Saracens wing Noah Caluori.

Through a QVC sketch featuring a suggestive neck pillow and her opening monologue, Carpenter playfully dismissed the idea of her being subservient to a misogynist male fantasy. A later sketch, where she played a "girlboss" character with a concussion, further allowed her to challenge those overly concerned with her sexuality, implying some criticism stems from internalized misogyny. Her performance was a self-aware and humorous pushback against her detractors.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has achieved a dramatic decline in per capita tobacco consumption over two decades, attributed to strong policies on taxation, advertising bans, and public smoking restrictions. However, the World Health Organization's regional definition, which includes India but excludes Indonesia, complicates data comparison.

This agreement, reached with the American Federation of Teachers, reverses previous actions that had paused forgiveness in some programs.

          <p>The UK government is reportedly considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, as suggested by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While Miliband would not confirm specifics before November's Budget, he emphasized the need to tackle affordability and the role of clean power in long-term solutions. Scrapping VAT could save average households £86 annually, costing an estimated £2.5bn per year. The government is also exploring reducing regulatory levies currently added to energy bills, aiming to ease financial pressure on consumers amidst persistently high energy prices.</p>

Polanski also advocated aligning capital gains tax with income tax, asserting that "unearned wealth" should be taxed as much as earned income.
