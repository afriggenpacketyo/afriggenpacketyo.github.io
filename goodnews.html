          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. projects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the fiscal year through next March, estimating 3.1 trillion yen due to U.S. tariffs under President Trump.

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its upcoming Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the company's initial sales forecast for the successor to its popular Switch device, set to launch in June. The company reported a 24.7% revenue decrease and a nearly 50% profit plunge in its fiscal fourth quarter, attributed to consumers delaying purchases in anticipation of the new console. Investors are focused on Nintendo's forecast for the fiscal year, with the company expecting net sales of 1.9 trillion yen, a 63% year-on-year rise, and net profit to jump 7.6% to 300 billion yen. However, the forecast is based on U.S. tariff rates effective Apr. 10.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has achieved a significant trade agreement with the United States, marking a win for the UK after years of seeking such a deal since President Trump's initial tariffs. This success follows closely on the heels of a full free trade agreement between the UK and India, estimated to boost bilateral trade by ¬£25.5 billion and increase UK GDP by ¬£4.8 billion annually. The deal provides a political boost for Starmer, who has faced pressure to reassess domestic policies following recent election setbacks, by finalizing the India deal and reaching an agreement with the U.S. Trump alluded to the agreement on social media, hinting at reduced tariffs on specific goods, with the UK aiming to lower tariffs on steel and cars.</p>

          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of the fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport, affecting hundreds of thousands of journeys, "remains unknown." Heathrow was closed to all flights for much of March 21 after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage at the airport. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found "no evidence to suggest" the incident was suspicious. Power was restored to Heathrow's terminals around seven hours before flights resumed late on 21 March. The report found the flow of electricity to all four of Heathrow's passenger terminals was restarted by 10:56 on 21 March.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is projecting a significant decline in operating profit for the fiscal year, citing headwinds from a stronger yen and a $1.3 billion hit from President Trump's tariffs in April and May alone. The company's chief executive, Koji Sato, noted the extreme flux in the current environment surrounding the auto industry, including trade relations. The murkiness of Toyota‚Äôs forecast underscores how the whiplash of Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariff agenda is upheaving the auto industry and leaving many global companies unable to estimate future prospects. The tariffs, including a 25 percent tariff on vehicle imports into the United States, are already impacting the company's bottom line.</p>

The company posted a stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit, reporting preliminary underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $2.71 billion. Trump's current policy includes 145% import duties on products from China, prompting Beijing to hit back with tariffs on U.S. goods.
