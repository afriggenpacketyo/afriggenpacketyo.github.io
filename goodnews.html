          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares worth approximately $1.6 billion. This investment was built secretly over two quarters, becoming the 18th largest position in Berkshire's portfolio. The disclosure comes as UnitedHealth faces significant challenges, including a nearly 50% stock decline this year and a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices. Following the news, the insurer's stock surged 6% in extended trading, signaling renewed investor confidence despite its recent struggles. (not investment advice)</p>

This slight decrease, coupled with record-high home equity levels, presents an opportunity for homeowners looking to borrow money. The article suggests that while HELOC borrowers can benefit from future rate cuts due to variable rates, those considering a fixed-rate home equity loan might weigh waiting for potentially lower rates.

          <p>David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve chair, has advocated for aggressive interest rate cuts. He argued that the central bank should not be deterred by recent inflation data and should implement a half-percentage-point cut to stimulate the labor market. Zervos joins a growing list of potential successors to Jerome Powell who believe monetary policy is currently too restrictive. His market-focused background is seen by some as a potential benefit for a Fed that has been criticized for being out of touch. (not investment advice)</p>

This decline has sparked speculation about when rates might drop further, with market watchers closely monitoring key economic data releases. The article points to the upcoming unemployment report, the next inflation report, and the Federal Reserve's September meeting as pivotal moments that could influence future rate movements.

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit is returning to the sport after signing with the Bristol Bears for the 2025-26 season. The 24-year-old winger had left rugby in January 2024 to pursue a career in the NFL, where he was part of the training squads for the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars. Capped 32 times for Wales, Rees-Zammit is known for his incredible pace and try-scoring ability. His return to rugby union is a significant move for Bristol and has sparked speculation that he could be back in the Welsh national team this autumn.</p>

          <p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a 10-year-old from London, has made chess history by becoming the youngest female player to defeat a grandmaster in a competitive game. She achieved the record-breaking victory against 60-year-old grandmaster Peter Wells at the British Chess Championships. Sivanandan, who only began playing during the COVID-19 pandemic at age five, is now considered a trailblazer in a sport traditionally dominated by men. Experts believe she is on a path to becoming a grandmaster herself and could potentially become a future world champion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The choice of Alaska for the Trump-Putin summit is significant due to its unique history and geography, which connects both Russia and the United States. Once a Russian colony sold to the U.S. in the 19th century, Alaska became a strategic front line during the Cold War. Today, the state maintains Russian cultural ties, including Orthodox Christian communities, while also hosting critical U.S. military installations. Its proximity to Russia makes it a convenient and symbolic location for direct talks, far from European influence and on territory that is not a signatory to the International Criminal Court.</p>

          <p>At MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, researchers are working to create the artificial brains needed for humanoid robots to operate safely and effectively in the physical world. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team is training a robot named Ruby to perform basic kitchen tasks by learning from human movements. They use sensors to capture data on motion and force, teaching the machine how to handle objects with appropriate strength and precision. The goal is to develop robots that can assist with household chores or in medical settings, moving beyond the repetitive tasks of current industrial robots.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, AI software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, with its valuation soaring past $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company recently secured a contract worth up to $10 billion with the U.S. Army. This explosive growth has led to a sky-high valuation, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio exceeding 280, a massive premium compared to other megacap tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a schoolgirl from Glasgow, has been named one of Time magazine's "Girls of the Year" for her invention designed to help homeless people. At age 12, she designed a solar-powered blanket that stores heat during the day to provide warmth at night. The idea was developed into a working prototype by an engineering firm, and 35 units have been distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was featured on a digital cover of the magazine and turned into a Lego mini-figure.</p>
