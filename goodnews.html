        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his passing at age 91, industry experts are reflecting on Giorgio Armani's dual legacy as both a revolutionary fashion designer and a masterful business leader who built a multi-billion dollar global empire. Armani was celebrated for maintaining strict creative control over his brand, ensuring a consistent vision of sophisticated, accessible luxury across all his ventures, from haute couture to home goods. He famously redefined professional attire with his creation of the softly tailored "power suit" for men and later, the pantsuit for women, which empowered a new generation of professionals. His strategic use of Hollywood celebrity endorsements, starting with Richard Gere in "American Gigolo," further cemented his brand's iconic status.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed by authors who alleged their books were illegally used to train the AI chatbot, Claude. The settlement, which awaits judicial approval, would compensate authors approximately $3,000 for each of the estimated 500,000 books involved. The case centered on Anthropic's use of pirated book copies from websites like Library Genesis to build its large language models. This resolution is seen as a significant moment in the ongoing legal disputes between AI developers and content creators over copyright issues.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her sharp written response to a dissenting opinion by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent case. Barrett explained that Jackson's "spirited argument" concerning nationwide injunctions warranted an equally "spirited response," emphasizing that the exchange was about legal merits, not personal animosity. Quoting her former mentor Justice Antonin Scalia, she stated, "I attack ideas. I don't attack people," and assured there was no personal conflict between them. Barrett highlighted that the court is a place where vigorous professional disagreements can coexist with collegiality and friendship.</p>

          <p>The eight largest U.S. technology companies saw their combined market capitalization increase by $420 billion in a single week, reaching a total of $21 trillion. A significant catalyst was the remedies ruling in Google's antitrust case, where the judge opted against forcing a sale of its Chrome browser, providing relief to both Alphabet and Apple. This decision removed a major market overhang and cleared the path for a potential deeper AI partnership between the two giants. The rally also included a surge in Broadcom's stock following a major new AI chip contract, underscoring continued investor confidence in the tech sector's growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The guide advises homeowners to consider their long-term plans, compare total costs beyond interest rates, and understand the potential impact on benefit eligibility and heirs before committing to a reverse mortgage.

          <h2>Weakening Labor Market Data Increases Likelihood of Further Mortgage Rate Reductions</h2>

          <p>The latest U.S. jobs report, which showed a higher-than-expected unemployment rate of 4.3% and minimal job growth, could lead to further declines in mortgage rates. A weakening economy often prompts the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to stimulate growth, and lenders have already begun pricing in an anticipated rate cut. The disappointing employment data may encourage the Fed to implement a larger reduction than previously expected at its upcoming meeting. This could push mortgage rates, which recently hit an 11-month low, even lower, creating a potential opportunity for homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the release of a weaker-than-expected August employment report, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This 16-basis-point drop represents the largest single-day decrease in over a year, providing some relief to potential homebuyers facing high property prices. The decline could save a borrower on a typical home nearly $170 per month. However, it remains uncertain whether this reduction is substantial enough to reinvigorate housing demand, as some analysts believe rates need to fall into the 5% range to make a meaningful impact.

          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online shopping or browsing is not a valid reason for dismissal. An accountancy administrator, who was fired after spy software tracked her visiting sites like Amazon and Rightmove, was awarded over £14,000 for unfair dismissal. The judge determined that her personal computer use was not excessive, a significant portion was for professional development, and the company had no clear policy against it. The ruling suggested the employer's true motive was to dismiss the employee before she reached two years of service, which grants stronger legal protections.</p>
