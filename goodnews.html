          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders has called for the NCAA to implement stricter uniform rules, similar to those in the NFL. Speaking at Big 12 Media Days, Sanders expressed his disapproval of players wearing abbreviated pants without knee pads, arguing it shows a lack of respect for the game. He suggested that fines should be introduced to enforce proper uniform standards and maintain the sport's integrity. The article also notes his recent contract extension and his reticence to discuss his past health issues with the media.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Barbara Rae-Venter, a patent attorney whose hobby in genetic research led to the identification of the Golden State Killer, Joseph James DeAngelo. It details how her technique, investigative genetic genealogy, was also used to identify a living Jane Doe and solve a decades-old sexual assault case in Ohio. While this method has proven highly effective in cracking cold cases by building family trees from DNA evidence, it also continues to spark debate about genetic privacy and law enforcement's use of public DNA databases.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is enhancing its security protocols with new technology. The agency has deployed a fleet of military-grade drones and mobile command posts to improve aerial surveillance and inter-agency communication. These upgrades directly address failures identified from the Butler incident, where a shooter's drone went undetected and radio communication with local police was not direct. The new systems are designed to prevent a repeat of the security lapses that occurred during the 2024 campaign rally.</p>

          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles cheaper for consumers. While she did not confirm reports of a £700 million subsidy plan, Alexander guaranteed that upcoming announcements would make the switch to an EV more affordable. The move aims to address the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier to adoption for many families. This initiative is part of a broader strategy that includes a £63 million investment in charging infrastructure to combat range anxiety and meet 2030 emissions targets.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Policy Adviser Calls for 'Self-Centred' Think Tanks to Bolster Soft Power</h2>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks must develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He stated that these organizations should become more "self-centred" and focus on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic frameworks. According to Zheng, this approach is crucial for accurately explaining Chinese policies and practices to the world. It would also enable think tanks to better predict the nation's future development and provide more relevant feedback on government decision-making.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, a 72-year-old French woman, has been awarded the Legion of Honour, France's highest distinction. She gained international acclaim for waiving her anonymity to testify against her former husband, who was convicted of drugging her and inviting dozens of men to sexually assault her over a decade. Pelicot's courage in speaking out has been praised by President Emmanuel Macron, and she hopes her actions will inspire other survivors to come forward. Her goal is to make "shame swap sides" from the victim to the perpetrator.</p>

          <p>A new retrospective in Manhattan, curated by his granddaughter, celebrates the work of Dutch-American painter Joop Sanders, who was the last surviving member of the original Abstract Expressionist movement. Sanders, who died in 2023 at 101, was a contemporary of Willem and Elaine de Kooning and participated in the landmark 9th Street Show in 1951. The exhibition at the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation aims to reintroduce his significant contributions to the art world. It showcases his dynamic and humanistic style, which he developed over a career spanning more than five decades.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have successfully docked in geostationary orbit, likely for a historic autonomous refueling mission. According to U.S. space-tracking firm COMSPOC, the satellites were observed in prolonged close-proximity operations and appeared visually merged for several days in early July. This feat of autonomous satellite servicing, if confirmed as a refueling, represents a significant technological advancement that the United States has not yet achieved. The operation was reportedly monitored by U.S. surveillance satellites positioned nearby for optimal viewing.</p>

          <p>This long-form article examines the life and career of Pamela Anderson, arguing that her cultural significance extends far beyond her roles in Playboy and Baywatch. It draws parallels between her and Marilyn Monroe, highlighting a shared vulnerability and the sacrificial role she played after her private videotape was stolen and released in the 1990s. The piece chronicles her journey from a small-town Canadian girl to a global icon, her recent career resurgence, and her decision to embrace a makeup-free public image. It frames her as a resilient figure who has triumphed over public humiliation with grace.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully developed a biotransformation system that can convert methanol into sucrose, or white sugar. Since methanol can be produced by hydrogenating captured carbon dioxide, this breakthrough offers a potential pathway to turn CO2 into food, addressing both environmental and food security challenges. Published in the journal Science Bulletin, the research details a method that synthesizes sugar using enzymes, bypassing the need for traditional agriculture like growing sugar cane. The system was also adapted to create other complex carbohydrates, including fructose and starch.</p>

          <p>The medical field is starting to take the significant pain associated with IUD insertions more seriously, following years of patient advocacy and social media discussions. IUDs have become a popular long-term birth control method, but the insertion process can be intensely painful for many. Recent recommendations from the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are now urging doctors to have proactive conversations about pain management. This includes discussing options like topical creams and anesthetic shots, marking a shift away from the historical minimization of women's pain in medicine.</p>
