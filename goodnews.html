          <p>The Republican-led House narrowly passed President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a single vote after weeks of internal GOP negotiations. The bill, which includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and immigration spending, aims to fulfill Trump's domestic campaign promises. The passage was a victory for Speaker Mike Johnson, who faced sharp divisions within his conference. The bill now moves to the Senate, where revisions are expected due to opposition from some Republican Senators. Key changes to the bill include adjustments to Medicaid work requirements and an increase in the state and local tax deduction cap.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares in Xpeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, have experienced a significant rally, gaining nearly 80% this year, and analysts predict further growth. The surge follows upbeat earnings reports and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Xpeng's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust sales, which helped narrow its net loss and improve its gross margin. Analysts anticipate Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of this year, citing strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models.</p>

          <p>The government is moving forward with sentencing reforms aimed at alleviating prison overcrowding, largely accepting recommendations from an Independent Sentencing Review. These reforms include earlier release for some offenders based on an "earned progression model," where good behavior is rewarded with early release after completing a third of their sentence. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has ruled out early releases for the most serious offenders, such as those incarcerated for violent, sexual, or terrorist offenses. Additionally, the government plans to expand a pilot scheme offering voluntary chemical castration to some sexual offenders.</p>

          <p>ASML has developed High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that is transforming microchip production. This advanced machine, larger than a double-decker bus, is the latest generation of ASML's Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography devices. High NA improves chip prices by enhancing speed, performance, and yield through higher resolution and fewer steps. The first commercial installation occurred at Intel's Oregon facility in 2024, with only a few machines shipped to major chipmakers like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. CEO Christophe Fouquet emphasized the importance of driving costs down to create more opportunities in the chip market.</p>

          <p>Lenovo Group, the world‚Äôs largest PC maker, is facing unexpected challenges from recent US-China tariffs, even as demand for AI products drives strong annual revenue. The company reported a 21% increase in revenue for the year ending March 31, reaching US$69.1 billion, with net income rising 37% to US$1.4 billion. CEO Yang Yuanqing noted that tariffs implemented in March caught the company off guard, significantly impacting its most recent quarter.

Concerns over broader macro issues, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability.

New estimates showed 431,000 more people arrived in the UK than left over the 12-month period, compared to 860,000 a year earlier - the largest numerical drop on record. The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving.</p>
