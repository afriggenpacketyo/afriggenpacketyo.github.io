          <p>Charles Rangel, the longtime U.S. congressman from New York City, Korean War veteran, and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served New York's 13th Congressional District for 23 terms and became the first Black chair of the House's Ways and Means Committee. Despite facing ethics violations later in his career, he remained a respected figure in Harlem, known for his dedication to affordable housing, urban revitalization, and equal opportunities.

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor to Germany for the first time in 34 years, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite Japan's net external assets rising to a record high, partly due to a weaker yen, Germany's gross external assets reached 569.65 trillion yen, surpassing Japan's 533.05 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets when converted, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. The United States, in contrast, had a net external liability, with foreign debts exceeding overseas assets.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker BYD experienced a significant drop following the company's announcement of price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models. The price reductions, aimed at boosting sales, sparked investor concerns about increased competition and a potential price war in the EV sector. Analysts at Citi, however, remain optimistic, expecting robust sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan due to relatively mild competition. Shares of other Chinese automakers, including Geely Automobile and Great Wall Motor Co, also declined amidst investor caution.</p>

While state-owned firms saw a profit decline, private enterprises and those with foreign investments showed improvements. The NBS attributes the profitability to the industrial sectors' resilience, while cautioning that constraints such as insufficient demand and external uncertainty persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>King Charles III is set to deliver a significant speech in Canada's parliament, expected to offer support amidst the country's dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump. The King and Queen Camilla received a warm welcome in Ottawa, marking their first trip to Canada since Charles's reign began. Prime Minister Mark Carney, recently elected on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment, invited the King to deliver the speech at the opening of parliament. The speech, written on the advice of the Canadian government, will likely send a diplomatic message affirming Canada's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, the former dean of New York's congressional delegation and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at age 94. Rangel, a Harlem mainstay, served in Congress for over four decades, toppling Adam Clayton Powell Jr. in 1970. Despite an ethics violation that led to his censure in 2010, he remained a powerful political force, instrumental in Hillary Clinton's decision to run for Senate in 2000. Rangel was a key figure in Harlem's Democratic old guard and is remembered for his political agility and impishness.</p>

          <h2>Apprenticeship Reforms Prioritize Funding for Under-21s</h2>

          <p>The government is implementing changes to apprenticeships in England, shifting the focus to providing more training opportunities for individuals under 21. The reforms will scrap funding for postgraduate apprenticeships, making employers fully responsible for the costs of level 7 apprenticeships. These level 7 apprenticeships are used by people training in a wide variety of roles, including accountants, tax advisors and solicitors, most of whom are already in work. Only students under the age of 21 will qualify for funding for level 7 apprenticeships.</p>
