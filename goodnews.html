          <p>NPR invited readers to share their most memorable moments with their mothers, receiving nearly 500 submissions from diverse backgrounds. Many stories highlighted life lessons taught by moms, including one from Michael Sweet, who recalled his mother teaching him about racial equality at age 4. Other memories included heartwarming moments like Bobbi Jo Dziuk singing lullabies to her mother in a hotel and Lora Hinkson reminiscing about her mom's sweet bread. The submissions underscored the lasting impact of mothers' advice, actions, and love, even after they are gone, as seen in the story of Bob Simons, who honors his mother's memory each year on his birthday, the day she passed away.</p>

          <p>Mathematicians from Fudan University and UCLA have solved the 65-year-old Kervaire invariant problem, a longstanding puzzle in the mathematical community. This breakthrough was achieved through major computational methods. The Kervaire invariant is a function that measures whether a smooth framed manifold can be converted into a sphere through surgery. The solution proves that manifolds of Kervaire invariant one exist in dimension 126.</p>

          <p>John Cameron Mitchell reflects on his spring college tour, where he encouraged students to find their sense of punk as a means to confront the challenges of a potentially post-democratic America. Mitchell emphasizes the importance of D.I.Y. collective action and community, drawing from his experiences in the military, theater, and queer activism during the AIDS crisis. He advocates for embracing the analog, reaching out to unexpected allies, and creating useful stories outside approved systems. The article underscores the need for empathy and collective action to overcome the divisions fostered by authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>The 1st District Court of Appeal has rejected Donna Adelson's attempt to remove Leon Circuit Judge Stephen Everett from her trial for the 2014 murder of Dan Markel. Adelson claimed Everett had improper ex parte communications with the state by reviewing search and seizure warrant applications involving her husband. The appellate judges deemed these claims "meritless and facially insufficient." The case also involves a recent criminal investigation into allegations involving Adelson and her attorneys, with the state intending to use some secretly recorded phone conversations at trial.</p>

          <p>Dartmouth College, unlike most of its Ivy League peers, has avoided direct attacks from the Trump administration, potentially due to President Sian Beilock's strategic approach. While other universities face funding threats and investigations, Beilock has emphasized free expression and dialogue, hired a former Republican Party official, and taken a hard line against protesters. This approach has drawn praise from conservatives but criticism from those who believe she is placating the administration. The article examines the complex balance between protecting academic freedom and navigating a politically charged environment.</p>

          <p>While electric vehicle exports from China to the UK have decreased, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles have surged nearly 600% in the first quarter of this year. This trend is driven by factors such as affordability and the UK's standard import tariff, which applies equally to Chinese and non-EU rivals. The UK has become a key destination for Chinese car brands, particularly for plug-in hybrid models, demonstrating a shift in consumer preferences and market dynamics.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decline in first-quarter net profit, attributed to lower oil prices and production. The company's net income was $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations, but free cash flow and cash flow from operating activities also decreased. This signals ongoing financial strain as crude prices remain low and global demand slows, prompting Aramco to reduce its performance-linked dividend payout.
