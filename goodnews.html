        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC has launched an engaging interactive tool, "Cooler Than Me?", allowing users to compare their local weather with forecasts from cities around the world. This feature taps into Britain's cultural tendency to discuss and often lament the weather, offering a novel way to see if other places are indeed "greener and more pleasant." Users can explore the latest forecasts on the BBC Weather website, potentially transforming into armchair meteorologists. This playful approach encourages public engagement with meteorological data, moving beyond anecdotal observations to data-driven comparisons of global climate variations.</p>

          <p>A monumental $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in U.S. lottery history, has been won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. This significant payout concludes a three-month streak without a grand prize winner, tying the game's record for consecutive drawings. The fortunate ticketholders will share the colossal sum, with options for a lump sum cash payment of approximately $410.3 million each or 30 escalating annual installments. This historic win, achieved against immense odds of 1 in 292.2 million, underscores the life-changing potential of lottery games, which also contribute significantly to public causes through ticket sales.

          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy, son of Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, is launching his first major tour in 45 years, "The Road to Us Tour." The 66-year-old, who stepped back from the limelight for a career in television writing and producing, had to relearn his own songs and guitar skills for this comeback. Cassidy, known for hits like "Da Doo Ron Ron" and his role in "The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries," expressed that performing now feels fresh as he focuses on storytelling and songs that resonate with him today. The 50-city tour, starting September 13, will feature classic hits, new music, and personal anecdotes from his unique career trajectory.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, rallying support against what they termed "oligarchic control" in the U.S. and New York. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist backed by progressives, vowed to freeze rent, increase housing, and raise taxes on the city's wealthiest 1%. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a "test case" for democracy against billionaire donors and media oligarchs, criticizing mainstream Democrats for not fully supporting him. The event highlighted Mamdani's commitment to representing working-class and low-income communities, addressing issues like immigration and housing justice amidst a contentious mayoral race.</p>

The team amassed 755 total yards, the most in two decades for USC, including 309 rushing yards. Despite a sloppy start with a fumble and penalty, the Trojans quickly found their rhythm. While the defense had some breakdowns, the overwhelming offensive performance secured a dominant win, leaving head coach Lincoln Riley with much to celebrate against his predecessor.</p>

          <h2>US-China Research Team Develops Novel Robot Launch Method Using Bubble Cavitation</h2>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method for launching millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This groundbreaking technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, which causes water droplets on the surface to boil, triggering the formation of vapor bubbles. Once these bubbles grow to a critical point, they suddenly collapse, releasing energy and creating a strong force capable of propelling tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. Published in the peer-reviewed journal "Science," the study demonstrates that cavitation can serve as an incredibly efficient launching mechanism for micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her US Open title, defeating home favorite Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) to secure her fourth Grand Slam singles trophy. Sabalenka, who had faced emotional composure challenges in earlier Grand Slam finals this year, delivered a largely assured performance, avenging her Wimbledon semi-final loss to Anisimova. The Belarusian dropped to her knees in emotion after the victory, which came despite failing to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set. Anisimova, though improving from her previous final, was left in tears after another major defeat.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S. are adopting locked magnetic pouches, like those from Yondr, to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, impacting millions of students in 35 states. The pouches, which students keep but can only unlock with school-based magnets, aim to reduce distractions and foster a more engaged learning environment. While some students welcome the change, others are devising ways to bypass the restrictions. Educators and parents largely support the initiative, hoping to shift students away from constant digital engagement. The article notes the cost of these pouches and the ongoing efforts to create a culture change conducive to learning.</p>

The article emphasizes a moment of "bonhomie" between Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signaling a potential shift towards a multipolar world. The SCO, a Eurasian institution, focuses on combating terrorism and integrating economic initiatives like China's Belt and Road.

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is poised to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint, with his canonization presided over by Pope Leo. Known as "God's influencer" for creating websites documenting "miracles" to spread Catholic teaching, Acutis died of leukemia at 15. His body, preserved in wax, lies in Assisi, a pilgrimage site that has seen increased visitors, as has Our Lady of Dolours Church in London, where he was baptized. Two miracles were attributed to him, including the healing of a woman with breast cancer. The Vatican reportedly fast-tracked his canonization to inspire faith in young people, recognizing his modern approach to evangelism.</p>

The article questions whether the print magazine, a "relic to some" in a fast-paced digital world, can maintain its clout without Wintour's singular influence.

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, aiming to enhance security and streamline travel for non-EU citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area. Starting October 12, the system will replace manual passport stamping, requiring travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and photos, at kiosks during their first use. Concerns persist about potential long queues during the initial registration phase, particularly at busy points like Dover and Eurostar terminals. The registration will be valid for three years, with the system expected to be fully active across all 29 participating countries by April 2026.</p>
