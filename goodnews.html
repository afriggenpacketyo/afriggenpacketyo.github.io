          <h2>Trump to Officially Designate Persian Gulf as Arabian Gulf</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 22:23:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump plans to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia during his trip to Saudi Arabia next week. This move aligns with the preferences of Arab nations, who have advocated for this change, while Iran maintains its historical ties to the name Persian Gulf. While the U.S. military has already been using the term Arabian Gulf in its communications, this formal change by the President could be seen as a symbolic gesture of support towards Gulf countries. The International Hydrographic Organization works to standardize the names of bodies of water, but countries often use different names in their own documentation.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney asserted Canada's independence and unwillingness to become part of the U.S. during a meeting with President Trump, who has repeatedly suggested the idea of acquiring Canada. Carney emphasized that Canada is "not for sale" and focused on the importance of partnership between the two countries. Despite tensions on trade and borders, Carney conveyed a firm stance against further integration, prompting discussions on trade and global issues of common concern. Trump acknowledged the friendly nature of the meeting but did not entirely dismiss the idea of Canada joining the U.S. in the future.</p>

          <p>Long Beach has introduced four "smart" public restrooms with time limits to address restroom gaps in high-traffic areas. The restrooms, known as Thrones, are accessed via QR codes or access cards and feature digital signs indicating availability. The 7-by-8-foot restrooms cost $6,200 per month each for a four-month trial. The units have a 10-minute time limit to discourage loitering and enhance safety, with lights flashing and a recorded message prompting users to leave after the time expires. The city will analyze usage data and cost to determine whether to continue the program.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a friendly tone during a meeting with Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney, a stark contrast to his previous rhetoric about acquiring Canada. Despite earlier posts criticizing Canada, Trump expressed his love for the country and emphasized the importance of friendship. Carney, however, firmly asserted Canada's independence and rejected any notion of becoming the 51st state. Trump touched on various unrelated topics, including Barack Obama‚Äôs presidential library and diplomacy with the Houthis in Yemen, while Carney remained guarded and focused on maintaining Canada's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A plant in Shanxi, China, is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminium from China‚Äôs low-grade ore that was previously unusable. The technology, developed by Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method. This could reduce China's reliance on imported aluminium ore from Guinea and Australia. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum in 2023 to implement the technology.</p>

          <p>A Canadian retailer, Luke Therrien, CEO of his company, is forging direct ties with Chinese suppliers amid deepening trade tensions and tariff issues between the US and China. By cutting out American middlemen, Therrien aims to create a more sustainable and cost-efficient supply chain. The move involves navigating logistical hurdles and increased workload but is expected to improve pricing in the long run. This shift highlights how the trade war is reshaping global supply chains, prompting businesses to find new ways to source products outside of the US.</p>
