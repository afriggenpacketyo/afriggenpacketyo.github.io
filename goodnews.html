          <p>This article explores the ongoing debate surrounding single-staircase apartment buildings in the United States. Unlike many other countries, the U.S. typically requires apartment buildings taller than three stories to have two staircases, which can increase construction costs and limit design flexibility. Advocates argue that allowing single-stair buildings could lead to more affordable housing and more family-friendly units. However, fire safety officials express concerns about safety, leading to ongoing discussions and policy changes in various states.</p>
