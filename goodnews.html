          <p>AlphaSense CEO Jack Kokko, a former Wall Street analyst, discusses Deep Research, an AI tool designed to function like a team of analysts operating at superhuman speed, generating research and market insights from over 500 million business and financial documents. The tool taps into filings, press releases, content about public and private companies, and expert insights based on call transcripts. Kokko argues that this AI will augment analysts' capabilities by rapidly processing vast amounts of information, enabling them to ask and answer questions more efficiently. The tool can offer both pro and con positions, providing internal and external perspectives in record time, a task that would have taken human analysts days or weeks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that trade talks with China, taking place in London, might extend into a third day as both sides work on various trade issues. The talks are an attempt to defuse tensions between the world‚Äôs two largest economies over trade and technology, despite a temporary deal to scale back tariffs last month. This meeting follows a recent phone call between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump, where they agreed to push forward with negotiations to resolve ongoing economic disputes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney CEO Bob Iger believes that taking full control of Hulu will unlock new growth opportunities for the company, with Disney set to finalize its acquisition of NBCUniversal's stake in Hulu by July 24. Iger stated that this acquisition is the first big step in turning Hulu into a real growth business for Disney, allowing for better bundling capabilities with Disney+ and ESPN+. Integrating the apps fully will create a seamless experience for consumers, save operational costs, and reduce customer churn. Disney's streaming business achieved profitability in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which further improved in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and Hulu's full integration strengthens Disney's direct-to-consumer business.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian Air Force (UAF) has reportedly used a Lockheed Martin F-16 to shoot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-35S fighter-bomber, marking the F-16's first air-to-air kill in the conflict. The incident occurred near Korenevo in the Kursk region of Russia, with alleged support from a Saab 340 airborne early warning and control plane. The F-16AM involved was originally from the Netherlands, which has provided 24 such planes to Ukraine. This success suggests that the introduction of F-16s is altering the balance of power in the air, making it more challenging for Russia to deploy its air assets.</p>

          <p>The film *Ballerina*, a spin-off from the *John Wick* franchise, initially struggles to capture the stylistic flair of its source material, focusing on a generic revenge plot. However, it eventually succeeds by expanding the *Wick* universe with inventive stunts and bizarre scenarios, such as a cultish mountain town where every inhabitant is an assassin. Ana de Armas delivers a charming performance in action sequences that recall the mayhem of Buster Keaton and Looney Tunes. While *Ballerina* opened below expectations, it ultimately attempts to expand the *Wick* canon rather than deepen its titular protagonist, contributing to the franchise's world-building.</p>
