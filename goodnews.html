          <p>Best Buy is partnering with Ikea to test a new "shop-in-shop" concept, featuring mini-showrooms of Ikea kitchen and laundry room designs inside select Best Buy stores. The pilot program will launch this fall in ten stores across Florida and Texas, creating a 1,000-square-foot space where customers can see Ikea home furnishings alongside Best Buy's home appliances. The collaboration aims to create a one-stop destination for customers designing their home spaces. This initiative represents a new strategy for Best Buy to attract shoppers and enhance its in-store experience.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 90-day extension of the current trade deal with Mexico, delaying the implementation of new tariffs as negotiations continue. The decision came after a conversation between President Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Under the extension, Mexico will continue to face a 25% tariff on fentanyl and cars, and a 50% tariff on certain metals. Trump also stated that Mexico agreed to terminate its non-tariff trade barriers, though this was not confirmed by Sheinbaum, providing temporary stability for businesses amid ongoing global trade uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A Michigan program called Rx Kids is providing unconditional cash payments to new mothers, gaining attention as a potential national model for supporting families. The program, funded by a mix of state and private money, gives pregnant women $1,500 and then $500 monthly for the first year of their child's life, with no income requirements. Supporters, including Republicans and Democrats, argue it effectively mitigates child poverty and supports families during a critical developmental period. The initiative is being praised for its simplicity and for directly addressing the high costs associated with raising a child.</p>

          <p>The College Sports Commission (CSC), the new agency overseeing name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, has relaxed its standards regarding payments to athletes from third-party collectives. The updated guidance now considers a deal to have a "valid business purpose" if it involves promoting goods or services sold for profit, removing a previous interpretation that threatened many existing collective models. This change came after plaintiff attorneys in the landmark House settlement case threatened further legal action. The new rules provide more clarity and flexibility for how athletes can be compensated, though the CSC will still vet deals for fair market value.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled draft proposals to impose fines on large companies that persistently fail to pay their smaller suppliers on time. The plan would empower the small business commissioner to penalize firms with over 250 employees if they do not pay a significant portion of their invoices within a six-month window. Additionally, the proposals would cap invoice payment terms at a maximum of 60 days. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated the move addresses the "number one issue" for small businesses, aiming to alleviate cash flow problems caused by an estimated £26 billion in late payments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genetic study has revealed a remarkable evolutionary origin for the potato, suggesting the entire lineage arose from the hybridization of an ancient tomato and another flowering plant. Researchers found that this chance union, occurring 8 to 9 million years ago, created a new species with a novel ability: forming tubers. Neither parent plant could create these nutrient-storage organs, but the hybrid combined the right genetic traits to do so, allowing it to thrive in new, harsher environments. This discovery reshapes our understanding of the potato's history and highlights hybridization as a powerful, creative force in evolution.</p>

In these extreme environments, characterized by crushing pressure and a lack of sunlight, scientists were surprised by the scale of this larger marine life. Researchers believe these creatures survive not on nutrients trickling down, but by capitalizing on chemical energy produced by microbes from carbon accumulated on the trench floor. The discovery challenges previous assumptions about the limits of life and opens new avenues for studying adaptation in extreme environments.</p>
