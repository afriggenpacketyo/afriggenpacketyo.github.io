        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan announced it would slow its reduction of government bond purchases starting April of next year, while maintaining the benchmark rate at 0.5%. This decision aligns with economists' expectations and reflects concerns about rising growth risks in Japan's economy. The central bank plans to decrease monthly bond purchases by approximately 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026 to March 2027, targeting a monthly purchase amount of around 2 trillion yen. Japan's economic growth faces uncertainty, and inflation has exceeded the BOJ's target for about three years, but the bank expects accommodative financial conditions to provide support.

          <p>Gold has surpassed traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities, contrasting with assets tied to specific economies. Concerns over fiscal sustainability and ongoing wars have fueled demand for gold as a reliable store of value. While the dollar index has weakened and Treasury yields have decreased, gold prices have consistently reached new highs.</p>

One amendment aims to prevent women from being investigated for terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside of existing law. Recent data shows a rise in investigations related to suspected abortion offenses.</p>
