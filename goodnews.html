Strong earnings reports from major financial institutions like Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs were offset by disclosures of bad loans from Zions and Western Alliance, which caused a temporary selloff in financial stocks. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the week's financial news, including quarterly results from BlackRock, Abbott Labs, and Salesforce's positive long-term forecast, reflecting a market grappling with conflicting economic indicators.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a federal government shutdown, Washington D.C.'s official tourism bureau, Destination DC, has launched a campaign to assure visitors that the city remains open for business and leisure. The "DC is Open" initiative emphasizes that while federal institutions like the Smithsonian museums are closed, most of the capital's attractions, including private museums, restaurants, hotels, and memorials on the National Mall, are unaffected. The campaign aims to counteract the assumption that the entire city ceases to function during a shutdown, thereby protecting the local tourism industry, which drew 27.2 million visitors and $11.4 billion in spending last year.</p>

          <p>The German publishing house PONS Langenscheidt has announced that "Das crazy," a mix of German and English, is the Youth Word of the Year for 2025. The phrase, which deliberately breaks grammatical rules, is widely used by young Germans in internet culture to express surprise, speechlessness, or to keep a conversation going. Selected through an online vote with two million participants, the term's victory highlights the growing influence of English and a trend toward brevity in youth language. The announcement was made at the Frankfurt Book Fair, with the selection reflecting the contemporary linguistic habits of Germany's younger generation.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) and is engaging with its management, signaling potential strategic changes for the beverage company. The move comes after KDP's stock fell 25% following the announcement of a complex, debt-financed merger with JDE Peet's, a deal seen as highly favorable to majority stakeholder JAB Holdings. While Starboard cannot block the cash deal, its involvement is viewed as a constructive effort to restore investor confidence and guide the company through this transition, similar to its successful engagement with Ritchie Bros Auctioneer.

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge argues that parents should delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, ideally until age 16, to promote better mental health and future success. She advises starting conversations about responsible technology use by late elementary school, focusing on privacy, the value of time, and the permanence of online content. Twenge also stresses the importance of setting firm rules, such as using basic non-internet phones first and implementing parental controls to moderate use. For parents who feel they gave devices too early, she recommends being honest about the decision and establishing new, healthier boundaries.</p>

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment philosophy, Warren Buffett categorizes investments into three types: currency-denominated assets, non-productive assets, and productive assets. He expresses skepticism about the first two, noting that currencies lose value over time and that non-productive assets like gold generate no intrinsic value, relying solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for them later. Buffett strongly advocates for the third category—productive assets like farms and businesses—which are valued based on what they can produce and deliver over time. He emphasizes that the success of these investments is determined by their output, not by daily market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

The study found that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and nearly half of those who remarry have a child with their new spouse. Economically, remarriage appears beneficial, with the median household wealth of remarried adults being significantly higher than that of divorced, single adults.

          <p>As millions prepare for "No Kings" protests against President Trump, this article re-evaluates the anti-Trump "Resistance" movement, arguing that its earnest and sometimes "cringe" idealism is a powerful tool against political cynicism. Dismissed by some as performative, the movement's on-the-ground organizing during Trump's first term proved effective, contributing to the 2018 midterm victories. The author posits that in an era of authoritarianism, sincere belief in democratic principles, even if it appears uncool, is essential to counter the nihilism and fatalism that allow such regimes to thrive. The movement's effectiveness lies in combining this idealism with concrete, community-based political action.</p>
