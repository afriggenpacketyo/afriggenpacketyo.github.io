          <p>Scotland's national football team has called up free agent Ross Doohan and Bournemouth's 18-year-old Callan McKenna for their friendly match in Liechtenstein due to a goalkeeping crisis. Angus Gunn and Robby McCrorie have left the squad following a defeat by Iceland, and Cieran Slicker suffered an injury during his debut. With first-choice Craig Gordon and other regular squad members already missing due to injury, head coach Steve Clarke was forced to seek additional options. Doohan is reportedly set to return to Celtic, while McKenna has been training with the squad.</p>
