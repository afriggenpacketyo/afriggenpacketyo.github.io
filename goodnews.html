          <p>ESPN has signed a five-year deal, reportedly worth an average of $325 million annually, to exclusively stream WWE's premium live events in the United States starting in 2026. This package, which includes major events like WrestleMania and the Royal Rumble, will be featured on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform. The move is seen as a strategic partnership to expand the WWE's audience and provide ESPN with content that attracts a younger, more diverse, and more female demographic beyond traditional sports. The deal shifts the rights from NBCUniversal's Peacock, which previously held them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney announced fiscal third-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, largely due to significant growth in its streaming business and strong performance from its theme parks. The company's direct-to-consumer streaming unit, which was losing a billion dollars per quarter just two years ago, is now showing a solid foundation and helping to offset declines in traditional television revenue. Despite overall revenue slightly missing projections, domestic parks saw a 10% revenue increase, with officials noting strong consumer spending. Disney also raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance, signaling confidence in its financial trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost tourism and improve bilateral relations, South Korea will implement a temporary visa-waiver program for Chinese tour groups. The policy, effective from September 29, 2025, until June 30, 2026, is expected to revitalize regional economies and increase domestic consumption by attracting more visitors from China, which is already South Korea's largest source of tourists. This move follows a similar unilateral visa-free policy introduced by Beijing for South Korean nationals last year, which led to a significant increase in travel from South Korea to China. The initiative reflects ongoing efforts to thaw diplomatic tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle has publicly voiced his frustration with a new NFL directive that bans the use of smelling salts and ammonia inhalants before and during games. Kittle, who says he regularly uses the substance for an energy boost, jokingly remarked that he "considered retirement" upon hearing the news. The league memo cited a 2024 FDA warning about the lack of evidence for the safety or efficacy of ammonia inhalants and their potential to mask neurological symptoms, including signs of a concussion. The ban applies to all team activities, including pregame and halftime, affecting players like Kittle who relied on the stimulant.</p>

          <p>McDonald's announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with a notable rebound in its U.S. market. The fast-food giant's U.S. same-store sales grew by 2.5%, reversing two consecutive quarters of decline, a success attributed to popular promotions like a meal tie-in with the "Minecraft" movie and the launch of McCrispy Chicken Strips. Overall global same-store sales jumped 3.8%, the largest increase in nearly two years, with strong performance in international markets like Japan, China, and the UK. The results suggest the chain is successfully attracting diners despite previous pressures on low- and middle-income consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Talks between the UK government and the British Medical Association (BMA) are set to restart in an effort to resolve the long-running dispute over resident doctor pay and conditions in England. The agreement to resume negotiations follows a meeting between BMA leaders and Health Secretary Wes Streeting and includes a temporary halt on further strike action. While previous talks focused on non-pay issues like working conditions, the BMA maintains that addressing pay, which they argue has fallen significantly in real terms since 2008, remains crucial for a final resolution. The dispute has led to 12 strikes since March 2023, impacting the National Health Service.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly addressed concerns about the security of its semiconductor technology, stating unequivocally that its chips do not contain any hidden backdoors, kill switches, or spyware. In a blog post by its chief security officer, the company emphasized that deliberately creating such vulnerabilities would be a gift to malicious actors and is contrary to its principles of building trustworthy systems. The statement reinforces Nvidia's commitment to security across the many critical industries that rely on its graphics processing units (GPUs), including healthcare, finance, and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company asserted that established law requires fixing vulnerabilities, not creating them.</p>

          <p>An annual FBI report reveals that crime rates in the United States decreased across every category in 2024, with violent crime dropping to levels not seen since the 1960s. The data shows a 14.5% fall in murder and non-negligent manslaughter and a 4.5% decrease in overall violent crime compared to the previous year, directly contradicting claims of a rampant crime wave made during the 2024 election cycle. Murders in large cities saw the most significant decline at 19.1%. While the report shows a positive trend in most areas, it also notes a 10-year high in the number of law enforcement officers assaulted in the line of duty.</p>

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has stated that financially troubled football clubs like Sheffield Wednesday and Morecambe can "absolutely" be saved from collapse. Her comments come as both clubs face severe issues, including delayed wage payments and registration embargoes. Nandy emphasized that a new independent football regulator, set to launch later this year, will have the power to intervene, including forcing owners to sell in dire circumstances and giving fans greater influence. She stressed the importance of these clubs to their communities and cited the need for responsible ownership, referencing the collapse of Bury FC in 2019 as a catalyst for the new legislation.</p>

          <p>A new movement of people calling themselves "AI vegans" is emerging, choosing to abstain from using artificial intelligence for ethical, environmental, and personal wellness reasons. The article compares this digital abstention to dietary veganism, noting that both are driven by a desire to reduce harm, whether to animals or, in this case, to the environment and human cognition. The author points to the significant energy and water consumption of AI models and studies suggesting that overreliance on tools like ChatGPT can harm critical thinking. While mass adoption of "AI veganism" seems unlikely, the concept encourages greater awareness of the hidden costs associated with our increasing consumption of AI.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its plummeting birth rate, China has announced it will waive tuition fees for the final year of public kindergarten, starting this autumn. The policy, which also includes tuition reductions for children in approved private kindergartens, is part of a broader plan to make preschool education free and lower the financial burden on families. The central government will subsidize kindergartens to offset the lost revenue, sharing the cost with local governments. This move aims to provide financial relief to households struggling with a slowing economy and a weak labor market, thereby encouraging more parents to have children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Frustrated by the city's slow response to safety requests, some Los Angeles residents are painting their own crosswalks at dangerous intersections. One recent DIY project near Stoner Park in Sawtelle was initially removed by the Department of Transportation, but after a community outcry, officials reversed course and agreed to install permanent crosswalks. The incident highlights a broader tension between citizen-led safety initiatives and official city processes, which are often hampered by backlogs and funding constraints. This trend is growing, with advocacy groups like the Crosswalk Collective LA painting stripes in other neighborhoods following traffic fatalities, arguing that they must act when the city does not.</p>

          <p>A California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California must reconsider its policy that bars the hiring of undocumented students for on-campus jobs. The court found that the UC system's justification for the discriminatory policy—fear of potential federal litigation—was insufficient legal grounds. While the ruling does not force the university to overturn the policy, it requires a re-evaluation based on proper legal criteria. This decision is a significant win for immigrant rights advocates, who argue the ban violates state law and forces students into the underground economy, depriving them of crucial career and educational opportunities.</p>
