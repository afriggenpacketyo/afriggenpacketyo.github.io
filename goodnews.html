          <h2>UK Ministers Consider Removing Two-Child Benefit Cap</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the policy has contributed to poverty but acknowledged that removing the cap would be expensive. The Child Poverty Taskforce, led by Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall, is evaluating the cap as part of a broader child poverty strategy due in the autumn. Phillipson emphasized that the taskforce is considering all options and that a Labour government would have different priorities, but she also highlighted the significant costs of inaction and the impact on children's life chances.</p>

          <p>Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is increasing military spending and aiming for a stronger role in NATO amid concerns about Russia and pressure from the US for allies to bear more defense burden. Merz presided over the activation of a German tank brigade in Lithuania, signaling a commitment to European security. Germany plans to increase military spending to 3.5% of its economic output and another 1.5% on critical defense infrastructure, addressing shortcomings in its armed forces, including dilapidated barracks and staff shortages. This shift reflects a significant change for a country that has struggled to meet previous military spending targets.</p>

          <p>Kim Jong-un's absence from Russia's Victory Day parade, despite expectations given his strengthened alliance with Moscow, signals a message of restraint, retreat, and defiance. By not attending, Kim avoided an awkward spotlight alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping and a public alignment with Putin that could strain ties with China. Instead, Kim visited the Russian embassy in Pyongyang, calling Putin "my closest friend and comrade" and hailing the alliance with Russia. This move suggests a delicate balancing act between maintaining relations with both Russia and China.</p>

          <p>This Planet Money article explores whether manufacturing jobs are economically special, focusing on their value for workers. It cites research indicating that manufacturing jobs often pay a premium, especially for those without a college education, though this premium varies by subsector. The article examines why manufacturing jobs might pay more, considering factors like unionization, safety risks, and the use of expensive machinery. It also discusses the decline in manufacturing's share of "good jobs" and the challenges of boosting the sector in the face of automation and offshoring.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a decline in overall emissions for the first time, even as its energy demand and economic activity increased. This drop is largely attributed to China's aggressive deployment of wind, solar, and nuclear power, which has outpaced its electricity demand growth. The shift puts China ahead of schedule for its climate targets, including peaking emissions before 2030. However, the article notes that the decline could be temporary depending on economic growth and trade relations, and that China continues to emit high levels of other greenhouse gases.</p>

          <p>This article explores the possibility of delaying or eliminating menopause through medical interventions, highlighting the potential benefits and drawbacks. While the loss of estrogen associated with menopause can lead to various health issues, the idea of eliminating it raises concerns about societal pressure on women to remain young and fertile. Researchers are exploring hormone therapy, ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and medications like rapamycin to extend ovarian function. The article balances the potential health benefits with the social and emotional aspects of aging, emphasizing the need to support women through the menopausal transition rather than pathologizing it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing political divide between young men and women, attributing it to economic shifts over the past half-century rather than solely cultural issues. The decline of manufacturing and the rise of the cognitive economy have disproportionately affected men without college degrees, leading to job insecurity and regressive gender norms. Traditional gender roles have made it less appealing for men to identify as consumers, while feminist messages have empowered women in the workplace. The author suggests redefining men's role in an inclusive way that encompasses both caretaking and producing to address the crisis of masculinity.</p>

Apple is accelerating its "made in India" plans to adapt to Washington's tariffs against China, where Apple manufactures most of its iPhones. While the jump in India's iPhone shipments showed the adaptability of Apple's supply chains, growth is expected to slow down for the rest of the year because India's manufacturing capacity isn't expected to grow fast enough to take the entirety of U.S. demand.
