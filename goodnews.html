          <p>Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa addressed the United Nations General Assembly, marking a significant step in the country's re-engagement with the international community after the ousting of Bashar Assad. While highlighting a new sense of optimism within Syria, al-Sharaa faces substantial domestic challenges, including sectarian violence and criticism over upcoming elections that may lack inclusive representation. He called for the lifting of remaining international sanctions to aid economic recovery and promised justice for victims of violence, though concerns about his consolidation of power remain.</p>

          <p>In a public referendum, residents of Zurich, Switzerland, have voted to impose severe restrictions on the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to address noise and air pollution concerns. The new rules, supported by over 61% of voters, will completely ban gas-powered models and limit the use of electric devices to a three-month period from October to December. Proponents argued the devices harm microorganisms and spread fine dust, while opponents criticized the measure as an example of an "anti-social culture of prohibition" that complicates maintenance work.</p>

          <p>The 1960s British band The Zombies are finally receiving widespread recognition decades after their initial success, with their 1968 album "Odessey and Oracle" now regarded as a rock classic. The band, known for hits like "She's Not There" and "Time of the Season," experienced a fractured career, breaking up just before their most famous song became a chart-topper a full year after its release. Surviving members reflect on their journey from naïve teenagers to their eventual induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, a testament to their music's enduring and influential legacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is implementing a new "pull system" for its space industry, aiming to revolutionize the production of rockets and satellites by adopting an assembly-line model similar to car manufacturing. This approach contrasts with the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often causing delays and inefficiencies. The new model has final assembly "pull" components from suppliers only when needed, which is expected to enable faster, cheaper, and more consistent mass production of space systems. This industrial shift is intended to position China for dominance in the rapidly growing global space sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national chain stores continue to close, rising vacancy rates in U.S. shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses. With demand softening, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents, allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to move into prime locations they were previously priced out of. While overall rental rates are still rising, the pace has slowed, creating a market recalibration. This trend is enabling local entrepreneurs to reimagine these spaces and better reflect the needs of their communities.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems.

The terms of the settlement are confidential. This marks another significant legal resolution for Dominion, which previously secured a $787.5 million settlement from Fox News and a $67 million settlement from Newsmax over the amplification of the same evidence-free conspiracy theories about the election.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has pledged that construction on three new towns will commence before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites from a list of twelve proposed locations. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the initiative at the party's annual conference, framing it as a core component of Labour's strategy to stimulate economic growth and address the nation's housing crisis, drawing inspiration from the post-war new town developments.</p>

          <p>China's new Type 076 amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, is reportedly preparing to begin sea trials. Recent images show that covers have been removed from its electromagnetic catapult system, a feature that has led analysts to describe it as the world's first dedicated drone carrier. This advanced vessel is expected to significantly enhance the PLA Navy's unmanned aerial vehicle capabilities and play a crucial role in any potential conflict involving Taiwan.
