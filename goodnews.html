          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on destructive bottom trawling in English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. This announcement comes ahead of a UN Ocean Conference in France and amid warnings about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty to protect 30% of the ocean.</p>

          <p>HSBC plans to expand its investment banking business to serve the rising demand for initial public offerings (IPOs) from companies in Asia and the Middle East. This strategy aligns with the bank's restructuring efforts to focus on high-return regions like Hong Kong and India while exiting less profitable markets in Europe and the US. Hong Kong currently leads the world in IPOs, and HSBC aims to capitalize on the growing wealth management clientele in the region. This move reflects a strategic shift towards Asia and intra-Asia opportunities.</p>
