        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shanghai-based AI startup MiniMax has introduced its first reasoning model, MiniMax-M1, designed to challenge DeepSeek's R1 model by using less than half the computing power for reasoning tasks involving 64,000 tokens or fewer. MiniMax claims that M1 matches the performance of leading global models from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic in areas such as mathematics, coding, and domain knowledge. The M1 model is built on the 456-billion-parameter MiniMax-Text-01 foundational model and employs a hybrid mixture-of-experts architecture to reduce compute costs, similar to DeepSeek's approach, while also using Lightning Attention to speed up training and reduce memory usage. This launch signifies the intensifying competition among Chinese tech companies to develop advanced AI reasoning models.</p>

          <p>The PGA Tour has announced Brian Rolapp, a top NFL executive, as its next CEO, succeeding Jay Monahan, who will step down at the end of 2026 after a decade in the role. Rolapp, formerly the NFL's Chief Media and Business Officer, brings extensive experience in media partnerships and is expected to focus on strengthening the Tour's commercial relationships. This transition comes amid ongoing discussions about a potential merger with Saudi-backed LIV Golf, which has overshadowed Monahan's efforts to secure investments and create equity opportunities for players. Tiger Woods expressed his support for Rolapp's appointment, citing his respect for the game and fresh perspective.</p>

          <p>Dame Louise Casey is advocating for a national inquiry into grooming gangs in England and Wales, following her report on group-based child sexual abuse. Casey urges openness and scrutiny from those giving evidence, with the aim of creating a "national reset" on the issue. She also addressed concerns about the ethnicity of perpetrators, emphasizing the need for calm and careful data analysis, noting that while child sexual exploitation suspects are disproportionately of Asian heritage, general child abuse is not. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has committed to implementing Casey's 12 recommendations, including reviewing convictions of victims and making ethnicity data collection mandatory.</p>

          <p>Investing experts predict that gold prices could reach $4,000 per ounce within the next one to two years, driven by factors such as global instability, central bank demand, and inflation. Some experts suggest that gold could hit this milestone in 2025 if it maintains the same percentage gains as the previous year. They recommend strategies for investing in gold, such as maintaining a long-term outlook, leasing out gold, and considering gold mining mutual funds. Experts advise investors to gain exposure to gold sooner rather than later and to consider dollar-cost averaging to manage short-term price volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts suggest choosing short-term CDs for better rates or long-term CDs to protect against rate drops, and understanding the risks of early withdrawal penalties. Additionally, CD laddering is recommended as a strategy to balance short- and long-term rates. (not investment advice)</p>
