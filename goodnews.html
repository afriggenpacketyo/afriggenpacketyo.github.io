        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor secured a victory over Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a gripping bout at Madison Square Garden. The fight was decided by a majority decision, with two judges scoring it 97-93 for Taylor and the third scoring it a 95-95 draw. Unlike their previous encounters, this match was more of a tactical chess match than an all-out war, with Taylor's economical and smart boxing earning her a clear victory. Following the fight, the 39-year-old champion acknowledged the historic rivalry but remained non-committal about her future in the sport.</p>

The Warren County Sheriff's Office released photos showing a smiling Stevenson on a plane, heavily secured by multiple law enforcement officers from various agencies. Stevenson, who was originally wanted on firearm and drug charges, had slipped away from a transport agent at a ticket counter while in shackles. After a month-long manhunt, he was apprehended by U.S. Marshals in Seattle, with authorities ensuring his return trip was conducted under maximum security.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a $6.7 billion deal to acquire a second batch of 180 K2 main battle tanks from South Korea, reinforcing its position as a major European military power. This acquisition is part of a larger 2022 agreement that will see Poland's arsenal grow by nearly 1,000 tanks, partly to replace Soviet-era vehicles sent to Ukraine. The deal highlights South Korea's growing role as a key arms supplier to U.S. allies, especially as conflicts deplete Western stockpiles. Poland's significant defense spending increase reflects its strategic position on NATO's eastern flank as Russia's war in Ukraine continues.</p>

          <p>Google has announced a major talent acquisition, hiring Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees. While not a full acquisition of the company, the deal involves Google paying $2.4 billion for compensation and a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology. This move intensifies the fierce competition for top AI talent among tech giants, coming after Windsurf had reportedly been in acquisition talks with OpenAI. The deal allows Google's DeepMind to leverage Windsurf's expertise in 'agentic coding' to advance its own AI development tools.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a significant controversy. The brand faced criticism after showcasing sandals at Milan Fashion Week that closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals without acknowledging their origin. In response to the backlash, Prada met with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents thousands of Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaborations. This move is seen as an effort to respectfully engage with traditional communities and address accusations of cultural appropriation, with the Chamber now seeking to patent the traditional design.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests across seven counties in Southern California. The ruling, part of a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other advocacy groups, prohibits federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like their apparent race, accent, or presence at specific locations. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found a "mountain of evidence" suggesting constitutional rights were being violated. This decision represents a significant, albeit temporary, legal setback for the administration's intensified enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against the AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company deceptively used their voices to create AI-generated voice clones for its text-to-speech platform without their consent. While the judge dismissed claims based on federal copyright of a voice itself, the case will proceed on claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their recordings in training data. This decision is considered a significant victory for artists seeking to protect their work from misuse by AI companies.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are significantly expanding their international operations, establishing a growing number of overseas offices to meet the demand from Chinese companies going global. As of last year, there were 208 Chinese legal offices abroad, a 70 percent increase from 2018. This expansion is driven by Chinese businesses preferring legal support from trusted domestic lawyers as they navigate foreign markets. While they are successfully serving their existing client base abroad, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions. The trend reflects a strategic push from both the market and Beijing to build a global legal service footprint.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese pharmaceutical companies are aggressively developing alternatives to popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, with approximately 60 similar treatments currently in clinical trials. This surge in research and development is driven by the upcoming expiration of the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, in China next year. Analysts predict that the entry of numerous generic versions into the market will significantly increase competition and drive down the high cost of these treatments. The global market for these GLP-1 drugs is estimated to be worth around $150 billion, motivating this push. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials acknowledge the current downturn in container movement but express confidence in the long-term demand for larger vessel capacity.
