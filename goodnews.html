          <p>Brazilian police foiled a bomb attack planned for Lady Gaga's concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro. Authorities arrested two suspects who allegedly recruited participants to carry out attacks using improvised explosives, intending to gain notoriety on social media. The suspects were also accused of spreading hate speech against children, adolescents, and the LGBTQ+ community. The concert, part of Lady Gaga's 'Mayhem' tour, drew a crowd of over two million people and was heavily policed with 5,000 officers, metal detectors, drones, and facial recognition cameras.

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old investment icon, announced plans to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the $1.1 trillion conglomerate he transformed through value investing. Over six decades, Buffett turned a failing textile manufacturer into a corporate powerhouse, amassing a personal fortune of $168 billion. Known for his long-term investment strategy and folksy persona, Buffett's departure marks the end of an era, though his successor, Gregory Abel, is expected to maintain the company's financial stability. Buffett's approach inspired countless financiers and earned him widespread admiration. (not investment advice) Optimism score: 75</p>

Ruud acknowledged Draper's potential, predicting he will become increasingly difficult to play on clay. Optimism score: 65</p>
