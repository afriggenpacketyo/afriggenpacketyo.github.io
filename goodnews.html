        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are evaluating the best options for their money. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a fixed interest rate, which can lock in current higher returns before rates fall, but require keeping funds deposited for a set term. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but have variable rates that will likely decrease following the Fed's decision. The choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus the desire for guaranteed returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council found that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. This highlights the deep economic interdependence between the two nations but also underscores the risks of over-reliance on a single trading partner. While exports, primarily soybeans, iron ore, and oil, generate a significant trade surplus for Brazil, they are concentrated among a small number of companies. The report suggests this concentration makes the Brazilian economy vulnerable.</p>

          <p>The mortality rate in the United States saw a 3.8% decline in 2024, reaching its lowest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new federal report. For the first time since 2020, COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 leading causes of death. Heart disease and cancer remained the top two causes, with both seeing an increase in total deaths despite the overall rate decline. The provisional data provides an early indication of shifting mortality trends in the post-pandemic era.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged by 35% in a single day, marking its best performance since 1992 and pushing its market capitalization toward $1 trillion. The dramatic rise was fueled by the company's announcement of $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a 359% increase year-over-year, far exceeding market expectations. This massive backlog, driven by the AI boom and demand for cloud infrastructure, overshadowed a quarterly earnings report that otherwise missed revenue and profit estimates. The surge significantly boosted the net worth of founder Larry Ellison. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has become the first candidate to secure enough nominations from fellow MPs to officially run for the deputy leadership of the UK's Labour Party. She has established a clear lead over her closest rival, Lucy Powell, and three other contenders before the nomination deadline. The contest follows the resignation of Angela Rayner, and Phillipson, as the only cabinet member in the race, is seen as a candidate who will be supportive of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. The race has sparked debate within the party about its future direction and representation.</p>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered rocks in Mars's Jezero Crater that contain potential signs of ancient microbial life. The samples, from a former river channel, contain the minerals vivianite and greigite, which on Earth are often formed through biological processes involving organic matter. While scientists emphasize this is not definitive proof of life and non-biological formation cannot be ruled out, they describe it as the closest they have come to such a discovery. Final confirmation would require returning the rock samples to Earth for detailed analysis in advanced laboratories.</p>

          <p>Following a massive surge in Oracle's stock price, company co-founder Larry Ellison has become the world's wealthiest person, according to a Bloomberg ranking. Ellison's net worth climbed to $393 billion, overtaking Elon Musk, who had held the top spot for four years. The shift in wealth was driven by Oracle's blockbuster report on its cloud computing business, which is booming due to the artificial intelligence race. In contrast, stock in Musk's company, Tesla, has declined this year, contributing to the change at the top of the wealth index.</p>

These include when juggling multiple high-interest cards, needing professional negotiation leverage with creditors, or requiring the structure and accountability of a formal program. While these services have fees, the potential savings from reduced interest rates or settled debt can outweigh the costs, especially when bankruptcy is the only alternative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite September 10 being the historical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, activity has been unusually quiet this year. Meteorologists attribute the lack of storm formation primarily to Saharan dust moving over the Atlantic, which inhibits the development of thunderstorms needed for tropical cyclones. Additionally, the climate is in an "ENSO Neutral" phase, lacking the La Niña conditions that typically fuel a more active Atlantic season. Forecasters, however, still predict an above-average season overall, as 60% of the season remains and a transition to La Niña is expected.</p>
