        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from the New York Times explains mRNA technology and its application in vaccines, addressing common safety concerns. It clarifies that mRNA vaccines, like those for Covid-19 and RSV, work by delivering genetic instructions to cells to produce viral proteins, triggering an immune response without altering a person's DNA. Experts emphasize that mRNA is quickly degraded and there is no evidence of long-term safety issues after four years of use. The article also highlights ongoing research exploring mRNA's potential in treating various diseases, including cancer and cystic fibrosis, while acknowledging the challenges and uncertainties involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the potential impact of a newly secured trade deal between Britain and the United States. While the deal is expected to boost confidence and support specific sectors like the auto industry, its overall effect on the British economy may be limited due to the focus on services, which were not affected by recent tariff increases. The agreement could also vindicate Prime Minister Keir Starmer's efforts to cultivate a relationship with President Trump. However, the article notes that broader global trade uncertainty and domestic factors, such as rising taxes, pose greater threats to Britain's economic growth, and the Bank of England has already cut interest rates due to these concerns.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the potential political victory for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer following a trade agreement with the United States. The deal, secured after months of negotiations, is seen as a vindication of Starmer's strategy of cultivating a relationship with President Trump, who has often criticized the European Union. The article notes that Starmer's diplomatic outreach, including an invitation from King Charles III, has helped Britain avoid the harsh criticism directed at other trading partners. The deal could also present challenges for Starmer's efforts to reset trade relations with the European Union after Brexit.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates plans to give away virtually all of his wealth by 2045 through the Gates Foundation, totaling $200 billion, to address global issues such as childhood mortality and infectious diseases, as reported by CBS News.

He expressed concern that aid cuts by the U.S. and European countries could stall progress, potentially increasing child mortality rates.
