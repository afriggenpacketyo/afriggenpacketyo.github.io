          <p>Gold prices are poised for further gains after China's central bank extended its buying spree to an 11th consecutive month, contributing to the metal's record-setting run. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has notably raised its December 2026 gold price forecast to US$4,900 per ounce from US$4,300, citing expectations of continued central bank purchases and inflows from Western exchange-traded funds. Demand for gold as a safe-haven asset is growing amid ongoing global economic uncertainties, including the US government shutdown, reflecting broader market anxieties. A financial expert from Bridgewater Associates suggests that investors should allocate approximately 15% of their portfolios to gold for optimal diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Approximately 900 hikers, guides, and staff were successfully rescued after being stranded by a severe snowstorm on the Chinese side of Mount Everest, as state media reported. The severe storm, which struck Saturday night, cut off access to where the hikers were staying in tents at an altitude of over 4,900 meters (16,000 feet). Rescue teams from Tingri county provided food, medicine, heating, and oxygen supplies, escorting many to safety, though some hikers reportedly suffered hypothermia. The scenic area in China's Tibet region has been temporarily closed following the incident, which occurred during a week-long national holiday marking the anniversary of Communist Party rule.</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees achieved their largest comeback win in franchise history during an elimination game, rallying from a 6-1 deficit to defeat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-6 in Game 3 of the ALDS. Aaron Judge hit a crucial three-run home run off Louis Varland in the fourth inning, tying the game at six and sparking an eight-unanswered-run surge for the Yankees. Jazz Chisholm Jr. later hit a go-ahead homer, and the bullpen, including Devin Williams and David Bednar, secured the final outs without allowing a hit. The Yankees, now facing elimination again, will rely on rookie pitcher Cam Schlittler for Game 4, while the Blue Jays manager will likely opt for a bullpen game.</p>

          <p>Dr. Fred Ramsdell, a US scientist, learned he had won the Nobel Prize for medicine while on the last day of a three-week off-grid hike with his wife and two dogs in Montana's grizzly bear country. His phone, on airplane mode, missed initial calls from the Nobel committee, leading to his wife discovering the news via a flurry of text messages. Dr. Ramsdell, who shared the prize with two other scientists for their research into how the immune system attacks hostile infections, eventually contacted the committee 20 hours later after driving to a town for signal. This article highlights the humorous challenge of notifying laureates, recalling similar incidents with Kazuo Ishiguro and Paul Milgrom.</p>

          <p>Researchers have demonstrated a significant advancement in kidney transplantation, where an enzyme-converted kidney, after being transplanted into a recipient diagnosed with brain death, functioned for at least two days without signs of hyperacute rejection. This breakthrough could dramatically improve access to organs and help cut lengthy waiting lists, addressing the critical shortage of donated organs. The team, led by researchers from the University of British Columbia and West China Hospital of Sichuan University, emphasizes the urgent need for more efficient use of the available human organ pool, particularly as engineered animal organs remain years away from general practice. This article highlights the potential to overcome blood type incompatibility, offering hope for many patients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spot gold prices surged to an unprecedented $4,000, driven by strong safe-haven demand fueled by global uncertainty. Key factors cited include the ongoing US government shutdown and the resignation of Sebastien Lecornu as France's prime minister, alongside lingering US tariff-led economic instability that has rocked the global economy. This article notes that while Asia-Pacific stock markets traded flat, breaking from Wall Street losses, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand made an outsized interest rate cut by 50 basis points due to weak economic activity and global economic policy uncertainty. The record gold price increase reflects broader investor anxiety in a volatile international climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts explained his decision to hold back ace reliever Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the NLDS, opting for veteran Blake Treinen instead in the ninth inning with a three-run lead. Roberts cited concerns about managing Sasaki's workload, as the young pitcher had rarely pitched on consecutive days since returning from a shoulder injury, and the team wanted to give him rest. The strategy nearly backfired when Treinen struggled, giving up two runs and forcing Sasaki to enter for the final out. Moving forward, Sasaki is confirmed as the primary option for save situations, though Roberts stressed the need to balance his usage given his inexperience in a relief role and the long playoff season ahead.</p>

The theft contributed to the six years it took to complete the book, which sees the return of his popular characters, as the content hadn't backed itself up. Despite this setback and profound personal grief, including the loss of his mother and beloved dog, Barney, Mackesy found motivation in connecting with readers who shared profound personal stories about his work's impact.

          <p>New Zealand's central bank delivered an outsized 50-basis-point interest rate cut, bringing its policy rate to a three-year low of 2.5%, surprising economists who expected a smaller reduction. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cited weak economic activity through the middle of 2025 and slow growth in disposable incomes and house prices as reasons for the aggressive cut, aiming to support a recovery in consumption. While inflation is expected to return to its 2% target by the first half of next year, the country's GDP contracted more than expected in the second quarter, reflecting domestic constraints and global economic policy uncertainty. The article notes that growth forecasts for New Zealand's trading partners, particularly China, have improved, but overall growth is expected to slow in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

The name itself harks back to historical practices and preparations for winter in the northern hemisphere, where people would traditionally hunt and preserve meats during this time.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps, endorsed by President Trump, is projected to win a crowded Republican primary in Tennessee's special election for a House seat, setting him up to face Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in December. Van Epps' victory followed Trump's endorsement, which notably came after in-person early voting had ended, and he also received backing from Governor Bill Lee and Rep. Jim Jordan. The 7th Congressional District, a safely Republican seat, will serve as a gauge for the popularity of Trump's second-term agenda, particularly with Republican-leaning suburban voters in the Nashville area. The general election in December could slightly expand the GOP's single-digit majority in the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>A rare interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, only the third confirmed to enter our solar system, was recently photographed closely approaching Mars by two European Space Agency orbiters. The images, taken last Friday, show a faint, fuzzy white dot appearing to move against a backdrop of distant stars, approximately 18,641,135 miles away from Mars. Scientists describe this as a very challenging observation due to the comet's extreme faintness, being 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than usual targets.

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is set to unveil a new economic "golden rule" at the party conference, aiming to cut government borrowing and taxes in the UK. The rule would notably allocate half of all savings made by a future Conservative government to reducing the deficit, which is the gap between spending and tax revenues, and the other half to economy-growing policies, including tax cuts. Badenoch will accuse the Labour government of risking financial stability with a "borrowing and tax doom loop," attempting to reclaim the mantle of fiscal prudence. This article notes the Conservatives plan £47bn in savings from welfare, civil service, and foreign aid cuts, but face a challenging autumn Budget and poor poll ratings, with Badenoch insisting her approach will pay off long-term.
