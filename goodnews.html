          <p>Alibaba's CEO, Wu, unveiled an ambitious roadmap to establish the company as the world's premier full-stack AI service provider, targeting artificial superintelligence through its Qwen models and cloud services. This strategic move underscores the escalating global competition between Chinese and US tech giants for leadership in the AI sector, a domain with profound economic and geopolitical ramifications. The article emphasizes that China's integrated approach, focusing on both software and hardware, suggests that merely producing advanced chips is insufficient for winning the AI race, a sentiment echoed by Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang. Alibaba's shares surged following this announcement, reflecting market optimism about its future in AI.</p>

Despite controlling much of the game and displaying improved performance, the US team felt they deserved a better result against a strong Ecuadorian defense. The article highlights the team's comfort with a three-man backline and aggressive wingbacks, noting positive defensive plays and an ability to create spaces, even if finishing was sometimes indecisive. This match suggests ongoing development and a growing sense of confidence within the squad as they prepare for future competitions.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) rejected a Trump administration proposal linking federal funds to adherence to specific policies, including capping foreign admissions and restricting campus political comments. MIT President Sally Kornbluth stated the "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education" would infringe on freedom of expression and institutional independence. The article notes the proposal also demanded standardized tests for admissions and a binary gender definition. MIT, which already faces federal funding cuts, emphasized that scientific funding should be based solely on merit, aligning with its core values despite potential financial repercussions.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca reached an agreement with the Trump administration to offer discounted prescription drugs to Medicaid patients and guarantee "most-favored-nation" pricing on new drugs, in exchange for tariff relief. This deal, similar to one with Pfizer, aims to make medicines more affordable by matching the lowest prices offered in other developed nations. The article notes President Trump's exaggerated claims of massive price reductions, which experts deem illogical. While the agreement could save states money, its impact on Medicaid patients' out-of-pocket costs is uncertain due to existing "best price" protections. The deal also involves AstraZeneca investing in US manufacturing, partly influenced by Trump's tariff threats. (not investment advice)</p>
