          <p>Philip Lane, the chief economist for the European Central Bank, has stated that the recent cycle of monetary policy interventions aimed at controlling inflation is now "done." He noted that the primary goal of bringing inflation down from its peak to the 2% target has been achieved, removing the price shocks of 2021-2022 from the system. While this phase is over, Lane cautioned that the ECB must remain prepared to address new shocks and potential cyclical movements to maintain medium-term stability. (not investment advice)</p>
