          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured their first American League Championship Series (ALCS) berth since 2016 by defeating the New York Yankees 5-2 in Game 4 of the ALDS. Despite the Yankees' momentum from a Game 3 comeback, Toronto's offense, led by Vladimir Guerrero Jr., consistently scored runs. Eight Blue Jays pitchers combined to shut down the Yankees' lineup, with key plays in the seventh inning extending Toronto's lead. This victory concludes the Yankees' season, leaving them still pursuing their 28th World Series title since 2009.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces to an "agreed upon line." The article reports that while an agreement in principle exists, procedural issues remain, with hostages potentially being released as early as Monday. Both Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas confirmed the deal, mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey. This initial phase focuses on immediate humanitarian and security measures, leaving more contentious issues for future negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a Gaza peace deal's first phase drew praise from Republican lawmakers, who lauded him as a "peace president" for securing hostage releases. However, Palestinian Americans expressed significant skepticism and trepidation, questioning the agreement's terms and its long-term impact on the conflict. This article highlights the divergent perspectives, with critics emphasizing the lack of clarity on a permanent ceasefire and the immense destruction in Gaza. Concerns remain that the deal might only offer a temporary pause rather than a true resolution to the deep-seated issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point peace plan for the Israel-Hamas war outlines an immediate ceasefire, phased Israeli withdrawal, and the return of all hostages within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The article explains that the plan also calls for Gaza's demilitarization under independent monitors and governance by a "technocratic" Palestinian committee, not Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. While Netanyahu supports it, Hamas's full response is pending, and critical questions remain regarding long-term governance and Palestinian statehood. The proposal aims for a "sustainable, long-term peace" but faces significant challenges.</p>
