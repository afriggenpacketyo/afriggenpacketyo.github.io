          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, maintaining the current range despite external pressure to implement a cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of lower rates, signaling a potential shift in future policy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cited ongoing concerns about inflation remaining above the 2% target and a moderately growing economy as reasons for the cautious approach. The central bank will continue to monitor economic data, including the effects of tariffs, before its next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a comprehensive trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on South Korean exports to the U.S., a reduction from a previously threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea has committed to a $350 billion investment fund for U.S.-controlled projects and a $100 billion purchase of American energy products. However, differing interpretations have emerged regarding the management and profit distribution of the investment fund, a point of contention also seen in a recent U.S. deal with Japan.

The company's guidance for the third quarter was also incredibly strong, further boosting investor confidence despite a raised outlook for full-year expenses and capital expenditures. The impressive results were driven by strong user engagement across its Family of Apps and significant growth in ad impressions and pricing, bolstered by advancements in its AI recommendation systems.

The company's net income more than doubled, and it saw significant growth in funded customers and total platform assets, which nearly doubled to $279 billion. This growth is attributed to strong net deposits, higher asset valuations, and the success of its Robinhood Gold subscription service. The positive report continues a strong performance trend for the company, which has been expanding into wealth management and luring clients from established brokerage firms.

          <h2>The Science Behind Tsunamis and How to Respond to Warnings</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using a recent 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast as a case study, this article explains the science of how tsunamis are generated, propagated, and predicted. A tsunami typically requires a powerful underwater earthquake, usually magnitude 6.5 or higher, that causes vertical displacement of the seafloor, which is what occurred in the Pacific's Ring of Fire. Scientists use tide gauges and deep-ocean pressure sensors to forecast wave height and timing, though it remains a complex challenge. For safety, experts advise immediately moving to higher ground—at least 30 to 100 feet above sea level—upon receiving a tsunami warning, as the waves are immensely powerful.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research expedition has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Using a human-occupied submersible, scientists observed vast beds of clams, bacterial mats, and fields of tube worms, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in extreme pressure and darkness. These ecosystems are chemosynthetic, meaning they are fueled by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust rather than sunlight. The findings suggest such deep-sea communities may be more widespread than previously thought, opening new avenues for research into extreme adaptation.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has confirmed that the company's significant investments in artificial intelligence will continue into 2026, with spending expected to grow at a faster rate than in 2025. The company recently raised its expense outlook, citing the need to build a leading compute fleet and attract top-tier talent for its AI Superintelligence team. This strategy mirrors similar heavy investments by tech rivals like Alphabet and Microsoft, reflecting an industry-wide race for AI dominance. Despite the high costs, investors have reacted positively, buoyed by Meta's strong quarterly earnings and the immediate efficiency gains AI has brought to its advertising systems.

          <p>Microsoft reported exceptional fourth-quarter results, with revenue growing 18% to $76.4 billion, significantly beating analyst expectations and reinforcing its position as a leader in AI. The growth was largely driven by its Azure cloud unit, which saw revenue accelerate to a 39% increase, far exceeding forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Azure generated over $75 billion in revenue for the fiscal year, highlighting that cloud demand is currently outpacing supply. The company's strong performance and optimistic guidance for the next quarter caused its stock to surge, pushing its market capitalization toward the $4 trillion mark. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a 3% annualized growth rate in the second quarter, a significant rebound after shrinking in the first three months of the year. This stronger-than-expected performance was largely driven by a sharp decline in imports, a statistical quirk tied to the implementation of President Trump's tariffs, which are subtracted from the GDP calculation. While consumer spending also increased, a key underlying measure of private domestic demand showed much weaker growth of only 1.2%, suggesting that the economy's fundamental strength may be less robust than the headline figure indicates. Overall, economic activity appears to be moderating. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 tremor off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula resulted in minimal damage and no fatalities outside of its immediate vicinity. This article explains that the primary reason was the tsunami's directionality; its main energy was projected into the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. While Russia saw significant waves, heights in California and Hawaii were much smaller than initially feared. The event serves as a best-case scenario for a distant tsunami, highlighting the critical role of location and energy focus in determining its impact.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to analysis from CNBC's Jim Cramer, the Federal Reserve is reluctant to cut interest rates due to a highly mixed economic environment. He suggests that strong labor figures, healthy GDP growth, and unclear impacts from tariffs create a complicated picture for policymakers. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's cautious stance reflects this uncertainty, as a premature rate cut could risk reigniting inflation. The market's negative reaction was attributed to the Fed not providing a clear signal that future rate cuts are inevitable, leaving investors without a desired backstop. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing popularity of anxiety-inducing television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt," which immerse viewers in high-pressure, realistic environments. In contrast to escapist "comfort TV," these series use techniques like real-time pacing and single-take sequences to create a visceral sense of tension that resonates with audiences. Psychologists suggest this appeal may stem from "vicarious stress," a risk-free fight-or-flight response, and the catharsis of seeing relatable characters navigate mundane yet high-stakes workplace challenges. This trend reflects a potential shift in viewer appetite towards realism and stories that mirror the constant, low-level anxiety of modern life.</p>

The offering raised $1.2 billion and values the company at $19.3 billion, just shy of the $20 billion valuation from its failed acquisition by Adobe. Figma is capitalizing on a slowly reopening market for tech IPOs, following successful debuts by other companies earlier this year.

This robust performance was driven by a 22% year-over-year growth in sales and a notable increase in advertising revenue, which the company attributes to efficiency gains from its AI technology.
