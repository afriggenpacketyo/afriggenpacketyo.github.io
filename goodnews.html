          <h2>Japan to Study Offshore Blue Carbon for CO2 Capture and Storage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 22:21:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. Coastal and ocean plants like mangroves and kelp are known to absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation, making them a key focus for mitigating climate change. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact of carbon capture and storage projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon initiatives, marking a significant increase from the 34 tons absorbed by coastal plants in fiscal 2023.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose as much as 14% in their Hong Kong trading debut. The CATL IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL intends to use 90% of the funds raised to construct a factory in Hungary, which will supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. CATL has faced challenges, including punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs and being placed on a U.S. Pentagon watchlist over suspected ties to China's military, allegations the company denies.</p>

          <p>President Trump awarded the first-ever Medal of Sacrifice to three Florida deputies who died in the line of duty. The Medal of Sacrifice was posthumously awarded to Cpl.

          <p>China has reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, as part of Beijing's effort to stimulate the economy. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. State-backed commercial lenders also reduced deposit rates, paving the way for lower lending rates. The rate cuts are part of a package of stimulus measures, including reductions to the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves, and lower mortgage rates under the housing provident fund.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to move forward with legislation to regulate stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency, after Democrats initially blocked the measure. The bill aims to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws. It would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S. and includes strengthened regulations on foreign issuers, beefed-up enforcement, and bars large tech companies from issuing their own stablecoins. Some Democrats remain concerned that the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.</p>

          <p>The UK is purportedly in a favorable position regarding trade agreements compared to other countries, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The government emphasizes recent trade deals with the US, India, and the EU, anticipating an upgrade in Britain's economic growth. While aiming for further enhancements in the EU agreement, the focus shifts to securing a trade pact with Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Despite previous intentions for a long-term relationship with China, the UK is currently not pursuing trade negotiations with the country. The ongoing conversation and negotiation will determine how much this will cost, precisely what it will mean for defence co-operation, who and how many young people may be able to travel more easily to the EU and vice versa and whether and by when there is a mutual recognition of professional qualifications.</p>

SPACs allow people to raise money in the stock market, without a business plan, and then acquire a business with the funds they raised, or they have to give the money back.
