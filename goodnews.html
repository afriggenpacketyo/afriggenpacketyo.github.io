          <p>Canada will meet NATO's defense spending target of 2% of GDP this fiscal year, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced, five years earlier than planned. The increased spending will fund new submarines, aircraft, ships, armed vehicles, and artillery, as well as boost pay for the armed forces. Carney emphasized the need to reduce Canada's security dependence on the United States, citing a "darker" global landscape and President Trump's trade policies. This move aligns Canada with NATO's spending guidelines and aims to enhance its military preparedness and independence. </p>
