          <p>Israel and Hamas have formally approved the initial phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan, marking a significant step towards de-escalation after two years of conflict. The agreement involves an immediate ceasefire, a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and the release of all 20 remaining living hostages by Hamas. In exchange, Israel will release approximately 1,950 Palestinian prisoners and detainees and facilitate the entry of hundreds of humanitarian aid trucks daily into Gaza. Subsequent phases, which include Gaza's demilitarization and future governance, remain subject to further negotiations and present significant challenges.</p>

          <p>The second episode of "Celebrity Traitors" heightened the drama, with Olympic diver Tom Daley openly suspecting presenter Kate Garraway of being a Traitor due to what he perceived as over-acting. Comedian Alan Carr, revealed as a Traitor, struggled to maintain his composure after "murdering" his close friend, singer Paloma Faith. The episode was also marked by contestants' humorous spelling errors during voting and discussions about their fashion choices. The show concluded on another cliffhanger, leaving viewers to wait a week to discover who will be banished from the game next.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the track's lyrics, which included serious allegations against Drake, constituted opinion within the context of a highly publicized rap battle. The lawsuit had claimed that UMG, the parent record label for both artists, promoted the track despite its false and damaging content. This ruling marks a significant moment in the long-standing feud between the two superstar rappers, reinforcing the legal protections for artistic expression in music.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers delivered an outstanding performance in England's 3-0 friendly win against Wales, solidifying his place in the team and validating manager Thomas Tuchel's new selection philosophy. Tuchel has emphasized building a cohesive team over collecting individual star players, a strategy highlighted by his decision to exclude superstar Jude Bellingham from the squad. Rogers, playing in Bellingham's number 10 role, scored the opening goal and was instrumental in the attack, becoming a symbol of Tuchel's merit-based approach. The victory suggests England can succeed even without its biggest names, strengthening the manager's position.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois for 14 days. The ruling came as a similar legal challenge to troop deployment in Portland was heard by an appeals court. The judge in Illinois questioned the administration's credibility and found no evidence of a "rebellion" that would warrant military intervention, stating that local law enforcement was capable of handling the situation. This decision represents a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to send federalized troops into cities led by Democratic officials.</p>

His defense team argues that the child died from pneumonia and that his conviction was based on "junk science."
