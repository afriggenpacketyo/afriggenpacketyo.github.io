          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 23:13:30 EDT</div>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has confirmed a massive $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors, effective from July 2024 through the end of 2033. The company has not disclosed the identity of its partner, citing a confidentiality request to protect trade secrets. This long-term deal is a significant boost for Samsung's foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies and competes directly with industry leader TSMC. The news comes as Samsung aims to advance its 2-nanometer technology and has caused its shares to rise, despite recent struggles to meet AI-related demand.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework deal, establishing a 15% tariff on many European exports to the US, a figure lower than the threatened 30% but higher than previous rates. The agreement is being presented as a significant victory for the Trump administration, which also secured commitments for the EU to purchase more American energy and arms. For the EU, the deal avoids a more damaging trade war and provides stability, though it represents a notable concession on tariff levels. The agreement also sets the stage for upcoming US trade negotiations with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to the trade of child sexual abuse material as part of "Operation Grayskull." The network had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files. The investigation, which began in 2020, has so far led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or used the platforms. Among those convicted is a man described by the DOJ as "one of the most significant" purveyors of such material in the world, who has been sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>In response to rising violence in prisons, specially trained staff in men's facilities across England and Wales will be equipped with Tasers in a new trial. The move comes as new data reveals over £20 million has been paid in compensation for assaults on staff and inmates over five years. The government states it is ensuring staff have the necessary tools for safety, while the Prison Officers' Association has called the measure long overdue to address "intolerable" violence. The Tasers will be issued to a specialist national unit that responds to serious incidents like riots and hostage situations.</p>

          <p>China's technology hub, Shenzhen, has introduced new regulations that mandate leniency for researchers and companies whose state-funded innovation projects fail to meet their goals. The rules state that if failures are due to legitimate technical difficulties or market shifts, and do not involve misconduct or abuse of power, the individuals and units involved should not be punished. This policy is designed to encourage bold exploration and risk-taking in scientific and technological research. The aim is to foster a culture where innovators are not afraid to pursue ambitious projects, even if they don't succeed.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a trade deal setting a 15% tariff on most EU goods entering the US, European leaders have offered varied but generally positive reactions. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the deal "positive" and a source of stability, while Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof noted that while "no tariffs would have been better," the agreement provides clarity. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the pact for averting a worse conflict that would have hit Germany's export-heavy economy hard. The deal averts a threatened 30% tariff but still represents a significant compromise from the EU's initial goal of zero tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the US, half the rate Trump had threatened, while a 50% tariff on steel remains. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to investing $600 billion in the US and purchasing $750 billion in American energy products. Both leaders hailed the deal as a major achievement that brings stability, though it marks a significant concession from the EU's pre-Trump tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An archaeological site in the village of Keeladi in southern India has ignited a fierce political and historical debate. Excavations have unearthed a 2,500-year-old urban settlement, with some artifacts dating back to 580 BCE. Experts from the Tamil Nadu state archaeology department argue these findings challenge the long-held narrative of a northern-centric origin for Indian civilization and literacy. The claims have turned the site into a symbol of Tamil pride and identity, fueling a north-south political divide and leading to accusations that the federal government is attempting to suppress the findings.</p>
