          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field in California's Fresno County on Wednesday evening, but the pilot managed to eject safely and was not injured. The aircraft was attached to the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders," a Navy squadron based at Naval Air Station Lemoore that trains pilots on the F-35 platform. The crash caused a small grass fire that burned approximately a dozen acres, which was subsequently contained by Cal Fire. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation, and no other personnel were reported to be affected.</p>

The official stated that nearly 100,000 aid trucks have entered the territory since the war began, and Israel has facilitated the establishment of 14 field hospitals and numerous aid entry points. The briefing emphasized ongoing coordination with dozens of international partners to deliver food, water, and medical supplies, and highlighted challenges in aid distribution once inside Gaza. The official asserted that Israel's war is against Hamas, not the civilian population, and that it complies with international humanitarian law.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade agreement, establishing a blanket tariff of 15% on South Korean exports to the U.S., including for the critical automotive sector. The deal avoids a threatened 25% levy and includes a commitment from South Korea for a $350 billion investment fund for U.S. industries like shipbuilding and semiconductors. While the U.S. Commerce Secretary stated 90% of the investment profits would go to Americans, South Korea's president indicated the fund would facilitate Korean companies' entry into the U.S. market. The agreement negates some benefits of the existing bilateral free trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a controversial bill, AB 379, into law, which increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The new law allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. This "wobbler" provision targets older individuals while avoiding harsher penalties for all younger offenders. The bill faced opposition from some Democrats who raised concerns about potential harm to victims and the profiling of minorities under a related loitering provision.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced that she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the next election. In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now, though she loves her home state. Sources close to Harris indicated that while she seriously considered the run, she believes she can have a greater impact on the national stage and wants to experience life as a private citizen. This decision keeps the door open for a potential presidential run in 2028.</p>

          <h2>Tsunami Alerts Issued Across Pacific After Major Earthquake Off Russia, with Risk Passing for US</h2>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific, prompting warnings and evacuations in Japan, Hawaii, and the U.S. West Coast. While Hawaii and most of the U.S. coast saw their warnings downgraded or canceled after only minor flooding and small waves were observed, some alerts remained active for South American countries. The powerful undersea quake, one of the strongest ever recorded, caused flooding in Russia near the epicenter. Experts noted that tsunamis are a series of waves and that dangerous currents could persist for some time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to expand London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and complex task of rerouting the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would reduce risk, control costs, and could be fully operational by 2035 at a cost under £25 billion. This marks the first time the government is considering competing bids for the long-debated expansion project, which aims to significantly increase the airport's flight capacity.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning due to cramping, alleviating initial concerns of a more serious injury. On a hot and humid night, Ohtani appeared uncomfortable on the mound before being removed, but he was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter. The team stated the issue was related to the humidity and expects him to make his next scheduled start. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 5-2, capping a disappointing month for the team, but the news about Ohtani's minor ailment was a significant relief.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The rate remains in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, though in an unusual move, two board members dissented, voting in favor of a rate reduction. The decision comes amid uncertainty over the economic effects of the administration's tariffs, with policymakers remaining cautious about inflation, which is still above the 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that he sees little evidence that current interest rates are inappropriately holding back the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a major earthquake off the coast of Russia, this article explains the science behind tsunamis. These powerful ocean waves are typically generated by large, shallow, underwater earthquakes that cause vertical movement of the seafloor, displacing massive volumes of water. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use deep ocean sensors and tide gauges to predict their arrival and potential height. Experts stress that tsunamis are a series of waves, not a single event, and even small ones can create dangerously strong currents, making it crucial for people to heed evacuation warnings and move to higher ground immediately.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led scientific expedition has captured unprecedented images of abundant life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Using a human-occupied submersible, researchers discovered thriving communities of creatures, including fields of tube worms and beds of clams, in a pitch-black, high-pressure environment. This life is not fueled by sunlight but by chemosynthesis, converting chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust into energy. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life and suggest such ecosystems may be widespread in the planet's deepest trenches.</p>
