          <p>British Steel has been awarded a five-year, ¬£500 million contract to supply train tracks for Network Rail, securing thousands of jobs and providing stability for the Scunthorpe steelworks. The contract, commencing on July 1st, ensures that British Steel will continue to meet 80% of Network Rail's track needs, with other European steelmakers supplying specialized rail products. This agreement follows government intervention to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces by its Chinese owners, Jingye. The deal underscores the government's commitment to strengthening domestic manufacturing and supply chains, particularly in critical infrastructure sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs report that China's private enterprises are experiencing a resurgence due to the easing of regulatory restrictions. These changes aim to support non-state firms in achieving technological breakthroughs and expanding their international presence. The private sector's renewed "animal spirits" are evident in increased capital expenditure, overseas expansion plans, R&D spending, and fundraising activity. The sustainability of this rebound depends on more predictable policies, macro stimulus to address disinflation, and stable U.S.-China relations, as the private sector contributes significantly to China's GDP and employment.</p>

          <p>Marshall, a small mountain town in Western North Carolina, has reopened to visitors after being devastated by Hurricane Helene nearly nine months ago. The town, located along the French Broad River, saw the river rise nearly 25 feet during the storm, washing out homes and businesses. Business owners, who remember the mud caked on their floors, are eager to welcome visitors back, with volunteers from across the country having helped with the cleanup efforts. Despite the challenges, there's a sense of victory as the town returns to normalcy, with many businesses reopening their doors.</p>

          <h2>IEA Projects Continued Global Oil Demand Growth Despite China Peak</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global oil demand will continue to grow until the end of this decade, despite an anticipated peak in China's demand by 2027. The IEA attributes this to cheaper gasoline and slower electric vehicle adoption in the United States. While maintaining its prediction that global demand will peak by 2029, the agency notes that China's demand will peak earlier due to increased EV usage. The IEA's forecast contrasts with OPEC's view that consumption will continue to rise, and the IEA also suggests ample oil supplies through 2030 if there are no major disruptions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order to implement parts of a trade deal between the UK and the US, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US. The deal allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier in the year. The order also includes provisions for steel and aluminum, but details on those tariffs were not specified, although the UK government hopes to make progress toward 0% tariffs on core steel products. The agreement also removes tariffs on certain aerospace products, and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the deal as a "sign of strength" between the two countries.</p>

Despite the men's team experiencing their worst domestic campaign since 1973-74 and the women needing to surpass Chelsea's Treble-winning team, Berrada believes it is better to aim high.

          <p>Chris Woakes' return to the England team for the first Test against India at Headingley is considered crucial. Woakes, now 36 and the oldest player in the squad, is expected to lead the attack with his accuracy and movement. He played a significant role in England's Ashes victory two years ago and in Stuart Broad's send-off at The Oval. His consistency and experience make him a vital asset for the team, especially given the Indian batting lineup's lack of experience in English conditions.</p>
