          <h2>Air Canada Flight Attendants End Strike After Tentative Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 06:16:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Air Canada flight attendants, represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), have ended their days-old strike after reaching a tentative agreement with the airline. The industrial action had significantly disrupted summer travel, affecting approximately 130,000 passengers daily, primarily due to disputes over wages and compensation for ground duties. Despite the Canada Industrial Relations Board declaring the strike illegal and issuing return-to-work orders, union leaders initially defied these directives, emphasizing the need for a negotiated solution. The mediated settlement is expected to resolve core issues, including a substantial compensation increase, paving the way for a gradual resumption of Air Canada's operations and alleviating widespread travel disruptions.</p>

          <p>Home Depot maintained its full-year sales growth forecast of 2.8% and comparable sales increase of 1%, despite missing Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations for the second consecutive quarter. The company reported a slight decrease in net income but a nearly 5% rise in overall revenue for the fiscal second quarter. Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail acknowledged a "deferral mindset" among homeowners, yet pointed to positive indicators such as a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and improving monthly sales trends throughout the quarter. Home Depot is actively diversifying its business by acquiring companies like SRS Distribution and GMS, focusing on professional customers to offset a sluggish real estate market and high borrowing costs.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 06:12:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American capital is increasingly flowing into Europe's top soccer leagues, driven by rapid revenue growth that has seen valuations soar, exemplified by Manchester United's valuation reaching £5 billion. Kieran Maguire, a football finance professor, attributes this trend to higher wealth aggregation in the U.S. and the limited availability of top-tier American sports teams for purchase. Private equity and venture capital now hold stakes in over 36 European clubs, with a sharp increase in M&A activity, often pursuing multi-club ownership models despite regulatory scrutiny from bodies like UEFA. While revenue growth from media rights is slowing, clubs are seeking to diversify income through commercial deals, stadium utilization, and potentially holding regular matches overseas to sustain this investment trend.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 06:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mechelen, Belgium, is increasingly vulnerable to intense rainfall and flooding due to its dense urbanization and sealed surfaces, a problem exacerbated by climate change. In response, the Flanders region has expanded its comprehensive Sigma Plan, initially launched after 1970s floods, to combine hard infrastructure like dikes with controlled flood zones. This strategy includes "depoldering" areas to give rivers more space and restoring wetlands, which can store vast amounts of water during heavy rains and release it during droughts. Local initiatives also involve separating rainwater from sewage and replacing paved areas with green spaces, demonstrating a multi-faceted approach to climate adaptation despite some public skepticism and ongoing development challenges.</p>

Starting Tuesday, the platform will feature tech accessories, home decor, and sports collectibles from external sellers, with Best Buy earning commissions. This strategy aims to fill product gaps, offer innovative items from smaller vendors, and leverage the growing trend of online marketplaces. While the model promises higher profits by shifting inventory and shipping responsibilities to sellers, it also carries risks, such as potential inconsistencies in customer experience. Best Buy anticipates about 500 vetted sellers at launch, with strict adherence to the company's return policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles couple Lexie Glass and Evan Hursley successfully transformed their traditional, water-intensive lawn into a vibrant, low-water native landscape, drawing inspiration from local wildlife and sustainable practices. They leveraged a $5,100 rebate from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's turf replacement program, covering all material costs for their DIY project. The couple meticulously designed their garden, incorporating elements like sinuous paths from recycled concrete and using sheet mulching to enrich the soil. This endeavor not only created a beautiful, eco-friendly oasis that attracts local wildlife but also serves as an inspiring example for neighbors, demonstrating the accessibility and benefits of sustainable landscaping.</p>

          <p>This article highlights Harrison Ford's Emmy nomination for his supporting role in Apple TV+'s "Shrinking" as a significant, and long-overdue, recognition of his extensive acting career. Despite a prolific filmography spanning decades, this marks Ford's first Emmy nomination and only his second major competitive acting nomination, with his sole Oscar nod being for "Witness" in 1986. The article emphasizes that Ford, at 83, has never won a major competitive film or television award, despite accumulating numerous lifetime achievement honors. His performance as therapist Paul Rhoades is considered a strong frontrunner, suggesting that an Emmy win would be a fitting and well-deserved acknowledgment of his enduring contributions to the entertainment industry.</p>

Silcott made history as the first Black project architect for both Los Angeles County and UCLA, where he contributed to significant buildings like the UCLA Boathouse. He successfully sued L.A. County for racial discrimination and retaliation, a case that became a rallying point for equity in public employment. A Howard University alumnus, Silcott's financial struggles during his studies inspired him to become a prolific philanthropist, donating over $3 million to Howard's architecture program, establishing funds for student aid and endowed chairs, and mentoring generations of aspiring architects.</p>

          <p>Kiruna, a city in Sweden's far north, is undertaking the monumental task of relocating its 113-year-old church, a vast red timber structure, 5 kilometers to a new city center. This move is necessitated by ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining, which threatens the old city's infrastructure. The 672-tonne church, once voted Sweden's most beautiful pre-1950 building, is being moved intact on giant trailers at a speed of 500 meters per hour, a two-day journey. This engineering marvel is a deeply emotional and symbolic event for residents, signifying the preservation of tradition, history, and community memories amidst the city's wider relocation efforts.</p>

Remarkably, modern medicine still employs versions of cardiotonic steroids to treat congestive heart failure.

To address this, Princeton University's AI4All summer camp invites high schoolers from low-income families to learn about generative AI, aiming to "democratize AI education." Participants like Esraa Elsharkawy and Anthony Papathanasopoulos, who lack AI education in their own communities, gain valuable skills and envision AI's potential for solving real-world problems. Computer science professor Olga Russakovsky, co-founder of AI4All, stresses the importance of diversifying the AI field to ensure its benefits reach everyone and to prevent misuse of the technology.</p>

          <p>The UK has reportedly withdrawn its controversial demand for a "back door" to global Apple users' encrypted data, according to the U.S. director of national intelligence. This demand, issued under the Investigatory Powers Act, would have compelled Apple to break its own encryption methods, which the company resisted by withdrawing its Advanced Data Protection from the UK market and initiating legal challenges. While the UK government has not formally confirmed the withdrawal, privacy campaigners express cautious optimism, viewing the original demand as a "reckless and potentially unlawful move." Concerns remain that similar powers still exist in UK law, posing ongoing risks to user security and privacy.</p>
