          <p>Darden Restaurants, owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, missing earnings per share expectations but meeting revenue forecasts. Net sales increased by 10.4% to $3.04 billion, boosted by the acquisition of Chuy's Tex Mex restaurants. Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse showed strong same-store sales growth, offsetting struggles in fine dining. Despite the earnings miss, the company raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to 7.5%-8.5%, reiterating its adjusted earnings per share projections. Shares fell in premarket trading following the announcement, reflecting investor reactions to the financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

This "historic collaboration" aims to merge Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing with Intel's CPUs, expanding ecosystems for the next era of computing. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the strategic importance of this fusion of world-class platforms. The deal, subject to regulatory approvals, does not include manufacturing Nvidia chips with Intel's foundry, focusing instead on collaborative development. This investment signals a significant strategic alliance within the competitive semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Role of AI Chatbots Like ChatGPT in Healthcare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI chatbots like ChatGPT are increasingly being used in healthcare, with some doctors consulting them for second opinions and many patients seeking medical advice. While an article notes a case where ChatGPT correctly diagnosed a rare illness, another highlights a patient poisoned by following its advice. Experts caution against relying solely on AI for diagnosis due to its tendency to "hallucinate" and lack of HIPAA compliance. However, these tools can help patients frame questions for doctors or understand medical jargon, potentially leading to more productive conversations and improved care. The future sees AI as a scribe or diagnostic aid, but human oversight remains crucial.</p>

          <p>New Zealand is undertaking an ambitious conservation project to save its unique flightless birds, like the kākāpō and takahē, from invasive predators introduced by human settlers. The goal is to eliminate predators like rats and stoats by 2050, a massive undertaking requiring innovative solutions. The country is exploring new technologies such as AI-powered automated traps that identify target species and genetic research, including gene drives, to prevent invasive species from breeding. While the scale of eradication is unprecedented and poses risks like unforeseen consequences from genetic modification, these efforts aim to create thriving native wildlife populations. Brent Beaven, manager of Predator Free 2050, emphasizes the creation of new tools and technology as a significant gain, regardless of full eradication success.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented a new policy permitting men aged 18 to 22 to leave and re-enter the country as they choose, a move President Zelenskyy believes will encourage them to stay. This decision, aimed at retaining young talent, has sparked societal debate, with some viewing it positively while others question its fairness to military personnel. Many young men cited reasons like visiting family, attending events, or seeking better work abroad, often expressing intentions to return for studies or holidays. Border officials noted an increase in overall summer traffic, but not a significant surge specifically from this age group, suggesting a nuanced impact.</p>

          <h2>Leonardo DiCaprio's New Film Explores Cultural Divisiveness and Extremism</h2>

          <p>Leonardo DiCaprio stars in Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," which the actor says holds a mirror up to society's growing polarization and divisiveness. The article, 20 years in the making, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon's novel "Vineland," features DiCaprio as a paranoid ex-revolutionary. While not having a central message, the film delves into "an interesting undercurrent about extremism" in a politically satirical and black comedic style. Critics have warmly received the film, praising its acting and timely themes of dissent and not fitting in, particularly relevant in today's American context.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in US investment, expected to create 7,600 jobs, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major firms like Blackstone, Microsoft, and Google are committing significant funds, aiming to deepen economic ties between the two nations. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the pledges as a testament to Britain's economic strength and its openness for business. However, this comes as domestic businesses slow investment due to rising costs, and pharmaceutical giants like Merck and AstraZeneca have paused UK investment, citing an increasingly challenging business environment and shifting focus to the US. The contrast highlights ongoing economic complexities despite the new foreign capital. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's National Immigration Administration reported 15.89 million visa-free entries from January to August, accounting for roughly two-thirds of international arrivals. This growth is significantly powered by visitors from Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia, following a reciprocal visa-free agreement implemented on July 17. Since then, Malaysian passport holders have made 150,000 visa-free trips to China. Russia is also anticipated to become another major source of visa-free arrivals. This trend indicates a successful diplomatic strategy to boost tourism and international exchange, fostering closer ties with regional partners and contributing to economic activity.</p>

          <p>"Phasmagorica," an immersive séance experience created by BC Smith, is selling out at L.A.'s Heritage Square Museum, reimagining the art of communing with the deceased. The event, which Smith describes as an "experiment" rather than a performance, seeks to evoke the feeling of late 1880s séances, emphasizing realism and historical context. Attendees are left alone in a dark tent with a spirit board and other tools, prompting personal exploration rather than illusions. Smith, a "hopeful skeptic," aims to foster conversation about connection and meaning, noting the historical popularity of séances as group activities that demystified communication with spirits.</p>

          <p>California is continuing its ambitious plan for 25 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2045, despite the Trump administration canceling nearly half a billion dollars in federal funding for its largest project. Governor Newsom's senior advisor emphasized the state's commitment to clean energy goals, job creation, and global competitiveness. The state is utilizing its own $475 million climate bond funds for port upgrades and transmission infrastructure, which fall under state jurisdiction. While the federal cuts are a setback and raise concerns about private investment, California officials are determined to demonstrate how offshore wind development can succeed, especially given its importance for climate goals.</p>

          <p>West Hollywood will become the first city in Los Angeles County to enforce a widespread ban on the sale of most living animals, effective May 1, 2026. This ordinance expands an existing 2010 law prohibiting dog and cat sales, now including rabbits, amphibians, birds, and reptiles, among others. Animals from shelters or rescue organizations are exempt. Animal welfare groups like SPCA LA and PETA laud the decision, citing concerns over cruel breeding conditions. However, the Pet Advocacy Network argues it could undermine reputable retailers and fuel black market sales, drawing parallels to unintended consequences of California's statewide dog ban.</p>
