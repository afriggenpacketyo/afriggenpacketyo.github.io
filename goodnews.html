          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field near Naval Air Station Lemoore in Fresno County, California, on Wednesday evening. The pilot of the advanced aircraft was able to eject safely before the crash and was not injured. The jet was part of the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" squadron, a unit dedicated to training F-35 pilots. The crash caused a small grass fire that burned approximately a dozen acres, but no other personnel were affected. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade deal that sets a blanket tariff rate of 15% on South Korean exports, including for the critical automotive sector. This is lower than the 25% rate initially threatened by President Trump. As part of the agreement, South Korea has committed to a $350 billion investment in the U.S., though interpretations of how this fund will be used appear to differ between the two nations. The deal notably excludes further opening of South Korea's sensitive rice and beef markets, a key win for Seoul in the negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a controversial bill into law that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-old minors for sex. The new law allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. The bill, AB 379, faced opposition from some Democrats who raised concerns that certain provisions could be used to unfairly profile minority groups. The legislation also establishes a support fund for survivors, financed by increased fines on offenders and non-compliant hoteliers.</p>

In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now. A source close to Harris indicated that while she seriously considered the run, her heart wasn't in it, and this decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign. She plans to remain active by campaigning for Democrats and launching a nonprofit.</p>

          <h2>Hotel Tycoon Surinder Arora Proposes Rival Plan for Heathrow Airport Expansion</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport. The plan, named Heathrow West, features a shorter third runway that would avoid the costly and complex need to reroute the M25 motorway. The group claims its proposal would be cheaper and less risky than the one from Heathrow's own operators, with a new runway operational by 2035. This marks the first time the government is considering competing bids for the long-debated expansion project, introducing a new dynamic to the process.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it added 2.3 million funded customers, bringing its total to 26.5 million. The growth was driven by strong net deposits and higher valuations in equities and cryptocurrency, reflecting the company's successful push into broader wealth management services. Despite the strong performance, the stock slipped slightly on guidance for increased operating expenses related to its pending acquisition of Bitstamp. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning due to cramping, alleviating initial fears of a more serious injury. On a hot and humid night, Ohtani appeared uncomfortable on the mound before being removed, though he remained in the game as the designated hitter. Manager Dave Roberts expressed relief that the issue was minor and expects Ohtani to make his next scheduled start. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 5-2, capping a disappointing month for the team.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, signaling a potential shift in sentiment. The Fed's cautious approach comes amid debate over the economic impact of the administration's tariffs, with policymakers weighing stable employment against concerns of slowing growth and inflation that remains above their target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated a rate cut is not imminent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Scientific Explainer Details the Causes of Tsunamis and Safety Measures</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a major earthquake off the coast of Russia, this article explains the science behind tsunamis and the necessary safety precautions. Tsunamis are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that cause vertical movement of the seafloor. While they travel at jet-speed in the deep ocean, they slow down and increase dramatically in height as they approach shallow coastlines, creating powerful and destructive surges. Experts emphasize that even small tsunamis are dangerous and urge people in coastal areas to heed all evacuation warnings immediately by moving to higher ground.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese-led research expedition has discovered and filmed "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9 kilometers in the Pacific Ocean, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life. Using a human-occupied submersible, scientists observed vast fields of tube worms, clams, and bacterial mats in the pitch-dark, high-pressure environment. This life is not fueled by sunlight but by chemosynthesis, converting chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor into energy. The findings suggest these unique ecosystems may be widespread in the deepest parts of the ocean.</p>
