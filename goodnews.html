          <h2>Happiness Researcher Advocates '90-Second Rule' for Managing Negative Emotions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a '90-second rule' to better manage anger and stress for a more fulfilled life. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to an emotion like anger, involving hormones such as cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any lingering feeling is a result of consciously or unconsciously re-engaging with the triggering thought. Gawdat advises allowing oneself to feel the emotion for that minute and a half, and then actively choosing to shift focus, thereby preventing a cycle of rumination and prolonged distress.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the hobby-centric culture in Denmark, a business school professor undertook an experiment to try 17 different hobbies in one year, leading to profound personal changes. The author found that engaging in activities like pottery, tennis, and woodworking helped her kick a doomscrolling habit, build new social communities, and feel less lonely. This journey reshaped her understanding of self-care, shifting it from passive appointments to active, skill-building pursuits. She concludes that integrating hobbies is a crucial secret to achieving work-life balance, as it forces the creation of healthy boundaries and fosters a stronger sense of individual identity.</p>

          <p>According to a new study analyzing Census Bureau data, Florida was the most popular state for Americans aged 60 and over to relocate to in 2023, attracting a net migration of over 44,000 retirees. The state's appeal is largely attributed to its favorable tax policies, including no state income tax on Social Security benefits or retirement account withdrawals, as well as its warm climate and abundant recreational opportunities. While Florida has consistently led in retiree migration, the net inflow for 2023 was significantly lower than the previous year. The article also lists other popular states for retirement, such as North Carolina. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the Utah desert, the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS), operated by the nonprofit Mars Society, serves as a crucial training ground for future life on Mars. The facility's terrain closely mimics the Martian landscape, allowing crews to live in isolation and follow strict protocols similar to those required for a real space mission. A recent five-person crew spent two weeks at the station, conducting extravehicular activities (EVAs) in simulated spacesuits and managing daily life in a confined habitat. This analog environment is considered one of the best for preparing astronauts for the scientific, engineering, and psychological challenges of a potential mission to Mars.</p>

          <p>This newsletter compilation explores the evolving motivations for physical activity, moving beyond the traditional goal of weight loss to embrace a wider range of benefits for physical and mental well-being. It highlights that for many, exercise was long associated with the aesthetic pursuit of thinness, but finding a form of movement that feels good can fundamentally change this relationship. The article references personal stories of discovering joy in activities like weightlifting or running, which can build confidence and comfort in one's body more effectively than purely calorie-focused workouts. It posits that in an era of weight-loss drugs, understanding the intrinsic value of movement is more important than ever.</p>

          <p>The mortality rate from heart attacks in the United States has plummeted by nearly 90 percent since 1970, marking a significant public health achievement. This dramatic improvement is attributed to a combination of preventative measures and advanced medical treatments. Key factors include the steep decline in smoking rates, the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and improved emergency response protocols like CPR and portable defibrillators. While this progress has saved millions of lives, the article notes that rising rates of obesity and diabetes present new challenges, and emerging treatments like GLP-1 inhibitors could play a crucial role in future cardiovascular health.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-affiliated media reports that China and the European Union are close to resolving their dispute over electric vehicle (EV) tariffs, with technical negotiations largely complete. The finalization of a deal now reportedly depends on the 'political will' of the EU. This development comes as the EU has been actively investigating Chinese trade practices, including subsidies and alleged market distortions, which it claims give Chinese EV manufacturers an unfair advantage. The potential agreement could de-escalate trade tensions between the two economic powers, which have been strained by multiple ongoing trade probes initiated by the EU.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team achieved a 21-10 victory against an understrength Waratahs side in Sydney, though their performance was marked by numerous errors and a lack of cohesion. Scotland's Huw Jones scored two first-half tries, but the Lions struggled to maintain momentum, allowing the Waratahs to close the gap to just four points early in the second half. A key try from scrum-half Alex Mitchell ultimately secured the win for the tourists. Despite the victory, the high mistake count and disjointed play were seen as concerning for the team as they prepare for the upcoming Test series against the Wallabies.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old retired police officer from Long Island shares his story of surviving a major stroke, emphasizing the critical role of immediate medical intervention. After waking with stroke symptoms, he was rushed to the hospital where doctors initiated a stroke protocol, administering a clot-busting drug and performing a procedure within a very short timeframe. His recovery was arduous, involving a tracheotomy and extensive speech and physical therapy to regain his ability to talk, swallow, and walk. The account serves as a powerful reminder of the 'time is brain' principle in stroke treatment and the challenging, long-term nature of rehabilitation after such a life-altering event.</p>

          <p>Following a successful grassroots campaign, Florida has passed a law banning oil and gas exploration within 10 miles of certain protected estuaries, including the environmentally vital Apalachicola Bay region. The 'Kill the Drill' coalition, comprising residents, environmental groups, and business owners, formed after the state initially granted an exploratory drilling permit to a Louisiana-based company in 2024. Citing the devastating economic impact caused by the mere threat of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the coalition lobbied for permanent protection. The new law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, marks a significant victory for local conservation efforts against the fossil fuel industry.</p>

In response, brands are revamping their programs with new campaigns and more flexible reward structures to enhance engagement and provide tangible value, hoping to offset the impact of a broader spending slowdown.</p>

          <p>The Apple TV+ series 'Murderbot,' based on Martha Wells' novella, offers a unique twist on the artificial intelligence narrative by featuring a protagonist that has no desire to be human. The show follows a security cyborg who, after hacking its own governing module to achieve free will, names itself 'Murderbot' and prefers watching soap operas to interacting with the humans it protects. Unlike many sci-fi stories where AI yearns for humanity, this character finds human emotions and social norms alien and undesirable, choosing to keep its autonomy a secret. This premise provides a refreshing and quirky exploration of consciousness, identity, and the potential gulf between human and machine intelligence.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has intensified its enforcement against a black market for illegal caviar, stemming from the poaching of protected sturgeon in the Sacramento River. With sturgeon populations under stress, fishing is restricted to catch-and-release, but high demand for caviar has fueled illegal trafficking. Recent operations, including surveillance and vehicle stops, led to the capture of poachers possessing sturgeon. A separate investigation into Dungeness crab trafficking also uncovered a salmon poaching ring, resulting in the seizure of over 150 pounds of black market salmon roe. These enforcement actions aim to protect threatened species and disrupt illicit wildlife trade.</p>

          <p>A key group of eight OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, has agreed to a larger-than-anticipated oil production increase of 548,000 barrels per day for August. This move accelerates the unwinding of voluntary supply cuts that were put in place to stabilize the market. The decision was attributed to a steady global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, as indicated by low oil inventories. This increase is part of a phased plan to gradually restore production, with the group having already boosted output significantly in the preceding months to meet demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Rooted in the civil rights tradition, the movement aims to build a broad coalition of the poor and working class to force a moral reckoning in the public square.
