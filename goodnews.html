          <p>This New York Times article reports that President Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, a move that is likely to solidify Ciattarelli's odds in the Republican primary. The article notes that Ciattarelli previously criticized Trump but has since courted his support. The endorsement could be a liability in the general election, as New Jersey traditionally leans left and Trump is seen as a polarizing figure. The article also mentions the other candidates in the race and the Democrats' competitive primary.</p>

The article highlights the conflict between the administration's efforts to control independent agencies and the legal protections afforded to CPB. The article also notes that CPB's board would be unable to enact Trump's executive order seeking to defund PBS and NPR without a quorum.</p>
