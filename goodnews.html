          <p>Australia secured a decisive 26-6 victory over England in the first Rugby League Ashes match to be held since 2003. After a tense opening, the Kangaroos took control of the game at Wembley, with Reece Walsh scoring two impressive tries. Despite a disallowed try and some spirited defense from England, Australia maintained its lead throughout the contest. England managed a late consolation try from Daryl Clark, but it was not enough to challenge the Australian dominance. The victory continues Australia's long-standing success in the historic rivalry between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Following the controversial demolition of the White House East Wing, a journalist embarked on a quest to locate the historic rubble. The search led to East Potomac Golf Links, where trucks were depositing White House soil, reportedly to be used for creating a new golf hole. Further investigation traced dump trucks back to the White House and to an industrial park in Maryland, though site workers denied receiving any debris from the presidential residence. The article reflects on how a cherished national symbol can be reduced to rubble and discreetly hauled away from public view.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded the election. Although vote counting was still in progress, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister. The role of president in Ireland is largely ceremonial, but Connolly has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza and gained backing from several left-leaning parties. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two seven-year terms.</p>

          <p>The popular investment strategy of passively investing in S&P 500 index funds, like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing its appeal due to a lack of diversification. Financial analysts observe that the index has become heavily concentrated, with the technology sector accounting for a record high of over 35%. In contrast, defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities are at an all-time low weighting. As a result, some traders are reportedly shifting their focus toward small-cap stocks, which have recently shown strong performance and offer broader market exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a new interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris has indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency in 2028. While stating she has not made a final decision, Harris asserted, "I am not done," and expressed confidence that a woman will eventually be elected president. She dismissed current polls that show her with low favorability, recalling that she defied polling expectations in her previous electoral victories. Harris also strongly criticized President Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" who is weaponizing the justice system and has caused many to capitulate to his demands.</p>

          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or optimizing rest through technology, has created a multi-billion dollar industry for gadgets like the Eight Sleep smart mattress. However, a recent cloud service outage demonstrated the pitfalls of this dependency, as users' high-tech beds malfunctioned, becoming stuck in freezing, boiling, or upright positions. While some advanced sleep tech can be beneficial for medical conditions like PTSD-induced nightmares, the general market is flooded with devices whose effectiveness is questionable. The incident highlights the potential for technology, often a cause of sleep disruption, to introduce new points of failure into our most basic biological functions.</p>

While her victory was clear, it was not a landslide, suggesting that the faction of the party closer to the prime minister still holds significant support.

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist advises that saying "no" to children should be part of a broader strategy to teach safety, regulation, and connection. Instead of simple prohibition, parents should explain the reasoning behind boundaries and offer choices to give children a sense of autonomy. For example, rather than just saying "stop," a parent could say "gentle hands" to guide behavior positively. The article emphasizes that consistency is key, as it helps children feel secure, and it is important for parents to repair the connection after a reactive or emotional "no."</p>
