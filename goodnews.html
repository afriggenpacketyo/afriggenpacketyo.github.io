          <p>Ford Motor Company announced a significant 14.2% increase in vehicle sales for the second quarter compared to the previous year, far exceeding the industry's projected 1.4% growth. The automaker sold 612,095 new vehicles, with strong performance from its F-Series trucks and electrified vehicles, which include both hybrids and EVs. While hybrid sales saw a 23.5% rise, pure electric vehicle sales experienced a 31.4% decline in the same period.

          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology explored the perceived effects of food on sleep and dreams among college students. The research, based on online surveys, found that participants most frequently blamed desserts, spicy food, and dairy products for worsening their sleep quality. Specifically concerning dreams, 22% of participants who felt food affected their dreams attributed disturbing nightmares to consuming dairy. The study's authors theorize this association may be linked to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance during sleep, which could negatively impact dream content, though they acknowledge the need for more substantive evidence.</p>

While national average yields for CDs are modest, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some 6-month and 1-year CDs offering APYs above 4.40%. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide better rates than long-term ones.

          <p>With over 100 million Americans facing a collective $220 billion in medical debt, various relief options are available for those struggling to pay their bills. Nonprofit hospitals are required by law to offer charity care, providing free or discounted services to patients who meet specific income criteria, often below 200-300% of the federal poverty level. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement companies can negotiate to reduce balances, though this may impact credit. As a final resort, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can eliminate or restructure medical debt, but has serious long-term financial consequences.</p>

Responses like 'someone who doesn't want to text on weekends' or 'a person who's too social' provide genuine insight into a company's culture.

          <p>Despite fears of renewed inflation, President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to significant price increases for U.S. consumers. Economists point to several buffering factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory before tariffs took effect, absorbing some costs to maintain market share, and using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, this stability may be temporary. Experts, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, anticipate that the inflationary impact of the tariffs will likely begin to appear in consumer prices during the second half of the year.
