          <p>Taylor Swift has personally addressed and dismissed rumors that she will perform at the Super Bowl halftime show. During an interview, she explained that while she has a good relationship with organizer Jay-Z, her focus during the football season is entirely on supporting her fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce. She described the sport as intense and dangerous, stating she is too "locked in" watching him play to simultaneously plan a major performance. Swift also used the interview to deny other rumors and share details about Kelce's romantic proposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to author Morgan Housel, true happiness stems from contentment and managing expectations rather than the accumulation of wealth. The article argues that the pursuit of 'more' often leads to dissatisfaction, as desires escalate with each new acquisition. It contrasts the lives of unhappy billionaires with individuals who live on modest means but feel rich because their wants are few. The central lesson is that psychological wealth is achieved by appreciating what one already has and recognizing that happiness is the state where nothing feels missing, regardless of one's financial status.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed over 225% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. This partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals, such as copper and cobalt, located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move reverses a previous administration's decision to block the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed focus on securing U.S. supply chains for resources essential for defense and energy infrastructure.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio suggests investors should consider allocating up to 15% of their portfolios to gold, as the precious metal's price surpasses $4,000 an ounce. He compares the current economic environment of high debt and government spending to the early 1970s, arguing that gold serves as a crucial diversifier when traditional assets like debt instruments underperform. Dalio emphasizes that gold is a unique asset for wealth preservation during times of monetary debasement and geopolitical instability, offering a hedge against widespread market volatility.

          <h2>Financial Advisors Suggest Diversification Strategies as S&P 500 Reaches New Highs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 10:21:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the S&P 500 continues to set record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to look beyond the popular index for better diversification. They caution that the market-cap-weighted index is heavily concentrated in a few large technology companies, creating a potential risk if those stocks falter. To mitigate this, advisors suggest considering total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weighted S&P 500 funds. The goal is to build a more balanced portfolio that can better withstand a potential market pullback. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Startups Increasingly Delay IPOs Due to Abundant Private Capital</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 10:14:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals that startups are staying private for significantly longer, with the median age for a company going public now at 13 years, up from 10 years in 2018. This trend is largely attributed to the massive growth in alternative capital from sources like private equity, venture capital, and sovereign wealth funds, which provide ample funding without the regulatory burdens of a public listing. As a result, companies are maturing and achieving much larger revenues before their IPOs. This shift is changing the landscape for both private and public market investors.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain Recent Swarm of Ladybirds in UK Homes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents across the UK have reported an unusual number of ladybirds swarming in and around their homes, a phenomenon experts say is normal for this time of year. Unseasonably warm weather has prompted the insects to become active and seek sheltered places to hibernate for the winter. The most common species found indoors is the invasive harlequin ladybird, which has thrived due to a warm spring and summer that boosted the population of aphids, their primary food source. While they compete with native species, their congregation in homes is a natural part of their winter survival strategy.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has proposed the creation of an "open and shared sustainable mega constellation" (OSSMC), an AI-powered global satellite network intended for universal access. The project aims to address the challenges of an increasingly crowded low-Earth orbit, which is expected to host over a million satellites from projects like SpaceX's Starlink. Led by a professor involved in China's navigation systems, the initiative is presented as a solution to promote equitable access to space resources. It is framed as a Chinese contribution to building a shared future for humanity in space.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 09:39:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When choosing between traditional (pretax) and Roth 401(k) contributions, investors should consider their effective tax rate, not just their marginal rate, according to one financial planner. While the marginal rate applies to the last dollar earned, the effective rate represents the overall percentage of total income paid in taxes. This distinction is crucial because an individual's effective tax rate in retirement may be significantly lower than their marginal rate during their working years. This calculation can provide a more accurate picture for deciding whether to take a tax break now with traditional contributions or pay taxes upfront for tax-free growth with Roth.

          <p>Dell Technologies has increased its long-term annual revenue growth forecast from a range of 3-4% to a more optimistic 7-9%, causing its stock to climb 5%.

CEO Michael Dell stated that customers are eager for AI solutions and the company is successfully converting this demand into growth and strong cash flow. Dell, a key customer of Nvidia, plans to significantly increase its shipments of AI servers in the coming fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>
