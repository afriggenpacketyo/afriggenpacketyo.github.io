          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University doctoral student from Turkey, was released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. The judge, William K. Sessions III, emphasized the lack of evidence that Ozturk posed a threat to American foreign policy interests, with the primary evidence against her being an essay critical of Israel. Ozturk's lawyers accused the government of detaining her in retaliation for speech protected by the First Amendment, citing public outrage over her treatment. The article also details the conditions of her confinement and the impact on her academic work.</p>

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada due to concerns about heat damage to crops in China's agricultural heartlands. Henan province, a major wheat-growing region, issued a risk warning due to hot, dry weather. The purchases mark China's first wheat imports from Australia since last year. The article notes that China's imports had slowed after large harvests in 2024, and there is no guarantee that more purchases will follow due to existing wheat inventories.</p>
