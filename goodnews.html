          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coastline. Although it is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., the hurricane generated life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the East Coast, prompting warnings and beach closures. Parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks experienced tropical storm conditions and storm surge, leading to evacuation orders in some areas. Forecasters expect Erin to gradually weaken over the next few days and become a post-tropical storm by the weekend.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The method involves exchanging stocks from a portfolio for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, which legally delays the tax bill until the ETF shares are sold. To qualify, the contributed assets must meet strict diversification rules, ensuring no single stock is over-weighted. While the strategy offers significant tax advantages, financial advisors caution that it can limit investment flexibility, as the investor's capital is then tied up in that specific ETF.

Many tourists and locals are seeking permanent souvenirs inspired by the artist's new album, which is an ode to Puerto Rican culture. Local tattooists have created flash sheets with culturally significant designs like the maga flower and coquí frog. The artists are using the opportunity to educate non-Puerto Rican clients about the meaning behind the symbols, fostering a deeper appreciation for the island's heritage while navigating the complexities of cultural representation.</p>

          <h2>Kirsten Dunst Expresses Interest in Joining 'A Minecraft Movie' Sequel for Financial Reasons</h2>

          <p>Actress Kirsten Dunst has stated her desire to be cast in a sequel to the blockbuster "A Minecraft Movie," candidly admitting her motivation is to make "a pile of cash." In a recent interview, Dunst, whose career spans from childhood roles to critically acclaimed films like "Civil War," expressed a desire to work on a project that is highly profitable. Her last film, "Civil War," became A24's second-highest-grossing movie but earned significantly less than the nearly $1 billion worldwide gross of "A Minecraft Movie." Dunst also confirmed she has several other projects lined up, including films with directors Ruben Östlund and Sofia Coppola.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public records reveal that the U.S. military created a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid" for federal agents during this summer's escalated immigration raids. The list was compiled after activists organized protests, some lasting through the night, outside hotels where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were staying. The documents, obtained by a government transparency nonprofit, show that the protests successfully disrupted federal operations, forcing agencies to find accommodations where personnel would not be "harassed." The demonstrations were a direct community response to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the region.</p>

          <p>Jordan Cox and Sam Curran led the Oval Invincibles to a remarkable six-wicket victory against the Trent Rockets in The Hundred cricket tournament. The pair delivered spectacular half-centuries, scoring a combined 103 runs from just 28 deliveries to chase down a target of 172 with 11 balls remaining. The Rockets had set a strong total, largely thanks to Joe Root's season-best 76 runs. However, the explosive batting from Cox and Curran, which included a 32-run, five-ball set, turned the match decisively and solidified the Invincibles' position at the top of the league table.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is officially reviewing a petition to reclassify psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in "magic mushrooms." The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has requested the review, which could move psilocybin from a restrictive Schedule I narcotic to a less restrictive Schedule II classification. This change would acknowledge its potential medical value and could expand access for therapeutic use, particularly in treating conditions like depression and anxiety. The move follows a years-long legal effort by researchers seeking to use the substance in end-of-life care for terminally ill patients.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a closely watched speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium amidst a complex economic landscape and political pressure. Powell must navigate President Trump's demands for interest rate cuts while interpreting mixed economic data, including a recent slowdown in job growth and a rise in an inflation gauge. Analysts will be looking for any hints about the Fed's upcoming September interest-rate decision, though Powell is expected to maintain a data-dependent stance. The speech is critical as the Fed balances its dual mandate of maximizing employment and controlling inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion, debt forgiveness programs are an option for some struggling consumers, but not everyone qualifies. Generally, candidates must have a substantial amount of unsecured debt, typically $7,500 or more, for creditors to consider negotiation. They also need to be experiencing significant financial hardship, such as job loss or a medical emergency, which makes full repayment unrealistic. Furthermore, borrowers who are already delinquent on their payments are more likely to be approved, as creditors may prefer a partial settlement over the risk of receiving nothing if the consumer declares bankruptcy.

          <p>Kristian Nairn, known for his role as Hodor in "Game of Thrones," has withdrawn from the upcoming season of "Strictly Come Dancing" just days after being announced as a contestant. In a video to his followers, Nairn explained that he has been dealing with a high level of stress and grief that has begun to manifest physically, causing a concerning spike in his vitals. While his doctor is not overly concerned and expects a recovery within weeks, the timeline does not allow for the necessary training for the show. Actor Lewis Cope from "Emmerdale" will take his place in the competition.</p>
