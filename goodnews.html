          <p>Sunday's newspaper headlines focus on a range of topics, including the government's new immigration plans to deport migrants who commit crimes and a deep dive into Donald Trump's business dealings. Several papers lead with the government's planned crackdown on foreign nationals convicted of offenses, granting officials wider powers to remove them from the UK. Other stories include an exclusive interview with Danny Dyer about his time on EastEnders and speculation about the cast of the upcoming series of Strictly Come Dancing. A story about a retired special constable arrested for a social media post warning about antisemitism also made headlines.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful and unrealistic. She suggests that being flawed is an essential part of a mother's role, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. Dr. Ross highlights the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems, urging a shift towards recognizing the credit mothers deserve. She encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and stop striving for an unattainable ideal.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has reiterated his goal to eliminate all tariffs in trade negotiations with the United States. Speaking on a Fuji Television morning program, Ishiba acknowledged positive discussions with the US, but emphasized that Japan should aim for zero percent tariffs, even as Washington agreed with London on a baseline 10% tariff for car exports. Ishiba argued that high auto import levies would make cars more expensive for U.S. consumers and that lowering those tariffs would benefit the American economy. He also expressed caution about a potential reduction in consumption tax to support the domestic economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has drawn widespread condemnation from Iranians across the political spectrum, who view the name as a fundamental part of their national identity. This move has seemingly united Iranians of all political, ideological, and religious factions against what they see as an attempt to erase their history and culture. While Trump has the power to change geographical names within the United States, it is unlikely that other countries will follow suit, and the move could negatively impact ongoing nuclear talks between Iran and the United States.</p>

          <p>A new medication, zongertinib, has shown promise as a safe and effective therapy for a hard-to-treat type of lung cancer. According to an international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists, the oral medication outperformed the standard treatment option when treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, indicates that zongertinib could establish a new benchmark for targeted therapy in HER2-mutant NSCLC.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo government has begun redeveloping a two-kilometer expressway in the Ginza district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians, expected to be completed by the 2040s. The Tokyo Sky Corridor will replace the Tokyo Expressway, also known as the "KK Line," which was built on rooftops and opened in 1966. The plan is modeled after New York City's High Line and aims to create a tourist attraction with trees, flowers, benches, and rest areas. The project faces challenges, such as summer heat and the structure's ability to support soil and plant life.</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as the "big tent" party, suggesting that the party has become too exclusive. Gallego cited podcast host Joe Rogan as an example of someone "kicked out" of the tent because his message did not completely align with the party's. He touted his own success in a battleground state as an example of how Democratic candidates can win moving forward and emphasized the importance of empathizing with voters on issues impacting them.</p>
