          <p>A 31-year-old Manhattan resident, Micherre Fox, found a 2.3-carat white diamond after a three-week search at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. She had traveled to the park specifically to find her own stone for her engagement ring, believing in the symbolism of solving problems through hard work. On her final day, she discovered the gem, which park staff later confirmed, making it the third-largest diamond found at the park this year. Fox has named the stone the "Fox-Ballou Diamond" in honor of herself and her partner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," numerous major corporations have adopted the color orange in their social media marketing. This trend was sparked by Swift's recent affinity for the color and her discussion of it on the "New Heights" podcast, co-hosted by her boyfriend Travis Kelce. Companies from United Airlines to Netflix and even the NHL have posted orange-themed content to capitalize on the massive economic and cultural influence associated with the artist. The phenomenon underscores the significant marketing power Swift wields, turning her personal preferences into major brand opportunities.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the return of standalone physical stores and its first catwalk show in seven years, years after its parent company Arcadia collapsed. The brand, now owned by Asos, aims to capitalize on nostalgia while also attracting a new generation of Gen-Z shoppers. Industry experts note that Topshop will face a challenging retail environment, competing with fast-fashion giants and needing to recapture the "cool" factor that once made it a cultural touchstone. The success of the relaunch will depend on its ability to balance its iconic British style with modern consumer demands.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Bournemouth 4-2 in their Premier League opener, a match marked by thrilling offense and concerning defensive weaknesses for the reigning champions. Newcomer Hugo Ekitike was a standout performer, scoring one goal and assisting another, making a strong case for his place in the team. Despite the win, which was secured by late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah, Liverpool's defense appeared vulnerable, particularly when Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo scored a fine equalizer. The match highlighted the challenges head coach Arne Slot faces in integrating new players and shoring up the team's back line.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a major resurgence after a multi-year slowdown caused by inflation and rising interest rates. High-profile debuts from companies like Bullish, Figma, and Circle have seen their stock prices soar, signaling strong investor appetite and potentially opening the floodgates for a backlog of other high-value startups. Wall Street insiders and exchange CEOs are optimistic about a healthy pipeline of companies preparing to go public. However, some analysts warn that the dramatic first-day pops are reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a simple, barebones electric pickup truck it claims can be sold for around half the average vehicle price in the U.S. The company's strategy focuses on minimizing manufacturing costs by offering a basic two-seat vehicle, then allowing owners to customize it with over 100 accessories. With over 100,000 reservations, Slate is betting on price-conscious consumers, though its appeal may be tested as federal EV tax credits expire, potentially raising its starting price to a more competitive bracket.

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to scale back its federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) following a lawsuit filed by the city. Under the agreement, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command, contrary to an earlier directive that had appointed the head of the DEA as an "emergency police commissioner." The deal was reached after D.C. sought an emergency restraining order, calling the move a "hostile takeover" that illegally usurped local authority. This development de-escalates a tense power struggle over crime and immigration policies in the nation's capital.</p>
