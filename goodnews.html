          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, born in Uganda to Indian parents, faces scrutiny over his self-identification as 'Asian' and 'Black or African American' on a university application. While Ugandans of Indian descent are widely considered African in their home country, this identity is complex within US racial classifications, often reserved for descendants of the transatlantic slave trade. The article highlights the historical presence and contributions of Indians in Uganda, alongside the challenges of fitting multi-hyphenated identities into rigid American categories. Mamdani's heritage and his father's activism underscore a broader discussion on the fluidity of 'African' identity beyond race, challenging binary perceptions.</p>

          <p>British 400m hurdler Seamus Derbyshire is set to compete in his first World Athletics Championships, embracing his 'authentic self' after years of battling competition anxiety. The openly gay athlete gained viral fame for his expressive pre-race routines, which he says are spontaneous and a result of changing his mindset. After mental health struggles derailed his 2024 Olympic dreams, Derbyshire revamped his approach, leading to his most successful season and qualification for the Tokyo championships. He hopes to inspire other athletes and prioritize enjoyment and learning in his debut, rather than focusing on winning.</p>

          <p>Australia announced a US$1.1 billion plan to acquire a fleet of 'Ghost Shark' autonomous underwater attack drones to enhance its naval capabilities. Defense Minister Richard Marles stated that Australia is leading in autonomous underwater military technology, with the first batch of domestically developed drones expected by January next year. These long-range, stealth-capable drones will complement Australia's US nuclear-powered submarines, bolstering its defense posture. The investment is part of Australia's strategy to counter China's military expansion in the Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains, mirroring Wall Street's upward trend, driven by increasing hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut. This occurred as investors digested August inflation data from China, which showed consumer prices falling 0.4% year-over-year and producer prices dropping 2.9%. South Korea's Kospi index hit a record high, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also advanced. Shares of Asian tech firms in Apple's supply chain rose following new iPhone launches, though Apple's own shares dipped. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Europe's 2035 ban on new diesel and gasoline cars is back in the spotlight, sparking intense debate within the auto industry. Over 150 electric vehicle industry leaders urged the European Commission to uphold the target, citing hundreds of billions in new investment and warning against weakening commitments. Conversely, major auto manufacturers like Mercedes and Volkswagen, represented by ACEA and CLEPA, argue the targets are no longer feasible due to a 'polycrisis' of rising costs and supply chain disruptions. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also criticized one-sided political commitments to specific technologies, reflecting the deep divisions ahead of crucial talks with EU leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite only securing two Premier League wins since April, Manchester United's underlying statistics suggest the team has been performing better than their results indicate under manager Ruben Amorim. Data from the last 10 games shows United taking the most shots and facing fewer shots than almost all other teams, indicating dominance in creating and restricting chances. The main issue lies in their inefficiency in both scoring and saving goals, with players underperforming historically expected conversion rates. This suggests either a lack of quality, confidence, or simply bad luck, rather than Amorim's much-criticized tactics being solely to blame.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, ruling that she can remain in her post while her lawsuit challenging the removal proceeds. The judge stated that Trump had not provided sufficient 'for cause' grounds related to Cook's job performance, rejecting allegations of mortgage fraud prior to her appointment. This decision is a significant win for the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference, particularly as Trump has consistently pressured the Fed for interest rate cuts. Cook is expected to participate in the upcoming Fed meeting, where a rate cut is anticipated.</p>

His release stirs hopes for a political comeback for the opposition figure and presents new challenges for the ruling party.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a vaccine to curb a rampant chlamydia epidemic that is decimating wild koala populations across eastern Australia. Scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast spent over a decade developing the single-dose jab, which has shown to reduce the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms and decrease mortality by at least 65%. Chlamydia causes severe health issues, including blindness and infertility, and conventional antibiotic treatments can be fatal to koalas. While the vaccine offers a crucial tool, experts stress that habitat loss remains the most significant threat, necessitating broader conservation efforts alongside the medical breakthrough.</p>
