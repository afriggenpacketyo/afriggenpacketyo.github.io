          <p>President Trump has arrived in Saudi Arabia, marking the first stop on his tour of the Gulf. He aims to sign deals worth over $1 trillion, focusing on investments in AI, energy, and arms purchases. The Saudi royals are expected to offer Trump lavish hospitality, mirroring his first presidential visit. Trump's trip is under scrutiny due to his family's financial interests, including pending real estate, cryptocurrency, and golf deals with Saudi-owned firms and Gulf governments. The Qatari royal family is also donating a luxury Boeing 747-8 for Trump's use as a presidential plane, potentially raising ethical concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has banned the far-right group "Kingdom of Germany," accusing it of attempting to establish a "counter-state." Police conducted raids in seven German states, arresting key members, including the group's self-declared monarch, Peter Fitzek. Dobrindt stated the group undermines the rule of law and uses antisemitic conspiracy narratives. The 'Kingdom of Germany' reportedly has around 6,000 members who deny the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic. The movement has come under increased scrutiny due to fears of its violent potential, including a 2022 plot to overthrow the government.</p>

          <p>Japanese auto giant Honda reported a 76% plunge in operating profit for the fourth quarter, missing earnings estimates due to trade tensions with the U.S. and unfavorable currency movements.

Honda expects currency moves to further push down profits by 452 billion yen.

Wage growth has slowed but remains relatively strong, creating a "tricky position" for the Bank of England regarding future interest rate cuts.

          <p>Financial institutions are revising their China growth forecasts after a surprise trade deal between Washington and Beijing. The U.S. and China reached an agreement to temporarily halt the majority of tariffs on each other's products for 90 days. UBS said China's GDP growth in 2025 could climb to between 3.7% and 4%, up from a previous base case of 3.4%. Morgan Stanley has also raised its near-term quarterly China GDP forecasts, expecting companies to speed up exports.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to lower tariff rates, but triple-digit duties imposed since April have been significantly reduced. The baseline rate is about 50 per cent according to estimates from financial institutions and comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The rate is derived by adding the around 20 per cent in tariffs imposed during Trump‚Äôs first term, plus the 30 per cent in new duties still in force after last weekend‚Äôs agreement. Specific tariff levels for Chinese exporters will vary depending on the product.</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms, initially hurt by interest rate hikes in 2022, saw profits boosted by higher net interest income in 2024. Now, a broad decline in interest rates raises doubts about the sustainability of relying on this income. Fintechs are taking steps to diversify revenue streams and reduce reliance on card fees and interest. Those with diversified revenue streams or strong customer monetization are better positioned to weather changes in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US Army is shifting its focus to deterring Chinese aggression in the Pacific and strengthening border security and missile defense. The changes, recommended by the Army leadership, will transform the kinds of weapons America uses, how they are bought and how fast they get into the hands of soldiers. After redirecting more than $30 billion of its budget, they are canceling upgrades of Cold War mat√©riel and invest in equipment better suited for what the Pentagon calls ‚Äúhigh-intensity conflict.‚Äù To get weapons acquisitions back on a fast track, the Army will standardize the use of more rapid contracting techniques that resemble practices by businesses in the commercial sector, where most tech innovation takes place.</p>
