          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States, partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. The order followed arguments about interpreting a federal appeals court ruling that narrowed an earlier decision. The judge rejected the government's interpretation, emphasizing that it could not disobey statutory and constitutional law. The ruling is a victory for refugees and aid groups who challenged the suspension of the refugee program, which was created by Congress in 1980.</p>

Critics express concerns about Musk's increased control over the area and potential impacts on public access. SpaceX seeks federal approval to increase launch frequency from five to 25 per year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contested State Supreme Court race, rejecting efforts to discard thousands of votes. The ruling favors Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who won by 734 votes, and prevents retroactive changes to election rules. Judge Myers, a Trump appointee, stated that failing to count challenged ballots would violate voters' due process rights. The decision, however, can be appealed within seven days, potentially prolonging the resolution of the election.</p>
