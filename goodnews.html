          <p>As part of its annual Student Podcast Challenge, NPR has featured a submission from an 11-year-old sixth grader from Oakland, California. The podcast, titled "Monster Madness," focuses on the lore of Bigfoot and was created with the help of his younger brother. Judges praised the entry for its thorough research, creative writing, original sound effects, and the joyful enthusiasm the creators brought to the project. The feature highlights the creativity and storytelling skills of young people participating in the nationwide contest.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains the Science of Romantic Obsession and How to Overcome It</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's book explores "limerence," a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by intrusive thoughts and emotional dependency. The state can be a normal part of early love but becomes problematic when the affection is unreciprocated or uncertain, leading to an addiction-like cycle in the brain's reward system. Bellamy suggests strategies to break free, such as limiting contact with the object of obsession, reframing positive daydreams into negative ones, and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the infatuation.</p>

          <p>Following a successful general election, the UK's Liberal Democrat party is grappling with its future strategy at its annual conference. While leader Sir Ed Davey's playful, stunt-focused campaign style garnered significant media attention and helped win seats, polling suggests voters may now view it as making the party look less serious. The party must now decide how to build on its success, whether to continue targeting traditional Conservative voters or expand its focus, and how to articulate a substantive policy platform beyond its current focus on care and patriotism.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 03:11:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is being increasingly adopted in workplaces as a tool to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks and managing workloads. However, studies suggest AI can also be part of the problem, with frequent users reporting higher rates of burnout due to the cognitive load of learning new systems and the pressure to take on more work. Experts advise that while AI can be a helpful assistant, companies must manage its implementation carefully to ensure it genuinely lightens employee burdens rather than simply creating capacity for more tasks.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, a British couple in their late 70s and early 80s, have been released after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for almost eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charity in the country for nearly two decades, were reunited with their daughter in Qatar before flying back to the UK. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges. Their release, brokered by Qatar, was celebrated by their family and praised by the UK Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, is set to face France in a highly anticipated World Cup semi-final, carrying the weight of a formidable 31-test winning streak. Despite England's overwhelming statistical dominance in recent years, France has consistently been their toughest opponent, often closing significant deficits and pushing the English side to its limits. French coaches and players are downplaying the historical data, emphasizing that the unique pressure of a World Cup semi-final match neutralizes past results and offers a chance to break the streak.</p>

          <p>The ubiquitous school parent WhatsApp group, intended for sharing information, is becoming a source of stress and anxiety for many, prompting some to leave the chats entirely. Parents cite the high volume of notifications, the tendency for discussions to become divisive and negative, and the prevalence of competitive parenting as primary reasons for their departure. While the groups can be useful for logistical coordination, they also contribute to an uneven distribution of school-related administrative tasks, often falling disproportionately on mothers, and can create unnecessary conflict for schools to manage.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in Virginia's gubernatorial election, a key political contest viewed as a bellwether for the Trump administration's policies. The race between Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic former Rep. Abigail Spanberger is heavily influenced by national issues, particularly the administration's cuts to the federal workforce, which have a significant impact on the state's large number of government employees. Spanberger is positioning herself as a bulwark against these cuts, while Earle-Sears is aligning with the economic record of the state's popular outgoing Republican governor.

          <p>U.S. Northern Command is actively testing and evaluating various counter-drone systems to defend sensitive national security sites from unauthorized incursions. At a recent event at Eglin Air Force Base, dozens of companies demonstrated technologies ranging from acoustic detection systems to interceptor drones that capture hostile craft with nets. The initiative comes in response to a rising number of drone intrusions over U.S. military installations, with officials aiming to establish rapid response teams capable of neutralizing any drone threat across the country within 24 hours.</p>
