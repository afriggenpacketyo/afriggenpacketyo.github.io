          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amid concerns about inflation, housing affordability, and the impact of a volatile Washington. The article highlights that while security ties with the United States are crucial, Australia's prosperity depends on trade with China, creating a complex geopolitical situation. Voters are primarily focused on cost-of-living issues, and both major parties have offered limited solutions to alleviate economic pressures. The article also notes a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates, reflecting dissatisfaction with the traditional political landscape, and draws parallels between the opposition leader's rhetoric and that of Donald Trump, which may be negatively impacting his campaign.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species in animal tests. This could lead to a universal antivenom, addressing the current need for species-specific treatments. Friede's initial motivation was to protect himself, but he later aimed to develop better therapies for snakebite victims. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target two classes of neurotoxins, creating an antivenom cocktail effective against multiple species.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the strength of the Hong Kong dollar due to recent capital inflows. This action comes before the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where interest rate cuts may be discussed. Similar interventions are expected if the US lowers interest rates, potentially driving more capital into Hong Kong. The HKMA aims to maintain orderly money and foreign exchange markets amid increased demand for the Hong Kong dollar related to equity investment.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and consolidating political power under the Communist Party. The reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state media, and eliminating approximately 100,000 public sector jobs. The government also plans to reduce the number of provinces and municipalities, streamlining local governance. This shake-up is intended to address dysfunction caused by the party's anti-corruption campaign and to enhance Vietnam's ability to manage external economic pressures, such as potential US tariffs.</p>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods is impacting advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. The loophole allowed low-cost online retailers like Temu and Shein to offer discounted goods from China, driving significant digital advertising spending. Now, with tariffs imposed, these companies are reducing their advertising, affecting tech giants' revenue. Temu has started adding "import charges" and transitioning to local fulfillment, while both Temu and Shein have reduced advertising on platforms like Google and social media. This shift has caused these apps to fall out of the top downloaded lists.</p>
