          <p>President Trump is set to unveil a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since implementing "reciprocal" tariffs. The agreement, announced remotely with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, aims to strengthen the relationship between the two nations. While Trump touted the deal as comprehensive, 10 Downing Street indicated that negotiations were ongoing. This move follows Trump's earlier imposition of tariffs on the UK, which he later paused amid market instability and criticism, with the administration claiming the pause was decided upon due to numerous countries wanting to negotiate new trade relationships with the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," effectively stopping artificial intelligence semiconductor limits from taking effect. Nvidia shares climbed in response to the news, with the company welcoming the administration's leadership. The rule, proposed in the last days of the Biden administration, organized countries into tiers with varying restrictions on shipping advanced AI chips. The rescission offers America an opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution, create high-paying U.S. jobs, build new U.S.-supplied infrastructure, and alleviate the trade deficit, according to an Nvidia spokesperson.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed most of the claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, including stars like Tom Brady, Gisele B√ºndchen, Kevin O'Leary, and Stephen Curry. The ruling narrows the scope of a sprawling multidistrict litigation accusing them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to demonstrate that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's collapse in November 2022, wiping out billions in customer funds.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has agreed to acquire Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange based in Dubai, for $2.9 billion in a deal comprising cash and Coinbase stock.

          <p>Bill Gates announced plans to shutter the Gates Foundation in 2045 and criticized Elon Musk for slashing funding to USAID. Gates condemned the funding cuts, saying they have led to life-saving food and medicines expiring and could result in the resurgence of diseases. Gates stated that Musk had cancelled grants to a hospital in Gaza province, Mozambique, which he said was working to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to babies, based on the mistaken belief that the US was supplying condoms to Hamas in Gaza in the Middle East. Gates plans to distribute virtually all of his wealth through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years, estimating the foundation will spend more than $200 billion on these efforts.</p>

Swinney expressed worries that vulnerable individuals might feel pressured to end their lives prematurely, also noting that his religious faith and his wife's terminal condition influenced his decision. The bill, proposed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, would allow terminally ill people to request medical assistance to end their lives if deemed mentally fit by two doctors. While Swinney praised McArthur's efforts, he remains concerned about the potential scope of the legislation.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has cut UK interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5% due to a slowdown in inflation, but warned of unpredictability in the global economy. The Bank considered a larger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit economic growth, but concluded this would be offset by a drop in energy bills and eventually lower inflation. The decision comes as details of a tariff deal between the UK and US are set to be announced later. Future UK rate cuts are likely to be gradual and careful, as minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided.</p>

          <p>Shopify's shares dipped after the company posted mixed first-quarter results and issued soft guidance for the current period, noting tariff uncertainty. The company beat revenue expectations but provided weaker-than-expected guidance for gross profit and revenue growth in the second quarter. Shopify's merchants, primarily small- to medium-sized businesses, face exposure to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, with the expiration of de minimis rules impacting some businesses. The company acknowledges the uncertainty ahead and is actively monitoring data to support its merchants.</p>

          <h2>British and Irish Lions Squad Announced; Pollock to Tour Australia, Farrell Misses Out</h2>

          <p>Northampton's 20-year-old forward Henry Pollock will tour Australia with the British and Irish Lions this summer, but former England captain Owen Farrell, the son of head coach Andy, misses out. Pollock's inclusion marks a warp-speed rise to the top of the game. Farrell, a three-time tourist in the past, has only just returned to fitness with French side Racing 92 but the 33-year-old had aspirations to represent the Lions once more. England skipper Maro Itoje was confirmed as captain of the 38-strong party, completing a late-career rise as a leader.</p>

          <h2>Starmer's Cultivation of Trump Yields UK Trade Deal, but Challenges Remain</h2>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain has secured a trade agreement with the United States, a much-needed political victory and vindication of his strategy of cultivating President Trump. While the details of the agreement were not yet clear, it seemed to affirm the ‚Äúspecial relationship‚Äù often invoked by British and American diplomats. Britain, even under a center-left Labour government, has escaped the harsh criticism that Mr. Trump has trained on the European Union and China. It also reflects Mr. Starmer‚Äôs tireless diplomatic outreach to Mr. Trump.</p>
