          <h2>Salt Lake City and Boise Adopt New Pride Flags to Counter Republican Bans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 20:43:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Republican-led bans on flying pride flags on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted official pride flags as a workaround. Salt Lake City added pride, trans, and Juneteenth flags to its official city flag collection, while Boise retroactively designated the pride flag as an official city flag. These measures are a reaction to state laws restricting flag displays to official flags, such as the U.S. flag and state flag. The actions by the city leaders underscore a continued commitment to LGBTQ+ rights amid efforts to roll back such rights at the state level.</p>

          <p>For the second time in eight days, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman was lost in the Red Sea. The pilot ejected safely and sustained minor injuries. The incident occurred during an attempted landing on the aircraft carrier when the arrestment mechanism failed. This follows a previous incident where a Super Hornet fell overboard while being towed in the hangar bay. Officials have stated that the aircraft was not struck by Houthi militants, despite ongoing regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a surge on Wednesday following the Trump administration's decision to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," which had imposed restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. The Commerce Department stated that the rule was overly complex and would hinder American innovation. Nvidia welcomed the move, emphasizing the opportunity for America to lead the next industrial revolution. AMD CEO Lisa Su also supported a balanced approach between national security and promoting the American chip industry. The decision signals a potential boost for U.S. chipmakers and their access to the global AI market.</p>

          <p>The federal government has released 60,000 additional pages of records related to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, as ordered by President Trump. The documents, which include details of the FBI's investigation and interviews with Sirhan Sirhan and eyewitnesses, have been digitized and made available to the public. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned Sirhan's guilt. While it is unclear if the files will reveal new information, they represent an effort toward transparency, though many details were already publicly known from previous investigations.</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece argues that the charitable tax deduction in the United States distorts philanthropy by disproportionately benefiting wealthy donors and the charities they support. The author contends that the current system incentivizes charities to cater to wealthy donors, creating an uneven playing field. The author proposes replacing the charitable deduction with a system that provides the same federal subsidy to every donated dollar, regardless of the donor's income, such as a government matching program or a tax credit.</p>
