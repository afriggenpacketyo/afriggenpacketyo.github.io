          <p>The Chinese city of Suzhou is making a concerted effort to establish itself as a world-leading biopharmaceutical hub, with ambitions to rival Boston. The city is already home to 3,800 companies in the sector and is offering substantial subsidies to attract more top-tier international and domestic firms. By 2030, Suzhou's goal is to host over 10,000 biopharma companies and generate an output exceeding 1 trillion yuan. This strategic push includes academic partnerships, such as the one between Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University and the local government, to cultivate future leaders in drug innovation and development.</p>

          <p>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has responded defiantly to legal threats from the Trump administration regarding the city's sanctuary policies for immigrants. The Department of Justice issued warnings to Boston and other jurisdictions, threatening to withhold federal funds and pursue legal action if they do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. In a public statement and a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Wu asserted that Boston follows the law and will not be coerced by what she termed unconstitutional threats. She criticized the administration's policies and affirmed the city's commitment to being a welcoming place for everyone.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Commemoration of Wartime History Can Coexist with Appreciation for Modern Japan</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's remembrance of its war against Japanese aggression is not an exercise in cultivating hatred, but a necessary reflection on historical truth and sacrifice. The author contrasts the solemn wartime commemorations with their own positive experiences growing up with Japanese popular culture, such as anime and manga, in the 1980s. The piece suggests that it is possible for Chinese society to condemn the historical actions of Japan's military while simultaneously embracing and appreciating modern Japanese culture and its people. This distinction is presented as a mature approach to a complex historical relationship.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Shenghua Wen, has been sentenced to eight years in a U.S. prison for illegally exporting firearms and military equipment to North Korea. The U.S. Justice Department stated that Wen, who remained in the U.S. illegally after his student visa expired, was directed by North Korean officials to procure the items. Wen purchased many of the weapons in Texas and shipped them from California, disguising at least one shipment as a refrigerator. In return for his smuggling efforts, he received approximately $2 million in payments from Pyongyang, according to U.S. authorities.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Oregon are engaged in a delicate operation to save the Doerner Fir, one of the world's tallest non-redwood trees, after it caught fire. The approximately 450-year-old, 325-foot-tall Douglas fir was ignited last week, with a hot spot still smoking high up in its trunk. Helicopter crews have been dousing the flames from above, as it is too dangerous for climbing crews to work directly under the tree due to falling debris. A containment line and sprinklers have been set up on the ground to prevent the fire from spreading, while the cause of the blaze remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>An Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, is facing federal charges for allegedly creating and operating a sophisticated botnet known as "Rapper Bot," which was used to conduct large-scale cyberattacks. Prosecutors claim the botnet, which infected tens of thousands of devices like routers and DVRs, was one of the most powerful DDoS-for-hire services in existence. Foltz allegedly loaned the botnet to customers who targeted victims in over 80 countries, including a U.S. government network. Law enforcement officials dismantled the botnet after executing a search warrant at Foltz's home, and he now faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>In the revamped US Open mixed doubles competition, the highly anticipated team of Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu was defeated in straight sets by Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula. Despite the crowd's support for Alcaraz and Raducanu, the pairing of Draper and Pegula proved to be sharper and more experienced, particularly at the net. The article highlights Draper's strong performance and Raducanu's relative inexperience in doubles play as key factors in the 4-2, 4-2 result. The match was part of a new, high-profile format designed to attract top singles stars to the mixed doubles event.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock increased by 3% after the retailer maintained its full-year financial outlook, projecting a 2.8% growth in total sales. This came despite the company narrowly missing Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue in its second-quarter report, the first such miss since 2014. The company noted that homeowners continue to show a "deferral mindset" for large projects due to economic uncertainty, but also saw encouraging signs like an increase in big-ticket transactions. The results reflect a home improvement market still awaiting a significant pickup in activity. (not investment advice)</p>
