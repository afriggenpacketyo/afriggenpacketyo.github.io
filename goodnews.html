          <p>U.S. Representative Randy Feenstra, a Republican from Iowa, has officially filed paperwork to run for Iowa governor in the 2026 election. Feenstra is seeking to succeed Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who announced she would not be seeking a third term. While Feenstra has not yet made a public announcement about his campaign, he has expressed interest in the position. The GOP primary could be crowded, with several other Republicans considering a run, while Iowa Auditor Rob Sand has filed paperwork to run in the state's Democratic primary.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults. The proposed legislation would allow patients with a terminal illness and deemed mentally fit by two doctors to request medical assistance to end their lives. The vote follows similar proposals in England and Wales and marks the third time the Scottish Parliament has considered such a bill. The Scottish government remains neutral on the issue, while prominent figures like First Minister John Swinney and former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have voiced their opposition, raising concerns about potential coercion and the definition of terminal illness.</p>

          <p>The German government has banned the far-right group "Kingdom of Germany," a faction within the "Reichsbürger" movement, accusing it of attempting to establish a "counter-state." Police conducted raids in seven German states, resulting in arrests, including the group's self-declared monarch, Peter Fitzek. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that the group undermines the rule of law and uses antisemitic conspiracy narratives to support its claims. The "Kingdom of Germany" is considered the largest association within the Reichsbürger scene, whose supporters deny the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential of public transportation to replace cars, focusing on reducing congestion and air pollution. While some cities have implemented free public transport with mixed results, psychological factors such as the desire for safety, comfort, and status associated with car ownership pose challenges. Cities like Jakarta are improving bus services and integrating them with minibuses to encourage public transport use. Other strategies include discouraging car ownership through levies and redesigning cities to prioritize public transport, as seen in Paris, which removes parking lots and increases parking fees for polluting vehicles.</p>

          <p>Former professional cricketer Arul Suppiah is speaking out about his battle with anorexia, an eating disorder and serious mental health condition. Suppiah's health struggles began in 2017 with a health kick that turned into an unhealthy obsession with exercising and restricting food intake. He actively avoided social situations involving food, and the weight loss was validated by those around him. After nearly fainting at work, Suppiah was diagnosed with anorexia and almost sectioned under the Mental Health Act, but managed to turn things around.</p>

          <p>A government survey reveals that approximately half of respondents in Japan believed at least one instance of false information on social media. The survey examined false claims, such as the idea that mass beaching of sardines or whales signals an impending earthquake. About 25% of those who encountered such information spread it further. The government is now focused on improving media literacy, urging people to be skeptical and verify information before sharing it. The survey showed that 90% of respondents recognized the need for media literacy, but many had not taken steps to improve their understanding.</p>

          <p>Financial institutions are revising their China growth forecasts upward after a surprise trade truce between the U.S. and China. The agreement involves temporarily halting the majority of tariffs and reducing mutual tariffs from 125% to 10%. UBS now projects China's GDP growth in 2025 to climb to between 3.7% and 4%, while Morgan Stanley expects companies to speed up exports to take advantage of the lower tariffs. ANZ Bank also sees potential for China's GDP to come in higher than 4.2% this year.</p>

          <p>The American perception of China is split between a technological and manufacturing superpower and an economy on the verge of collapse. While companies like DeepSeek, BYD, and Huawei lead in innovation, China faces sluggish consumer spending, rising unemployment, and a housing crisis. The Chinese government's focus on technological self-reliance and industrial capacity is not adequately addressing these challenges. The real unemployment numbers are believed to be much higher, and factories are closing, leading to job losses.</p>
