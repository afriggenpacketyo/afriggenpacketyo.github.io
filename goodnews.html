          <p>Oscar Piastri outpaced his McLaren teammate Lando Norris to secure pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona. Piastri's advantage suggests that a rule change aimed at restricting the flexing of front wings had little impact on McLaren's performance. Verstappen and Red Bull have typically been competitive at circuits with long medium and high-speed corners, but the gap between pole and Verstappen was larger than at previous races. Norris admitted to making errors on his final run, while Verstappen struggled with Turn One throughout the session. The optimism score is 75.</p>
