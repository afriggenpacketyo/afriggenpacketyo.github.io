          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native wrongly deported in March and later returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee. A federal judge's ruling prevents immigration authorities from detaining him upon release, mandating his return to Maryland where he lived with his family. His attorneys, who arranged private security for his transport, expressed relief but cautioned he remains "far from safe" due to potential future immigration actions. Abrego Garcia must reside with his brother, report to Pretrial Services, and adhere to other conditions, including not contacting MS-13 gang members, while awaiting his trial in January 2027.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing new media rights agreements with NBC, Netflix, and ESPN, set to expire after the 2028 season. NBC is expected to acquire Sunday night games and Wild Card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix will secure Home Run Derby rights for about $50 million per year. ESPN will receive a new package worth $550 million, including rights to MLB TV's digital out-of-market games and in-market games for five local teams, plus a new mid-week national game package. This move signifies MLB's strategy to diversify partnerships and expand reach, especially as traditional TV viewership declines and streaming services seek lucrative sports content.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ether experienced a significant surge, trading near its record high, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments at the Jackson Hole symposium. Powell indicated that adjusting the policy stance might be warranted due to shifting risks, leading traders to anticipate a September rate cut. This caused a "panicked repositioning" and short squeezes in the crypto market, with about $120 million in Ether short liquidations occurring within an hour. Companies focused on accumulating Ether, like Bitmine Immersion and SharpLink Gaming, saw their shares jump, reflecting renewed market optimism. Despite a recent streak of outflows, Ether exchange-traded funds recorded substantial inflows, signaling a potential rebound in investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. However, the IRS recently clarified that buyers can still qualify if they enter a binding contract and make a payment before the deadline, even if vehicle delivery occurs later. This flexibility is crucial for those purchasing vehicles from out-of-state or ordering custom-built cars, potentially making a meaningful difference for many shoppers. The tax credit, which has complex and frequently changing rules, can now be received as an upfront discount, but vehicles must meet specific criteria regarding price, North American manufacturing, and battery component sourcing, along with buyer income limits.

          <p>Canada announced it will remove retaliatory tariffs on numerous U.S. products covered under the USMCA agreement, a move aimed at de-escalating trade tensions with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the decision, which President Trump welcomed as "nice" and a sign of good relations. These tariffs, imposed by Canada in March, had placed a 25% duty on American-made goods like alcohol, clothing, and shoes. The White House praised the overdue action, anticipating continued discussions on trade and national security. This development follows a framework agreement between the Trump administration and the European Union, signaling broader efforts to reshape global trade policies.</p>

          <p>Intel shares surged after reports indicated the Trump administration is preparing to announce the U.S. government will take an equity stake in the struggling chipmaker, potentially around 10%. President Trump confirmed the agreement, calling it a "great deal" for Intel, though White House officials noted ongoing discussions and no explicit agreement from Intel's CEO. This move signifies a shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government actively investing in corporate America, specifically leveraging CHIPS Act funds. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the government seeks a non-voting equity stake in exchange for these funds. This development follows SoftBank's recent $2 billion investment, highlighting efforts to bolster Intel's advanced chip manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a positive week, culminating in a significant rally on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech hinted at potential interest rate cuts. Powell's remarks on growing downside risks in the labor market and a shifting balance of risks suggested an adjustment to policy stance might be warranted, boosting market confidence. This dovish outlook spurred rallies in cyclical, economically sensitive stocks like Capital One, DuPont, and Home Depot, which are expected to benefit from lower rates. Conversely, defensive groups such as consumer staples, utilities, and health care lagged. Traders increased bets on multiple rate cuts by year-end, signaling a more optimistic economic forecast.

          <p>Fifteen young climate advocates, aged 8 to 17, have filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin, challenging the state's pro-fossil fuel policies. The lead plaintiff, 17-year-old Kaarina, was forced to relocate due to increased flooding and "freeze-thaw events" exacerbated by climate change, directly linking her personal trauma to the state's policies. The lawsuit, supported by Our Children's Trust and Midwest Environmental Advocates, targets two state laws that prevent regulators from considering pollution when permitting new fossil fuel plants and from requiring more carbon-free electricity. Plaintiffs argue these laws violate their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and the public trust doctrine, seeking their overturning to protect a livable future.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that interest rate cuts might be warranted, citing "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies and a shifting balance of risks. In his Jackson Hole speech, Powell noted the labor market's resilience but also rising downside dangers, including potential inflation risks from tariffs. With the benchmark rate below last year's level and low unemployment, he stated conditions allow the Fed to "proceed carefully" in adjusting its policy stance. These remarks sent stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling, as Wall Street anticipates cuts. Powell reaffirmed the Fed's independence from political demands and its commitment to the 2% inflation target, acknowledging past lessons from high inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As credit card debt reaches new highs and delinquencies climb, credit card forbearance is emerging as a temporary relief option for struggling Americans. This arrangement allows borrowers to pause or reduce payments for a limited period, potentially including fee waivers and interest relief, though interest may still accrue. Qualification typically requires proof of financial hardship, such as job loss, unexpected expenses, and a history of on-time payments. It's not automatic, requiring direct contact with the issuer. For those who don't qualify, alternatives like debt management plans, consolidation loans, balance transfer cards, or bankruptcy can provide more sustainable paths to regain control of their finances.
