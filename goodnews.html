          <p>Costa Rican police seized crack cocaine, marijuana, knives, and five capybaras after a high-speed chase. The two men in the vehicle, both with criminal records, were arrested and the capybaras were turned over to the National System of Conservation Areas. Security Minister Mario Zamora noted the incident highlights the intersection of drug trafficking and the introduction of non-native species. This marks the first recorded case of illegal capybara trafficking in Costa Rica, with the animals destined for a refuge for environmental and conservation education programs.</p>

          <p>The UK energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed a fall in the energy price cap, resulting in a typical household bill decreasing by ¬£11 a month from July. Despite the price drop, consumers are encouraged to seek fixed-rate deals for potential annual savings of up to ¬£200. The price cap, which affects 21 million households, remains higher than previous years, leading to ongoing concerns about affordability and customer debt.

          <p>The Yosemite National Park post office celebrated its 100th anniversary, highlighting its vital role in connecting the remote Yosemite Valley community to the outside world. The post office, designed by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood, has been a lifeline for residents, hikers, and climbers. From delivering everyday supplies to facilitating romances, the Yosemite post office has a rich history. The anniversary comes at a challenging time for the USPS, with concerns about privatization and cost-cutting measures.</p>

          <p>Albert 'Little Al' Robles, former mayor of Carson, remains active in politics despite a history of controversies and unsuccessful campaigns. Currently, he is representing former Huntington Park Councilmember Esmeralda Castillo in a lawsuit against the city. Robles has a long list of grievances and a desire to be seen as a crusader. He feels Latino politicians are held to a higher standard and believes they need to close ranks like other ethnicities do.</p>
