        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In anticipation of a significant coastal storm, major U.S. airlines including American, Southwest, Delta, and United have proactively waived flight-change fees and fare differences for travelers. The policy applies to numerous airports across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, where the National Weather Service has issued flood and high-wind advisories for Sunday through Monday. This flexible travel policy allows customers booked for travel during the storm to rebook for a later date without financial penalty. As of Saturday afternoon, flight disruptions were reported to be minimal.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team is demonstrating formidable strength in the ongoing World Cup, largely due to the standout performances of captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and spinner Sophie Ecclestone. After three opening wins, England sits unbeaten at the top of their group, with Sciver-Brunt returning to form with a century against Sri Lanka and Ecclestone leading the tournament's wicket-takers. While their initial fixtures have been favorable, the commanding play of their two star players has sent a clear message to top-ranked rivals India and Australia, whom they have yet to face.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has declined an offer to return for a second spell as manager of Scottish Premiership club Rangers. Following the dismissal of head coach Russell Martin, Gerrard held discussions with the club that were reportedly positive. However, he ultimately withdrew from consideration, with the timing of the potential move cited as the primary reason for his decision. Gerrard, who previously managed Rangers from 2018 to 2021 and won a league title, remains open to a future return, but the club must now continue its search for a new manager.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins football team continued its remarkable turnaround under interim coach Tim Skipper with a decisive 38-13 win against Michigan State. Following an upset victory over Penn State last week, the team proved its resurgence is not a fluke, with the offense scoring 38 unanswered points after an early deficit. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava threw for three touchdowns, while the defense, led by coordinator Kevin Coyle, effectively shut down the Spartans' offense. The victory improves UCLA's record to 2-4 and marks a significant shift in performance since a change in the coaching staff.</p>

The National Weather Service anticipates the storm will bring between 0.5 to 1.5 inches of "beneficial" rain to Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with higher amounts in mountain areas. While the precipitation is welcomed, meteorologists note it will not be sufficient to end the region's wildfire season. Residents are advised to monitor the forecast for potential minor road flooding and debris flows in recent burn scar areas.</p>

          <p>The Rabin Medical Center in Israel is making specialized preparations to receive and treat some of the 20 hostages set to be released from Gaza. Medical staff are pioneering a new field they term "captivity medicine," drawing lessons from previous hostage returns to address the unique and complex physical and psychological trauma involved. The hospital's dedicated unit focuses on a patient, unhurried approach, using a multidisciplinary team while giving hostages space and control over their recovery. The process involves being a "medical detective" to uncover the long-term effects of their prolonged ordeal.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through central London in April 2024, has been retired. The 15-year-old horse suffered serious injuries, including a broken bone, after being spooked by construction noise during a morning exercise. Unable to return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, Quaker will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire. The incident last year drew significant public attention after two of the bleeding horses were photographed galloping through the capital.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have officially backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum. The plan, endorsed at the party conference in Aberdeen, states that winning a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election will be considered a mandate to negotiate for another vote. Swinney argued this is the most realistic path, based on the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. This approach was chosen over an amendment that would have treated the election itself as a de-facto referendum on independence.</p>

          <p>A growing number of younger consumers, often referred to as Gen Z, are pushing back against the "fast furniture" industry by choosing to buy secondhand items. Motivated by environmental concerns over furniture's large carbon footprint and a desire for durability, they are avoiding cheap, mass-produced decor designed to be disposable. This trend is reflected in surging online searches for used items on platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Pinterest. Advocates say this shift not only promotes sustainability but also allows consumers to form a stronger emotional connection with unique, restored pieces.</p>
