          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 17:06:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump unveiled plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defense system, allocating an initial $25 billion towards the project with an estimated total cost of $175 billion. The system aims to protect the United States from foreign missile threats using next-generation technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. Trump stated that the system should be fully operational before the end of his term, with involvement from multiple American defense and technology companies in states like Alaska, Florida, Georgia, and Indiana. The system is inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, but is designed to combat a wider range of threats, including hypersonic weapons and fractional orbital bombardment systems.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court temporarily lifted sanctions against Maine Republican Rep. Laurel Libby, who was sanctioned for posting an unblurred picture of a transgender high school athlete on Facebook. The sanction stripped Libby of her right to vote on legislation, effectively disenfranchising her constituents. The court's decision, with Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissenting, emphasized the importance of legislators' freedom of speech, drawing parallels to a 1966 case involving a Georgia lawmaker sanctioned for opposing the Vietnam War. The ruling underscores the protection of offensive speech under the First Amendment, though the case originated from Libby's decision to target a high school student.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Biden's recent diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer has raised questions about the effectiveness of current screening guidelines. Experts note that even with regular PSA testing, aggressive prostate cancers can develop rapidly and go undetected. Guidelines recommend against screening for men over 70, but many continue testing in consultation with their doctors. The PSA test is not foolproof, and some fast-growing cancers may not release the protein it detects. Overestimation of the PSA's power as a diagnostic tool and potential side effects of treatment contribute to cautious screening recommendations.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has halted the Temecula school district's ban on critical race theory (CRT) while litigation proceeds. The court found the ban to be unconstitutionally vague, causing anxiety and confusion among teachers. The resolution defined CRT as a "divisive ideology" assigning moral fault based on race, but the court noted that this definition lacked a clear source and represented the board's subjective perception. The court prioritized the privacy rights of students, emphasizing that policies must comply with state law.</p>
