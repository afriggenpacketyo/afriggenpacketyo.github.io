          <p>Several news outlets are covering a range of topics, including concerns over government spending cuts, with Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner reportedly clashing with other officials over budget reductions. The postponement of the government's child poverty strategy raises concerns about increasing poverty rates. On a positive note, plans are underway to establish a network of mental health A&Es across the UK to alleviate pressure on hospitals. Internationally, President Trump's threats to increase EU tariffs are causing economic anxiety, particularly in Germany, while the brother of the Princess of Wales shares insights into their special bond and mental health struggles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to alleviate consumer burden from soaring rice prices. The move comes amid criticism that the government has not effectively curbed the price spike, which has hurt households amid rising inflation. Koizumi intends to bypass auctions to control prices and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution, with procedures for negotiated contracts expected to begin soon. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached a record high, prompting the government to release 300,000 tons initially. (not investment advice)</p>

This endorsement follows a review by federal agencies and signals a reversal from previous concerns about national security risks. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have welcomed the decision, emphasizing their commitment to American workers and the steel industry. The acquisition, initially announced in December 2023, had faced opposition due to national security concerns and political considerations, including opposition from President Biden and the United Steelworkers union.</p>

Businesses in Qatar are keen to use the yuan, leveraging Hong Kong's "toolbox" for settlement, payment, and hedging. The trend reflects a broader shift as countries and businesses seek alternatives to the US dollar due to trade wars, aligning with China's long-term strategy for financial independence. An increase in yuan-denominated trades and investments would benefit Hong Kong's financial sector, especially given the strengthening ties between China and oil-rich Qatar.</p>

          <p>Laura Piani's debut feature, "Jane Austen Wrecked My Life," is a warm romance about Agathe, a bookish clerk in Paris who dreams of a Darcy-like love. Agathe is sent to the Jane Austen Residency, where she meets Oliver, Austen's great-great-great-great-grandnephew, with whom she initially clashes. The film explores themes of literature, writing, and poetry, as Agathe confronts past traumas and writer's block, ultimately finding love and self-discovery. The movie's predictable yet enjoyable journey offers a salve-like quality for romantic souls, suggesting that Jane Austen didn't wreck her life, but rather opened it up to possibilities.</p>

          <p>With the ban on disposable vapes in the UK set to begin on June 1, many vapers are stockpiling the devices, fearing the alternative rechargeable options won't meet their needs. Concerns range from forgetting to recharge devices to disliking the taste of refillable vapes, which often contain fewer sweeteners. While the ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, some worry it will drive people back to smoking cigarettes. Retailers have seen a surge in vape sales as customers stock up, but some small shop owners fear the ban will negatively impact their businesses.</p>

          <p>Karan Kandhari's "Sister Midnight" is a gritty, stylish comedy set in Mumbai, following a restless young housewife named Uma as she navigates urban malaise and discovers hidden strength. Uma, played by Radhika Apte, rebels against her arranged marriage and monotonous life, embarking on solo walks and taking a cleaning job. The film captures the liminal space of Uma's alternative existence, with hypnotic visuals and a punk-rock energy. While the movie's episodic nature doesn't always cohere, its inventiveness and Apte's performance make it a compelling and unpredictable experience.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit a 767-kilometer canal project linking Jiangxi province, a rare earth hub, to Zhejiang, a wealthy coastal province, as part of its efforts to expand inland waterway transport. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, estimated to cost 320 billion yuan, is intended to lower logistical costs and integrate inland regions with coastal hubs. Planned as a Class III waterway, the canal will accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually, connecting Jiangxi's manufacturing hub to Zhejiang's seaports.</p>

          <h2>EU Calls for 'Respect' in US Trade Deal Amid Trump's Tariff Threats</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's trade chief emphasized the bloc's commitment to a trade deal with the US based on "respect" rather than "threats," following President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on EU goods. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic affirmed the EU's readiness to defend its interests, while European governments warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides. Trump expressed impatience with ongoing trade negotiations, stating his plan to raise tariffs on June 1 was set, though a major investment by a European company in the US could potentially delay the implementation.</p>
