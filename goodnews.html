        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Houston Texans running back Joe Mixon is expected to be sidelined for the entire preseason due to a persistent ankle issue. The two-time Pro Bowler began training camp on the non-football injury list after sustaining the injury earlier in the offseason. This is not Mixon's first struggle with injuries, as he has previously missed games due to ankle problems and a concussion. The Texans, who recently signed All-Pro Nick Chubb, will further evaluate Mixon's condition closer to their regular-season opener against the Los Angeles Rams.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna to Hamburg were evacuated after being stranded inside a tunnel for over six hours. The train stopped due to a power failure shortly after its journey began, causing the lights and air conditioning to fail in the summer heat. The rescue operation was prolonged when some passengers attempted to leave on foot, forcing a secondary power shutdown for safety. Ultimately, all passengers were safely evacuated via emergency exits and buses, with only two individuals requiring on-site medical treatment.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport due to a landing gear issue during takeoff. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 experienced a problem with a tire, prompting a response from the Denver Fire Department, which later extinguished a fire. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely deplaned and transported back to the terminal by bus. While five people were evaluated at the scene, only one was transported for a minor injury, and the airline arranged a replacement aircraft for the passengers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary, an occasion marked by an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded on July 26, 1775, the postal service played a crucial role in unifying the young nation and continues to be a key institution. The celebration occurs as the agency's future is debated, with past discussions of privatization and restructuring. The new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has affirmed his belief that the USPS should not be privatized, emphasizing its enduring public service mission.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. This news came as a relief, as a more severe injury could have resulted in a long-term absence for the two-time AL MVP. Judge, who received a platelet-rich plasma injection, hopes to return in 10 days to two weeks, initially as a designated hitter. He first felt the pain during a game against Toronto, impacting his ability to throw effectively from the outfield.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the legacy of the early 2000s MTV show "The Osbournes," which transformed Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne into a beloved reality TV father figure. The show pioneered the "reality sitcom" format, blending the family's spectacular fame with mundane domestic life, a formula that captivated millions of viewers. Before shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," "The Osbournes" offered an unprecedented, often unscripted look into a celebrity family's daily chaos and genuine affection. While the constant filming took a personal toll on the family, the program's success reshaped the television landscape for years to come.</p>

          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, this article explores the physiological reasons behind the intense physical reactions to watching football. Psychologists explain that high-stakes matches trigger a hormonal stress response, increasing adrenaline and cortisol, which can elevate heart rates and affect sleep and behavior. This "fight or flight" response is a sign of deep emotional investment in the team. Experts advise managing this stress by getting adequate rest, planning the day, eating well, and reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures remaining below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While coastal areas remain cool and drizzly, other parts of California have faced oppressive heat, highlighting the state's diverse microclimates. Experts caution that despite the cool start, hotter weather could still arrive later in the season.</p>

The "Great Jeans" campaign promotes a denim line where proceeds support a domestic violence charity, but a promotional video joking about her "genes" while focusing on her chest was called "tone deaf" by some critics. Conversely, many fans defended Sweeney and praised the ad for moving away from "woke advertising." The collaboration has boosted American Eagle's stock, with the company betting on Sweeney's star power to revitalize the brand. (not investment advice)</p>

The changes also aim to streamline the process for opening new bars in disused shops and expanding outdoor service areas to help revitalize struggling town centers. This initiative comes as many venues have faced closure threats due to noise complaints, and the pub industry continues to see a steady decline.</p>
