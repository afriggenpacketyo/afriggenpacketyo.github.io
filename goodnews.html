          <p>The U.S. trade deficit narrowed significantly in April as President Trump sharply escalated tariffs before pausing a large swath of the levies. Imports dropped by 16% in April, leading to a trade deficit of about $61 billion, a sharp decline from $140 billion the previous month. The article notes that the uncertain policy environment facing businesses has coincided with a souring of consumer attitudes. Despite these concerns, key measures of the economy have largely defied fears of a downturn, with the unemployment rate remaining low and job growth robust. (not investment advice)</p>
