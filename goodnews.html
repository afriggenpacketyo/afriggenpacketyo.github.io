The industry's net profit margin is projected to rise to 3.7%, with total revenues reaching a record high of $979 billion. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high of 84%, although fleet expansion faces challenges due to aerospace sector supply chain issues. (not investment advice)</p>

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recognizes the financial problems facing universities and aims to support collaboration where possible. The report suggests greater collaboration could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient. However, legal advice has prevented universities from consulting each other on the impact of course closures, hindering collaboration.</p>
