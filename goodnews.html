          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to nominate Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer and advocate for the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, as his surgeon general. This decision comes after withdrawing the nomination of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat.

Kennedy Jr.'s vision for the future of healthcare. Her nomination is expected to focus on wellness efforts within the health department.</p>

          <p>Part of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere around May 10. The lander probe, about a meter wide and weighing nearly half a tonne, is expected to crash back to Earth this week. Experts believe at least part of it could survive the journey due to its robust heat shield and durable structure. The risk to people on the ground is considered low, with the potential landing zone covering most of the inhabited world between 51.7¬∞ north and south latitude.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interest rates are widely expected to be cut by the Bank of England, with analysts predicting a reduction to 4.25% from 4.5% on Thursday. The decision will be announced at 12:02 BST, following a two-minute silence to mark VE Day. Such a move would make borrowing money less expensive for businesses and individuals, but could result in lower returns for savers. The Monetary Policy Committee will be closely monitoring inflation and global economic uncertainty, including the impact of President Trump's tariff policy, which could lead to further rate cuts this year.</p>

Katie Boulter, however, struggled to repeat her previous form and was defeated by Pavlyuchenkova, despite the latter's losing streak. Raducanu returned to action in April after a month-long break and reached the second round at the Madrid Open two weeks prior.</p>

          <p>Washington state Governor Bob Ferguson has signed a bill into law that sets limits on rent increases, making the state among the first in the nation to provide protections for tenants.
