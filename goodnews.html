        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional, deeming the teaching of yoga "protected speech". The court sided with instructors who sued over a law banning yoga classes of four or more people at shoreline parks and beaches. The city argued the rule targeted commercial activity, as the instructors' classes draw donations. Instructors and participants view the classes as a service to those who are disabled or cannot afford yoga elsewhere, emphasizing the community aspect and accessibility.</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency that analyzes the budgetary impacts of bills, is under fire from Republicans after projecting that their signature legislation would increase federal deficits by about $2.4 trillion over a decade. The CBO was established in 1974 to provide lawmakers with objective information about the budgetary impacts of proposed bills, acting as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. The CBO's work is advisory, and the agency makes no policy recommendations; it's up to lawmakers to decide what to do with the information they receive. While the CBO is more accurate than critics suggest, projecting how new tax changes will affect the economic decisions of 330 million Americans is extraordinarily complicated, and there's always going to be a margin of error.</p>

Ramos cited Cuomo's experience and ability to stand up to the Trump administration as reasons for her support. The endorsement comes after Cuomo faced attacks during a mayoral debate over his handling of nursing home deaths and sexual harassment allegations. Ramos's decision has been met with dismay from progressive allies, while Cuomo has stated he will not endorse Ramos in return.</p>

Even a wealthy landowner can come off like a victim here, as is the case with Tadeu, a businessman who in the 1990s started an ecological sanctuary on his 28,000 hectares, and whose complaints to the Brazilian government about illegal encroachment on his land fall on deaf ears.

However, the sale of approximately 9 million liters of potentially affected drinks remains on hold pending federal laboratory test results.

Working alongside researchers from various countries, he notes that Harvard's strength lies in its convening power, which transcends religion, culture, and politics.
