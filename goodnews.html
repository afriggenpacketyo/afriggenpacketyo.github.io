          <p>Marks and Spencer has resumed online orders after halting purchases in April due to a cyberattack. Shoppers can now buy a selection of fashion products for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with more products and services resuming soon. The cyberattack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, initially affected click and collect and contactless payments. M&S estimates the attack will cost ¬£300m in profits this year, and some customer data, including telephone numbers and addresses, was stolen, though payment details were not compromised. This event marks a critical step in M&S's recovery from the disruption caused by the cyberattack.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 will introduce the Madrid Grand Prix while dropping Imola from its 2026 calendar. Imola's removal is due to pressure on the number of events, with F1 aiming for a maximum of 24 races. The addition of Madrid is a quirk, as Barcelona still has a contract for 2026. Spa in Belgium will host only four races from 2026 under a six-year contract, and Thailand is pushing for a race in Bangkok.</p>

          <p>China's rare earth export restrictions are impacting the automotive and robotics industries, and analysts warn that Western defense giants will also feel the heat.
