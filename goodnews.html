          <p>Investors are showing a preference for short-term Treasury investments, driven by concerns about market volatility and the stability of yields on the shorter end of the fixed-income market. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) have seen substantial inflows, indicating a trend towards ultrashort opportunities. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has also increased its holdings in T-bills, now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries. This shift suggests a lack of confidence in long-duration investments amidst current economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump reportedly knew about Jared Isaacman's donations to Democrats before nominating him to lead NASA, despite later withdrawing the nomination due to those donations. Sources indicate Isaacman, an ally of Elon Musk, had disclosed the contributions prior to his selection. This suggests a possible disconnect between the stated reason for withdrawing the nomination and the actual knowledge within the administration. The withdrawal adds to the ongoing narrative of political considerations influencing key appointments.</p>

Root surpassed Eoin Morgan to become England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, leading a recovery from a shaky start. Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope set up West Indies' total, but England's sloppy fielding aided their efforts. Root's partnership with Will Jacks proved crucial, despite a late scare from Alzarri Joseph, ultimately sealing the win for England.</p>
