          <p>Major broadcast station owners Sinclair and Nexstar have announced they will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" starting Friday, ending a multi-day preemption. The stations had stopped showing the program after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments, which also led Disney's ABC network to temporarily suspend the show. Both companies stated their decisions were made independently of government influence, despite an FCC chairman's comments raising questions about broadcast licenses. The move restores the late-night show to approximately 20% of the country where it had been unavailable, including in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Debt Relief Programs and Credit Counseling for Managing Finances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 16:38:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many Americans are exploring options beyond minimum payments to manage their finances. Two common approaches are debt relief programs and credit counseling, which operate differently. Debt relief programs, such as debt settlement, aim to reduce the total amount owed by negotiating with creditors, but this can negatively impact credit scores. In contrast, credit counseling focuses on creating a manageable debt management plan to repay the full amount over time, often with lower interest rates, which generally has a milder effect on credit. The best choice depends on an individual's financial situation, debt load, and risk tolerance.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows How Debt Forgiveness Could Significantly Reduce a $20,000 Credit Card Balance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 15:45:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with a $20,000 credit card balance, pursuing debt forgiveness, or debt settlement, could lead to substantial savings. A successful negotiation could potentially reduce the owed amount by 30% to 50%, meaning a cardholder might pay between $10,000 and $14,000 to resolve the debt. This approach offers a much faster resolution compared to making minimum payments, which could take decades and accrue tens of thousands in interest at current rates. However, debt settlement can negatively impact one's credit score and may have tax implications on the forgiven amount.</p>

          <h2>Monthly Costs for a $20,000 Home Equity Loan Remain Stable Despite Fed Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 15:45:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have had a minimal impact on the monthly payments for a new $20,000 home equity loan. Currently, a 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.34% would cost approximately $246 per month, while a 15-year loan at 8.21% would be around $194 per month. These figures are only slightly lower than costs from earlier in the year, before the rate cuts. Despite the modest change, home equity loans remain an attractive borrowing option due to their fixed rates, which offer predictable payments compared to variable-rate HELOCs.</p>

          <p>A shopper in upstate New York discovered a rare, live orange lobster in a supermarket tank and purchased it to save it from being cooked. The lobster, a one-in-30-million genetic anomaly, was temporarily housed in a 20-gallon tank before being released back into the wild. The rescue was facilitated by the wildlife group Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium, who helped return the crustacean to the Long Island Sound. The release took place just one day before National Lobster Day, a time that marks the peak of the lobster harvesting season.</p>

          <h2>UK Labour Party Reinstates Two MPs Suspended for Benefit Cap Rebellion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 15:06:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Labour Party has readmitted former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum after they were suspended for a year. Their suspension followed a vote against the Conservative government's two-child benefit cap, which went against the Labour leadership's position at the time. Their reinstatement comes as the party appears to be softening its stance on the controversial policy, which limits welfare payments for families with more than two children. Upon her return, Begum criticized the party for suspending MPs who vote with their conscience, highlighting a persistent ideological divide within Labour.</p>
