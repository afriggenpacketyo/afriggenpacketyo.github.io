          <p>The Trump administration is contemplating the Insurrection Act of 1807, which would allow the deployment of troops on U.S. soil in response to major unrest, as confirmed by Vice President JD Vance. This consideration comes as President Trump travels to Jerusalem to address the Knesset and meet with families of hostages set to be released from Gaza, following the brokering of a peace deal. Trump has proclaimed that the war in Gaza is over and that relations in the Middle East are expected to normalize. The administration is looking at all of its options given that crime has gotten out of control in our cities.</p>

          <p>Ben Stiller discusses his feelings of failure following his separation from wife Christine Taylor in his new documentary, "Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost." He compares his marriage to his parents' 50-plus year marriage, noting the strain their working relationship may have put on them. Stiller and Taylor separated in 2017 after 17 years, but later reconciled during the COVID-19 pandemic after living in the same house for nearly a year. Taylor noted they both grew in different directions during their separation, and needed time to figure things out.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have adjusted their pitching rotation for the National League Championship Series, delaying Shohei Ohtani’s next pitching start to later in the series. Manager Dave Roberts announced that Yoshinobu Yamamoto will start Game 2 instead of Ohtani, allowing Yamamoto to maintain his regular pitching schedule. The decision aims to give Ohtani time to focus on recalibrating his offensive performance after a slump in the NL Division Series, where he struggled at the plate. Roberts expects a different offensive output from Ohtani this series, as he has two games to solely focus on his hitting.</p>

          <p>Southern California is preparing for a “winter-like” storm expected to bring significant rainfall from late Monday through Wednesday. The National Weather Service forecasts rainfall totals ranging from three-quarters of an inch to 1½ inches, with mountain and foothill areas potentially receiving up to 3½ inches. There is a risk of thunderstorms and strong, gusty winds, prompting a flood watch for burn areas from Monday night to Tuesday afternoon. The early-season storm coincides with the return of La Niña, a climate pattern typically associated with drought in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Maintaining friendships in adulthood can be challenging due to busy schedules and changing life stages, leading to the loss of close bonds. Experts emphasize the importance of communicating honestly, embracing messiness, and prioritizing in-person interactions to combat relational loneliness. Making space for friendships requires accepting changing circumstances and inviting friends into everyday life, even during mundane activities. Reframing thoughts to focus on future happiness and trusting that feelings do not diminish during busy times can also help rekindle relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by psychologists at the University of Sussex reveals that thermal cameras can measure stress levels by detecting changes in blood flow in the face. The study found that a drop in nose temperature can be used as a measure of stress, with the length of time it takes to recover indicating stress regulation ability. The technique is non-invasive and could be used to monitor stress in babies or people who can't communicate. Researchers also found that showing adult chimpanzees video footage of baby chimpanzees has a calming effect.</p>

          <p>Paramount, backed by the Ellison family, has officially started bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery, potentially reshaping Hollywood. Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount's initial bid of about $20 a share, but talks are ongoing, with Paramount preparing a second bid. The merger would lead to the elimination of one of the original Hollywood film studios, and could see the consolidation of CNN with Paramount-owned CBS News. The Paramount bid was seen as an attempt to slip in under the wire because other large companies, including Amazon, Apple and Netflix, may have been interested in buying the studios.</p>
