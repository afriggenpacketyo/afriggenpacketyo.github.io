The aim is to combat marine pollution, with concerns growing over microplastics impacting marine organisms and potentially human health. Japan is not expected to support the statement, citing a desire for an agreement that includes as many countries as possible, while petroleum-producing Middle Eastern countries are also likely to abstain.
