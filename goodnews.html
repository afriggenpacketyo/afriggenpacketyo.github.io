          <p>BYD's shares experienced a significant drop following the company's announcement of price reductions on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models. The price cuts, aimed at boosting sales until the end of June, include a 20% reduction on the Seagull hatchback and a 34% cut on the Seal dual-motor hybrid sedan. Citi analysts anticipate a substantial increase in dealership foot traffic as a result of these price adjustments. However, the price cuts have also sparked concerns among investors regarding potential price wars and increased competition within the Chinese electric vehicle market, leading to declines in shares of other automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motor, Li Auto, and Xpeng (not investment advice).</p>

Octopus Energy's commercial director, Mario Lupori, personally apologized to Mr. Holden and committed to providing additional staff training to prevent similar mistakes. The company confirmed that Mr. Holden's credit score was not affected and that his personal details were not shared, but the situation caused considerable stress and frustration for the customer.</p>

Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency and speed with which the government will address public concerns, establishing a special response team to handle high rice price issues.

          <p>Businesses are finding a way to minimize the impact of tariffs by utilizing a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule." This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions, potentially reducing costs by stripping out the middleman's profit. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales, carried out at arm's length by independent parties, with proof that the item was destined for the U.S. While the rule has been around since 1988, it has gained renewed attention under recent tariff regimes, particularly in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep is essential for the brain to clean up harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, discovered that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," prompting restorative slumber. This breakthrough not only solves a long-standing mystery of why sleep is biologically essential but also opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control despite a "planned partnership" with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp., which aims to acquire it. Trump emphasized that the deal is an investment and partial ownership, but control will remain with the U.S.A. He also mentioned that the two companies are set to sign a partnership that will create at least 70,000 jobs and deliver a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have both welcomed the president's decision.</p>

          <p>President Trump will delay his threatened 50% tariffs on all European Union imports into the US following a "very nice call" with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. The delay extends the deadline to July 9, allowing more time for negotiations between the two parties. This decision marks a shift from Trump's previous stance, where he warned of imposing tariffs due to stalled discussions. The EU chief, von der Leyen, has expressed readiness to advance trade talks swiftly and decisively.</p>
