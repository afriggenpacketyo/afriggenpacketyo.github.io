          <p>OpenAI has announced a strategic partnership with chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which could result in OpenAI acquiring up to a 10% stake. As part of the multi-billion dollar deal, OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's AI accelerator chips over several years, starting in 2026. This move aims to diversify OpenAI's hardware supply, reducing its reliance on Nvidia, and provide the immense computing power needed to scale its AI models for global use. The partnership highlights the circular economy forming in the AI sector, where key players invest in each other to secure capital and computing resources.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Maxwell's legal team had argued that her conviction was invalid due to a 2008 non-prosecution agreement Epstein made with federal prosecutors in Florida, which they claimed extended to his co-conspirators. The court's decision effectively exhausts one of her final legal avenues for overturning the conviction. Maxwell was found guilty in 2022 of recruiting and grooming underage girls for sexual abuse by Epstein.</p>

          <p>Nike CEO Elliott Hill acknowledged in a recent interview that the company's turnaround plan will "take a while" to restore profitable growth, cautioning that the process will not be linear. Since taking over, Hill has been reversing his predecessor's strategy by re-engaging with wholesale partners instead of focusing solely on direct-to-consumer digital sales. The new strategy also involves restructuring the company to focus on individual sports to spur innovation and win back market share lost to competitors. Despite showing early signs of progress, the company faces macroeconomic headwinds, including an anticipated $1.5 billion impact from tariffs.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones stated that he believes current market conditions are ripe for a significant rally before the bull market ends in a "blow-off top," similar to the dot-com bubble of 1999. He noted that today's environment is potentially more explosive due to the combination of aggressive fiscal policy and a recent monetary easing cycle, a mix not seen since the post-war era. Jones warned that while the greatest gains often occur in the final 12 months of a bull market, investors must be nimble to avoid the inevitable sharp correction that follows. He suggested a portfolio of gold, crypto, and Nasdaq tech stocks for the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

The charges, which include murder, sexual assault, and persecution, stem from his role in the Darfur conflict in Sudan over two decades ago. The conflict resulted in the deaths of up to 300,000 people and the displacement of millions. The court found that Abd_Al-Rahman encouraged and gave instructions for the atrocities committed by the militia. He now faces a potential life sentence, marking a significant moment for international justice.</p>

          <p>As China formulates its 15th five-year plan, it has identified the next five years as a critical period for achieving global leadership in science and technology by 2035. The plan will heavily focus on making breakthrough advancements in strategic sectors like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. This push comes as China seeks to overcome US-led export controls that have limited its access to advanced chip-making technology. Despite already leading in fields like 5G and new energy, Beijing views self-sufficiency and innovation in these key technological battlegrounds as essential for its future development and international competitiveness.</p>

Bitcoin has also rallied, hitting over $125,000, bolstered by the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration and growing interest from institutional investors seeking alternatives to the U.S. dollar. The trend suggests investors are increasingly turning to these assets as hedges against instability in traditional financial systems. (not investment advice)</p>

The menu features creative takes on classics, such as beef and broccoli inspired by Peruvian lomo saltado and a spicy Sichuan chicken. Ng aims to offer accessible, high-quality food that honors the legacy of dishes developed by early Chinese immigrants in America.</p>

After a public outcry, the show was reinstated, and the poll found Kimmel with a net favorability rating of +3, while Trump's was -13.
