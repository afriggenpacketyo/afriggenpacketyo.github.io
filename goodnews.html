          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily reference rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, marking the largest upward adjustment since January. This significant move follows a dovish pivot by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole conference, where he signaled a potential interest rate cut in September, departing from his earlier more hawkish stance. Consequently, the offshore yuan climbed to its strongest level since late July, reflecting strong market expectations for Fed easing. Economists are now closely watching the scale and pace of these anticipated rate cuts throughout the year, which are expected to have a continued impact on global financial markets and currency valuations.

The 38-year-old Serb, aiming for a record 25th major title, acknowledged his lack of match practice but praised his ability to win crucial points. Meanwhile, American hopes Ben Shelton and Taylor Fritz also advanced to the second round, with Fritz being the last American man to reach a major final at Flushing Meadows. Their strong start highlights a promising period for American men's tennis, with two players seeded in the top eight for the first time since 2007.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has developed over the Atlantic Ocean, slowly gaining strength and projected to move north-northeast for the next couple of days. Located approximately 320 miles east of Bermuda, the storm has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters anticipate Fernand will strengthen through Monday before gradually weakening late Monday or Tuesday, remaining over open waters. NOAA had predicted an above-normal hurricane season this year, with Fernand following Hurricane Erin, which previously reached Category 5 intensity without making landfall.</p>

          <p>China is preparing for the test flight of a 1MW floating wind power generation system, which resembles an airship and is touted as a solution for remote and disaster-stricken areas. Developed by Beijing SAWES Energy Technology Company in collaboration with Tsinghua University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this technology aims to provide power where conventional supplies are inadequate. An earlier, smaller-scale iteration successfully ascended to 1,000 meters in January, demonstrating the feasibility of transmitting electricity to the ground. This development signifies a potential leap in turbine technology, offering a flexible and deployable energy source for challenging environments.</p>

This event, co-chaired by Eva Chow and Leonardo DiCaprio, will be the last before the museum's new Peter Zumthor-designed building opens next spring. Coogler, known for films like 'Black Panther' and the recent hit 'Sinners,' is celebrated for his masterful storytelling. Corse, a Topanga-based painter, is recognized for her experimental approach to art, particularly her 'White Light' series, which explores perception through innovative material use. The gala aims to strengthen the ties between film and visual art, raising millions for LACMA's programming and acquisitions.</p>

          <p>The airline industry is on the cusp of a major transformation in its booking systems, moving towards modern digital retail models akin to Amazon and Spotify. Travel tech companies like Flyr are developing next-generation 'offer and order management' systems to replace outdated passenger service systems (PSS). These new systems will enable features like shopping carts, allowing for simultaneous booking of different flights, varied seat classes, and additional services within a single transaction. Riyadh Air, launching later this year, will be the first 'digitally native' airline to operate without legacy PSS technology, setting a precedent for personalized and flexible booking experiences aimed at increasing airline revenue and competitiveness against online travel agents.</p>

This article highlights several ASX-listed companies with market capitalizations exceeding A$10 million, including Great Northern Minerals, KGL Resources, and MaxiPARTS. Great Northern Minerals and KGL Resources are pre-revenue and unprofitable, facing challenges like limited cash runways and negative returns on equity, despite efforts to raise capital. In contrast, MaxiPARTS Limited demonstrates strong financial performance with robust revenue streams, significant profit growth, and a reduced debt-to-equity ratio, signaling confidence in its future prospects within the commercial truck and trailer parts distribution sector.

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese electric carmaker Nio surged over 14% on Monday, extending a seven-session rally, driven by the recent unveiling of its new ES8 SUV. Priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan, the ES8 is one of Nio's most affordable models, significantly cheaper than its premium SUVs. This strategy aims to broaden Nio's customer base amid intense competition in China's EV sector, where other companies are offering similar features at lower price points. Nio has also launched two cheaper brands, Onvo and Firefly, to target mass market and young urban buyers, respectively, with ES8 deliveries set to begin in late September. (not investment advice)</p>
