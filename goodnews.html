          <h2>UK Government Introduces Grants Up to £3,750 to Boost Electric Vehicle Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:11:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has launched a new scheme offering drivers discounts of up to £3,750 to encourage the purchase of new electric cars. The grants, part of a £650 million fund, will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and are intended to help meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. While the government hopes this will make EVs more affordable, critics and industry figures point to the insufficient number of public charging points as a major barrier to adoption. The move has sparked political debate, with the opposition arguing it forces a product on consumers before the necessary infrastructure is ready.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that for the United States to lead the global AI revolution, it must leverage its abundant natural gas resources to meet the immense energy demands of data centers. The author contends that relying solely on renewable energy is impractical at the required scale and that a pragmatic approach is needed to prevent AI innovation from moving overseas to countries like China. By co-locating gas-powered generation with data centers, the U.S. can provide affordable, reliable electricity without straining the public grid. The piece praises the Trump administration's focus on this strategy as vital for economic strength and national security.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:44:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is updating its relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) guidance for schools in England to address contemporary issues. The new curriculum will include lessons on identifying misogyny, understanding the harms of AI-generated deepfakes, and recognizing unhealthy attitudes toward consent, with a focus on positive male role models. Unlike a previous draft, the new guidance will not impose strict age limits for topics but will outline what should be covered by the end of primary and secondary school. The changes, which also emphasize parental engagement, aim to better equip students to navigate the modern world.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's recent dominance is attributed to his work with putting coach Phil Kenyon, who helped turn a major weakness into a strength. In 2023, despite being the best player from tee to green, Scheffler was ranked outside the top 150 in putting. Kenyon addressed his green reading and grip, but a crucial switch to a mallet-style putter proved to be the turning point. Within a year, Scheffler won seven PGA Tour events, including his second Masters and an Olympic gold medal, solidifying his position at the top of the sport. The article highlights Kenyon's role in Scheffler's remarkable transformation.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans in the United States. The protections, which shield them from deportation and allow them to work, were set to expire as part of a broader administration effort to curtail the program. An immigrant advocacy group sued to block the revocation, arguing Afghanistan remains unsafe for return. The court's one-week stay provides a brief reprieve while it considers the case, highlighting the precarious situation for Afghans who fled their country, many of whom assisted the U.S. during its military presence there.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025. This rapid adoption is the result of long-standing government policies, including significant tax exemptions for EVs and higher taxes on polluting gasoline and diesel cars. The country has also invested heavily in public charging infrastructure, with over 10,000 fast chargers now available nationwide, easing concerns about grid capacity. In major cities like Oslo, EVs make up as much as 40% of all passenger cars, resulting in cleaner air and quieter streets, demonstrating a successful model for decarbonizing transport.</p>

          <p>A new urban development in Sickla, a suburb of Stockholm, is set to become the world's largest wooden construction project, with an investment of about $1.25 billion. The developer is using cross-laminated timber to build thousands of new homes, offices, and schools, aiming to showcase a more sustainable model for urban growth. The construction sector is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, and building with mass timber can reduce a project's climate impact by over 80% compared to concrete. The project leverages Sweden's deep cultural connection to its forests and aims to create an attractive, environmentally friendly urban center.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, a significant development after U.S. export controls had effectively halted them. The U.S. government has reportedly assured Nvidia that the necessary licenses will be granted. This policy shift follows intensive lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued the restrictions were undermining American tech leadership and hurting Nvidia's market share in China. The move is seen as a major win for the company and could be a result of a preliminary trade framework agreed upon by Washington and Beijing, potentially easing tech-related tensions.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has revealed plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build massive AI data centers across the United States in a push for "superintelligence." The first of these multi-gigawatt facilities, named Prometheus, is slated to be operational in 2026, with another, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. One of the proposed sites is described as covering an area nearly the size of Manhattan, underscoring the immense scale of the investment. This move signals Meta's ambition to be a leader in the AI race, though it also raises concerns about the enormous energy and water consumption of such facilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University has provided the first evidence that animals respond to sounds produced by plants, potentially opening up a new field of ecological study. Scientists found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic "screaming" noises associated with distress, such as dehydration. These sounds, which are outside the range of human hearing, are perceptible to many insects and some mammals. The discovery suggests that an entire invisible ecosystem of sound-based communication may exist, influencing behaviors like pollination, feeding, and seeking shelter among various species.</p>
