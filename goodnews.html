          <p>King Charles recently hosted his inaugural "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, an event that brought together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and activists to explore his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The gathering featured a ceremonial fire and discussions on the interconnectedness of all life, reflecting the King's long-held beliefs on sustainability, organic farming, and spirituality. The article positions this philosophy not as a mere hobby but as a central element of his worldview and a key component of the legacy he hopes to leave, bridging his environmental work with his deep personal faith.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wimbledon women's final features a compelling contest between world number one Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam champion, has overcome her historical unease on grass to find dominant form, while Anisimova is fulfilling her early-career promise after taking a break for her mental health. This article analyzes how the match could be decided, suggesting that while Swiatek holds the advantage in big-match experience, Anisimova's position as the underdog could free her to play a dangerously aggressive game, making the final a test of nerve as much as skill.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising global tensions, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine of "Australia first," signaling a strategic recalibration of the nation's international relationships. Drawing inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese is emphasizing national sovereignty and the need for Australia to shape its own future rather than defining itself by its alliances. This assertion of an independent course comes as his government navigates domestic debates over the Aukus security pact and increased defense spending, aiming to position Australia with strength and self-determination.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old from Massachusetts who is non-speaking due to autism and a neurological disorder called apraxia, has achieved a remarkable goal by gaining acceptance to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). For most of his life, Viraj's intelligence was hidden until his father discovered he could communicate by typing with his thumb on an iPad. This breakthrough unlocked his potential, allowing him to excel academically, score a 35 on the ACT, and pursue his dreams. Viraj hopes his journey will inspire the world to recognize the untapped potential within the entire non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's attempt to dismiss a lawsuit from the state, allowing the case alleging the platform harms children to move forward. The state's lawsuit claims that TikTok is intentionally designed with manipulative and addictive features aimed at exploiting its young user base to maximize engagement and advertising revenue. The attorney general praised the ruling as a crucial step toward holding the company accountable for its practices. This case is part of a growing legal trend where states are targeting the design and safety policies of tech companies rather than user-generated content.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the United States has resumed the shipment of military supplies to Ukraine, following a temporary halt on some critical weapons last week. The aid renewal was announced after President Trump revealed a deal for NATO to purchase and transfer U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to Kyiv. These systems are vital for Ukraine's ability to defend against a recent surge in Russian drone and missile attacks, which have caused record civilian casualties and increased pressure on the U.S. to bolster Ukraine's defensive capabilities.</p>

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood have soared over 160% in 2025, yet the company is simultaneously navigating several significant obstacles.

Despite these regulatory and business challenges, investor optimism remains high, bolstered by political tailwinds such as the "Trump Accounts" initiative, a government-seeded investment program for which Robinhood is already developing an application.
