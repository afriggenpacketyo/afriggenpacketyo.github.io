          <p>Kent Broussard, a 66-year-old retired accountant from Baton Rouge, has achieved a lifelong ambition by successfully auditioning for the Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band. Having dreamed of playing the tuba for the band since he was a child, Broussard returned to school and relearned the instrument to compete for a spot. The band's director confirmed that Broussard was not given any special treatment during the competitive audition process. Now the oldest member of the band by over four decades, he hopes his story inspires others to pursue their dreams regardless of age.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has introduced a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could increase his net worth to over $1 trillion if the company achieves a series of ambitious goals over the next decade. The package, which requires shareholder approval, is tied to increasing Tesla's market value to $8.5 trillion and meeting significant production targets, including for Robotaxis and humanoid robots. This proposal aims to ensure Musk's long-term commitment to the company. The plan comes while his previous $50 billion pay package from 2018 remains contested in a Delaware court.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 20:19:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI company Anthropic has agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed by authors who accused the firm of using their copyrighted books without permission to train its AI model, Claude. The settlement, which awaits court approval, would compensate authors approximately $3,000 for each of the estimated 500,000 works involved. This case is significant as it follows a judge's split ruling that found training on legally obtained works could be fair use, but using pirated books was not. The outcome is seen as a major precedent for how AI companies must handle copyrighted material.</p>

Having already traveled 15,000 miles across 17 countries, the theft left him stranded. However, the incident prompted a massive wave of support from the public and the global biker community, with numerous offers of replacement gear and motorcycles. Among the offers was a loaner bike from the production company behind Ewan McGregor's "Long Way Home" series.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti is unlawful. The decision by District Judge Edward Chen blocks the Department of Homeland Security's move, allowing approximately 1.1 million people to maintain their legal right to live and work in the U.S. The judge stated the administration's action was unprecedented and violated the law, given the dangerous conditions in the migrants' home countries. The Department of Homeland Security has indicated it will appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>California has officially joined the Northwest Wildland Fire Fighting Compact, a collaborative agreement with 12 other U.S. states and Canadian provinces aimed at sharing resources and technology to combat major wildfires. The move allows members to provide mutual aid when a blaze exceeds a single jurisdiction's capacity. Governor Gavin Newsom framed the partnership as a necessary step as California faces more frequent and intense fires due to climate change. The announcement highlighted a contrast with the Trump administration, which has recently reduced the budget and staff of the U.S. Forest Service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A revised draft of a major U.S. Senate bill on cryptocurrency regulation includes a new provision to ensure that tokenized stocks and other traditional securities are not reclassified as commodities. The Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 seeks to establish clear jurisdictional lines between the SEC and the CFTC for regulating digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hope that the bill could be passed by the end of the year, though it still requires bipartisan support. This legislative effort follows a stablecoin regulation bill that was signed into law earlier in the summer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching $1.8 billion, potential winners face the critical decision of taking a lump sum cash payment or receiving annuity payments over 29 years. According to certified public accountant Dan Geltrude, the lump sum offers greater investment control but carries the risk of overspending, a fate that has befallen many past winners. The annuity option is described as a "safe bet" that makes it more difficult to lose the entire fortune quickly. The article advises any winner to remain anonymous initially, sign the ticket, and immediately assemble a team of legal and financial professionals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made a last-minute change to their pitching rotation for their series opener against the Baltimore Orioles. Scheduled starter Tyler Glasnow was scratched due to back tightness, and two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani volunteered to take the mound on short notice. Ohtani had his own recent start skipped due to illness but was deemed ready to pitch. Manager Dave Roberts expressed hope that Glasnow's issue is not serious and praised Ohtani's willingness to step up for the team, which is looking to bounce back from a recent series sweep.</p>
