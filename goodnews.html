          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have utilized an advanced AI protein language model to investigate convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently develop similar traits. The study successfully identified complex, high-order features in proteins that evolved separately but serve analogous functions, such as echolocation in bats and dolphins. This AI-driven approach moves beyond traditional methods that focus on simple sequence similarities, offering deeper insights into the genetic basis for how different species adapt in similar ways to their environments.</p>

          <p>Consumer Reports has released its list of the best new SUVs for 2025, prioritizing reliability, owner satisfaction, safety, and road-test performance. The Subaru Forester, particularly the new hybrid model, secured the top spot for its quiet ride and improved fuel economy. Other top contenders include two Toyota models: the RAV4 Plug-In Hybrid, praised for its 40-mile electric range, and the lesser-known Crown Signia hybrid, noted for its efficiency. The list is rounded out by the Hyundai Tucson Plug-In Hybrid, recognized for its comfort and 33-mile electric range, and the versatile Subaru Outback.</p>

          <p>China is embarking on one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects, a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet. Dubbed a "project of the century," the line will traverse extreme terrain, including mountain ranges and permafrost, at an average altitude of over 4,500 meters. With an estimated cost potentially reaching 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), the railway presents immense engineering difficulties but is seen by Beijing as crucial for regional development and strategic integration. A state-owned company has been established to build and operate this monumental line.</p>

          <p>The European Union has begun the gradual rollout of its new digital border control system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track the entry and exit of non-EU citizens in the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces manual passport stamping, requires travelers from countries like the UK to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a photo, on their first use. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel long-term, concerns remain about potential delays during the initial registration phase. The EES is being introduced in stages at airports and key border crossings like Dover and the Channel Tunnel, with full implementation expected by April 2026.</p>

          <p>At its party conference, Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru endorsed a plan to create a "standing commission" to prepare a white paper on Welsh independence. However, party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth clarified that this detailed proposal would not be for the first term of a potential Plaid-led government, suggesting it is a longer-term ambition. This move marks a shift from the party's previous pledge to hold an independence referendum within five years. The immediate focus will be on engaging the public in a national debate about Wales's constitutional future and pursuing enhanced devolution.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to qualify for the next World Cup to "put right" the team's painful 2022 play-off defeat to Ukraine. As Scotland prepares to face Belarus, they are well-positioned in their qualifying group, level on points with leaders Denmark. Clarke, who led the team to two consecutive European Championships, sees World Cup qualification as the next critical step. A victory against Belarus could secure at least a play-off spot, moving the nation closer to its first men's World Cup appearance in 28 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the genetic process that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a complete new plant. Their research, published in the journal *Cell*, identifies two key genetic switches that enable somatic cells—any cell other than a sperm or egg—to initiate embryogenesis. This phenomenon, known as somatic embryogenesis, was previously not well understood. The findings provide fundamental insights into one of biology's most profound processes and could have significant implications for agriculture and plant biotechnology.</p>

          <p>An analysis of several high-profile strikers who moved to Premier League clubs during the summer transfer window reveals a mixed bag of early-season performances. Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres has made a strong start, scoring three goals and playing a key role in the team's top standing. Similarly, Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike and Newcastle's Nick Woltemade have found the net multiple times, making an immediate impact. In contrast, players like Everton's Thierno Barry and Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko are still finding their footing, having yet to consistently deliver on their high price tags.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her personal journey of understanding body donation after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, revealed her decision to donate her body to medical science. Initially shocked, Owen produced a documentary at Cardiff University, where her mother is registered, to explore the process. The article highlights how medical students learn from donated bodies, which they call their "silent teachers," and the profound connection they feel. While the wait for a traditional funeral can be difficult for families, the experience ultimately provides comfort in knowing their loved one's final act is a gift to future medical professionals.</p>

The decisive victory improves his undefeated record to 35-0 and sets up a highly anticipated future showdown with fellow unbeaten fighter Vergil Ortiz Jr. Promoters have confirmed an agreement is in place for the two to meet in early 2026.</p>

          <p>Footballer Fran Kirby has shared her challenging journey back to professional sports after being diagnosed with pericarditis, an inflammation of the sac around the heart, in 2019. The condition, which caused extreme chest pain and fatigue, led her to collapse and consider ending her career. After a difficult 10-month recovery period involving strong medication and immense physical and mental strain, Kirby successfully returned to the pitch. Now playing for Brighton, she emphasizes a more cautious approach to her health and recovery, appreciating the simple ability to walk her dogs as much as winning trophies.</p>

          <p>Despite being the all-time leading goalscorer for both England and Tottenham Hotspur, and continuing his prolific form at Bayern Munich, questions persist about whether striker Harry Kane is fully appreciated. While some critics point to his lack of major trophies or suggest his international record is inflated by qualifiers, pundits argue his all-around game, consistency, and leadership make him one of the world's truly elite players. His humble demeanor and understated profile may contribute to this perception, but his remarkable statistics and impact for both club and country place him in the highest echelon of modern football.</p>
