          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that his country received a U.S.-made Patriot anti-aircraft system from Israel, which has been operational for a month. He also stated that two additional Patriot launchers are expected to arrive this autumn, though their origin was not specified. This development is notable given Israel's previous reluctance to provide military aid to Ukraine, having maintained a more neutral stance in the conflict with Russia. The move suggests a potential shift in Israeli policy as Russia strengthens its ties with Iran, a key adversary of Israel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the unique power of novels discovered during adolescence, with a particular focus on Judy Blume's groundbreaking 1975 book, "Forever." For many teens, obtaining and reading the novel, which depicts sexuality from a female protagonist's perspective, was a significant rite of passage. The book offered a rare chance for young readers to see their own anxieties and desires validated, providing a sense of understanding during a formative time. The enduring legacy of such young adult literature lies in its ability to make teens feel seen and less alone in their experiences.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, the first Black woman to be hired as a television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has died at the age of 92. A trailblazer in an industry dominated by white men in the 1960s, Davis became a trusted and respected journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area, hosting shows for stations like KQED. Throughout her career, she covered pivotal moments from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, interviewing figures like Muhammad Ali and Fidel Castro. Colleagues and public figures remember her as a mentor who fearlessly broke down barriers for future generations of journalists.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold the remainder of its stake in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD, concluding a highly profitable 17-year investment. BYD confirmed the news, expressing gratitude for the long-term support from Buffett and his late partner, Charlie Munger, and stating that selling is a normal part of investing. Despite the amicable separation, BYD's shares fell over 6% in Hong Kong following the news, amid signs of cooling growth for the company. Concurrently, Berkshire has continued to increase its investments in major Japanese trading houses, recently raising its stake in Mitsui to over 10%.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II and also served with distinction in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces, breaking racial barriers while demonstrating exceptional skill and courage. After retiring from the Air Force in 1971, Hardy became a dedicated champion of the group's legacy, which was formally honored with the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO), one of the largest out-of-home advertising companies. Anson argues that despite CCO divesting its international assets to become a U.S. pure-play company, its stock remains undervalued compared to peers like Lamar Advertising and Outfront Media. The firm believes a sale is the best path forward for shareholders, as a standalone restructuring would be slow and hampered by the company's significant debt. Potential acquirers could include industry rivals or private equity firms, which have shown recent interest in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

This method has already been used for disaster relief, with Fading West producing 82 homes for residents displaced by the 2023 Maui wildfires. By applying these efficient manufacturing principles more broadly, the company hopes to make homeownership more attainable for essential workers and families nationwide.</p>

          <p>Effectively managing workplace conflicts is crucial for professional success, and communication experts suggest memorizing key phrases to handle awkward situations. To initiate a difficult conversation, phrases like "I'm seeking clarity" can reduce defensiveness. When approached with a problem, asking "What does success look like?" helps align goals before offering solutions. During a disagreement, leading with empathy by saying "I want to make sure I understand" can validate the other person's perspective and de-escalate tension. Mastering these techniques can build a reputation as a calm, accountable problem-solver, thereby increasing influence at work.</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a celebrated journalist and documentarian known for his unconventional television interviews with cultural icons, has died at the age of 103. An Austrian Jew who fled the Nazis, he later returned to Europe as a U.S. soldier and was present at the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He eventually settled in Paris, where his subjective and sensitive interviewing style on the German TV show "Personenbeschreibung" became legendary, featuring guests like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen. Troller viewed his journalistic work as a form of "self-healing" after the trauma of his youth.</p>
