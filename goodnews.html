          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council is considering compulsorily purchasing two more empty houses on Warstones Drive and Hadley Road to convert them into family homes. These properties have been vacant for several years, and the council's cabinet will review the potential purchases at an upcoming meeting. The council has already acquired and refurbished over 300 homes in the past five years, selling or renting them to generate funds for the scheme. Housing improvement officers initially work with owners to encourage them to renovate and reoccupy the properties before resorting to compulsory purchase.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump in Canada during the Group of Seven (G7) leaders' meeting in mid-June. Prior to the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit Washington for further negotiations on the Trump tariffs. Japan is seeking the removal of U.S. tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced tariff rates due to the U.S.'s consistent refusal to eliminate them. Both countries aim to reach an agreement as soon as possible, focusing on boosting investment and creating jobs in the United States to reduce the trade deficit.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address rising prices. The release will include 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to sell at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to approximately 100,000 tons. The released rice will be distributed to smaller supermarkets, specialty shops, and major retailers, with applications beginning on Wednesday, and the government aims to deliver the rice quickly to lower consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have decreased significantly, with a 47% reduction in overdose risk among those aged 20 to 29, according to recent data. The shift is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and a trend of less risky drug and alcohol use among teens. Despite the positive trend, challenges remain for individuals struggling with severe addiction, and potential cuts in funding for addiction services pose a threat to sustaining progress. One pill can kill, and the recent wave of devastation may have spurred a more cautious approach to drug experimentation among Gen Z.</p>
