          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 09:36:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major financial institutions Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have partnered to launch tokenized money market funds, allowing institutional clients to invest in these assets via a blockchain platform. This innovation aims to bring the benefits of digital assets, such as faster settlement and 24/7 trading, to the $7.1 trillion money market industry. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for cash management for entities like hedge funds and corporations. The move is seen as a foundational step toward a more efficient digital financial ecosystem where such assets could also be used as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 09:30:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks. The court ruled that the directions given to the juries in their original trials were incorrect, making the convictions unsafe. The case centered on accusations that they conspired to influence rates for bank profit, a practice they argued was common and known to superiors. This ruling comes after a decade-long legal battle and follows a US court decision that found similar conduct was not a crime, raising questions about other convictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off her attacker's tongue during a sexual assault. At the time, the 19-year-old was given a suspended prison sentence while her attacker received a lighter penalty for lesser charges. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, successfully petitioned for a retrial to clear her name after 61 years of living with a criminal record. The case is a landmark moment for women's rights in South Korea, with prosecutors now asking the court to acquit her.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler, who had been considering a challenge to incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul, stated the decision was best for his family and district. His congressional seat is considered a key battleground, and his victory was crucial for the narrow Republican House majority. The decision comes after former President Trump had appeared to endorse Lawler for reelection, a move seen by some as an effort to clear the gubernatorial field for other candidates.</p>

          <p>Australian rugby player Harry Potter has rejected claims from Sir Clive Woodward and David Campese that the Wallabies squad possesses a "losing mentality." The criticism followed Australia's 27-19 loss to the British and Irish Lions, where the captain chose to end the game by kicking the ball out of play. Woodward, a former Lions coach, called the decision a sign of a losing mindset. Potter defended his team, stating it was "ridiculous" to question their will to win and emphasized that they are focused on learning from the defeat and performing better in the next crucial test match.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) detected and tracked Russian military aircraft operating near Alaska's coast on Tuesday. The planes flew within the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), an area of international airspace that is closely monitored for national security. NORAD stated the aircraft did not enter U.S. or Canadian sovereign airspace and were not considered a threat. This event is the latest in a series of similar occurrences this year, reflecting ongoing geopolitical tensions and routine military surveillance activities by both nations in the Arctic region.</p>

The feature, set to roll out next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, aims to enhance safety and comfort on the platform. While not a guarantee, the tool increases the likelihood of women-to-women matches. This initiative is an expansion of a similar feature previously tested in other countries and comes as ridesharing companies continue to address long-standing safety concerns, particularly regarding sexual assault and harassment.</p>

          <p>China's dominance in the global shipbuilding market saw a slight dip in the first half of the year, with its share of new vessel orders falling to 68.3% from 74.7% a year prior. According to China's industry association, the total order volume also decreased by 18.2%. Analysts suggest this decline is partly due to shipowners' caution in placing orders for oil and LNG tankers, given the United States' significant role in energy exports and the potential threat of port fees. Despite the drop, China remains the world's leading shipbuilder, leveraging significant competitive advantages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists in China claim to have developed a new design platform that overcomes a major computational challenge in aviation known as the "curse of dimensionality." This innovation reportedly allows for the optimization of a vast number of design variables without increasing the computing load. To demonstrate their system, the researchers applied it to the design of the US Navy's cancelled X-47B stealth drone. They assert their software achieved significant improvements in stealth, aerodynamics, and propulsion, potentially solving the complex trade-offs that led to the original American program's termination in 2015.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sea slug Elysia chlorotica exhibits a remarkable biological feat by stealing chloroplasts from the algae it consumes and incorporating them into its own body. This process, known as kleptoplasty, allows the slug to perform photosynthesis, generating its own food from sunlight like a plant. This unique form of symbiosis challenges traditional understandings of evolution, which typically focus on random mutation rather than the wholesale transfer of genetic skills between species. The phenomenon suggests that symbiotic relationships may play a more significant role in evolution than previously thought, blurring the lines between different kingdoms of life.</p>

          <p>Ari Aster's latest film, "Eddington," is reviewed as a dark and surreal neo-Western that channels the anxieties of the early COVID-19 pandemic. The movie follows a small-town New Mexico sheriff, played by Joaquin Phoenix, whose paranoia and desire for control escalate into extreme violence. The article compares the protagonist to "Taxi Driver's" Travis Bickle, exploring how the film immerses the audience in the chaotic perspective of a man who sees himself as a vigilante hero. "Eddington" is described as a challenging and lacerating comedy that satirizes the conspiracy theories and political polarization that defined the lockdown era.</p>
