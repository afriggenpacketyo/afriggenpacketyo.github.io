          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 21:45:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits decreased by 1.5% year-on-year in July, representing the slowest rate of decline observed in the past five months. This notable recovery follows a period of more significant drops and is largely attributed to Beijing's concerted efforts to combat price wars, which have helped bolster companies' profit margins. The data offers a crucial insight into the manufacturing sector's health, suggesting a potential stabilization amidst ongoing economic adjustments. This trend indicates that policy interventions might be yielding positive, albeit modest, results in the industrial landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bain Capital, the controlling shareholder of luxury parka maker Canada Goose, is considering bids to take the company private, with offers valuing it around $1.35 billion. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have made verbal offers, while other interested buyers include Bosideng International and a consortium led by FountainVest Capital and Anta Sports Product. This move comes as Canada Goose struggles with growth momentum, facing questions about its brand positioning and marketing strategy amidst cautious consumer spending on high-ticket apparel. Bain Capital's 12-year investment cycle, exceeding the typical timeframe, also makes an exit a natural progression. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have finalized their initial 53-man roster for the upcoming NFL season, with Trey Lance securing the backup quarterback position behind Justin Herbert. This decision follows Lance's impressive performance, which solidified his spot over veteran Taylor Heinicke. The roster reveals a new running back duo in Omarion Hampton and Najee Harris, and a deep defensive line. While the offensive line remains a question mark due to injuries, the team is set at other key positions. Head coach Jim Harbaugh is reportedly satisfied with the foundation, though further roster adjustments are anticipated.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott is confident that star pass rusher Micah Parsons will play in the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles, despite an ongoing contract dispute.

While owner Jerry Jones has rejected a trade, Parsons' teammate Trevon Diggs was less certain about his availability. Prescott downplayed the contract saga as a locker room distraction, emphasizing Parsons' dedication to the team and his strong work ethic during the offseason.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its 10th test flight, achieving key objectives after a series of previous failures. The massive 40-story rocket performed as planned, with the Super Heavy booster completing a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The Starship upper stage successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators and executed a controlled re-entry, despite some heat shield damage, before splashing down on target in the Indian Ocean. This critical success provides a much-needed boost for the program, which is vital for NASA's moon landing ambitions and Elon Musk's Mars colonization goals, though many technical hurdles for full reusability and orbital refueling remain.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is advocating for self-reliance and domestic spending with his "Make and Spend in India" campaign, directly countering President Trump's new 50% tariffs on Indian exports. Modi's call for "Swadeshi" aims to mitigate the economic blow to India's export-driven industries and millions of livelihoods. The government is also planning an overhaul of India's indirect tax architecture, proposing a simplified two-tier Goods and Services Tax (GST) system. This article explains that these fiscal stimuli, including a potential $20 billion GST reform, are expected to boost private consumption and GDP, helping to offset external economic pressures and global geopolitical tensions.
