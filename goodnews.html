        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses "energy vampires" in friendships, individuals who drain one's energy through excessive complaining, self-focus, or a constant need for attention. Psychologists suggest signs include a lack of interest in your life and chipping away at your mood. To manage these relationships, experts recommend honest conversations about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries on time spent or topics discussed, and changing shared activities to less conversational ones like exercising together. These strategies aim to protect one's well-being while potentially maintaining the friendship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong's goal of expanding green marine fuels relies heavily on establishing a robust methanol supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has initiated liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations, green methanol requires a tax-free import, storage, and sales system for mainland-produced fuel. This statement was made during the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol. The company anticipates increasing green methanol usage from 2027 due to Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity, led by President Maia Sandu, is set for a new parliamentary majority after winning elections marred by claims of "massive Russian interference." With most votes counted, Sandu's party is well ahead of pro-Russian blocs, securing enough seats to form a government independently. The election was tense, with bomb scares reported at polling stations and arrests made for plotting unrest. This outcome is seen as crucial for Moldova's future path towards the EU, despite ongoing challenges like inflation and corruption.</p>

Tourists often walk into private gardens and homes, causing significant disruption. The fee will include museum and windmill access, with revenues intended for maintenance and new infrastructure, though local businesses fear a loss of shoppers.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer asserts that the current AI boom's spending is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble, despite critics drawing parallels. He argues that today's massive capital projects are undertaken by established, financially robust companies like Meta, Tesla, Google, and Microsoft, unlike the debt-laden, unproven startups of 2000. Cramer acknowledges skepticism about AI's immediate tangible benefits but believes in its future potential and the strategic necessity for tech giants to invest heavily. He points to the self-funded nature of the buildout and strong demand as key differentiators. (not investment advice)</p>
