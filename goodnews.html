          <h2>Bitcoin Reaches New All-Time High Amid Regulatory Optimism and Institutional Interest (not investment advice)</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's rally persists, possibly due to investors seeking alternative stores of value amid broader macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Favorable regulatory developments, such as the GENIUS Act progressing in the Senate and a pro-crypto agenda from President Trump and his advisors, also contribute to market support. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's announcement that the bank will allow clients to buy Bitcoin further boosts confidence in the cryptocurrency. This article is strictly a report on the market's behavior.</p>

          <p>The Marks & Spencer website is back online after being inaccessible for several hours due to ongoing disruptions following a cyber attack. Customers have been unable to make online orders for weeks, and the website went completely down on Wednesday evening. M&S estimates the cyber attack will impact this year's profits by around £300m, with online services expected to be disrupted until July. The attack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, compromised some personal customer data, including telephone numbers, addresses, and order histories, but not payment details or passwords. Police are investigating the incident, focusing on the Scattered Spider hacking group.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares in Xpeng, the Chinese electric-vehicle maker, are expected to extend their rally of nearly 80% this year, driven by newer models and progress toward profitability. The company's Hong Kong shares surged after upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Xpeng's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, fueled by robust sales, narrowing its net loss and improving its gross margin. Analysts anticipate Xpeng will turn profitable in the fourth quarter of this year, maintaining a buy rating on the stock with a target price significantly higher than its current value.</p>

          <p>An IndiGo passenger jet traveling from New Delhi to Srinagar encountered a severe hailstorm mid-flight, causing significant damage to the plane but ultimately making a safe landing. Passengers experienced widespread panic and turbulence, with some fearing a crash, while the plane sustained a large hole in its nose. Despite the damage, the flight and cabin crew followed protocol, and the pilot manually flew the plane to a safe landing. Transportation analysts note that while hail can cause significant damage, planes are often able to land safely due to pilot skill and aircraft design.</p>

          <p>Canada is in high-level discussions with the United States regarding participation in President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense program. Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the talks, citing growing missile threats, including those from space, and emphasizing the need for protections for Canadians. The potential collaboration comes amid strained ties between Washington and Ottawa, as Canada seeks to diversify its trade and security alliances.

          <p>A bill has been proposed to give newborns $1,000 in "Trump Accounts," with the money invested on their behalf in financial markets. Children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, would receive the funds, which they could withdraw later for expenses like college or buying a house. While the $1,000 initial investment is clear, the accounts have puzzled tax experts, as they would function much like typical investment accounts rather than tax-advantaged accounts. The accounts have generated discussion due to their direct association with President Trump's name and the broader implications for government investment in citizens' financial futures.</p>
