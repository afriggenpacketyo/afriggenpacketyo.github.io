          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is leading to a potential "China shock" in global markets, with a flood of cheap exports. This situation is causing anxiety in Asia as local industries fear being squeezed. However, economists suggest that the influx of low-cost Chinese goods could ease inflationary pressures for consumers. This could provide central banks with some relief as they navigate rising trade tensions. The article presents a balanced view, acknowledging both the risks and potential benefits of China's manufacturing overdrive. (not investment advice)</p>
