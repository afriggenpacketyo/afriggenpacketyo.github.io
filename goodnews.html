Ames claimed she was denied a promotion and later demoted by the Ohio Department of Youth Services in favor of less qualified gay candidates, with her supervisor at the time also being gay. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, delivering the opinion, stated that Ames had been unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group. The ruling allows Ames' lawsuit to proceed, but does not guarantee she will win the case against her former employer.</p>

Pharmacist Stacia Woodcock advises against taking medication after its expiration date, citing potential loss of potency or contamination.

Judge Brian Murphy ruled that O.C.G. was deported without due process and despite his stated fears of persecution. The news comes amid a broader court fight over Trump's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act for deportations, with Judge James Boasberg ordering the administration to provide migrants removed under the Act an opportunity to contest their removal.</p>

While some presidents have been guarded about their use of the autopen, it has been used by many throughout U.S. history, including John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump held phone talks amid renewed trade tensions. Trump initiated the call after accusing China of violating a tariff accord. The two countries agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade war in mid-May in Geneva, but have recently traded barbs over alleged violations. U.S. officials claim Beijing is withholding critical minerals, while China's Commerce Ministry has refuted these claims and criticized the Trump administration for discriminatory measures.

          <p>A new report indicates that 81% of "next generation millionaires" plan to replace their parents' wealth management firms, citing poor digital offerings and a lack of services and products. The $100 trillion wealth transfer from older to younger generations is set to reshape the wealth management industry. The next generation of inheritors prioritize risk, want more crypto and private equity investments, live a digital life, and seek financial education, and wealth managers must adapt to meet these needs. Firms that attract, retain, and cater to the future of wealth will be best positioned. (not investment advice)</p>
