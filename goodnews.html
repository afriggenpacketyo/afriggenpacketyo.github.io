          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher, with investors closely watching the upcoming U.S. August jobs report to gauge the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Recent payroll data has already boosted market confidence in a September cut, alleviating fears of a sharp economic decline. Meanwhile, Danish wind farm developer Orsted announced a cut to its full-year earnings guidance, attributing the revision to unusually low offshore wind speeds. The company is also engaged in legal action against the Trump administration to resume construction on a stalled New England offshore wind farm, underscoring regulatory hurdles impacting renewable energy projects.</p>

This decision, which rejected the Justice Department's most severe proposed penalties, led to a substantial increase in Google's market valuation. Pichai expressed his relief that the "long process" of the antitrust case had reached a "resolution" and commended the administration's engagement. He further praised the White House's "AI Action Plan," emphasizing the transformative nature of artificial intelligence and the importance of U.S. leadership in the field, despite Trump's past criticisms and ongoing legal challenges against Google's platforms.</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei is actively working to unlock the country's vast copper potential, aiming to capitalize on surging global demand driven by electrification and renewable energy trends. As part of his "Make Argentina Great Again" reform agenda, Milei's administration introduced the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), offering significant benefits to large-scale investors. Major mining companies like BHP, Glencore, and Rio Tinto are making substantial bets, with an estimated $16 billion in copper projects seeking RIGI entry. Experts view Argentina as a highly exciting new copper story, though policy consistency and social license will be crucial for sustained success.</p>

Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was disqualified just seconds into the game for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, an incident he later called a "mistake." Despite this setback and other penalties, Jalen Hurts led the Eagles with two rushing touchdowns, and Saquon Barkley added another score. The game's intensity, typical of the rivalry, continued even after the lengthy weather interruption, with the Eagles defense making a crucial late stop to seal the win.</p>

          <p>Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the outgoing head of the British armed forces, asserts that the UK's national security is secure "for now and for the next few years." His optimism stems from the UK's status as a nuclear power, its membership in NATO, described as "the biggest and strongest gun club ever," and its close alliance with the U.S. Sir Tony also praised the UK's strong response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, contrasting it with earlier approaches. He urged skepticism against the idea of a new non-NATO "axis" forming, emphasizing the lack of historical trust and mutual support among such potential alliances.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump confirmed his plan to impose "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports, targeting companies that fail to shift production to the United States. During a White House dinner with prominent tech executives, he signaled that companies like Apple, which has committed an additional $100 billion to domestic manufacturing, would be spared from these levies. This initiative aligns with a broader U.S. effort to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, a strategy that has already seen major companies like TSMC and Samsung invest hundreds of billions in American plants since 2020. The policy aims to bolster national security and economic independence in the crucial technology sector, though specific details on exemptions are still evolving.</p>

          <p>Most bidders seeking to acquire a portion of Starbucks' China operations have submitted offers valuing the business at up to $5 billion, according to sources familiar with the discussions. This potential deal could represent one of the largest China unit divestments by a global consumer company in recent years. The valuation, roughly 10 times its expected 2025 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda), indicates strong interest despite sluggish growth and intense local competition. The sale would allow Starbucks to navigate challenges in the Chinese market, where it faces stiff rivalry from domestic brands like Luckin Coffee.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, with a cash value of $770.3 million. This marks a record 42nd consecutive drawing without a top prize winner. An analysis of Powerball data reveals significant variations in after-tax payouts across states, due to differing state income tax laws on lottery winnings. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to retain a larger portion of their winnings after federal taxes. Conversely, states such as New York and Minnesota have higher state taxes, resulting in lower net payouts for winners.</p>
