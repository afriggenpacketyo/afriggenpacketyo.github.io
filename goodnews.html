        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1," the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, potentially accelerating AI and data centers. The chip achieves a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, rivaling Nvidia's advanced GPUs. This development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors. Optical computing offers advantages like ultra-high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption, positioning it as a critical future direction in overcoming these barriers. The focus is now on expanding computational parallelism to enhance chip capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices dropped to $66.57 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent fell to $69.50. Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some suggesting a "peace through strength" strategy. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, which allowed for the prevention of casualties, and called for a move toward peace, signaling a potential shift in the regional dynamics (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel on Truth Social, following a missile attack by Iran on a US military base. While fresh missiles were fired overnight, daytime will test the durability of the ceasefire. The article questions whether Trump can be regarded as a trusted broker of peace, and whether Israel can be convinced to pull back on its military advantage. The president's influence will be tested at a NATO summit in The Netherlands, where a positive result in the Middle East could confound curiosity about him for the better.</p>
