          <p>During the first game of the AL Wild Card series between the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Guardians, a broadcast camera was destroyed by a 100-mph foul ball. In an at-bat against Tigers pitcher Tarik Skubal, Guardians hitter Angel Martinez fouled off a pitch directly back into the lens of a camera positioned behind home plate, shattering it. The game was briefly paused for cleanup, providing a memorable moment in a tense, high-stakes postseason matchup. The Tigers ultimately secured a narrow victory in the crucial opening game of the series.</p>

          <p>Struggling budget carrier Spirit Airlines stated in a court hearing that it is making significant strides in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy revitalization. The airline has secured agreements for up to $475 million in new financing and plans to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft to cut costs, many of which are grounded due to engine defects. As part of its restructuring, Spirit is also cutting 40 routes, furloughing flight attendants, and seeking concessions from its pilots' union. These steps are aimed at creating a stronger, more financially stable airline.</p>
