          <p>Three miners have been safely rescued in northern British Columbia after being trapped underground for two days following a mine collapse. The men, contractors at the Newmont-operated Red Chris mine, were reported to be in good health and spirits after sheltering in a refuge chamber with supplies. The chamber was sealed off by a large debris pile from two separate cave-ins, prompting a complex rescue operation to clear the access tunnel. A full investigation into the incident will be conducted, and production at the copper and gold mine remains suspended.</p>

          <p>The United States and Mexico have signed a new agreement to address the decades-old crisis of sewage from the Tijuana River polluting Southern California beaches. The accord establishes a timetable for Mexico to complete its $93 million allocation for infrastructure projects through 2027 to stop the flow of billions of gallons of raw sewage and toxic chemicals. The pollution has caused persistent beach closures and health issues for residents and Navy SEALs. U.S. officials praised the new Mexican administration's commitment to resolving the environmental and national security issue that previous efforts failed to fix.</p>

          <p>American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has completed a worldwide licensing agreement with Chinese biotech company 3SBio for the cancer drug SSGJ-707. Under the terms, Pfizer will gain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the drug globally, except in mainland China, where 3SBio will receive up to $150 million from Pfizer to lead development. As part of the transaction, Pfizer also acquired a 1.3% equity stake in 3SBio for approximately HK$785 million. The deal highlights the growing influence of Chinese biotech firms and increasing interest from major international pharmaceutical companies in their innovations.</p>

          <h2>Doctors Urge FDA to Re-evaluate Warning Labels on Menopause Hormone Therapies</h2>

          <p>A panel of doctors has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove its strongest safety warning, the "black box" label, from low-dose estrogen treatments for menopause. They argue the current labels, which warn of risks like cancer and dementia, overstate the danger for locally-administered treatments and unnecessarily scare women away from beneficial therapies for symptoms like vaginal dryness and urinary tract infections. This push comes amid a broader re-evaluation of hormone replacement therapy, which fell out of favor two decades ago due to overstated cancer concerns from a major study.</p>

          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, known for its globally popular Labubu dolls, is strategically pivoting towards becoming a major international brand. The company's founder and CEO, Wang Ning, stated that the goal has evolved from being "China's Disney" to becoming "the world's Pop Mart." This reflects a broader trend of Chinese consumer companies exporting their brands, not just their products. Driven by the viral success of Labubu, Pop Mart's overseas revenue has soared, and the company expects its international sales to surpass domestic sales this year, with North America becoming a key market.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed what leaders are calling a "historic" free trade agreement, which is projected to boost their annual bilateral trade by over $34 billion in the long term. The deal will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including British scotch and automobiles, and Indian textiles and jewelry. Specifically, tariffs on 92% of U.K. goods exported to India will be reduced or removed, while 99% of Indian goods shipped to Britain will become tariff-exempt. The agreement marks a strategic win for both nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's professional cycling, a significant financial gap persists compared to the men's sport. At the Tour de France, for example, the male winner receives €500,000 in prize money, while the female winner gets only €50,000. This disparity extends to salaries, with top male cyclists earning millions more than their female counterparts. While the director of the Tour de France Femmes points to progress, such as a longer race and higher TV ratings, top riders and advocates argue that much more needs to be done to achieve financial equality.</p>

          <p>Swedish football club Brommapojkarna has established itself as one of Europe's most effective talent development hubs, producing high-profile players like Viktor Gyokeres, Dejan Kulusevski, and Lucas Bergvall. Despite having a very small fan base and limited revenue from supporters, the club thrives by operating Europe's largest youth academy, with over 4,500 members. Their model focuses on nurturing local talent from a young age and selling promising players to bigger clubs, which provides their primary source of income.

          <p>An analytical article examines several popular narratives surrounding the WNBA, particularly in the era of Caitlin Clark. It concludes that while Clark is a major draw, the league is not solely dependent on her, with other young stars and veteran players also driving interest and record attendance. The piece explores the debate around her All-Star ranking, arguing that player and media votes reflected her on-court performance, which includes high turnover rates. It also addresses criticisms of league refereeing and the quality of play, suggesting that many perceived issues are exaggerated or common in professional sports.</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.9% in June, a rebound driven by hot weather that boosted supermarket sales of drinks and fuel sales. According to the Office for National Statistics, clothing retailers also benefited from promotions and demand for summer apparel. However, this increase follows a larger-than-expected 2.8% drop in May, and the overall trend for the quarter shows that retail spending has lost momentum. This suggests that economic growth was likely lackluster in the second quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As England prepares to face Spain in the Euro 2025 final, a tactical analysis highlights key areas that could decide the match. The article suggests England can exploit Spain's high defensive line with connected forward play and direct runs, similar to how Germany found success in the semi-final. A crucial element will be neutralizing Spain's talented midfield, particularly by limiting service to pivot player Patri Guijarro. While Spain is expected to dominate possession, England may be more comfortable playing in transition, a style that suits their current squad's strengths and could lead them to victory.</p>
