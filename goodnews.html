        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London-based payments platform Checkout.com has announced a share buyback initiative for its employees, establishing a new internal valuation of $12 billion. This figure represents a significant decrease from its peak valuation of $40 billion during a 2022 funding round, though it is a slight increase from a reported internal valuation of $11 billion later that year. The company, which competes with Stripe and PayPal, is using the buyback to provide liquidity for its staff. Despite the valuation drop, Checkout.com states it is on track to exceed 30% core net revenue growth this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to recent air incursions by Russia, several European Union member states are set to hold initial talks on a proposal to build a collaborative anti-drone defense system, described as a "drone wall." Officials from approximately 10 countries, primarily along the EU's eastern border, will participate in the discussions, which will also include Ukraine. The proposal gained momentum after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen advocated for the system shortly after NATO pilots intercepted Russian drones over Poland. The initiative aims to create a unified defense against the growing threat of drone warfare.</p>

          <p>High-level officials from the United States and China have agreed to increase communication channels to better manage ongoing diplomatic differences following a meeting in New York. The discussions were described as "candid, in-depth and constructive," with both sides agreeing to maintain dialogue and expand cooperation. During the meeting, China reiterated its stance on the one-China policy, urging the U.S. to uphold its commitments regarding Taiwan. This diplomatic engagement is seen as a preparatory step for a potential future summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins, Team Europe faces the significant challenge of winning on U.S. soil for the first time since 2012, with the home side having won the last five events. Key factors expected to decide the outcome include getting a fast start, managing the notoriously boisterous New York crowd, and leveraging player experience. Europe holds a distinct advantage in team experience, with 32 combined appearances to the U.S. team's 15. A strong performance in the opening foursomes session on Friday is considered crucial for Europe to silence the home fans and build momentum.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Ellie Kildunne, the star fullback for England's Red Roses, ahead of the Women's Rugby World Cup final. It traces her unconventional path, from playing on boys' teams in Keighley to briefly switching to football before finding her way back to rugby and quickly rising through the ranks. Kildunne, recently named World Rugby's Player of the Year, is celebrated for her exceptional talent, balanced running, and daring play style. Her popularity is also attributed to her passionate and ambitious personality off the pitch, where she embraces creativity and has been open about her recent ADHD diagnosis.</p>

          <h2>Takeover Speculation Around Energy Giant BP Subsides as Share Price Rises Sharply</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 01:09:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After being the subject of intense takeover speculation earlier this year, British energy major BP has seen its fortunes improve, with shares climbing over 32% since early April. This rally has quieted talk of potential acquisition by rivals like Shell or Exxon Mobil. The positive shift is attributed to a strategic reset, a new leadership team, progress in cost-cutting, and a series of successful oil discoveries. The company's stronger financial performance and rising share price have made a takeover less likely, with CEO Murray Auchincloss insisting the company is now focused on its own growth.

          <p>Former Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney has shared several amusing and strange anecdotes about his experiences playing in away matches. Speaking on his podcast, he recalled disruptive incidents like pre-game fireworks displays being set off on the hotel roof and a flooded dressing room at Sunderland caused by leaking toilets from the floor above. Rooney also noted the tactical use of temperature in dressing rooms, claiming Chelsea's was always too hot while Liverpool's at Anfield was consistently freezing. He described these as common, if odd, parts of life as a professional footballer on the road.</p>

          <p>Chinese toy company Pop Mart has stated it is pleased that the secondary market prices for its viral Labubu monster toys are declining after a period of extreme hype. At their peak, some editions were reselling for over 2,000% above retail, but prices have recently fallen as the company significantly increased production to meet demand. Pop Mart claims its goal is to make its art accessible to genuine fans, not to fuel a speculative market for scalpers. Analysts suggest the move is part of a long-term strategy to build a sustainable brand rather than being a temporary phenomenon. (not investment advice)</p>

The center will focus on three key platforms designed to improve the efficiency of cross-border transactions, enable on-chain payments, and help existing financial infrastructure integrate with blockchain technology. This move signals a significant step in China's ambition to internationalize its digital yuan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated his readiness to step down from his position after the war with Russia ends. In a recent interview, he emphasized that his primary goal is to achieve peace for his country, not to secure another term in office. When asked directly, Zelenskyy also committed to holding elections in Ukraine if a ceasefire were established. His presidential term officially would have ended in May 2024, but martial law, imposed since the 2022 invasion, currently prohibits elections from being held.</p>
