          <p>Pandora's CEO, Alexander Lacik, cautioned that U.S. tariffs on imports, particularly from Asia, could lead to widespread price increases in the affordable jewelry sector. While current tariffs are manageable, reverting to previously announced reciprocal rates would significantly impact manufacturers. Pandora, heavily reliant on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, has modeled scenarios to address potential price increases. The final consumer price adjustment will likely be industry-led, depending on tariff policies after the current pause expires in July.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers cutting interest rates, savers are contemplating whether to renew maturing CD accounts. Despite the likelihood of rate cuts, renewing CDs may still be a smart move due to the potential for the rate cut trajectory to change, the likelihood of small initial rate cuts, and the lost interest-earning opportunity if funds are moved elsewhere. While high-yield savings accounts offer comparable rates, they are variable and subject to change. A CD could still be the smart move to make for your maturing funds now.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced he will not seek the Republican nomination for Georgia Senate in 2026, a key race for control of the Senate. Kemp communicated his decision to Senate GOP leadership and President Trump, pledging to support a strong Republican nominee. Despite being a top recruiting target and polling well against incumbent Democrat Jon Ossoff, Kemp cited family reservations for his decision. The announcement leaves the GOP field open as they seek to unseat Ossoff in a closely contested state.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest homeowners considering a $100,000 HELOC should understand its advantages and potential risks. HELOCs offer the cheapest way to borrow home equity, with rates around 7.95%, lower than personal loans or credit cards. While HELOC rates are variable, they are expected to decline further if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. However, borrowers should factor in potential volatility and calculate repayments under various interest rate scenarios to ensure affordability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain steady interest rates raises questions about future mortgage rates. While the Fed doesn't directly set mortgage rates, its policies influence the broader interest rate environment. Factors like inflation trends, economic growth, and investor sentiment also play significant roles. Despite the Fed's pause, mortgage rates remain stubbornly high, near 6.9%. Experts suggest that potential homebuyers should improve their credit scores, shop around for offers, and consider options like rate buydowns to secure competitive rates.</p>

          <p>With the federal funds rate paused, homeowners are evaluating whether to pursue a home equity loan or a HELOC. While home equity loans were traditionally favored during rate pauses due to their fixed rates, experts now suggest HELOCs may be better due to potential rate cuts. The average HELOC interest rate is currently lower than home equity loans, and HELOC rates have been declining. Borrowers should consider their ability to manage variable rates and potential fluctuations when making their decision.</p>
