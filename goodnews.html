          <p>A four-year-old child sustained injuries after being bitten by a mountain lion while walking with their family on a popular trail in Olympic National Park, Washington. The child's father is being hailed as a hero for his swift actions, which observers believe saved the child's life. Following the attack, the child was treated at a trauma center and has since been released. Park rangers quickly located the collared cougar and "dispatched" the animal, assuring the public there are no further threats. This rare incident underscores the unpredictable nature of wildlife encounters in natural settings.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca announced a massive $50 billion investment in its U.S. manufacturing and research capabilities by 2030, marking its largest single global manufacturing commitment. This strategic move, which includes a new facility in Virginia for its weight management portfolio and expanded R&D across several states, is largely influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's demands for domestic manufacturing and potential tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. The company aims for half of its $80 billion annual revenue target by 2030 to come from the U.S., aligning with a broader trend of global pharma firms increasing stateside spending to navigate evolving trade policies.</p>

          <p>The small Norwegian village of Ulefoss is situated above Europe's largest known deposit of rare earth elements, potentially offering a strategic solution to the European Union's critical dependence on external suppliers, particularly China. The Rare Earths Norway (REN) mining company aims to extract an estimated nine million tons of rare earth oxides by 2030, employing an "invisible mine" approach to minimize surface impact and community disruption. If successful, this project could significantly bolster Europe's supply chain security for materials vital to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and defense sectors, thereby reducing vulnerability to global geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The development of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), often hailed as the "holy grail" of sustainable driving, is experiencing renewed momentum, with major automakers and cell producers accelerating their commercial production timelines. These advanced batteries promise significantly higher energy density, faster charging capabilities, and enhanced safety compared to conventional lithium-ion cells. The recent introduction of oxide-based semi-solid-state EVs by Chinese companies Nio and IM Motors has catalyzed this optimism. While challenges like high production costs and cell degradation persist, the industry is increasingly targeting 2027/28 for initial commercial output, often beginning with hybrid semi-solid technologies as a bridge.</p>

          <h2>Balkan Writer Challenges Publishing Industry Stereotypes About War and Tragedy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 00:00:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ana Schnabl, a writer from the Balkans, critically examines the publishing industry's tendency to expect authors from her region to focus solely on themes of war, trauma, or political issues. She recounts an encounter with a U.S. publisher who suggested her work should have "explanatory or illustrative value" regarding her cultural or historical context. Schnabl argues this expectation perpetuates a stereotype that the Balkans is a "lesser place" inherently linked to tragedy, overlooking diverse narratives about contemporary life and universal human experiences. The article advocates for publishers to embrace a broader range of voices from the region, moving beyond narrow, self-exoticizing lenses.</p>
