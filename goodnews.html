          <p>Independent movie theaters are adapting to the challenges posed by streaming services and high ticket prices by embracing creative business models. The article highlights examples like Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas, which operates as a non-profit and leverages celebrity events, and Vidiots in Los Angeles, which combines a theater with a classic video store to build community. In contrast, New York's Metrograph has found success as a for-profit venture by offering a premium, multifaceted experience including a restaurant and bookstore, demonstrating that a focus on community is key to their survival.</p>

          <p>In recognition of the U.N.'s International Day of the Girl, a collection of photographs by photojournalist Danielle Villasana is featured, celebrating the strength and perseverance of girls globally. The images capture young women in challenging circumstances, from a Venezuelan migrant girl studying math at the U.S. border to others who have faced gender-based violence and displacement. Villasana's work aims to convey the message that when provided with opportunities, education, and resources, girls and women demonstrate incredible resilience and are "unstoppable" in overcoming adversity.</p>

The article notes that this strategy has been highly successful, with the value of the positions growing by nearly 400% due to both additional purchases and soaring stock prices, reflecting a long-term commitment to these companies.

          <p>The Welsh political party Plaid Cymru has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000 if they win the next Senedd election. The policy aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by encouraging new educators, particularly in priority subjects like math and science and in Welsh-medium schools, to stay and work in Wales for at least five years. Party officials stated the goal is to match similar incentives offered in England by 2030. The proposal is part of a broader plan to raise educational standards, which also includes new literacy and numeracy schemes.</p>

          <p>Academy Award-winning actress Julia Roberts recently shared her early career struggles with insecurity and harsh criticism. In an interview, she revealed that cruel comments she received in her 20s were crippling but ultimately served as a challenge to build resilience and define the person she wanted to become. Roberts now views these early hurdles as valuable lessons that proved her own endurance. Career coaches echo this sentiment, advising young professionals to distance themselves from abrasive feedback and focus on their own value, while also looking for any "kernel of truth" that could lead to personal growth.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired a 2.5% stake in the electrical products manufacturer Atkore and is urging the company's board to explore a sale. Irenic's move comes as Atkore faces significant challenges, including a sharp decline in revenue and EBITDA from its pandemic-era highs, rising costs, and the recent unexpected retirement of its CEO. The activist firm argues that with the company at a critical inflection point, the board must consider whether remaining independent or pursuing an acquisition would provide the best outcome for shareholders.

          <h2>Exploring How to Productively Engage with the Emotion of Regret</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the nature of regret, framing it not as a purely negative emotion to be avoided but as a potential tool for self-discovery. Described as the "emotional price we pay for free will," regret often involves looking backward with a sense of loss or disappointment over past decisions. However, the piece suggests that by allowing ourselves to experience these feelings, we can learn valuable lessons about our present selves and our values. Instead of getting stuck in "what if" scenarios, engaging with regret can help inform our future choices and lead to personal growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite persistent hunger, true famines have become far less common due to major advancements in global agriculture, which is on track for a record grain harvest this year. The article attributes this success to the Green Revolution, including the development of high-yield seeds, the widespread use of synthetic fertilizers from the Haber-Bosch process, and a significant expansion of irrigated farmland. While these innovations have created a world of food abundance, challenges remain. Modern famines, like those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily caused by political failures and conflict rather than crop failures.</p>
