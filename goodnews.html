        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has dismissed a six-year plagiarism lawsuit against Pinkfong, the creators of the global hit 'Baby Shark.' US composer Jonathan Wright claimed copyright infringement, arguing his 2011 version of the folk song was substantially altered. However, the court upheld lower rulings, stating Wright's interpretation lacked sufficient originality to be protected as a separate work. This verdict confirms that Pinkfong's immensely popular 2016 rendition, streamed billions of times, is an arrangement of a public domain folk song.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BTecs, or Business and Technology Education Council qualifications, are practical courses assessed through exams, coursework, projects, and sometimes placements. Level 2 BTec Firsts are equivalent to GCSEs, while Level 3 BTec Nationals can be taken alongside or instead of A-levels. These qualifications are graded from Pass to Starred Distinction and serve as a pathway to university or direct employment, particularly popular among white working-class students. Recent government decisions have preserved funding for many key BTec courses, preventing their earlier planned scrapping.</p>

          <p>Startup Voltify, founded by Daphna Langer and Alon Kessel, seeks to transition the $80-billion U.S. freight rail industry from diesel to rechargeable batteries within a decade. Their 'VoltCars' are sodium-ion batteries designed to connect to existing locomotives, potentially saving rail companies billions and reducing emissions significantly. Despite initial industry skepticism regarding charging and power supply, Voltify is developing an algorithm to forecast energy demands and building solar-powered microgrids. The company is in active talks with major railroads for pilot projects, joining other firms like Wabtec and Siemens Mobility in the emerging battery-electric train market.</p>

          <h2>“Bleisure” Travel Trend Sees More Business Travelers Bringing Families Along</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 01:01:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend, dubbed 'bleisure' travel, sees over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, bringing family members, friends, or even pets on work trips. Motivations include reclaiming family time, combating loneliness, and significant cost savings by combining business expenses with personal leisure. While generally accepted, many employees keep these arrangements discreet from their companies due to 'policy grey zones' concerning expenses and liability. Companies that embrace this trend can see boosted morale and loyalty, provided business objectives are met and costs are clearly separated.</p>

          <p>Anchorage, Alaska, is experiencing a mix of excitement and apprehension as it prepares to host the Trump-Putin summit. Locals view Russia not as an abstract enemy but a close neighbor, leading to satirical concerns about being 'sold back' to Russia, referencing Alaska's history. While some enjoy the city's increased profile, others are wary of potential negative outcomes from the high-stakes diplomacy, especially given Putin's international arrest warrant. The summit location at a military base has somewhat dampened local engagement, yet the event sparks a range of emotions and discussions about Alaska's unique geopolitical position.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, coinciding with increased public awareness of health risks associated with even moderate drinking. This decline is particularly pronounced among young people (18-34), with 66% believing moderate drinking is harmful. Experts suggest the shift is driven by greater health knowledge, the rising popularity of alcohol-free alternatives, and economic factors impacting younger generations. Alcohol consumption among women has also seen a significant drop compared to men.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Viral photos of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like growths have sparked online speculation about 'zombie-rabbits.' Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the images are real, explaining the rabbits suffer from Shope Papilloma Virus, a relatively harmless disease. Spread by fleas, ticks, and rabbit-to-rabbit contact, the growths typically disappear as the rabbit's immune system fights the virus. The condition, primarily found in the Midwest, is believed to have inspired the mythical 'jackalope' and has contributed to scientific understanding of cancer-linked viruses. People are advised not to touch infected animals.</p>
