          <p>Authorities in Chile have handed over six luxury watches, valued at $125,000, to the FBI, which will be returned to actor Keanu Reeves. The timepieces were stolen from Reeves' Hollywood Hills home in December 2023 during a series of high-profile burglaries. The watches were discovered during police raids in Santiago, Chile, which also uncovered a range of other stolen luxury goods. The recovery is part of a broader investigation into South American crime groups targeting affluent homes in the United States, with Chilean police having arrested 23 citizens linked to the burglaries.</p>

Streeting has indicated that the new discussions will focus on improving working conditions rather than increasing the latest pay offer. While expressing disappointment over the strike's impact on patients, the health secretary's offer to meet was accepted by the union, which hopes for a more tangible settlement offer this time.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. In a notable bipartisan move, Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined with Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to pass the bill with an 8-7 vote. The legislation, now called the Honest Act, aims to prevent potential conflicts of interest and has drawn both support and criticism from within the Republican party. Its future remains uncertain as it awaits a potential vote on the full Senate floor.</p>

In her statement, Harris indicated that her public service would not be in elected office for now, but she plans to remain politically active and help elect Democrats. This move allows other potential Democratic candidates to formally launch their campaigns for the state's top office.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing ongoing uncertainty in the economic outlook, particularly regarding the impact of tariffs. The decision was not unanimous, with two FOMC members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that while the economy remains in good shape, the central bank is adopting a cautious "wait-and-see" approach. This hold on rates comes despite pressure from President Trump for the Fed to implement cuts to stimulate the economy further. (not investment advice)</p>

The 22-year-old Slovenian international, often compared to Erling Haaland, has impressed with his goal-scoring record, physicality, and all-around play in the Bundesliga. Despite being under a long-term contract, reports suggest an informal agreement could allow him to leave for a fee around £70 million. With his combination of size, speed, and clinical finishing, Sesko is considered one of Europe's most promising young forwards, making a high-profile move seem imminent.</p>
