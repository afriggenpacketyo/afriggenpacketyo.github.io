          <p>A virologist from the University of Nottingham advises the public to remain calm following the detection of West Nile virus fragments in UK mosquitoes, stating that mosquito-borne diseases are likely to increase in range due to climate change. While there have been no human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus in the UK to date, the expert emphasizes the need for awareness and preventative measures such as avoiding mosquito bites. Surveillance projects are underway to monitor mosquito activity across Britain, and the public is encouraged to cover up and use insecticide to minimize risk.</p>
