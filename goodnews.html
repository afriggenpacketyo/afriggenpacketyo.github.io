          <p>In a highly unusual arrangement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the federal government 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China. This agreement was a condition for receiving export licenses, which were granted after being restricted earlier in the year. President Trump confirmed he personally negotiated the deal with Nvidia's CEO, stating the revenue would benefit the country, allowing the companies to compete in the critical Chinese market.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the market's muted reaction to the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of their AI chip sales to China. Investors appear to view the arrangement as a net positive, as securing access to the massive Chinese market is considered more valuable than being completely shut out by export controls. The ability to compete in China, even with a revenue haircut, is seen as preferable to ceding the entire market to local competitors like Huawei. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision, confirmed by a White House official, provides more time for negotiation following recent talks in Stockholm.

While the president cannot unilaterally enact the change, his public consideration of the issue has fueled optimism for a major policy shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump offered his account of the deal allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, stating he initially sought a 20% revenue share but agreed to 15% after direct negotiations with CEO Jensen Huang. He downplayed national security concerns by describing the approved H20 chip as "obsolete" and claiming that China already possesses similar technology.

The author contends that a ruling against drawing congressional districts based on race would actually align with the Act's original, color-blind intent. The argument is that the law was designed to protect an individual's right to vote, not to create guaranteed safe seats for politicians of a particular race.</p>
