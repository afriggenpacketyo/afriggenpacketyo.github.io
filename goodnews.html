          <p>The S&P 500 is approaching a record high, completing a significant turnaround after a sharp decline in April following new tariff announcements. Analysts attribute the market's strong rebound to several factors, including easing investor concerns about trade disputes as negotiations enter a quieter phase. Optimism around technology stocks, particularly AI-related companies like Nvidia, has also been a major driver of the rally. Furthermore, investor sentiment has been buoyed by signals from the Federal Reserve that it may implement two interest rate cuts later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea has inaugurated the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone, a massive new resort that state media claims will launch a new era for its tourism industry. Leader Kim Jong Un attended the opening ceremony for the site, which will initially only be open to domestic visitors starting next week. The project is a key part of Kim's effort to boost the nation's struggling economy, but it opens while the country remains largely closed to foreign visitors due to pandemic-era restrictions. Russian officials have indicated their citizens will be the first foreign tourists to visit in July.</p>

Pritzker also criticized President Trump's policies on tariffs and immigration while outlining future goals for education, housing affordability, and mental healthcare.

          <p>A coalition of 23 environmental organizations, cities, and tribes has filed a first-of-its-kind class-action lawsuit against the EPA and its administrator, Lee Zeldin. The suit alleges that the agency illegally terminated approximately $3 billion in environmental and climate justice grants that were awarded during the previous administration. These grants were intended to fund local projects addressing pollution and climate impacts in vulnerable communities. The plaintiffs argue the funds were canceled without legal justification, and they are seeking to have the funding for all 350 impacted grant recipients restored through this collective legal action.</p>

State media has increasingly used honorific titles like "respected" to describe her, and her appearances have often been linked to significant state events.

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images providing evidence of a previously undiscovered exoplanet. The planet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be roughly the mass of Saturn and orbits a young star. Detecting such planets is typically challenging, but scientists successfully used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph to suppress the star's bright glare and reveal the faint object. While a small possibility remains that it could be a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly points toward it being a planet.</p>

The court ruled that her actions were not criminal because the documents she accessed were publicly available court records.

The Senate parliamentarian has ruled that several key provisions, including a plan to cut Medicaid funding to pay for new spending, violate Senate rules and would require a 60-vote threshold.
