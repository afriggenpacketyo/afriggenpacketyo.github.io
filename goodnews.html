        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scams that falsely claim artificial intelligence can predict questions for the national college entrance examination (gaokao). The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly launched a campaign to investigate and eliminate illegal and harmful information related to the exams. Mock papers and private tutors are allegedly using AI as a gimmick to attract students and parents, selling simulated test questions and reference materials at inflated prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government's initiative to sell stockpiled rice directly to retailers has resulted in cheaper rice becoming available to consumers. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. began selling the rice at a reduced price, leading to high demand and quick sell-outs. The government's effort aims to lower soaring rice prices affecting households, with 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 being offered through direct contracts with retailers. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes this approach will effectively curb rice prices.</p>

In his absence, Miguel Rojas will take over at shortstop, with Tommy Edman and Hyeseong Kim also being options.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel Corp. as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, supporting the Japanese company's $14 billion investment. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain under American control. He also announced plans to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50%, citing national security concerns. While Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, Trump's remarks suggest a potential partnership rather than a full buyout. (not investment advice)</p>
