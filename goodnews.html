          <p>Authorities in Los Angeles are investigating a smash-and-grab burglary at Solestage, a high-end sneaker and streetwear store on North Fairfax Avenue. Suspects used a stolen blue Toyota Camry to ram into the store around 5 a.m. on Friday, after which the suspects fled the scene. The LAPD is seeking information from the public regarding the suspects involved in the incident, but details regarding the items stolen from the store are currently unclear. Solestage is known for selling exclusive and expensive brands, including Supreme and Louis Vuitton, with some items costing thousands of dollars.</p>

          <p>Theresa Fortune, an Oakland mother, is using art to share her journey through postpartum depression, a condition that disproportionately affects women of color. After contemplating suicide, Fortune turned to photography and collage to tell her story, culminating in a piece called "Womban of the Earth," which depicts a Black mother giving birth. Her work caught the attention of Kaiser Permanente, where a major piece of her art is now permanently displayed. Fortune hopes her story will inspire others facing mental health challenges to seek help and find their own path to healing.</p>

          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a hiker who went missing for weeks in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, recounted her survival story, explaining that she was trapped by an avalanche and later immobilized by a fall. Slaton said she survived by eating wild leeks and melting snow for water after running out of food. Despite numerous attempts to call 911, she was unsuccessful, but her GPS led her to a cabin where she was eventually found by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort. Slaton, a nutritionist and archery teacher, said her foraging skills and resilience helped her endure the terrifying experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic activity, including business deals in the Gulf, lifting sanctions on Syria, negotiating the release of a U.S. citizen, and claiming credit for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, suggests a foreign policy focused on trade over war. Trump's approach emphasizes mercantilism and downplays ideology, as seen in his speech in Riyadh advocating for "commerce not chaos." However, his decisions, such as lifting sanctions on Syria, have surprised even those within his own administration and have faced criticism for a lack of consistency and potential negative consequences.</p>

          <p>Tyrrell Hatton is likely to be fined after a profanity-laced outburst during the second round of the US PGA Championship. After hitting a drive into a water hazard, Hatton unleashed a tirade, expressing his frustration with his driver. Jhonattan Vegas leads the tournament, but faces a tough challenge to maintain his position. Rory McIlroy made the cut despite a poor finish, and there are reports he had to change his driver head earlier in the week. Other players, including Matthieu Pavon, Matt Fitzpatrick, and Scottie Scheffler, are also in contention.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin angler fishing in Lake Michigan discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat that sank in 1923, state officials announced. Christopher Thuss found the wreck in shallow water near Manitowoc. The J.C. Ames, built in 1881, was a powerful tug used for moving lumber and railway cars. The ship was buried in sand for decades before recent storms exposed it. The discovery highlights the ongoing efforts to locate and document shipwrecks in the Great Lakes before invasive quagga mussels destroy them.</p>
