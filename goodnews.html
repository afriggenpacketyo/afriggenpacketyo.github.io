          <p>Chinese smartphone maker Honor is moving forward with plans for an initial public offering (IPO) on mainland China's A-share market. The company has officially filed its pre-IPO guidance with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, a mandatory step for listing. This move coincides with a perceived recovery in the A-share market, which has seen increased activity in the second quarter. According to consulting firm Deloitte, regulatory efforts to boost market confidence and improve the quality of IPO candidates are showing positive results, creating a more favorable environment for companies like Honor to go public.

          <p>NATO is increasing its engagement with the commercial space industry, supported by a new strategy and a pledge from member nations to significantly boost defense spending.

This follows NATO's 2019 recognition of space as an operational domain, creating new opportunities for commercial companies in satellite communication, navigation, and surveillance.

          <p>A collaborative team of Chinese researchers has developed a "digital embryo," a high-resolution spatiotemporal atlas that maps early organogenesis in primate embryos. This breakthrough provides a powerful tool for understanding the complex processes of embryonic development, where a single fertilized egg differentiates into hundreds of cell types to form tissues and organs. Published in the journal *Cell*, the research aims to decode how developmental abnormalities occur, which could lead to new insights into the origins of various diseases. The model is considered a significant step in revealing the fundamental secrets of life.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, economists argued that for China to achieve long-term prosperity, it must shift from a production-based to a consumption-driven economy. Professor Jin Keyu of HKUST noted that China's focus on subsidizing production creates trade imbalances and global friction. To harmonize its international relationships and unlock further growth, China needs to stimulate internal demand. The experts suggested that opportunities lie in developing the services sector and that local governments should be incentivized to prioritize consumption as a key metric of economic success.

          <p>Microsoft is officially retiring its infamous "Blue Screen of Death," the error message that has signaled critical system failures on Windows for over four decades. The company announced that the notorious screen will now be black, part of a wider effort to improve system resilience and streamline the user experience during unexpected restarts. The new error screen features more condensed text and a percentage counter for the restart process, removing the frowny-face icon. This change, available on Windows 11 later this summer, was prompted in part by the 2024 Crowdstrike incident.</p>
