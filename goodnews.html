          <p>The U.S. is set to auction the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht seized from a sanctioned Russian billionaire in 2022 as part of a task force targeting oligarchs. The vessel, which features a helipad and a pool, will be sold via sealed bids, with potential buyers required to have a net worth of at least $500 million and provide a $10 million deposit. The Justice Department asserts the yacht is owned by gold magnate Suleiman Kerimov, though a holding company claims it belongs to a non-sanctioned individual. The owner's lawyer has warned that any sale will be legally challenged, creating uncertainty for potential buyers.</p>

          <p>A large-scale evacuation was initiated in Dresden's Old Town after an unexploded World War II bomb was found during construction work. Approximately 17,000 people were instructed to leave their homes while experts worked to defuse the 250-kilogram British-made bomb. The discovery was made near the Carola Bridge, which is scheduled for demolition, and the evacuation zone included the historic Frauenkirche church. Such finds are still common in Germany, highlighting the lingering dangers of the war, with a similar large-scale evacuation having occurred in Cologne in June for the same reason.</p>

          <p>ESPN has finalized two significant deals, acquiring the NFL Network and securing exclusive U.S. rights for all WWE Premium Live Events starting in 2026. Under the non-binding agreement with the NFL, the league will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, a move that still requires final approval. These strategic content acquisitions were announced as parent company Disney reported a strong third quarter, with profits doubling year-over-year, driven by streaming growth and theme park performance.

A White House official stated the initiative aims to reshore the production of critical components, bolstering both economic and national security.

          <p>For retirees on a fixed income, accessing home equity is a key financial strategy, with two primary options: selling the home or obtaining a reverse mortgage. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to convert equity into cash without a monthly payment, which can help cover rising living costs, but it reduces the inheritance left to heirs and comes with its own fees and risks. Selling the home provides a lump sum of cash but means leaving a familiar property and navigating a potentially challenging housing market. Experts advise that a reverse mortgage is best for those who wish to stay in their home and need supplemental income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>E-commerce platform Shopify saw its stock price jump by 20% after reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. The company also provided a strong forecast for the third quarter, projecting revenue growth in the "mid-to-high twenties percentage rate," suggesting it has effectively navigated concerns about a potential economic slowdown. According to the CFO, a feared negative impact from U.S. tariffs "did not materialize," and the company has not seen any drop in U.S. demand. The positive results were driven by a 29% year-over-year increase in gross merchandise volume, indicating robust sales activity across its merchant platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This long-form article details the author's experience attending a free class for nervous fliers taught by a former commercial pilot, "Captain Ron." The author, who developed a fear of flying after a turbulent flight, joined others with similar anxieties to learn about the mechanics of aviation and cognitive strategies to manage panic. The class included a session on a stationary airplane, where attendees learned breathing techniques and other coping mechanisms. While the class did not completely cure the author's fear, it provided new tools and a sense of community, reframing the anxiety as a manageable challenge rather than a personal failing.</p>

          <p>McDonald's exceeded Wall Street's quarterly expectations for earnings and revenue, driven by a 2.5% increase in U.S. same-store sales, which reversed two quarters of decline. Promotions like a "Minecraft" movie tie-in and the return of Snack Wraps helped boost performance. However, CEO Chris Kempczinski expressed concern about the financial health of low-income consumers, noting that their visits to restaurants industry-wide have declined significantly. The company is working on making its core menu more affordable to re-engage this critical customer base, acknowledging a "bifurcated" consumer environment where international markets are showing stronger growth.

          <p>Firefighters in Ashcroft, British Columbia, have identified an unusual cause for a recent wildfire: a fish dropped by a bird onto a power line. Investigators believe an osprey caught the fish from a nearby river and, while in flight, dropped its meal onto the electrical wires. The resulting sparks ignited the dry grass below, leading to a "heavy fire" that required approximately 4,800 gallons of water to extinguish. The fire department confirmed that the fish was found charred at the scene and joked on social media that the osprey, which was unharmed, was a "flight risk" and had been held for questioning.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Iran and Pakistan have agreed to enhance their bilateral relationship, with a goal to increase trade to $10 billion and bolster security cooperation. The partnership focuses on addressing shared challenges from militant groups operating along their 900-kilometer border in the Balochistan region. Despite occasional tensions, the relationship is largely amicable, with Pakistan recently supporting Iran during its conflict with Israel. The article notes that while Tehran views Islamabad as a strategic partner, Pakistan's growing ties with the United States could introduce a complex dynamic, though experts believe Pakistan will continue to avoid direct military alignment against Iran.</p>
