          <p>This article provides firsthand accounts from Robert Violante and Carl Denaro, two survivors of attacks by the serial killer David Berkowitz, known as the "Son of Sam." Violante was shot on his first date, losing his sight but surviving, while his date Stacy Moskowitz died from her injuries. Denaro was also shot and seriously wounded months earlier, with doctors placing a metal plate in his head. Both men reflect on how the 1970s attacks irrevocably changed their lives, the terror that gripped New York City, and their relief upon Berkowitz's eventual arrest.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes competition is underway at the New Orleans Saints training camp, where two Australian punters are vying for one lucrative NFL contract. Incumbent punter Matt Hayball is facing a challenge from rookie James Burnip, both graduates of the ProKick Australia academy, which funnels former Australian rules football players into American football. This continues a trend for the Saints, who have favored rookie punters in recent years. Despite the cutthroat nature of the competition for the single roster spot, both athletes maintain a friendly and supportive camaraderie while competing for their NFL dream.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first start since a shoulder injury early in the season, Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a sharp performance, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his return was spoiled by two home runs from Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, who capitalized on the short right-field wall at the team's temporary ballpark. The Dodgers ultimately lost 4-0, but Snell's outing was seen as an encouraging sign for the team's late-season rotation depth. He demonstrated good control and velocity, offering hope that he can be a key contributor for the team's championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>At a ceremony in Bucharest, Romanian officials, including new President Nicusor Dan, commemorated the European Day of Remembrance for the Genocide of Sinti and Roma. The event highlighted the need for Romania to grapple with its history, particularly the deportation of over 25,000 Roma to their deaths during World War II under the regime of Ion Antonescu. Speakers emphasized that the commemoration is also a warning against modern-day racism and hate speech, calling for better enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. The presence of high-level officials signals a shift towards openly acknowledging this dark chapter of the nation's past.</p>

          <p>Ten years after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has transformed from a niche experiment into a foundational pillar of the modern financial system, now valued at over $420 billion. Initially conceived as a platform for programmable money and smart contracts, it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and trillions of dollars in stablecoin transactions. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are increasingly building on Ethereum's infrastructure, valuing its stability and dependability. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on this growth while cautioning against the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption accelerates.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team concluded day three of the fifth Test against India at 50-1, chasing a formidable target of 374 runs to win the match and the series. The hosts made steady progress until opener Zak Crawley was dismissed by Mohammed Siraj on the penultimate ball of the day. Earlier, India built a strong lead by scoring 396 in their second innings, largely thanks to a sublime 118 from Yashasvi Jaiswal and a surprise maiden fifty from Akash Deep. A victory for England would require the highest-ever successful Test chase at The Oval.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are turning to TikTok as a primary source for news, favoring short, engaging videos from content creators over traditional media outlets. This article examines the trend, profiling "newsfluencers" like Aaron Parnas who deliver rapid-fire updates, and noting the rise of news skits and meme-based content to explain current events. While users value the convenience and simplified terms, the platform's algorithm-driven feed and the potential for misinformation raise questions about the quality and accuracy of the information being consumed. The phenomenon challenges traditional definitions of news and journalism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted the Trump administration's sweeping ban on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled that while the administration can continue to deny discretionary asylum, it cannot use the president's proclamation to suspend laws that protect migrants from being deported to countries where they would face torture or persecution. These protections, known as "withholding of removal," have a higher legal threshold but are mandatory. The ruling limits the administration's ability to summarily expel all migrants without hearing claims for certain humanitarian protections.</p>

          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area based on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The court agreed that using such broad profiles to detain individuals violates the Constitution's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over raids conducted by the Trump administration that sparked widespread fear and protests. This decision affirms that agents must have reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country illegally before making a stop.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses rugby team achieved a commanding 97-7 victory against Spain, running in 15 tries in a one-sided match. However, the win was overshadowed by a red card issued to captain Marlie Packer in the second half for a clumsy clearout. The incident means Packer may miss some of England's initial pool-stage matches at the upcoming Rugby World Cup, pending a disciplinary review. Despite the captain's dismissal, England's performance demonstrated their overwhelming strength as they continue preparations to be tournament favorites, with one final warm-up match against France remaining.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's independent anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO, have exposed a significant corruption scheme involving the procurement of military drones and jamming systems at inflated prices. A sitting lawmaker, local officials, and national guard personnel were allegedly caught taking kickbacks of up to 30% on state contracts. This announcement comes just two days after the agencies' independence was restored by parliament following massive public protests against a government attempt to bring them under state control. The move to uncover graft is seen as a critical step in Ukraine's fight against corruption.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the efforts of organizations like Black People Will Swim, which are working to teach swimming to Black children and adults, addressing a legacy of aquatic segregation. Due to historical exclusion from public pools, a significant racial disparity in swimming ability and drowning rates persists in the U.S., with Black children being far more likely to drown than their white peers. The story follows an adult learner and showcases how providing access and instruction can create a ripple effect, empowering communities and tackling what advocates call a public health crisis.</p>
