          <p>American sprinter Melissa Jefferson-Wooden secured her first world title in the 100-meter race in Tokyo, finishing with a remarkable time of 10.61 seconds. This performance not only set a new championship record but also established the 24-year-old as the fourth-fastest woman in history. Her victory marks a significant comeback after an injury-plagued 2024 season and concludes a dominant year in women's sprinting. The event also celebrated the career of 38-year-old Jamaican legend Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who competed in her final world championship.</p>

Griffin sided with the family, stating that once the fan dropped the ball, she forfeited her claim to it. He also shared a personal story about his oddest fan interaction during his Heisman Trophy ceremony, where a man who appeared to be in a wheelchair to get an autograph was later seen walking freely.

          <p>France advanced to the Rugby World Cup semi-finals after overcoming a 13-0 halftime deficit to defeat Ireland 18-13 in a tense quarter-final match. Ireland dominated the first half, scoring two tries, but failed to capitalize further despite France receiving two yellow cards. In the second half, France scored 18 unanswered points, with a decisive long-range try from Joanna Grisez sealing the victory. The loss ends Ireland's hopes of reaching their first World Cup semi-final since 2014, continuing their winless streak against the French side since 2017.</p>

          <p>The Art Institute of Chicago is hosting a new exhibition, "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," offering a fresh perspective on the lesser-known French Impressionist painter. While Caillebotte is famous for his work "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the exhibition highlights his unconventional focus on male subjects, which often scandalized the 19th-century art establishment. The show explores themes of masculinity and sensuousness in his paintings, such as "The Floor Scrapers." Curators aim to re-integrate Caillebotte into the Impressionist narrative, allowing his art to be interpreted through a modern lens beyond the controversy it once generated.</p>

In a recent interview, Wayans reflected on his career, his upbringing in a comedy dynasty, and how he now channels personal loss and grief into his acting. He explained that the recent passing of his mother and other relatives has given him a deeper emotional well to draw from, making his dramatic performances more authentic.

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents devastated by the recent Eaton fire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support local businesses struggling with a drop in sales. The group, founded by a resident who lost her home, organizes weekly gatherings at different restaurants, providing a vital economic boost and a space for community connection. For many members, the club offers a unique form of collective healing, allowing them to share their experiences of loss and recovery with others who understand. The initiative serves as a model for post-disaster community resilience, fostering both economic recovery and personal bonds.</p>

          <p>Fragments of a historic shipwreck, believed to date back to the 1800s or earlier, have been discovered on Matanzas Beach in St. Johns County, Florida. County Beach Services staff found large timbers along the shoreline, which were later confirmed to be from a shipwreck by the St. Augustine Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP). To preserve the artifacts from sun damage and potential theft, one of the timbers was carefully reburied under wet sand. Researchers have documented the find using GPS and photogrammetry to create a 3D model for future study of Florida's maritime history.</p>

          <p>A feature based on historian Jill Lepore's new book, "We the People," explores the U.S. Constitution not as a static relic but as a framework designed to be amended and adapted over time. The article highlights that the founders expected the document to be constantly revised, with the Bill of Rights itself being a result of over 200 proposed amendments from the states. Experts note that while formal amendments have become rare, the Supreme Court's changing interpretations continue to shape the law. They worry, however, that the current political climate has weakened the intended checks and balances.</p>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its use of artificial intelligence with "Hear the Highlights," a feature that provides short, AI-voiced audio summaries of products. The AI model synthesizes information from product catalogs, web data, and the vast number of customer reviews to create these clips. While this could help shoppers navigate thousands of comments, critics worry that AI-generated summaries may lose the nuance, context, and specific personal insights found in human reviews. There are also concerns that the tool could inadvertently blend marketing language with genuine user feedback, potentially misleading consumers.</p>

          <p>To prepare for the anticipated hostile crowd at the upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage in New York, the European team is using a novel training method: virtual reality headsets that simulate heckling and abuse. Rory McIlroy revealed that captain Luke Donald provided the equipment to help players desensitize themselves to the intense pressure and noise they will face on American soil. McIlroy confirmed he encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want," though he declined to share the specific insults used. The innovative approach underscores the team's detailed preparations for their title defense.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, experts are weighing in on the key storylines and potential outcomes, with many predicting a championship victory for the Minnesota Lynx. The team is seen as being on a "revenge tour" after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals. Led by likely MVP Napheesa Collier, the Lynx boast the league's top defense and strong chemistry. Other contenders include the Las Vegas Aces, who are on a 16-game winning streak, and the defending champion New York Liberty. The absence of rookies Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark is noted as both a loss for rivalries and a chance for other stars to shine.</p>

          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending three technology stocks—Broadcom (AVGO), Zscaler (ZS), and Oracle (ORCL)—as strong long-term investments, citing their significant potential from the artificial intelligence boom. Broadcom's outlook is bolstered by accelerating AI-related demand and a new $10 billion customer, believed to be OpenAI. Cybersecurity firm Zscaler is showing robust growth driven by its Zero-Trust portfolio, while Oracle's stock surged after reporting a massive 359% increase in its contracted revenue backlog, largely due to major cloud and AI deals.

          <p>High-level trade delegations from the United States and China have begun their fourth round of face-to-face talks in Madrid, Spain. The meeting aims to address the escalating trade disagreements that have intensified since U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his tariff war earlier in the year. The negotiations, led by key representatives from both nations, are taking place at the Spanish foreign ministry.

          <p>Amid declining popularity for the UK's Labour government, political analysts are looking to the success of Zohran Mamdani, a progressive Democratic mayoral candidate in New York, for potential lessons. Mamdani's people-powered campaign has resonated with voters through a sharp focus on economic issues like affordability, housing, and a higher minimum wage. Experts suggest Labour could learn from his strategy of championing clear, compelling policies and crafting an overarching narrative that picks a side and connects with voters' lived experiences. His savvy use of social media is also highlighted as a key factor.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable act of bravery, doctors at the Kyiv Heart Institute performed a life-saving heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl, Kira Skliarova, during one of the most intense Russian missile attacks on the city. The surgical team, led by Dr. Borys Todurov, drove through explosions to retrieve the donor heart from a 4-year-old who had died in an accident. They then successfully completed the transplant surgery as the hospital building shook from nearby blasts. Kira, whose own heart was severely weakened by illness, is now recovering and has a chance for a full life.</p>
