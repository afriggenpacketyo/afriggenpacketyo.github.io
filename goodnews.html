          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. The creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," was about the length of an index finger and had a circular mouth lined with teeth. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period and reveals that Mosura was more complex than previously known radiodonts. The fossil showed the Mosura's open circulatory system and segmented body, indicating specialized functions. </p>

          <p>John McWhorter reflects on the history of Black America, prompted by President Trump's criticism of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. He contrasts the museum's modern approach with earlier historical narratives that focused on overcoming and integration. McWhorter praises the museum's abundance, nuance, and ability to bring the past to life. He also argues that Black history should acknowledge both tragedies and triumphs, while criticizing attempts to force the country back to an earlier, more willfully oblivious era. </p>
