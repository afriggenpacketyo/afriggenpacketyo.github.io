          <h2>China Reveals New Military Drone with Vertical Take-Off and Landing Capabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled a new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the drone demonstrated advanced autonomous capabilities, including target allocation and threat avoidance, during a recent test in Sichuan province. This design allows it to operate without a runway, providing significant tactical flexibility for reconnaissance and situational awareness missions in rugged terrain. With a 2.6-meter wingspan, the drone's design resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, enabling faster flight than a quadcopter.</p>

          <h2>FDA Authorizes Juul to Continue Selling Tobacco and Menthol E-Cigarettes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 21:09:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed a previous ban, now permitting Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market. The agency concluded that Juul's products can benefit public health by helping adult smokers switch from more harmful traditional cigarettes. This decision comes after years of controversy and lawsuits blaming the company for fueling the teen vaping crisis. Anti-tobacco advocates have criticized the move, while Juul's CEO called it an important milestone, emphasizing the need for regulated options for adult smokers seeking alternatives to combustible tobacco.</p>

          <h2>USDC Stablecoin Usage Surges Over 330% Amid European Regulatory Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 21:01:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stablecoin USDC has seen its usage in crypto payments increase by 337% in the first half of 2025, largely driven by new European regulations that caused payment processors to phase out support for its competitor, Tether (USDT). According to a CoinGate report, this shift highlights a growing preference among businesses for regulatory-compliant digital assets, with USDC now dominating crypto payouts. The report also notes Bitcoin's continued relevance in commerce and the significant growth of Layer-2 networks like Polygon, which are making crypto transactions faster and cheaper.

          <h2>Homeland Security Secretary Hints at Potential Changes to TSA's Liquid Restrictions</h2>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its rules regarding liquids in carry-on luggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the size requirements for liquids could be the next policy to change. This follows the recent elimination of the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, enhancing security while potentially allowing for more relaxed rules.</p>

          <h2>Scientists to Analyze 1.5-Million-Year-Old Ice Core to Uncover Climate History</h2>

          <p>An ice core, believed to be the oldest ever recovered at 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey for analysis. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the sample contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that hold crucial information about Earth's past climate. Scientists will melt the ice to study its chemical composition, hoping to understand a mysterious shift in the planet's glacial cycles known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. This research could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and provide insights into how our planet might respond to current warming trends.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases to 3.3% in June as Rice Prices Cool</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:16:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly due to a slight decline in the rapid rise of rice prices, which had surged following poor harvests. Despite the cooling, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates. However, concerns over economic growth, potentially hindered by U.S. tariffs, complicate the bank's policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New regulations in the United Kingdom, set to take effect next July, will require 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority, aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and facing unexpected late fees. As a result, some users may be denied this form of credit. The new rules will bring the largely unregulated BNPL sector more in line with other forms of lending, providing consumers with rights to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and clearer information about their agreements.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison has pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of "wet reckless driving," avoiding jail time for a 2024 DUI citation. The former USC star was arrested after a highway patrol officer found him asleep at the wheel of a Rolls-Royce blocking traffic near LAX. As part of the plea deal, Addison was sentenced to 12 months of probation, a $390 fine, and must complete two online courses. The original misdemeanor drunk-driving charges were dismissed, though the incident remains under review by the NFL for potential disciplinary action.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the unanimous approval required from all 27 member states due to concerns about a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including measures to further restrict oil and gas revenue and cut more banks from the SWIFT system.</p>
