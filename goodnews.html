          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully created and tested an artillery-launched drone system after 12 years of overcoming technical challenges. The drones, designed to be launched from a 155mm cannon, can withstand forces exceeding 3,000 times their weight. The advance relies on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism that separates the drone from its artillery shell mid-flight without electronic controls. Led by Huang Yunluan, the team stated that these drones can travel over 10 kilometers in seconds, conserve power, and extend loiter time, marking a significant advancement in military drone technology. The project, initially proposed in 2013, has now moved from concept to practical application.</p>

          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant increase after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35 billion euro capital raise, primarily supported by the French state. This capital injection, along with debt refinancing, will bolster Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following this move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding nearly 30% of the capital and voting rights, positioning Eutelsat strategically within the European Union and NATO for military communications, cyber-resilience, and secure government connectivity. Emmanuel Macron highlighted the move as ensuring France's strategic independence and paving the way for Europe's autonomy.</p>

Population increases were mainly concentrated in western states, while eastern states experienced a decline, and the number of foreign nationals living in Germany rose to 12.4 million.

          <p>Archaeologists in London have unearthed an extensive collection of painted Roman wall plaster at a demolition site, providing insights into ancient Londinium's artistic sophistication. Thousands of vibrant fragments, found discarded in a pit, were meticulously reassembled by the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA). The recovered artworks depict bright yellow panel designs, adorned with motifs of birds, fruit, flowers, and lyres, and include the first known example of a painter's signature in Roman Britain. The discovery offers a unique opportunity to study Roman domestic art and the lives of its inhabitants, with plans for eventual public display.</p>

          <p>The sale of the Los Angeles Lakers for $10 billion, a record for a sports franchise, highlights the growing trend of sports teams becoming too valuable for individual owners. The shift from family ownership to investment groups, led by Mark Walter, reflects the increasing financial demands of owning major sports properties. While the decline of cable poses a threat, the Lakers' strong connection to Los Angeles ensures continued growth and profitability, making the investment a sound one. The new ownership model raises questions about accountability for teams not as successful as the Lakers, potentially allowing for exploitation without public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A new study challenges the long-held theory that birds sing at dawn due to better acoustic transmission conditions, such as increased humidity and reduced wind. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little support for the 'acoustic transmission hypothesis'. Instead, the study suggests that early morning vocal activity relates to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night and communicating about finding food. The researchers did find relationships between birds who were more territorial and those with an omnivorous diet, with these birds being more vocal at dawn.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactively building supply chain resilience in response to China's dominance in rare earth minerals. Following China's 2010 export ban on rare earths, Japan diversified its sources, investing in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas, and reducing its dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. While Japan has made progress, it still relies on China for heavy rare earth elements, highlighting the challenges of escaping China's mineral orbit. Western nations are looking to Japan's approach as a template for securing their own critical mineral supplies, especially as demand for these minerals grows with the clean energy transition.

          <p>Tennis star Jannik Sinner has collaborated with Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli to release a song called 'Polvere e Gloria' (Dust and Glory). The song features Sinner repeating parts of his winning and losing speeches, and the music video includes scenes from the recording session and childhood images of both artists. Bocelli, who has previously been involved in sports-related performances, expressed his honor in working with Sinner. Sinner is the first Italian to reach the top of the men's tennis rankings and has won the US Open and Australian Open titles.</p>
