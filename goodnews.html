          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Exceeds Expectations in April</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 02:28:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK government borrowing was higher than expected in April, reaching ¬£20.2 billion, a ¬£1 billion increase from the previous year. This figure surpasses analysts' predictions of ¬£17.9 billion. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), this is the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993. The increase in borrowing reflects the difference between government spending and tax income during the month.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000 before slightly retracting. According to James Butterfill, this surge is driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and sustained interest from institutional buyers. The price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues related to ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's weakness against the dollar should no longer be a point of contention in tariff talks. Both parties reaffirmed that exchange rates should be market-determined. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy and financial markets.</p>
