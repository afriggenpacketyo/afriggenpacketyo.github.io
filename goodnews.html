          <p>In a complex economic environment with recent interest rate cuts but rising inflation, savers are seeking stable, short-term investment options. This article analyzes the potential earnings from a six-month certificate of deposit (CD), highlighting its benefits of fixed rates and FDIC insurance. It provides specific calculations for various deposit amounts, such as a $10,000 deposit earning approximately $212 over six months at a 4.30% rate. This presents a secure, if modest, way to grow savings while maintaining flexibility for the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed a free-floating "rogue planet," named Cha 1107-7626, consuming gas and dust from its surrounding disc at a record-breaking rate of six billion tons per second. This young, Jupiter-sized object, located about 620 light-years away, is exhibiting behaviors previously seen only in stars, such as magnetic activity driving its growth. The discovery challenges traditional distinctions between how planets and stars form, suggesting some planetary-mass objects may develop through processes similar to stellar formation, offering new insights into the early stages of celestial bodies.</p>

          <p>This article profiles the success of Carlos Cruz, who left El Salvador in 1979 and built a thriving restaurant empire in Baltimore from the ground up. After starting his career as a dishwasher, Cruz's passion for the industry led him to open three popular establishments, including Bayside Cantina and Chilango's. His culinary skills have even earned him the job of feeding the Baltimore Orioles, and he credits his success to hard work and the values of honesty and respect instilled by his parents.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO score, has unveiled a new pricing model that will allow it to license credit scores directly to mortgage resellers, potentially bypassing the major credit bureaus. This change is intended to eliminate markups and give lenders more choice, which could ultimately lower costs. The announcement triggered a more than 20% surge in Fair Isaac's stock price, while shares for credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax declined on concerns that their role in the mortgage industry could be diminished.</p>

          <p>Tesla has reported a 7% year-over-year increase in its third-quarter vehicle deliveries, reaching 497,099 units, a figure that exceeded many analysts' expectations. The growth was partly fueled by a rush of U.S. consumers purchasing vehicles before a key federal tax credit for electric vehicles expired. Despite the strong delivery numbers, the company's vehicle production for the quarter saw a slight decline compared to the same period in the previous year, reflecting ongoing operational adjustments.

          <p>The Premier League is actively considering replacing its current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), which have been criticized for limiting club investment by capping losses at £105 million over three years. Chief executive Richard Masters confirmed that discussions are underway for an alternative system, likely a squad cost ratio (SCR) model similar to UEFA's regulations. This new approach would tie club spending on wages and transfers to a percentage of their total revenue, aiming for greater alignment with European financial controls.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the world's happiest country, a distinction that experts attribute to high levels of life satisfaction rather than constant joy. The World Happiness Report's findings reflect a society with strong social support systems, high levels of public trust, and universal access to services like education and healthcare. This societal contentment is further bolstered by a deep cultural connection to nature and traditions such as the ubiquitous sauna, all contributing to a sustained sense of well-being among its citizens.</p>

          <p>This article explores the profound positive impact of regular physical activity on mental well-being, attributing it to the stimulation of key neurochemicals that regulate mood. Research shows that while all forms of exercise are beneficial, aerobic workouts like running are particularly effective at reducing depressive symptoms, and practices like yoga excel at managing stress. The most significant mental health gains are often experienced by sedentary individuals who successfully establish and maintain a new, consistent exercise habit, demonstrating that even modest activity can yield substantial rewards.</p>

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center noted that while Imelda will continue to weaken, it will remain a large system, and swells generated by it are still expected to create dangerous surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

The team cites "very strong" evidence based on a "visual anomaly" identified in satellite imagery of a lagoon, an object that has been visible in photos dating back to 1938. If confirmed, the discovery would solve the 88-year-old mystery of the aviator's disappearance during her 1937 attempt to circumnavigate the globe.</p>
