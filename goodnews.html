          <p>Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on the Nova music festival, is representing Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland. Her pop ballad, "New Day Will Rise," reflects hope and coping after loss, which resonates with her personal experience of surviving the attack by playing dead under bodies in a shelter. Despite widespread opposition to Israel's participation, Raphael has qualified for the grand final, and the Israeli delegation has prepared her for potential audience booing, as happened last year. The Eurovision organizers have clarified that no political expression is permitted onstage, and security measures have been heightened for the Israeli delegation. </p>
