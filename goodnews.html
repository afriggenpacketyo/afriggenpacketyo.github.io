          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly the last UK minister yet to agree on a funding deal with the Treasury before the upcoming Spending Review. While police budgets are expected to see a real-terms increase over the next three years, negotiations continue regarding the broader Home Office budget. Other ministers, such as Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, have reached settlements, but Cooper is holding out in talks involving both the Treasury and Number 10 Downing Street. The Spending Review is set to outline government department budgets for the next few years amid pressure to balance spending with fiscal rules.</p>
