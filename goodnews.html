          <p>South Korea's central bank maintained its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, primarily to assess persistent housing market risks in Seoul and rising household debt, aligning with economists' expectations. Despite stable inflation and "modest improvement" in economic growth, the Bank of Korea emphasized the need for close monitoring of home prices, which had spiked earlier in the year. The article notes the central bank upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2%, citing a recovery in domestic demand due to a supplementary budget and improved consumer sentiment. Analysts anticipate potential rate cuts in late 2025 or early 2026 to stabilize rates around 2%, with exports also showing favorable movements despite potential impacts from US tariffs.

          <p>USC has offered Notre Dame a multi-year extension to their historic football rivalry, which faced public outcry over its potential termination after 100 years. USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed optimism for a deal "very soon," accommodating Notre Dame's preference for a long-term commitment beyond the current season. The primary sticking point in negotiations remains the game's scheduling date, as USC navigates new Big Ten travel demands and aims to balance its season slate, preferring an earlier season matchup. This article highlights the complexities of maintaining cherished traditions in collegiate athletics amidst evolving conference alignments and the strategic priorities of individual programs, with USC coach Lincoln Riley prioritizing the Trojans' national championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>Florida's contentious "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration facility in the Everglades is expected to be empty of detainees within days, according to a state official's email to the interfaith community. This development follows a US District Judge's denial of a request from the Trump administration and Florida officials to halt an order effectively winding down its operations. Officials had argued the facility was necessary due to overcrowding elsewhere and cited significant costs to close it, but the judge was not swayed, noting its temporary design and rapid construction. The article also mentions Governor Ron DeSantis's announcement of a new "Deportation Depot" facility in the state, signaling ongoing shifts in immigration policy and the continued debate over immigration detention practices.</p>

The jackpot carried an estimated cash value of $383.7 million, though it was not immediately known if any winning tickets were sold, following no winner for the previous $750 million grand prize. Powerball officials noted that ticket sales have doubled in the past week, as more players participate while also contributing to good causes in their communities. The article highlights the astronomical odds of winning the top prize, which stand at 1 in 292.2 million, and the choice for a single jackpot winner between a lump sum or annual annuity payments.</p>

          <p>Cardi B's defense received a significant boost in a civil trial where a security guard, Emani Ellis, is suing the rapper for alleged assault outside a Beverly Hills obstetrician’s office in 2018. Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, denied touching or scratching Ellis, claiming the guard is seeking a $24 million payout, despite acknowledging a heated verbal exchange. Testimony from the obstetrician and his receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, supported Cardi B's account, with Malcolm stating she saw Ellis initiate contact and cause her own forehead injury, while Cardi B was behind her. The article details the conflicting testimonies, highlighting the rapper's assertion that her pregnancy at the time would have made a physical altercation unlikely.</p>

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, former governor of the People's Bank of China, has urged caution regarding the global surge in stablecoins, calling for a "multidimensional assessment" of their genuine utility and potential systemic risks. He warned against excessive use for asset speculation, which could trigger fraud and financial instability, and criticized industry players for leveraging hype for valuations rather than sustainable business models. With the US and Hong Kong developing regulatory frameworks, speculation about yuan-backed stablecoins is growing, but this article highlights Zhou's emphasis on vigilance to prevent the accumulation of risks detrimental to the financial system's healthy development.

          <p>All NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a significant increase driven by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and demands from US President Donald Trump. However, only three members—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently meeting the new, higher target of 3.5% agreed upon in The Hague. The United States itself is expected to spend 3.22%, while Germany is anticipated to hit the 2% target once its budget passes. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but emphasized that "cash alone doesn't provide security," stressing the need to convert funds into genuine military capability for deterrence against potential enemies.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, signaling sustained demand for AI infrastructure, yet its stock slipped in extended trading due to a data center revenue miss for the second consecutive period. The company projects $54 billion in revenue for the current quarter, excluding H20 shipments to China, and anticipates $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. While overall revenue surged 56% year-over-year, this marked its slowest growth in nine quarters since the generative AI boom began. The article highlights that large cloud providers account for half of Nvidia's data center business, primarily buying its latest Blackwell chips, and the company's board approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases, reflecting continued confidence despite the stock dip.

          <p>After a significant delay of over two and a half years, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Board of Public Works president Steve Kang as the city's new chief film liaison, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Kang will be assisted by Dan Halden and Amy Goldberg in this role, which aims to help film and TV productions navigate city bureaucracy.

          <p>The UK Education Secretary urged eligible working parents to apply for expanded government-funded childcare, offering 30 hours a week for children aged nine months to four years from September. This final phase of the expansion plan aims to ease childcare costs, which averaged £12,425 annually for under-twos in England. However, concerns persist regarding the number of available staff and places, with some nurseries considering withdrawal due to "unsustainable financial pressures" from government rates. The article details eligibility criteria and application processes, while highlighting challenges such as top-up fees and uneven distribution of places across the country, impacting disadvantaged families.</p>
