          <p>Japan has started selling government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring prices to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move seeks to address public criticism of the government's ineffectiveness in curbing rising rice prices amidst broader inflation. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency and speed required to alleviate public concerns and prevent a shift away from rice consumption, with a special response team established to handle high rice price issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of legislation, to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sales price from the factory to a vendor, rather than the inflated price from an intermediary. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving independent parties, proof that the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. While complex, the rule can provide significant cost savings, especially for higher-value consumer goods and luxury products, as noted by Moncler. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep helps the brain clean up harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, explains how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. The team discovered that when H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to ‚Äúrepair mode,‚Äù prompting restorative slumber. This breakthrough offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.</p>
