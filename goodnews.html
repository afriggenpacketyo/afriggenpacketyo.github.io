          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett addressed concerns about potential Medicare adjustments and emphasized the administration's focus on eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse. He stated that while the Senate is discussing possible adjustments, the White House is primarily focused on ending waste and preventing benefits for ineligible individuals. Hassett also discussed the upcoming meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in London to resolve issues related to critical mineral exports, expressing confidence that a deal will be reached. He defended the administration's tariff policies, arguing that they generate revenue and reduce inflation, citing a Congressional Budget Office estimate of $2.8 trillion in tariff revenue over the next 10 years (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, were diverted to Rome because the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was too large to land at Naples Airport. The flight, carrying 231 passengers and 11 crew members, landed in Rome due to operational limitations. After landing in Rome, passengers were transported to Naples by bus, a journey of approximately three hours. American Airlines apologized for the disruption, noting that they typically use a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route.</p>

          <p>Senator Cory Booker stated he would not accept campaign donations from Elon Musk, following Musk's public disagreement with Donald Trump over a budget bill. Booker supports anyone, including Musk, who puts resources into informing Americans about the potential negative impacts of the bill. He agreed with Musk's criticism of the legislation, calling it economically and morally wrong, and encouraged him to pressure Congress to reject it. This comes as Democrats consider how to leverage the growing rift between Musk and Trump, while some left-wing politicians criticize Musk's influence in politics.</p>
