          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight bound for Boston was forced to make an emergency landing back at Miami International Airport shortly after takeoff on Saturday. The maneuver was prompted by a bird strike that reportedly affected one of the aircraft's engines. According to the FAA and the airline, the plane landed safely without any injuries to the passengers or crew. The flight was able to depart again later, arriving in Boston about two hours behind its original schedule, concluding the incident with a safe outcome.</p>

Furthermore, financial institutions are wary because BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating what one expert calls a "giant black hole" in their understanding of a consumer's overall credit risk.
