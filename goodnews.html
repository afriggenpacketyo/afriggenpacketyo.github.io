          <h2>New Blood Test for Alzheimer's Disease Set to Launch in the US</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new blood test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is set to become available in the US starting in late June, developed by Japanese company Fujirebio Holdings. The test, which received regulatory clearance from the FDA, will initially be offered at approximately 50 American research institutes and hospitals specializing in Alzheimer's disease. This non-invasive test detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, and offers a quicker and less expensive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests. The availability of this blood test is expected to improve access to diagnosis and treatment for the nearly 7 million Americans affected by Alzheimer's disease, potentially accelerating the rollout of new Alzheimer's drugs. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to complete the ambitious project by the end of his term. The system, designed to protect against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, faces technical and financial challenges, with projected costs ranging from $161 billion to $542 billion. Trump claims the system will be "fully operational" within three years and will intercept missiles launched from anywhere, including space. The project, reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" initiative, seeks to modernize U.S. defense capabilities amid concerns about adversaries' advancements. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The media's focus on young men supposedly fueling the rise of the far right overlooks a more significant shift in public opinion: young women are increasingly turning towards the left. Research indicates that while a gender gap exists in support for far-right parties, it is primarily driven by a sharp leftward turn among young women, not a rightward turn among young men. This trend presents a political opportunity for center-left parties to prioritize the values and priorities of female voters, such as climate action and strengthening the welfare state, rather than pandering to reactionary politics. Focusing on these issues could transform the political debate and encourage greater participation from young women in elections. </p>

          <p>Chengdu, an inland city in southwestern China, is experiencing a surge in population and a booming real estate market, defying the country's property crisis. The city's growing appeal reflects a disillusionment among young people who are turning away from the hypercompetitive work culture and high cost of living in major coastal cities. Chengdu offers a more relaxed lifestyle, a vibrant cultural scene, and affordable housing, attracting transplants and returnees. This shift indicates a broader trend of young Chinese seeking a better quality of life in inland cities. </p>

          <p>Veterinary students are in high demand due to a shortage of professionals in the field, driven by high turnover rates, rising student debt, and increased pet ownership. California and the rest of the nation are experiencing a lack of animal medical care, leading to overcrowded shelters and a rise in pet illnesses. The job comes with pressures and high suicide rates among veterinarians. Despite these challenges, pet owners are increasingly willing to spend on pet care, making investments in veterinary medicine popular among corporations and private-equity firms. </p>

The election highlighted questions about progressive officeholders, as their wing of Democratic Party seeks to wrest control from centrist leaders.

          <p>A new test has been developed that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumors from weeks to just hours, researchers say. Surgeons have described the "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing as a "game changer" and say it could improve care and treatment for thousands of patients. The method has been developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with clinicians at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH). The research has attracted interest from across the UK, with other NHS hospitals setting up their own testing alongside their existing regimes to gather more evidence about its effectiveness. </p>
