          <p>President Donald Trump has approved Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire United States Steel Corp., signaling a potential turning point for the U.S. steel industry. Trump announced that the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the American economy, with the bulk of the investment occurring over the next 14 months. Nippon Steel expressed respect for the decision, while U.S. Steel appreciated Trump's leadership in securing the futures of thousands of steelworkers and the iconic company, which will remain in America with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States previously reviewed the acquisition plan under former President Joe Biden but failed to reach a consensus, leading to Trump's reexamination of the deal.

          <p>A misplaced antenna caused military air traffic controllers to lose contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), leading to two commercial planes performing go-arounds to avoid a collision. The incident occurred less than a month after the FAA increased staffing and oversight for DCA's air traffic control team. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed frustration and called for a review of the rules. The Army claims its helicopter was broadcasting its location and the go-arounds were performed out of caution.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered substantial reductions to the White House National Security Council (NSC), resulting in the dismissal of numerous policy experts. The move aims to streamline bureaucracy and eliminate duplication, shifting responsibilities back to home departments and agencies. Following the cuts, the NSC will resemble its size at the end of Trump's first term. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been running the NSC since the previous national security advisor was effectively dismissed, creating an unusual double-role.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States are thriving due to human influence on their habitat, specifically the use of backyard feeders. The study in Global Change Biology found that hummingbird feeders have changed the size and shape of the birds' beaks. Beaks have grown longer and more slender, aiding in nectar consumption, and males' beaks have become pointier for fighting off competitors. The hummingbird's range has also expanded northward, influenced by eucalyptus forests introduced to California.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. Harvard sued the administration, alleging that the move violated the First Amendment and Due Process Clause. The administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders, but Harvard President Alan Garber refuted these claims. The dispute is part of a broader standoff between the Trump administration and Harvard over campus policies and governance.</p>

          <p>The New Jersey gubernatorial elections are heating up ahead of the primaries, with experts suggesting the race could be a bellwether for the 2026 midterms. The race could indicate how voters feel about President Trump and how partisan allegiances are shifting in New Jersey. The Democratic primary features six figures hoping to succeed incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy, while Republicans are hoping to flip the governorship red. Trump has endorsed Republican front-runner Jack Ciattarelli, a returning challenger.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, ensuring that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The deal is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Nippon Steel's nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was previously blocked by former President Joe Biden, but Trump's announcement signals a shift. Shares of U.S. Steel jumped on the news, and the company praised President Trump's leadership.</p>
