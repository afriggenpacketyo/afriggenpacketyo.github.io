          <p>Jibaritos y Más, a thriving family-owned Puerto Rican restaurant in Chicago, is celebrated for its authentic cuisine, including the popular jibarito sandwich which famously uses flattened plantains instead of bread. Co-founded by Venezuelan immigrants Yelitza Rivera and her son Jesus Arrieta, the restaurant operates four successful locations across the city. Beyond its culinary offerings, the establishment demonstrates profound generosity by preparing and donating 80 to 100 fresh, scratch-made meals daily to neighbors in need. This significant charitable initiative, a promise made by Rivera, ensures that everyone in the Humboldt Park community has access to at least one hot meal, embodying a deep commitment to social welfare.</p>

          <p>Legendary civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson was honored in Chicago on Saturday for his 84th birthday by a gathering of prominent political figures. Although Jackson himself was hospitalized with a lung infection and unable to attend the event, his family stated he was expected to be well enough to attend church on Sunday. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, former alderman and congressman Bobby Rush, and Jackson's sons, U.S. Rep. Jonathan Jackson and former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., hosted the celebration at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition headquarters. This article underscores the widespread respect and enduring legacy of Rev.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychology expert and author Morgan Housel presents five fundamental rules for achieving happiness that are independent of abundant wealth, advocating for contentment over relentless material pursuit. The article emphasizes that genuine satisfaction arises from appreciating one's current possessions and circumstances rather than perpetually desiring more, drawing inspiration from art and personal anecdotes, such as his profoundly content, low-income grandmother-in-law. Housel argues that happiness is fundamentally the gap between one's expectations and existing circumstances, suggesting that cultivating lower expectations can foster immense psychological wealth. Ultimately, this article encourages readers to strive for a state where nothing feels missing, irrespective of their current lifestyle or financial status.</p>

          <p>Tesla has released a new version of its full self-driving supervised technology, though investor attention remains primarily focused on a larger, anticipated product announcement teased by Elon Musk for October 7th. Speculation widely points to the reveal of a stripped-down, lower-cost Model Y or significant updates on the long-promised next-generation Roadster. This article notes that Tesla's stock climbed significantly on the pre-announcement buzz, following a multi-quarter slump in auto sales attributed to an aging lineup, increased competition, and consumer backlash against Musk's political rhetoric. The company is actively working to shift investor perception towards its future as a robotics and self-driving car business, seeking new growth drivers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Clarke, Michel Devoret, and John Martinis for their pivotal discovery that quantum tunnelling, a bizarre barrier-defying phenomenon previously confined to the quantum realm, can be observed on an electrical circuit in our classical world. This groundbreaking work, which effectively illustrated quantum effects on a "somewhat large object," laid the essential foundational groundwork for the development of superconducting quantum bits (qubits) used in future quantum computers. The article explains quantum tunnelling as particles having a probability of appearing on the other side of a barrier, even if classically impossible. This discovery offers new, observable insights into the weird quantum world and significantly propels advancements in quantum computing technology.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is increasing its holdings in GE Vernova, purchasing an additional 20 shares, raising its weighting to 1.5%. The article highlights the trust's growing conviction in the long-term demand for AI infrastructure, spurred by recent announcements from OpenAI regarding massive AI data center deployments requiring significant power. While GE Vernova's onshore wind business is expected to remain soft, the company's gas turbines for electricity generation and electrification products for grid solutions position it to potentially benefit from this surge in AI-related energy demand. The stock had previously surged after a strong second quarter and raised outlook, making this a strategic buy on a pullback. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Debate Emerges in Germany Over Responsibility for National Drone Defense</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 11:04:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant debate is unfolding within Germany's CDU/CSU conservative bloc regarding whether regional states (Länder) or the federal government (Bund) should hold primary responsibility for defending critical installations from drone threats. This discussion has gained urgency following two recent drone-related flight suspensions at Munich Airport, underscoring vulnerabilities. While some politicians advocate for greater federal responsibility due to the national security implications of such threats, others contend that individual states are better equipped to handle localized drone incidents. This article highlights that German police forces are typically tasked with drone threats, but the military (Bundeswehr) is constitutionally restricted from shooting down drones domestically unless faced with a full-scale war scenario.</p>

          <p>This article suggests Ukraine is turning the tables on Russia in the ongoing conflict, despite a significant manpower shortage, by effectively leveraging drone technology and evolving combat tactics. Commanders are minimizing casualties through more precise artillery use, careful troop movements, and improved rotation plans, aiming to avoid direct contact. The Atlantic article highlights the "weird intimacy" of drone warfare, where operators can observe and strike targets with chilling precision. While acknowledging the brutality and the hatred fostered by the war, it concludes that Ukraine's institutional reorientation for a long conflict and steady enemy losses, coupled with Western support, may be shifting the balance of time in its favor.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed minerals explorer Trilogy Metals surged over 225% after the White House announced it had acquired a 10% stake in the Canadian company through a $35.6 million investment. This strategic partnership is part of a broader U.S. push to unlock domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper, cobalt, zinc, and lead in Alaska's Ambler mining district, aiming to secure domestic supply chains. The article notes that President Trump's order reverses a previous Biden administration rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to responsible resource development. Opponents, however, continue to raise significant concerns about potential environmental harm to the pristine Alaskan landscapes and local wildlife. (not investment advice)</p>
