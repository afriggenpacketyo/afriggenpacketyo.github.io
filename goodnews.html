According to Stord CEO Sean Henry, scale is the biggest challenge for independent merchants trying to compete with Prime, as logistics require a significant volume of packages and strategically located inventory to offer rapid delivery.

          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic has indicated he is currently leaning towards only one interest rate cut this year, citing concerns about potential upward pressure on inflation due to tariffs. While the Federal Reserve projected two rate cuts in March, Bostic believes the tariffs have been larger than initially anticipated, requiring more time to assess their impact. Bostic expressed particular concern about rising inflation expectations among Americans, which he believes could complicate the Fed's efforts to maintain stable prices. Bostic is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee.</p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland saw centrist candidates halting or slowing down hard-right breakthroughs that many liberals had feared, though discontent with mainstream parties remains. In Romania, Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor, defeated George Simion, a hard-line nationalist aligned with President Trump. In Poland, Rafal Trzaskowski, a liberal mayor, secured a spot in a runoff against Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian, although the margin of victory was narrow, indicating strong support for hard-right candidates.

Starmer hopes that the practical benefits of the deal will outweigh objections from Brexit supporters, focusing on smoother relations with the EU without reopening major questions like single market membership.

Possible explanations include weakened surveillance due to government cuts, fear among immigrant farm workers to come forward for testing, or a natural seasonal decline in infections. While the CDC maintains that the risk to the general public remains low, the lack of detected cases raises concerns about undetected milder infections and the potential for the virus to mutate.

          <p>It's usually a wise idea to save money now for expenses you may face in the future. After all, you never know when a financial emergency might happen. And when one does, you'll likely want a financial safety net to fall back on. The national average savings account interest rate is 0.41% as of May 19, 2025, according to the latest numbers available from the FDIC. You can earn exponentially more than that by opening a high-yield savings account, however. (not investment advice)</p>
