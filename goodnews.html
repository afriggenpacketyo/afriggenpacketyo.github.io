          <p>American shopping malls are undergoing a significant transformation to survive, replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants including churches, bowling alleys, and expanded bookstores. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio has seen a local church, Crossroads, revitalize a former Sears space, drawing thousands of visitors and boosting business for remaining retailers. This trend, driven by mall owners like CBL Properties and Brookfield, focuses on creating community hubs with diverse, experience-oriented offerings. Data shows this strategy is increasing foot traffic, with Gen Z in particular embracing the revamped, community-focused mall experience.</p>

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a significant rally after reports that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a potential move to Schedule III could provide major benefits, such as easing tax burdens and encouraging institutional investment. Trump confirmed he is reviewing the matter and will make a decision soon, a statement that has fueled industry optimism. While the final authority rests with the Attorney General, presidential backing is seen as a crucial step for the cannabis market. (not investment advice)</p>

TKO Group, the parent company of UFC and WWE, views the deal as a way to broaden its audience and drive streaming subscriptions.

This initiative is part of Ford's "Universal EV Program," which aims to compete with both EV and traditional auto markets by making electric vehicles more accessible.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has labeled concerns about potential national security risks from Nvidia's H20 chips sold to China as "nonsense." He commented on reports that Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue from their China sales in exchange for export licenses. Cramer argued that the government had the power to block the sales if it perceived a genuine threat, suggesting the deal is a pragmatic solution. His commentary reflects a market-focused perspective that prioritizes continued business operations and revenue generation for the U.S. tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will shut down its dial-up internet service in late September, marking the end of an era for a technology that introduced millions of people to the online world. The characteristic sound of a dial-up modem connecting became a nostalgic soundtrack for early internet users in the 1990s and 2000s. At its peak, AOL had over 23 million subscribers in the U.S. before being eclipsed by faster broadband services. The discontinuation of the service signifies the final chapter for a foundational piece of internet history.</p>

          <p>The online checkout process is facing a seismic shift as generative AI platforms like ChatGPT are expected to integrate direct purchasing capabilities. This would allow consumers to complete transactions within the AI chat interface, bypassing the need to visit a merchant's website. While this could disrupt traditional payment processors, experts suggest the bigger impact will be on e-commerce platforms like Amazon, as AI becomes the primary point of product discovery. The new battleground for retailers will be controlling this pre-sale phase, where AI assistants guide consumer choices and capture valuable user attention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia and AMD have entered into an unusual agreement to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China. This arrangement is a condition for receiving export licenses for advanced chips like Nvidia's H20, which were previously restricted.

          <p>Liverpool's performance in the Community Shield showcased both the promise of its new signings and potential defensive weaknesses. New attacking players Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz had encouraging debuts, contributing to a potent offense. However, the team appeared defensively open at times, a recurring issue during pre-season, as they adapt to a new 4-2-3-1 formation. The absence of key midfielders highlighted vulnerabilities in the back line, suggesting that while the attack looks strong, the team may face a period of adjustment to find defensive stability early in the season.</p>

          <p>A new scientific paper published in a peer-reviewed journal presents a model for a physical warp drive that does not require negative energy, a theoretical and likely impossible substance. This concept builds upon the 1994 Alcubierre drive model but overcomes its primary obstacle by proposing a different method of manipulating spacetime. Instead of moving a ship within a spacetime bubble, the new model involves stable, floating bubbles of spacetime itself. While the energy requirements are still immense and construction is in the far future, this provides a theoretical pathway for faster-than-light travel based on understood physics.</p>
