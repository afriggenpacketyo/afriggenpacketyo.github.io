          <p>Southeast Asian leaders convened in Kuala Lumpur, addressing concerns about the impact of new U.S. tariffs on regional economies. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim highlighted the strain on the global trading system due to the tariffs, which range from 10% to 49% affecting ASEAN members. Anwar Ibrahim said he wrote to U.S. President Donald Trump to propose an ASEAN-U.S. meeting to negotiate the tariffs. The leaders warned that unilateral tariffs pose complex challenges to ASEAN's economic growth, stability, and integration, reaffirming their commitment to a non-discriminatory multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Sexual orientation develops during puberty through a complex interplay of biological and psychosocial factors, with no single cause identified. Human sexuality is characterized by its diversity, and sexual orientation is considered a matter of fate, not choice, developing during adolescence under the influence of sex hormones. After this developmental phase, sexual preference remains stable, despite societal pressures to conform. Despite universal human rights including the right to free sexual orientation, individuals continue to face exclusion, discrimination, and persecution in many countries due to their sexual orientation.</p>

          <p>Anthropologist Sabine Hyland is studying ancient Inca khipus, knotted cords used for record-keeping, in a remote Peruvian village, aiming to decipher their lost writing system. The Incas used khipus instead of writing on tablets, and Hyland hopes to unlock the history of the Andean people by decoding these cords. The village of Jucul has preserved its khipus for centuries, and Hyland's research involves linguistic analysis, statistical methods, and cultural knowledge. The article explores the structure of khipus, the challenges of decipherment, and the potential to illuminate the rise and fall of the Inca empire.</p>
