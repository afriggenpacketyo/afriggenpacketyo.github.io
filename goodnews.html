          <p>Congo and the M23 rebel group, which is backed by Rwanda, have signed a declaration of principles in Qatar, committing to a permanent ceasefire. This agreement aims to end the prolonged conflict in mineral-rich eastern Congo, which has displaced seven million people. The deal, which follows a U.S.-facilitated peace agreement between Congo and Rwanda, stipulates that a final comprehensive peace accord will be signed by August 18. Key unresolved issues include the withdrawal of rebels from seized cities and whether Rwanda will cease its support for the M23 group.</p>

          <p>The government of China's Guangxi province has launched an "AI for All" competition to cultivate artificial intelligence start-ups with a focus on Southeast Asian markets. The event, which runs through September, aims to leverage Guangxi's long-standing role as a hub for cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). With tracks covering sectors like e-commerce, smart agriculture, and tourism, the initiative seeks to bolster economic ties and technological innovation. Hong Kong officials praised the competition, noting its alignment with the city's strategy to promote AI as a key industry.</p>

          <h2>Charities Advocate for Council Tax Exemption for Terminally Ill Individuals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 06:06:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leading UK end-of-life charities, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for a nationwide council tax exemption for people diagnosed with less than 12 months to live. The campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first local authority to implement such a policy. Proponents argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a significant income shock and increased costs, making financial relief from large bills like council tax crucial for providing peace of mind. The Local Government Association stated that some support is already available, but advocates are pushing for a more compassionate and standardized approach.</p>

          <p>Conservationists have successfully confirmed the breeding of the California red-legged frog in Southern California for the first time in 25 years, thanks to the use of artificial intelligence. After a multi-year effort to reintroduce frog eggs from Mexico's Baja Peninsula, scientists were struggling to confirm if the amphibians were reproducing. A custom AI model was deployed to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings, successfully identifying the mating calls of mature male frogs. This technological breakthrough marks a significant milestone in the fight to save the threatened species, famous from Mark Twain's writing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nutrition experts are cautioning consumers about the proliferation of "high-protein" claims on snack foods, which often masks high sugar content and may not signify a healthy choice. The article provides a simple calculation to determine the actual percentage of calories from protein in a product, suggesting that a truly high-protein food should derive 30% or more of its calories from protein. Dietitians recommend prioritizing whole foods like Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, and nuts for protein intake. They also emphasize that most adults can easily meet their protein needs through regular meals without relying on processed snacks.</p>

          <p>Heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch is rerecording its most popular songs after discovering their former label had sold the master recordings of their first seven albums without their knowledge. Taking inspiration from Taylor Swift's successful "Taylor's Version" rerecording project, the band aims to reclaim control of their work. The first collection, "20 Years of Five Finger Death Punch — Best of Volume 1," was just released, featuring new versions of their hits. The move has surprisingly garnered support from Swift's fans, highlighting a shared sense of injustice over artists' rights in the music industry.</p>

          <p>Coffee giant Nescafé is strategically targeting Gen Z consumers by focusing on the rapidly growing cold coffee market. Recognizing that iced coffee is often the entry point for younger drinkers, the Nestlé-owned brand is developing new products like its Espresso Concentrate to allow for customized cold beverages at home. The company also sees an opportunity to position coffee as a sophisticated, non-alcoholic alternative for evening social occasions, capitalizing on the trend of lower alcohol consumption among younger generations. This move is part of Nestlé's broader strategy to refocus on core, high-growth categories like coffee.</p>

          <p>Financial therapists and consumer experts are advising people to be more intentional with their spending to avoid financial strain, especially when money is tight. They suggest asking a series of questions before making a purchase, such as whether it will impact essential funds, if it's filling an emotional need, or if you're trying to impress someone. The article also recommends doing research before buying, not assuming price equals quality, and walking away if the item isn't exactly what you want. The key is to avoid impulsive or emotional buying by being more mindful of your motivations and budget.</p>

While facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's popularity has grown nationwide among Muslims who align with his progressive platform and advocacy for Palestinian rights.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a significantly cheaper and simpler method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious diseases. The new technique uses gene therapy tools to produce the specialized anticancer cells directly inside the patient's body, avoiding the complex and expensive external manufacturing process. The team successfully used this in-vivo method to treat four patients with multiple myeloma. This innovation could make the promising but costly therapy, which can exceed $139,000 per treatment, much more accessible to patients worldwide.</p>
