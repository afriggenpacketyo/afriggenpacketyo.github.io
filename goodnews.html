          <p>Former NFL offensive lineman Taylor Lewan threw a ceremonial first pitch at a St. Louis Cardinals game that went awry. Lewan's pitch sailed closer to the first-base on-deck circle than home plate, prompting him to throw his hat to the field and do pushups. Lewan humorously called it the worst day of his athletic career, referencing a previous game where he struggled. He vowed to improve for his next attempt at a first pitch.</p>
