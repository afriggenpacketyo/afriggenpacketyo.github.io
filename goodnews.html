          <p>Leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) democracies convened in Canada to discuss global trade, navigating disagreements arising from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies and unilateral actions. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the need for cooperation and economic prosperity in a divided world, though Trump's stance diverged from his counterparts. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stressed the importance of a free, fair, and rules-based economic order, advocating for the strengthening of multilateral trade through the World Trade Organization. The summit also addressed regional affairs, including the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, where China's military activity is a concern.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has issued a warning about patients filming their medical treatments for platforms like TikTok and Instagram, citing potential risks to both patients and NHS staff. The trade union's annual conference highlighted concerns that such filming can distract staff, create discomfort, and inadvertently publicize private medical data of other individuals in the hospital. One radiographer recounted an instance where a patient's relative began filming during treatment setup, while another reported a patient covertly recording her for a cancer blog. The union emphasizes the need for clear NHS policies to address this growing trend.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have introduced a bill to prohibit law enforcement officers from concealing their faces while on duty, with exceptions for SWAT teams and medical reasons. The proposal aims to increase transparency and accountability, particularly in response to concerns about masked federal officers during immigration raids. Supporters argue that hiding faces makes officers appear disconnected from the community and shields them from scrutiny, while opponents, including the Department of Homeland Security, claim the bill endangers officers by making them identifiable. The bill would also encourage officers to wear visible identification on their uniforms, and the California Police Chiefs Assn. has expressed a desire to discuss safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasing its focus on arms exports to deepen ties with allies and bolster its defense industrial base. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani expressed a desire to promote Japan's defense exports, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba attended the country's largest defense exhibition. This shift aims to improve interoperability with partner nations through standardized maintenance and joint training, as well as to achieve economies of scale for domestic production. While Japan has largely relied on U.S. weapons, developing its own defense industry is seen as crucial, especially given potential changes in U.S. defense policy.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have released details of their version of President Trump's tax bill, revealing key differences from the House-passed version, particularly concerning Medicaid and state and local tax (SALT) deductions. The Senate proposes steeper cuts to Medicaid funding and a permanent extension of the $10,000 SALT deduction, while the House seeks a higher deduction for certain incomes. These discrepancies have sparked opposition from both sides, with House Republicans threatening to vote against the bill if the SALT cap is not raised, and some Senate Republicans expressing concern over the Medicaid changes. The Senate version also includes a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling and provisions to end taxes on tips and auto loan interest.</p>

          <p>A Detroit Police Department sergeant, Shannon Jones, initiated Operation UNITED to exhume unidentified crime victims buried in "paupers' graves" and use DNA analysis to identify them and provide closure to their families. Inspired by photographs of missing loved ones, Jones partnered with FBI Special Agent Leslie Larsen to launch the project, which has resulted in 33 positive identifications. The operation involves exhuming remains, extracting DNA, and comparing it to online databases and samples from relatives. One case involved Kristina Morris, whose father disappeared in 1995 and was later identified through Operation UNITED, leading to an active homicide investigation.</p>

          <p>The city of Xian in western China has seen a surge in tourism, leading to the growth of a cottage industry centered around traditional Chinese clothing (hanfu). Tourists are increasingly spending time dressing up in elaborate costumes for photoshoots at historical sites, creating opportunities for costumiers, make-up artists, and photographers. This trend aligns with government efforts to promote traditional culture and express national confidence. The tourism industry in Xian generated significant income last year, and this sector provides new employment avenues for young people, offering a potentially stable career path.</p>

          <p>Social media and video networks have overtaken traditional TV channels and news websites as the main source of news in the U.S., according to research from the Reuters Institute. More than half of Americans now get their news from platforms like Facebook, X, and YouTube, with online personalities like Joe Rogan gaining significant reach. This trend presents a challenge for traditional publishers, as politicians increasingly favor sympathetic online hosts over mainstream interviewers. Despite their popularity, online influencers and politicians are also identified as major sources of false or misleading information, and the usage of X for news is stable or increasing, particularly among right-leaning audiences.</p>

Arias was commissioned by the U.S. State Department in 1945 to create a singable Spanish version of the national anthem, and her story remained largely unknown until her grandson discovered her drafts in 2006. Nezza views Arias' song as a symbol of American pride and a living piece of forgotten Latino history.</p>
