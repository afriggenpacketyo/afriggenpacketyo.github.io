          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:19:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which fueled the rally. The price increase also triggered a wave of short liquidations, further accelerating the upward momentum. Analysts attribute the sustained interest to expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and potential crypto-friendly legislation, which are seen as positive catalysts for the digital asset.

          <h2>Delta Air Lines Explores Further Segmentation of Premium Cabin Offerings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:09:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta Air Lines is planning to introduce more varied ticket options within its premium cabins, mirroring the segmentation strategy it successfully applied to its main economy cabin. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, stated that the goal is to cater to the diverse needs of premium travelers, though specific details of the new fare structures were not disclosed. This focus on high-end cabins comes as revenue from premium seats has grown by 6%, while main cabin revenue has seen a slight decline. The move could result in different tiers of business or first-class fares, potentially offering varied levels of amenities like lounge access or seat selection.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence largely attributed to a significant surge in customs duties from recently imposed tariffs. This monthly surplus contrasts with the fiscal year's growing deficit, which now stands at $1.34 trillion. While receipts are up, the report notes that persistently high interest payments on the national debt remain a major financial challenge for the government. The figures highlight the immediate fiscal impact of the administration's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chemical manufacturer DuPont has agreed to a $27 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit concerning the contamination of the water supply in the village of Hoosick Falls, New York. The lawsuit, initiated in 2016, claimed that a local facility's use of Teflon materials led to drinking water being contaminated with PFOA, a harmful "forever chemical." This settlement brings the total amount recovered for residents to over $90 million, following earlier agreements with three other companies. The deal, which still requires judicial approval, also includes $6 million for an ongoing medical monitoring program for residents exposed to the chemical.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner delivered a commanding performance to defeat seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets (6-3, 6-3, 6-4) in the Wimbledon semifinals. The victory marks Sinner's first-ever Wimbledon final and ends Djokovic's latest attempt to secure a record 25th Grand Slam title. Sinner's relentless and precise play overwhelmed the Serbian star, who struggled to find his rhythm throughout the match. The 23-year-old Italian will now face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a highly anticipated final, a rematch of their epic five-set clash at the French Open last month.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's long-term solvency and recent overpayment issues, seniors are increasingly seeking ways to supplement their retirement income. This article outlines three potential financial strategies for homeowners aged 62 and older to generate additional funds. These options include reverse mortgages, which provide payments from home equity; annuities, which offer guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum payment; and personal loans, which can serve as a flexible emergency fund.

          <p>This article posits that the current season of the reality show 'Love Island USA' serves as a compelling portrait of Gen Z's dating habits, characterized by emotional guardedness and a lack of deep romantic connections. Despite high viewership, the season has been criticized by fans for featuring "situationships" rather than genuine love stories. The author suggests this reflects a broader trend among young adults who grew up online and during the pandemic, leading to anxiety about vulnerability and direct communication. The show's most popular contestants are those who defy this trend by openly expressing their strong emotions, resonating with an audience that may struggle with similar inhibitions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has announced a new program to provide direct cash assistance to individuals and families impacted by the Trump administration's recent immigration raids. The aid will be distributed via cash cards, funded by philanthropic partners rather than city money, to help those who have lost income due to a family member's detention or are afraid to go to work. The initiative is part of a broader city response that includes reinforcing L.A.'s sanctuary city policies. The program aims to provide immediate financial relief as the federal immigration crackdown in the city continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the origins of the widely adopted 10,000-steps-a-day fitness goal, revealing it began not as a scientific standard but as a 1960s marketing campaign for a Japanese pedometer. While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent research has shown it to be a reasonably effective benchmark for promoting good health. Experts note that health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts, around 2,500 to 3,000 per day. The consensus is that while 10,000 is a useful and motivating target, the most important thing is to remain active, with any amount of walking being better than none.</p>
