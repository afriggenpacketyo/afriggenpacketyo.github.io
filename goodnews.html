          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 01:09:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's film "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, immerses viewers in a gritty 1998 New York City, following former baseball player Hank Thompson as he inadvertently stumbles into a violent crime caper. After a series of unfortunate events, including a bizarre cat-sitting assignment, Hank finds himself pursued by various criminal factions, including Russian thugs and Hassidic hitmen, alongside a hard-nosed NYPD detective. The movie vividly portrays a sleazy, energetic pre-millennial Manhattan, exploring themes of squandered potential and self-loathing through Hank's often hazy, alcohol-fueled journey. Austin Butler portrays the protagonist, who is forced to confront his past and present failures amidst the escalating chaos, making for an affectionate yet grimy tour of the city.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are experiencing significant returns, with one engineer reporting over 30% gains this year and anticipating another 20% by early next year, driven by government pledges to support the shaky economy through the stock market. This strategy aims to create a "wealth effect" that stimulates consumption, despite underlying economic challenges. Traders are focusing their equity exposure on high-beta stocks within the new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware sectors, expecting these to perform well as the broader market stabilizes or stages a comeback. The prevailing sentiment among these investors is that a rising stock market is essential to bolster the struggling economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $950 million for the upcoming Saturday night drawing, following no grand prize winner in Wednesday's approximately $850 million drawing. This makes it the game's sixth-largest jackpot ever, with an estimated cash value of $428.9 million before taxes. A single jackpot winner would have the choice of taking a lump sum payment or opting for a payout via an annuity that would consist of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million. Powerball tickets are sold in 45 states, and the growing jackpot is attracting more players, which also contributes to good causes in their communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's central bank kept its policy rate unchanged at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, primarily to further assess housing prices in Seoul and surrounding areas, which had spiked earlier in the year. Despite stable inflation and "modest improvement" in economic growth, the Bank of Korea highlighted the need for close monitoring of household debt and strong home price expectations. The bank upgraded its 2025 inflation forecast to 2% and GDP growth forecast to 0.9%, anticipating a "modest recovery" in domestic demand, though exports are expected to slow due to U.S. tariffs. This decision follows recent agreements between South Korea and the U.S., including significant investment pledges and reduced tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida is deploying 120 robot rabbits in the Everglades as an innovative new strategy to combat invasive Burmese pythons, which are severely decimating native wildlife populations. These sophisticated robots are designed to mimic marsh rabbits, emitting heat, a natural scent, and realistic movements to lure the highly camouflaged snakes out of their hiding spots. Equipped with video cameras, the pens signal when a python is nearby, enabling contractors to quickly locate and remove them. This initiative, costing $4,000 per robot, aims to overcome the primary challenge of python detection and follows previous, more expensive efforts with live rabbits. Officials express optimism about the project's potential to protect the delicate Everglades ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered an ace-like pitching performance for the Los Angeles Dodgers, leading them to a 5-1 victory and a sweep of the Cincinnati Reds. After recovering from his second Tommy John surgery, Ohtani pitched five full innings, allowing only one run, recording nine strikeouts, and demonstrating a new, unpredictable pitching strategy by utilizing a wider array of his seven offerings, rather than relying solely on fastballs and sweepers. This outing marked a significant step in his return to form, addressing previous challenges in working deeper into games and showing the tactical adjustments needed for a frontline starter. His dominant performance is crucial for the Dodgers as they eye the postseason, providing more options for his role.</p>

          <p>USC has offered Notre Dame a multi-year extension to continue their historic football rivalry, following public concern over its potential end after the current season. USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed optimism for a deal soon, acknowledging the series' importance to both schools and their respective fan bases. While USC previously hesitated due to College Football Playoff format uncertainties and the new demands of a Big Ten travel schedule, they now aim for a long-term agreement to preserve the tradition. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, as USC prefers an earlier season slot to better balance its conference schedule, a challenge for Notre Dame which has more scheduling flexibility as an independent team.</p>

          <p>Cardi B's defense in a civil trial received a significant boost from witness testimony concerning a 2018 alleged assault on a security guard outside a doctor's office. The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, vehemently denies touching, scratching, or spitting on the plaintiff, Emani Ellis, who is seeking $24 million and claims Cardi B used slurs and attacked her. A receptionist and the obstetrician from the Beverly Hills office testified that Ellis initiated the physical contact and sustained no visible injuries, while the receptionist herself incurred a cut. Cardi B, who was four months pregnant at the time, argued she would not have engaged in a physical altercation due to her condition and the guard's larger size, asserting that Ellis is seeking a payout.</p>

The consortium recently acquired four logistics assets from CapitaLand Ascendas Reit for S$306 million (US$238.56 million), which are anticipated to be a core part of the new REIT's asset composition. The formation of this JD Property-backed REIT would mark one of the largest new entrants in Singapore’s REIT market in over a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has called for a "multidimensional assessment" of stablecoins, urging caution amidst their global surge and the development of new regulatory frameworks in the US and Hong Kong. Zhou warned against the risk of stablecoins being excessively used for asset speculation, which could trigger fraud and instability in the financial system. He highlighted the danger of industry players prioritizing cashing out over business profitability and sustainability, potentially leading to the accumulation of "systemic risks." This advice comes as speculation grows about Beijing potentially introducing yuan-backed stablecoins in a bid to further internationalize its currency, emphasizing the need for vigilance and comprehensive evaluation.

          <p>All NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a significant achievement driven by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and persistent demands from US President Donald Trump for European allies to invest more. However, a new NATO report reveals that only three members—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently meeting the recently agreed-upon goal of 3.5% of GDP. While the United States remains the largest contributor in absolute terms, its spending is estimated at 3.22% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but emphasized the crucial need to convert these funds into genuine military capability for effective deterrence against potential enemies.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, with sales growth projected to remain above 50% this quarter, signaling robust demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. However, the stock slipped in extended trading as its data center revenue fell slightly short of estimates for the second consecutive period, despite overall strong performance. The company's data center business remains central to the global AI buildout, with CFO Colette Kress forecasting $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. Nvidia's growth is primarily driven by its GPU chips, and it anticipates potential H20 chip sales to China, which could add billions in revenue if geopolitical conditions permit, further impacting future revenue.
