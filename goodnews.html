Ye also addresses concerns about semiconductor shortages, stating that China currently has sufficient AI computing power and that on-device chips are becoming powerful enough for AI models. He highlights the use of AI in marketing and sales, specifically mentioning Starbucks' use of AI to improve customer experience, such as optimizing order delivery times. He also notes that real-life videos are still needed, as it is hard for generative AI to convey real emotions, real human touch.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law that mandates 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system, set to begin in the fiscal year starting April 2026. The revised law targets companies that produce 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, covering industries like steel and car production. These companies will receive a maximum emission allowance, and those exceeding the limit must purchase carbon credits from companies with surplus credits. The government estimates that the targeted companies account for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions, aiming to incentivize emissions reduction.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable because existing shareholders are selling a larger portion of shares (60%) than the company itself (40%), a characteristic reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. This is rare in tech IPOs, and the reason for Circle's decision is not explicitly stated. Circle is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, but the high volume of insider sales likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. Private investors are eager for exits to distribute funds back to their investors, especially after a multiyear drought in IPOs.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Claim to Solve Hyperloop's 'Extremely Unpleasant' Ride</h2>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, potentially improving the ride comfort in vacuum-tube maglev systems. Research showed that even minor imperfections in the track could cause violent low-frequency vibrations, making the ride "extremely unpleasant." However, engineers working on a full-scale test line in China claim to have reduced turbulence intensity by nearly half, improving the ride experience.</p>

          <h2>SpaceX Starship Flight Test Doesn't Complete Mission</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During its ninth test flight, SpaceX's Starship successfully launched but did not complete its mission due to a propellant leak that caused a loss of control. Despite reaching orbit, the spacecraft spun out of control and made an uncontrolled reentry, likely disintegrating over the Indian Ocean. SpaceX stated that the flight test provided valuable data for improving the Starship's reliability. This launch marked the first flight of a flight-proven Super Heavy booster, although the booster ultimately exploded during splashdown.</p>

          <p>Onosato was promoted to sumo's highest rank of yokozuna after competing in just 13 professional tournaments, achieving the honor at a record pace. The 24-year-old is the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since 2017. Onosato secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, meeting the requirement of back-to-back championships as an ozeki. He is now set to forge a rivalry with Mongolian yokozuna Hoshoryu.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard University have created a sense of unity on campus, bringing together individuals who were previously divided over issues like the war in Gaza and free speech. The Department of Homeland Security's decision to bar Harvard from enrolling international students has been met with widespread opposition, with students and faculty setting aside their differences to defend the university. Former critics of Harvard have also voiced support, condemning the Trump administration's actions as excessive.</p>

          <h2>CDC Revises Recommendations on COVID Shots for Healthy Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 21:48:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will no longer advise routine COVID shots for healthy children, a change influenced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s skepticism about the need for vaccination. While some children may experience only mild symptoms from COVID, others can become seriously ill, and over one million U.S. children have developed long COVID. The decision reflects a debate among medical researchers about the risks of COVID to children and the necessity of annual vaccines, with considerations for underlying conditions and the potential for vaccination to protect against long COVID.</p>
