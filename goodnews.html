          <p>The UK is currently experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to exceed 30C for a second consecutive day. Hot and dry conditions are predicted to persist across the country, with central England potentially reaching highs of 32C. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, effective until Monday, warning of potential impacts on health and social care services, including increased mortality among vulnerable populations. While temperatures are record-breaking for 2025, they remain below the June peak of 35.6C recorded in 1976.</p>

          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, intends to divide his estimated $13.9 billion fortune among the more than 100 children he has fathered. Durov stated that he wants all his children to have equal rights and avoid conflict over his wealth after his death. He is the "official father" of six children with three different partners but has fathered over 100 children through sperm donation to a fertility clinic. Durov also addressed criminal charges he faces in France, describing them as "totally absurd," and reiterated that he denies any wrongdoing in connection to failing to properly moderate the app to reduce criminality.</p>

These "oversimplified" measures have complicated understanding of the regulations, derailing their original intention and bringing "unnecessary shocks to the catering industry".</p>

          <p>Recent fire exchanges between Israel and Iran have highlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, drawing attention to the U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed Golden Dome multi-layered missile defense system. The Golden Dome project aims to defend the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles through a network of satellites, sensors, and interceptors. Defense and space companies are vying for a share of the project, particularly after Elon Musk's recent public feud with Trump. The House Appropriations Committee unveiled a draft of its fiscal 2026 defense spending bill that includes $13 billion for missile defense and space programs supporting the Golden Dome effort.

The British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) is calling for increased funding to provide amblyopia screenings in all schools in England, as is done in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The Local Government Association (LGA) reports that some councils are unable to offer this service due to capacity or budget constraints.

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. The low-cost coating was tested on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, effectively delaying rot by almost a week or more at a cost of just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. This new strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to a major factor in global food waste.</p>

The competition's scheduling between the end of the European season and the start of the next, along with hot and humid weather, has impacted both play and attendance.

Earlier this year, China said it would allow pilgrims to return to the Tibet autonomous region this summer to follow two pilgrimage routes after a five-year suspension. The sites are sacred to followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon, and the pilgrimages are usually organized by the Indian government. Yang Yabo, director of the Institute of South Asia Studies at the Tibet Academy of Social Sciences in Lhasa, believes that pilgrimages by Indian devotees to Tibet have played a positive role in restoring stability in China-India relations during times of crisis.</p>
