The deals are expected to encompass investments in artificial intelligence, energy production, and significant arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers, and the trip is closely scrutinized for potential conflicts of interest involving the Trump family's business ventures in the region.</p>

While a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson denied that Piker's political beliefs triggered the screening, civil liberties organizations have expressed concern that border officials are abusing their power by interrogating political commentators.

          <p>An article from DW explores whether public transport can ever replace cars, discussing initiatives in cities like Jakarta and Tallinn. Jakarta is improving its bus system with dedicated lanes and connectivity to minibuses, while Tallinn offers free public transport but has seen mixed results. The article notes that psychological factors, such as the need for safety and comfort, play a role in people's transportation choices. Some cities are making driving less appealing through levies and redesigning urban spaces to prioritize public transport.</p>

          <p>China has lifted a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing planes following a temporary cut in tariffs between the United States and China. Officials in Beijing have begun informing domestic carriers and government agencies that deliveries of aircraft made in the U.S. can resume. In April, several jets at Boeing's delivery center in China were returned to the United States due to tariffs. The agreement between Washington and Beijing to slash reciprocal tariffs has paved the way for the resumption of deliveries.</p>
