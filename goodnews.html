          <p>South Korea's People Power Party (PPP) has selected Kim Moon Soo as their candidate for the June 3 presidential election, following Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment. Kim, a former Labor Minister, secured 56.5% of the votes in the party primary, surpassing his rival, Han Dong-hun. He has expressed a commitment to forming a strong alliance to counter liberal front-runner Lee Jae-myung, who is currently facing multiple criminal trials. Kim has also pledged to implement incentives for businesses and innovation, signaling a conservative vision for the country and a firm stance against North Korea. The election aims to find a successor to Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached by the opposition-controlled National Assembly in December. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luke Charters, the Labour MP for York Outer, is calling for a reconsideration of the 1985 legislation that prohibits fans from consuming alcohol in view of the pitch at the top five tiers of men's football in England. Charters argues that this ban creates an inconsistency compared to other sports where alcohol consumption is permitted, and proposes trials to assess the impact of lifting the restrictions. The Football Supporters Association (FSA) supports this call, and trials are already underway in the women's game, which is not subject to the 1985 ban. Charters suggests starting with small-scale trials in the lower leagues to determine the best approach, emphasizing responsible drinking and family zones where alcohol would not be appropriate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Autonomous University of Baja California have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in the wild, offering hope for the critically endangered species. The study tracked 18 axolotls released in Mexico City wetlands, finding that they gained weight and adapted to their new environment, demonstrating their ability to hunt and avoid predators. Axolotls, native to Mexico's capital, are popular among medical researchers for their regenerative abilities. The success of the axolotls in both artificial and restored wetlands suggests that man-made habitats could help mitigate the impacts of habitat degradation and climate change.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the issue of "elderspeak," a form of communication that resembles baby talk and is often used with older adults, particularly those with cognitive impairments. The article highlights a new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) that teaches aides to address older people as adults, reducing the use of inappropriate endearments and simplified language. Studies have shown that reducing elderspeak can decrease resistant behaviors and potentially lower the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes. The article also explores cultural differences and offers advice on how individuals can politely push back against elderspeak.</p>
