        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Cologne indicates that while parents find greater meaning in life compared to childfree individuals, they often experience lower life satisfaction, particularly mothers. The research, based on data from the European Social Survey, highlights that the impact of parenthood on life satisfaction varies significantly across countries, with Scandinavian nations showing less pronounced differences between parents and non-parents. Factors such as childcare, financial support, and gender equality play a crucial role in determining parental satisfaction levels, suggesting that societal support and equitable partnerships contribute to a more positive experience for parents. The study emphasizes the importance of viewing children as a societal responsibility rather than solely a parental one, advocating for policies that support families and promote gender equality.</p>

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games, despite the potential impact on its medal prospects. Governing body World Skate decided in April to institute the limit, which would have ruled some of Japan's previous Olympic medal-winning skateboarders ineligible. Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa has endorsed the new restriction against the backdrop of increasingly severe injuries being reported among growing children.

          <p>An amendment to the Penal Code placing greater emphasis on rehabilitation efforts in prison took effect Sunday in Japan, marking the first time changes have been made to the forms of punishment under Japan's more than a century-old crime laws. Imprisonment is no longer divided into categories of with and without labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory for inmates, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education to reduce recidivism, according to the Justice Ministry. The new system sets up 24 programs tailored to an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, including specialized curricula for elderly inmates and those with addiction issues. Inmates will be sent to prisons that can offer appropriate programs for them, with their situations reviewed every six months.</p>
