          <p>After an initial loss to France, England's women's football team secured a place in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals with decisive wins against the Netherlands and Wales. Manager Sarina Wiegman noted the opening defeat created an "urgency" that unified the team, leading to dominant performances. The Lionesses will now face Sweden in a highly anticipated match, a repeat of the Euro 2022 semi-final. Analysts note that while England has found a successful formation, Sweden presents a strong, physical, and counter-attacking challenge.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that King Charles III has invited U.S. President Donald Trump for a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17-19. The visit is scheduled while the House of Commons is in recess for party conferences, a move that avoids the possibility of a controversial address to Parliament. Trump and his wife, Melania, will be hosted at Windsor Castle, making him the first modern politician to be granted two state visits. The timing and arrangements are seen as a diplomatic maneuver amid ongoing UK-US political and trade discussions.</p>

          <p>In a speech, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to divorce their personal politics from their financial decisions, particularly regarding the Trump administration. He argued that despite personal feelings about the president, the market has shown resilience, driven by individual investors and pro-business policies at the agency level. Cramer pointed to potential deflationary effects of AI and a favorable environment for mergers and deregulation as strong tailwinds for stocks. He concluded that while one may dislike the administration's style, the underlying economic and policy environment is creating conditions for a bull market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," which marks a return to his more experimental R&B roots, similar to his past projects "Journals" and "Changes." The album feels rawer and more improvisational than his mainstream pop work, featuring murky production and demo-like tracks that reflect a tumultuous period in his personal life. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee, the album embraces a scrappy, idiosyncratic sound that aligns with modern pop trends. The result is a messy yet often beautiful collection that showcases a more instinctual and less polished side of the superstar.</p>
