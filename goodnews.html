          <p>As the alliance between President Trump and Elon Musk dissolves, a debate has emerged regarding Musk's impact on Trump's 2024 election victory. Trump claims he would have won regardless of Musk's support, while Musk asserts that Trump would have lost without his financial contributions. Musk spent nearly $300 million supporting Trump's campaign, focusing heavily on Pennsylvania. Some strategists believe Musk's efforts significantly aided Trump, while others maintain that Trump's victory was inevitable. The differing perspectives highlight the complexities of assessing individual contributions to election outcomes.</p>

          <p>A civil jury found that Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer retaliated against a high-ranking female prosecutor, Tracy Miller, after she raised concerns about his conduct.

          <p>The government has banned several water companies from paying bonuses to senior executives due to their failure to meet environmental and consumer standards. The measures apply to companies that are not financially resilient or have been convicted of a criminal offense. Six firms, including Anglian Water and Thames Water, are affected by the ban. The ban is backdated to April 2024, allowing the regulator Ofwat to claw back bonuses already paid. This move follows growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills.

          <p>On the 50th anniversary of Philippines-China relations, there is a call for improved diplomacy between Manila and Beijing. An overemphasis on the sea dispute has strained broader connections, hindering economic cooperation and stigmatizing people-to-people exchanges. Allowing security issues to dominate relations is neither wise nor strategic. Other Southeast Asian coastal states assign less publicity to their sea rows and employ more effective strategies. The two countries should find areas to work together without compromising their positions.</p>
