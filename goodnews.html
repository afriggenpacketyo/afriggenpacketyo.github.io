          <p>Tesla experienced a significant rebound in Australian electric vehicle sales in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months. Vehicle sales jumped to 3,897, primarily driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y compact SUV. While Model Y sales soared, Model 3 sales dropped significantly, but the overall deliveries in Australia were up 9.3% year over year and surged over 675% from April. Despite this positive trend, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the previous year, and globally, the company faces headwinds.</p>
