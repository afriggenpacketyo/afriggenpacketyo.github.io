          <p>False claims circulating on Chinese social media that Poland sent troops to Ukraine have been debunked. The misinformation appears to stem from a misinterpretation of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's comments about Poland sending military representatives for drone defense training, which Poland's Ministry of Defense clarified would occur on Polish territory. The article traces how these inaccurate reports were amplified by Chinese content farms, which often use sensationalist headlines to create "informational chaos" that aligns with Chinese and Russian narratives portraying NATO as an aggressor.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a call to finalize a deal aimed at preventing a U.S. ban on the social media platform TikTok. The call follows an agreement on a "framework" to address U.S. national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A federal law had mandated ByteDance to divest its American operations or face a shutdown, but President Trump, who has expressed his fondness for the app, has repeatedly extended the deadline. The successful negotiation aims to preserve TikTok's operations in the United States while satisfying regulatory requirements.</p>

          <p>SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced that the agency will propose a rule change that could allow publicly traded companies to report earnings on a semiannual basis instead of quarterly. The move follows a call from President Donald Trump, who argued that less frequent reporting would save money and encourage a focus on long-term corporate strategy. Atkins stated that if the rule is approved, companies could choose their preferred reporting cadence, aligning U.S. markets with practices already followed by some foreign issuers. The proposal has sparked debate, with supporters citing long-term focus and opponents raising concerns about reduced transparency for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is purchasing additional shares of Boeing, citing optimism about the company's future prospects under the Trump administration's trade policies. The club's thesis is based on an increase in aircraft orders stemming from new trade agreements and the anticipation of a major order from China. The article suggests that President Trump's ongoing negotiations, including a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, could serve as a catalyst for the aerospace giant's stock. The company is also noted for improving operational results and a strengthened balance sheet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charity in the country for decades, were freed following mediation efforts by Qatar. Their family expressed immense relief, having previously raised concerns about the couple's deteriorating health and harrowing prison conditions, which reportedly included being chained to other prisoners. The release highlights the complex diplomatic channels required to assist foreign nationals in Afghanistan since the Taliban's return to power.</p>

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has stated his support for two more interest rate cuts this year, in addition to the one approved this week. He believes the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will be a temporary, "one-time effect," leaving room for the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy further. Kashkari's more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite current inflation running above the Fed's 2% target. He emphasized that the central bank is not comfortable with 3% inflation but sees justification for additional cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year note reaching a two-week high, as investors assessed the economic outlook after the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. While a rate cut typically pushes yields down, investors in long-term debt are also weighing factors like future economic growth, inflation, and government finances. Recent positive data, including a significant weekly decline in jobless claims, has reassured investors that an economic slowdown might be avoided. This has contributed to the counterintuitive rise in long-dated yields despite the Fed's dovish monetary policy shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative. The new provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in qualified tips annually from 2025 to 2028, with the benefit phasing out for higher earners. The guidance specifies which occupations are eligible and confirms that automatic gratuities will not qualify because they are not voluntary payments. However, the regulations exclude workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare and legal services, from eligibility for the new tax break.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a "B2B2C" (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the impact of trade war tariffs on consumer prices. In this system, a third-party intermediary acts as the merchant of record, purchasing products from the retailer at a wholesale price and then handling the shipping and tariff payments. Because tariffs are paid on the lower wholesale price rather than the final retail price, the overall cost is significantly reduced. This strategy, sometimes called "tariff hacking," allows brands to maintain consistent pricing across markets and avoid passing on tariff-related increases to their customers.

          <p>This opinion article challenges the validity of some widely circulated, gloomy projections about China's future population decline. The author points out that forecasts predicting a drastic fall often lack clear justification when compared to projections for other countries like the United States, which is expected to grow. The piece contrasts these international models with forecasts from Chinese researchers at Renmin and Peking Universities, which suggest a more moderate scenario with China's population stabilizing around 1.12 billion by the end of the century. The article urges readers to consider these alternative data points with skepticism.</p>

          <p>As annual fees for premium travel credit cards like the American Express Platinum and Chase Sapphire Reserve increase, consumers are advised to carefully analyze whether the benefits justify the cost. Financial experts suggest focusing on three key areas: airport lounge access, statement credits, and overall lifestyle fit. Cardholders should determine if they frequently use the affiliated lounges and if the available credits are for brands they already purchase from. If maximizing the perks requires significant effort or changes in spending habits, a lower-tier card with fewer, more practical benefits may be a better financial choice. (not investment advice)</p>
