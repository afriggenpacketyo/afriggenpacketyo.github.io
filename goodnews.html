          <p>Following two days of high-level discussions in London, the United States and China have agreed on a framework to implement the Geneva trade consensus. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the agreement addresses Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports and potential rollbacks of U.S. tech sales restrictions. The deal requires approval from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping, indicating that unresolved details still need internal discussion. This framework reflects a mutual commitment to de-escalation and continued dialogue, though the extent of concrete agreements remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked President Trump's tariffs, allowing them to remain in place until at least the end of July. The appellate judges have scheduled oral arguments for July 31, meaning the tariffs will stay in effect unless further court action occurs. The tariffs, imposed on imports from various countries including Canada, China, and Mexico, have been justified by Trump using a 1977 law that allows the president to regulate imports during emergency situations. The trade war has faced criticism from both parties, but Trump maintains the tariffs are necessary to fix trade imbalances.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer wants to focus on stocks that appeal to younger investors but are often overlooked by Wall Street analysts. He suggests reviewing companies related to cryptocurrency, nuclear energy, and quantum computing. Cramer mentioned names like Hut 8, Riot Platforms, and CleanSpark in the crypto space, and Oklo, Cameco, and BWX Technologies in the nuclear sector. He also noted that while some may see these as the wild west, it's worthwhile to shed some light on companies with significant trading activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Accidental Discovery in Planetarium Show Suggests Spiral Structure in Oort Cloud</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 19:55:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An accidental discovery during the preproduction of a planetarium show has revealed a spiral structure within the Oort Cloud, challenging the widely held belief that it is spherical. The spiral was found in data provided by Oort Cloud expert David Nesvorny, who confirmed its presence and published a paper in *The Astrophysical Journal*. Simulations suggest the spiral is caused by the galactic tide, the gravitational field of our galaxy, acting on objects in the inner part of the Oort Cloud. The discovery may help scientists understand how solar systems evolve and the potential building blocks of life in the Oort Cloud.</p>
