          <p>Amid record credit card debt, many Americans are considering debt management programs as a solution. This article outlines the three primary requirements for enrollment: having a steady and sufficient income to make consistent payments, possessing a manageable amount of unsecured debt within program limits, and demonstrating a willingness to commit to the program's rules. These rules often include closing credit accounts and participating in financial counseling, making it a disciplined path toward paying off balances. (not investment advice)</p>
