          <p>A measure in President Trump's reconciliation bill aimed at restricting federal payments to large abortion providers is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans, potentially jeopardizing the bill's passage. Representative Mike Lawler raised concerns about the definition of "large groups" providing abortion services, questioning the need for the measure given the existing Hyde Amendment. With a slim majority, House Republicans can't afford much dissent, and the bill also includes spending cuts related to Medicaid work requirements and healthcare for illegal immigrants, as well as repealing Biden's green energy subsidies.</p>
