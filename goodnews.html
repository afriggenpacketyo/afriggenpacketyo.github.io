          <p>Singer-songwriter Ben Folds has shared insights into his process of writing songs for the new animated musical "Snoopy Presents: A Summer Musical." Folds explained that he aims to capture the deep, empathetic, and nuanced world of "Peanuts," which he feels is rare in children's programming. He also discussed his decision to step down as the National Symphony Orchestra’s artistic advisor at the Kennedy Center, stating he could not be a "pawn" in what he described as Donald Trump's power play there. Folds emphasized his commitment to creating art that maintains a semblance of hope in the current era.</p>

          <p>Actress Halle Berry seemingly responded to recent remarks made by her ex-husband, former MLB player David Justice, regarding their past marriage. In a podcast appearance, Justice suggested their relationship ended partly because Berry did not cook or clean and did not seem "motherly." Shortly after, Berry posted a photo on Instagram showing her laughing with her current partner, Van Hunt, accompanied by the caption, "Phew…! cooking, cleaning and mothering." The witty post was interpreted by many as a direct and humorous rebuttal to Justice's decades-old criticisms of their marriage, which ended in 1997.</p>

          <p>A copy of "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" has been returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after its 1943 due date. The book was discovered among the possessions of a deceased man by his child, who mailed it back from Oregon with an explanatory letter. The sender noted that their grandmother likely checked out the book before moving to Mexico City for a U.S. Embassy job. Fortunately for the family, the library ceased charging late fees in 2021, avoiding what would have been an almost $900 fine.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos-backed Slate Automotive is positioning itself to disrupt the electric vehicle market with a simple, low-cost, and highly customizable pickup truck. The company's strategy is to offer a barebones, two-seat base model and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into a five-seat SUV. Slate's primary selling point is its price, which was initially advertised as under $20,000 with federal tax credits. With those incentives expiring, the company faces the challenge of remaining competitive at a higher price point against established models like the Ford Maverick.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares experienced a significant rally following the disclosure that activist hedge fund Starboard Value increased its stake in the company by 47% during the second quarter. This move has fueled market speculation that a new round of investor activism could pressure management to enhance profitability and refocus on core business growth, similar to a successful campaign in 2023. Analysts suggest this renewed pressure could help revive the company's stock, which has underperformed recently due to concerns about its AI strategy and acquisition plans.

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester involved in the opposition to Atlanta's police training center, known as 'Cop City.' The judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to secure an indictment more than two years after their arrest. Marsicano's attorney argued the state was purposely delaying the case, effectively making the process the punishment. This decision marks a significant victory for opponents of the training center, although Marsicano still faces separate RICO conspiracy charges in Fulton County.</p>

          <p>Recent research highlights the potential health benefits of cloves, a common kitchen spice that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. The spice contains eugenol, a compound with natural antimicrobial properties that can help control oral bacteria and reduce the risk of gum disease. Studies also suggest that clove extract may help lower blood sugar levels after meals. Additionally, cloves are a rich source of essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, and they possess antioxidant properties that can help prevent cellular damage, making them a valuable addition to a healthy diet.</p>

          <h2>Review: Horror Film 'Weapons' Delivers a Cathartic Yet Unsettling Conclusion</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zach Cregger's new horror film, "Weapons," is being praised for its daring narrative, which provides clear answers to its central mystery about a group of third-graders who mysteriously vanish one night. The article describes the movie as a story about community tragedy that successfully builds to a cathartic climax where the villain is defeated. However, the review also notes that the film powerfully underscores the fallacy of such closure, reminding the audience that vanquishing the source of evil does not erase the trauma it has already caused, making it a uniquely feel-bad, feel-good experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article from Deutsche Welle fact-checks President Trump's recent claims that crime is 'out of control' in Washington, D.C., which he used to justify a federal takeover of the city's police. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 compared to states, it was not the highest among major U.S. cities. More importantly, the article notes that Trump's justification omits the fact that violent crime and homicides in the city have seen a significant decrease in 2024 and 2025. This downward trend aligns with a nationwide reduction in crime, making the president's portrayal of a current crisis misleading.</p>

          <p>A review in The Atlantic reflects on Muriel Spark's most famous novel, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," highlighting the author's masterful narrative control and exploration of morality. The story centers on an eccentric teacher in 1930s Edinburgh and the group of young students she takes under her wing, known as the 'Brodie set.' The article notes that the book is less about Brodie herself and more about the profound and lasting influence a charismatic figure can have on impressionable adolescents. It delves into how the main character, Sandy, ultimately finds her own path by converting to Catholicism, dethroning her teacher's authority.</p>

The 450,000-square-foot production campus will be the largest in the state and is expected to serve as a home base for Sheridan-produced shows like "Landman" and "Lioness." This venture represents a significant boost for Texas's entertainment industry, which recently increased its film incentive program to $1.5 billion over the next decade. The new studio aims to anchor North Texas as a central hub for global film production.</p>
