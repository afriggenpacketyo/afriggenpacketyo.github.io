          <p>Cardinal Vincent Nichols, a senior Roman Catholic leader from England and Wales, shared his experience of participating in the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV, describing it as an "immensely peaceful" process. Speaking to the BBC, Cardinal Nichols highlighted the absence of rancor or politicking among the cardinals during the highly secretive meeting within the Vatican's Sistine Chapel. The article emphasizes the calmness and solemnity of the conclave, where cardinals focused on prayer and reflection, free from external communication, to choose the new Pope following the death of Pope Francis. Cardinal Nichols noted that the experience taught him patience and allowed for deeper reflection.</p>
