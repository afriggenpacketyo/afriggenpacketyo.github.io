          <p>Neuroscientist Mark Blumberg discusses the complexities of animal behavior and the limitations of the term "instinct." He argues that behaviors are species-typical, arising from a combination of genetic predispositions, environmental experiences, and learning. Blumberg uses the example of a tailorbird sewing leaves to create a nest to illustrate the interplay of innate abilities and environmental factors. He emphasizes that behaviors grow up in bodies under environmental experiences and explicit learning, and all of those things are going to shape them.</p>

The expert contends that the increase in autism rates is primarily due to expanding diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, not a novel environmental factor. The article highlights the significant progress in genetics research, which has identified hundreds of genes associated with autism and facilitated the development of potential therapies. It warns that Kennedy's emphasis on environmental factors could divert resources from promising genetic research and muddy the understanding of autism.</p>
