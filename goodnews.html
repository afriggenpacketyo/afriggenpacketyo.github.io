          <p>Roy Cooper, the former two-term Democratic governor of North Carolina, has officially announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2026. He is seeking to fill the seat of retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis. In his announcement video, Cooper framed his campaign as a fight to protect the American middle class, criticizing recent federal policies for favoring corporations and the wealthy. Having previously served as the state's longest-serving attorney general, Cooper enters the race with significant political experience, and his bid is seen by Democratic leaders as a key opportunity to flip a Republican-held seat.</p>

          <p>Following deadly border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The agreement was brokered during talks in Malaysia, chaired by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as head of the ASEAN regional bloc. The conflict, which began after a land mine explosion, marked a rare military confrontation between ASEAN members. Both nations' leaders hailed the outcome as a vital first step towards de-escalation, a move also praised by former U.S. President Trump, who had warned of trade implications if hostilities continued.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Sphere is set to present its first full film experience with a screening of the 1939 classic, "The Wizard of Oz," beginning August 28. The project will utilize the venue's massive wraparound screen, 16k resolution, and advanced sound system to immerse viewers in the world of Oz. In partnership with Google Cloud, engineers used AI "outpainting" to expand the original film frames to fit the unique space. The experience will also incorporate 4D effects like motion, wind, and scent to enhance the feeling of being inside the movie's iconic scenes, such as the tornado.</p>

          <p>The first trailer for "Avatar: Fire and Ash," the third film in James Cameron's series, has been released, revealing a new fire-wielding Na'vi tribe known as the Mangkwan Clan, or Ash People. Led by the formidable Varang, played by Oona Chaplin, this clan inhabits a volcanic region and is positioned as an adversary to Jake Sully's family. The trailer also teases the introduction of another new group, the nomadic Wind Traders, and suggests the film will explore more complex moral themes beyond a simple "humans are bad, Na'vi are good" narrative. The movie is scheduled for release on December 19.</p>

          <p>A new study from Swiss universities suggests that the human immune system can be activated merely by the sight of an apparent infection, even in a virtual environment. Researchers showed participants virtual reality avatars, some of which appeared sick with rashes or coughs. Brain monitoring and subsequent blood tests revealed that viewing the sick-looking avatars, especially as they moved closer, triggered an immune response, including increased activity of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). The findings open up potential therapeutic applications, such as using VR to modulate immunity for allergies or autoimmune diseases.</p>

          <p>This article from Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club outlines a decision to sell a portion of its holdings in the industrial company Eaton. The move is intended to lock in profits after the stock reached a new high, having gained about 20% year-to-date, partly in reaction to a new U.S.-EU trade deal. The club's analysis suggests that the specific market driving the stock's recent surge is not large enough to sustain the valuation. The cash raised from the sale will be used to potentially invest in other industrial stocks that are viewed as having more room for growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Maryland are developing new technology to combat spatial disorientation, a dangerous condition that contributes to 5-10% of general aviation accidents. The system uses haptic vibrations, delivered through a flight suit or pilot's seat, to provide sensory cues that help a pilot determine their orientation when visual and equilibrium senses are compromised, such as in bad weather. This technology functions similarly to lane departure warnings in cars, aiming to provide an intuitive, non-visual way to correct flight path. The FAA notes that 90% of accidents caused by pilot disorientation are fatal.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account is currently a better option for growing a $20,000 sum. By calculating potential earnings based on current interest rates, the analysis shows that short-term CDs with terms of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months consistently earn slightly more interest than a high-yield savings account. A key advantage of the CD is its fixed interest rate, which guarantees the return, whereas the rate on a high-yield savings account is variable and could decrease. Therefore, for guaranteed maximum earnings, a CD is presented as the superior choice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a declining population and record-low birth rates, the Chinese government will offer an annual subsidy of 3,600 yuan (about $500) per child for families with children under the age of three. This national policy follows similar initiatives by over 20 provincial governments, which have been offering financial incentives and extended leave to encourage couples to have more children. China's population has fallen for three consecutive years, as young people are often deterred by high childcare costs and career pressures.

While teams like Spain's 2012 Euro winners popularized the "false nine," top clubs are now heavily investing in traditional strikers like Viktor Gyökeres and pursuing players like Alexander Isak. The success of Erling Haaland at Manchester City, a player who does not conform to the typical fluid forward role, signaled a shift. This analysis suggests that the role has evolved, with modern strikers combining a range of skills, but their primary function as a central goalscorer is once again highly valued.</p>

This article consults mortgage professionals on whether a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan is the better choice.

Conversely, HELOCs provide flexibility and could become cheaper if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. The best choice ultimately depends on the borrower's specific needs, risk tolerance, and whether they need a lump sum or flexible access to funds over time. (not investment advice)</p>
