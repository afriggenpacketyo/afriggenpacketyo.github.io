          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a formal deportation order, issuing the ruling just as flights were reportedly preparing for takeoff. The judge described the temporary restraining order as "extraordinary" but justified it by the government's hurried effort over a holiday weekend. Attorneys for the children argued the plan would violate legal protections, while the Justice Department claimed it was a repatriation effort. The order ensures the children will remain in U.S. custody for now.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey addressed a caller's question about the economic impact if many Americans became debt-free, arguing that the economy would not collapse. He asserted that while lenders and finance companies would suffer, overall spending would likely increase as people would have more disposable income for responsible purchases. Ramsey and his co-host dismissed the notion that the economy relies on consumer debt to prosper, suggesting a shift in financial power back to individuals. He believes such a change would lead to smarter spending and increased generosity. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 at Anfield thanks to a late, decisive free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai in the 83rd minute. The match, anticipated as an early test for two Premier League title contenders, was largely a cautious and tactical affair. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's conservative approach was criticized for missing an opportunity to secure a rare win at Liverpool's home ground. The result extends Liverpool's perfect start to the season and continues Arsenal's long winless streak at Anfield, which dates back to 2012, striking an early psychological blow in the title race.</p>

The storm, which is the 11th named storm of the season in the region, currently poses no immediate threat to land. Forecasters expect Kiko to strengthen over the next few days, predicting it will reach hurricane status by Tuesday as it moves westward across the ocean. At present, its maximum sustained winds are at 40 mph, just above the threshold for a tropical storm.</p>

          <p>Gordon Ramsay revealed on social media that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and has undergone surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from his face. The celebrity chef shared photos of a large bandage and stitch marks below his ear, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and is typically slow-growing with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early. Ramsay, known for his directness, has previously used social media to share health updates and cautionary advice with his fans.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, achieved his second recorded hole-in-one during the final round of the Junior Players Championship in Florida. The ace occurred on the par-three third hole at TPC Sawgrass from a distance of 177 yards. This follows his first hole-in-one, which he made just last December while playing alongside his father at the PNC Championship. The young golfer is steadily building his own legacy in the sport, demonstrating remarkable skill and precision at a prestigious junior tournament.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move the government says will support thousands of UK jobs into the 2030s. This strategic partnership aims to significantly strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 frigates designed to operate jointly in the North Atlantic to counter threats such as Russian submarines.</p>

          <h2>Financial Considerations for Employees Laid Off Shortly Before Retirement Eligibility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 12:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the difficult financial situation of being laid off just months before qualifying for retirement benefits, a scenario that can jeopardize pensions, 401(k) vesting, and healthcare coverage. It notes that while federal law prohibits firing an employee solely to prevent them from collecting benefits, proving such intent can be challenging. The piece advises weighing the value of a severance package against the potentially much larger long-term loss of retirement and health benefits. Consulting an attorney specializing in employee benefits is recommended before accepting any severance offer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. While the grand prize remains elusive, several smaller prizes were won, including a $1 million ticket sold in Worcester, Massachusetts, and three other tickets in the state that won $50,000 each. The upcoming Monday night drawing will be the 40th since the jackpot was last won on May 31. This is the largest Powerball prize offered since a $1.326 billion jackpot was claimed in Oregon in April 2024.</p>

          <h2>Massive Sea Urchin Removal Effort Revives California Kelp Forest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 12:00:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has achieved remarkable success by removing nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins from the ocean floor. Over the past decade, an army of divers has cleared over 80 acres of "urchin barrens," allowing the vital kelp forest ecosystem to rebound. The proliferation of urchins, caused by the decline of natural predators like sea otters, had decimated the kelp, which serves as a critical habitat and carbon sink. This successful effort is now seen as a potential model for restoring other struggling kelp forests around the world.</p>

          <p>Slovenian basketball superstar Luka Dončić recorded only the fourth triple-double in EuroBasket history since 1995, leading his team to an 86-69 victory over Belgium. The Dallas Mavericks player scored 26 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and provided 11 assists, securing Slovenia's first win of the tournament. The dominant performance was crucial for Slovenia's chances of advancing to the knockout stage after losing their first two games. Dončić also became the youngest player to reach 400 career points in the tournament since Tony Parker did so in 2007.</p>
