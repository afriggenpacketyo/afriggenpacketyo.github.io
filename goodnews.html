The latest Consumer Price Index showed a slight 0.1% increase in inflation, delaying any potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve until September. Experts advise comparing mortgage lenders to find the lowest rates and fees, and lower rates are typically extended to those with higher credit scores and lower debt-to-income ratios.

Critics argue that the bill's benefits are overstated, and its impact is undermined by the Trump administration's trade wars and increasing federal debt. Some Republicans are highlighting the bill's inadequacies, pointing to subsidies and economic interventions that inflate the touted benefits.

The beats on "Smart Girls" were handled by legendary hip-hop producer Matt Dike, and Wilson sent out copies of "Smart Girls" as a cassette single that Christmas to fans.
