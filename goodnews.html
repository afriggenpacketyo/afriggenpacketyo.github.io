          <p>Brazilian Civil Police arrested two suspects in connection with an alleged bomb plot targeting Lady Gaga's free concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The suspects, reportedly Lady Gaga fans, were allegedly planning to use improvised explosives, including Molotov cocktails, though no explosives were found during the operation. Authorities say the two are part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence, with one suspect also found in possession of child pornography. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat ahead of the singer's performance, which drew over two million fans.</p>

          <p>Saturday Night Live's "Forever 31" sketch, featuring Quinta Brunson, parodied the fashion choices and anxieties of millennial women. The sketch showcased stylish yet comfortable clothing for women who are "stylish but tired," capturing the realities of navigating life in their 30s. Unlike previous parodies, the sketch did not mock the clothing or the women wearing them, but rather highlighted the relatable experience of prioritizing comfort and practicality. The humor came from the relatable experiences of millennial women who have lived through multiple culture-shocking events and are more focused on comfort than trends.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With America facing a shortage of millions of homes, innovative solutions are emerging to address the affordable housing crisis. One approach involves retrofitting single-family homes into multi-unit dwellings, like "roommate houses," to maximize existing housing stock, while another involves building backyard cottages. California's ADU laws have spurred an entrepreneurial boom, and companies are helping homeowners subdivide lots. These strategies aim to add housing in existing neighborhoods without major disruption, offering a way to increase housing density without constructing large apartment complexes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marvel and Disney's latest release, "Thunderbolts*," has proven a hit at the box office, earning an estimated $162 million internationally. The film, based around lesser-known superheroes, has received mixed reviews from critics but a high audience score. Some critics note that the film is the best thing to come from Marvel since WandaVision, but that the topics covered, including suicide, depression and domestic violence are "not always sensitively handled", while others praise the film as "the best Marvel movie in years". The film's success is potentially due to audience fatigue with main Marvel Cinematic Universe characters.</p>
