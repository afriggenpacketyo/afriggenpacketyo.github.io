          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, are now available at GP surgeries in England, but only for individuals meeting strict criteria. NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to manage demand and resources, prioritizing those most in need, such as individuals with a BMI of 40 or over and specific health conditions. Eligible patients will also receive wrap-around care, including regular check-ups and advice on exercise and healthy eating. Some GP practices have cautioned that only a few patients will initially qualify, and training is needed for healthcare staff to administer the drug safely. The long-term plan is for the jabs to be more widely available, but a staggered approach is needed to reach those most at need, manage GPs' workload and NHS resources.</p>

          <p>NATO allies are set to pledge increased defense spending at their annual summit, with the U.S. pushing for a target of 5% of GDP. This includes 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure like cyber warfare capabilities. While some members are committed, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold. The stakes are high due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East, but analysts question whether these pledges will translate into concrete action.
