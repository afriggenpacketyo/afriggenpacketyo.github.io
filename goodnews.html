          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 over five years to quit their jobs and move to Taiwan for a 13-month sabbatical with their young son.

The experience proved transformative, leading them to re-evaluate their career priorities and realize they could live happily on less, while also providing time for personal growth and welcoming a second child.</p>

          <h2>Debut Novel 'The Hounding' Explores Themes of Femininity and Fear</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is a book review of a story set in 18th-century England where five mysterious sisters are accused of witchcraft after being seen transforming into dogs. The article explores how the novel directly engages with the historical subtext of witch stories, where femininity itself is perceived as a threat. While praising the book's lush and violent prose, the review notes that the novel sometimes states its feminist themes too bluntly, though it ultimately succeeds in showing how persecution feels new and startling to each life it touches.</p>

          <p>A coalition of European leaders, including those from the UK, France, and Germany, issued a joint statement emphasizing that a lasting peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Kyiv's involvement. This came ahead of a planned one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, which currently does not include Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. While European leaders welcomed Trump's efforts to stop the war, sources indicate the White House remains open to a three-way meeting, though Putin has requested a bilateral summit.</p>

          <p>According to Cepee Tabibian, founder of a community that helps women move abroad, Albania is an increasingly popular yet often overlooked destination for Americans. The country offers significant advantages, including a low cost of living, with apartments available for under $500 a month, and a unique visa policy allowing Americans to stay for up to a year without paperwork. Combined with its stunning natural landscapes and a welcoming local culture, Albania is becoming an attractive option for those seeking a "soft landing" in Europe.</p>

This psychological trait, an evolutionary adaptation for survival, now leaves people prone to doomscrolling and overlooking genuine signs of progress in the world.

Recommendations include opting for pasture-raised products over factory-farmed ones, eating larger animals like cows instead of many smaller ones like chickens, and being mindful of misleading welfare labels on food packaging.</p>
