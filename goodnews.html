          <p>Singer Anastacia, celebrating the 25th anniversary of her debut album "Not That Kind," shared anecdotes from her career, including being asked by Arnold Schwarzenegger to perform the same song 12 times at his birthday party. She recounted her difficult start in the music industry, where executives struggled to market her unique voice and appearance, often telling her to sound more like Celine Dion. Despite being blacklisted from major US radio stations, she found immense success internationally and expressed gratitude for the relative anonymity she enjoys in her home country, a sentiment shared with her by Beyoncé and Bono.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates a 46% increase in cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older between 2021 and 2023, reflecting a diminishing stigma and growing belief in its medicinal benefits for conditions like pain and PTSD. With marijuana now legal for medical or recreational use in most states, many seniors are turning to edibles and other products as alternatives to traditional medicine. However, some medical professionals caution against potential health risks, citing research that links cannabis use to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, regardless of the method of consumption.</p>

His return is the first of several anticipated reinforcements for the Dodgers, with pitcher Alex Vesia and utility player Tommy Edman also expected back soon, as the team aims to regain momentum for its playoff push.</p>

          <p>A port operator in Dalian, China, is establishing a new fruit transit center to support a 'durian express' shipping service, aiming to deliver fresh durians from Southeast Asia to the country's northeast region faster. This new service is expected to reduce shipping times from up to twelve days to as little as six, enhancing the freshness of the popular fruit for approximately 100 million consumers in the area. The initiative addresses logistical challenges in a region that has been a relatively underpenetrated market for durians compared to southern and eastern China, which are geographically closer to key suppliers like Malaysia and Thailand.</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Pass Bill Targeting Deceptive Online Puppy Sales</h2>

          <p>California's legislature has passed a bill aimed at curbing the pipeline from out-of-state puppy mills by banning online pet brokers who deceptively market commercially bred dogs as being from small, local operators. The legislation, which now goes to the governor, targets online marketplaces and middlemen who sell dogs, cats, or rabbits bred by others for profit. This move closes a loophole in a 2019 law that banned pet stores from selling such animals but did not cover the burgeoning online sales market. The bill is part of a package of legislation prompted by investigations into fraudulent pet sales.</p>

          <p>A major security operation involving police drones and a temporary airspace restriction will be implemented over Windsor for President Donald Trump's upcoming state visit to the UK. King Charles will host the president and his wife at Windsor Castle, prompting Thames Valley police to enforce a round-the-clock operation. The order will prohibit non-police drones and small aircraft from flying in the protected area during the visit and its rehearsal. This will be Trump's second state visit, an unprecedented gesture for a U.S. president, with protest groups already planning demonstrations in London and near the castle.</p>

          <p>England's Test cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has expressed frustration with the common perception of his team's aggressive playing style, often dubbed "Bazball." He stated that the idea they simply swing the bat recklessly is a "disrespectful" misconception that overlooks the hard work and strategic determination of the players and staff. McCullum, who dislikes the term, clarified that his coaching philosophy is about creating an environment where players can handle pressure and express their talent without being restricted by tension. This approach has revived the team, which had won only one of its previous 17 matches before he took charge.</p>

          <p>Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term after his Labour Party emerged as the top party in the country's parliamentary election with approximately 28% of the vote. The result allows Stoere to maintain a governing majority with the support of four other left-leaning parties, securing 87 of the 170 seats in parliament. The election campaign focused on domestic issues like the rising cost of living and public services, as well as the stability of an incumbent government amid international turmoil. The populist Progress Party on the right also saw significant gains, doubling its score from the 2021 election.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that several recent pessimistic narratives surrounding major tech companies have proven to be unfounded. He pointed to fears that Alphabet would be broken up by a DOJ monopoly ruling, which did not materialize, and concerns over Amazon's web services falling behind Microsoft, which the market has since moved past. Cramer also discussed Apple's recovery from worries about its AI strategy and noted that even after a price target cut, Nvidia's performance remains exceptionally strong. He concluded that negativity can be easily generated in the market, but reversals are often ignored. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family succession dispute has concluded with a $3.3 billion settlement that cements Lachlan Murdoch's control over key media assets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. The deal resolves a legal battle initiated after his siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—opposed their father Rupert's attempts to amend a family trust to favor Lachlan. Under the agreement, the three siblings will relinquish their shares and roles in the companies, receiving their inheritance through a new, separate trust. This ensures the conservative ideological direction of the media empire will continue under Lachlan's leadership.</p>

          <p>China has demonstrated a remarkable ability to reduce pollution while simultaneously expanding its industrial base, a process described as "industrialisation-driven decarbonisation." From 2015 to 2022, the country cut average annual PM2.5 air pollution levels by over 35%, an achievement comparable to what the U.S. accomplished in three decades under the Clean Air Act. This success is attributed to a massive investment in green infrastructure, the deployment of cutting-edge technology, and the use of real-time environmental monitoring. The approach has led to significant improvements in both air and water quality across the nation.</p>
