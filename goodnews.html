          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from May's downturn. This survey primarily covers smaller, export-oriented firms and suggests a boost from front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. While it points to some resilience in the manufacturing sector, economists note the divergence from the official, broader PMI. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed through significant housing reform legislation aimed at accelerating construction by easing environmental review standards. The new laws, AB 130 and SB 131, exempt most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often criticized for causing delays and litigation. Newsom used a "poison pill" provision in the state budget to force the bills' passage, sidestepping opposition from some labor and environmental groups. Experts believe these are the most substantial CEQA reforms in decades, potentially unblocking numerous housing projects.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify Compound Produced During Exercise That May Slow Aging</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may play a key role in slowing the aging process. Their research reveals that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and the aging of multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding helps explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The study, published in the journal Cell, suggests that it may be possible to develop anti-aging strategies that simulate the positive effects of exercise by targeting this pathway.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has posited that a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing market dynamics by favoring bold, idea-driven companies over traditional blue-chip stocks. He argues these investors reward innovative concepts, citing the rise of companies like Robinhood, Reddit, and DoorDash, which they believe could yield immense future earnings. According to Cramer, this cohort is less concerned with Federal Reserve policies and more focused on compelling company narratives and growth potential. This shift indicates a move towards a "story-dominated market" where individual stock ideas hold more sway. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not yet seen appreciable price increases for goods on its platform, despite steep tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. He attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including significant forward buying by Amazon and its third-party sellers to build up inventory before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of the Amazon marketplace, with its two million sellers, helps keep prices down as many sellers will absorb costs to gain market share. This provides a buffer for consumers against the immediate impact of the trade policy.</p>

This translates to a drop of about ¬£11 a month for a typical household, providing some welcome relief for consumers. However, analysts caution that prices are unlikely to fall much further and remain hundreds of pounds above pre-pandemic levels, with significant uncertainty for the coming winter.
