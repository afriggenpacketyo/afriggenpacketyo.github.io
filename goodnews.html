          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is standing by his government's efforts to turn away asylum seekers at the country's borders, even after a court ruling blocked the move. The Berlin Administrative Court's decision was a setback for Merz, who promised to curb irregular migration after taking office last month. Merz maintains that border rejections can still be carried out within the framework of existing European law, aiming to protect public safety and prevent overburdening cities and municipalities. Critics have repeatedly challenged Merz's immigration policies as violating both German and EU law, citing insufficient evidence for a "national emergency."</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to exit polls. This victory would position him as the next leader after the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached following a declaration of martial law. Lee's eligibility for the presidency was previously questioned due to election law charges, but a final ruling was postponed. Experts predict Lee will face challenges reviving South Korea's economy and negotiating trade agreements with the U.S., potentially seeking to extend tariff talks beyond the agreed deadline.

          <p>Constellation Energy shares rallied 15% following the announcement of a 20-year agreement with Meta to supply nuclear power.

The agreement ensures the continued operation of the plant, which was at risk of closing when its zero-emission credit expired. The plant will not directly power Meta's data centers but will contribute to the tech giant's goal of 100% clean electricity.</p>

          <p>An article examines the potential for revitalizing manufacturing to help the heartland catch up with "superstar" cities. While manufacturing can create good-paying jobs, especially for those without a college education, some argue that it's not the only solution. Economists debate whether manufacturing can be an engine for widespread economic growth or if other tradable sectors are more effective. Tariffs may not be the best approach, and workforce development programs and subsidies may be more effective in revitalizing manufacturing.</p>
