        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics made a pilgrimage to Rome for the Holy Year, celebrating a newfound sense of welcome within the Catholic Church, a change many attribute to the late Pope Francis. A high-ranking Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing the Jubilee's historical purpose of restoring dignity to marginalized groups. Participants contrasted this experience with past pilgrimages where they felt shunned, highlighting Pope Francis's legacy of inclusion and Pope Leo's intention to continue it. The event signifies a major shift in the church's tone towards its LGBTQ+ members.</p>

          <p>School districts in 35 states are implementing cellphone bans using Yondr pouches, a solution that requires students to lock their phones in a magnetic pouch during the school day. The move aims to reduce classroom distractions and help students re-engage with in-person learning, a sentiment shared by many educators who felt phones were hindering education. While some students and parents have welcomed the change, others have expressed skepticism or tried to circumvent the system. The company behind the pouches reports significant growth as more schools seek to create phone-free educational environments.</p>

Yadegari, who learned to code at age seven and previously sold a gaming website for $100,000, developed the app to solve the tediousness of manual calorie tracking.

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated claims about rampant violence in cities like Chicago and Baltimore, an analysis of crime data reveals a different picture. Violent crime rates have been falling nationwide, and the four cities with the highest murder rates in 2024 are all located in Republican-led states. The article points out that Trump selectively targets cities in Democratic states while ignoring higher crime rates in red states. For instance, Chicago's 2024 homicide rate is significantly lower than that of Jackson, Mississippi, which has the highest rate in the nation.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its anti-corruption campaign within its financial sector, a move that analysts believe will ultimately improve governance and attract foreign investment over the long term. However, in the short term, the crackdown may not immediately boost confidence due to prevailing market uncertainties. The investigation of high-profile figures is seen as a response to the demand from international institutions for a cleaner business environment. The campaign is extending from banking into the stock market, signaling a comprehensive effort to reform the country's financial landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

The team has already built genetic profiles for two sets of remains, yielding thousands of living genetic matches.

For four years, Chris Bank has faced fines and legal challenges from the city, which claims his garden violates local ordinances that mandate a certain percentage of a yard must be turf grass. The city has revised its rules multiple times, recently reclassifying sunflowers as a "crop" and limiting them to 10% of the front yard. Bank, who sees his flowers as beneficial to the environment and local pollinators, has vowed to continue his fight against the regulations.</p>

Joy points to the significant hidden costs of homeownership, such as renovations and unexpected repairs, as well as the stress and labor involved in being a landlord. For her, the mobility and reduced mental load of renting have been more conducive to focusing on her businesses and career growth.</p>

The article connects this to the psychological freedom of realizing that people are not judging you as much as you think.
