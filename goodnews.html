        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor reported a 16.3% year-over-year U.S. sales increase for May, driven by an employee pricing program amidst rising tariff costs and vehicle price increases. The sales increase was led by a 17.2% increase in vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines and a 29% jump in hybrid models, offsetting a 25% drop in sales of all-electric vehicles. This marks the third consecutive year-over-year, double-digit sales increase for the automaker, supported by the 'From America, For America' employee pricing program that continues through the Fourth of July weekend. The pricing promotion was announced as President Donald Trump's 25% auto tariffs on imported vehicles took effect in early April.</p>

          <p>Meta has entered into a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase nuclear power, joining other tech companies in supporting the industry to meet the growing energy demands of data centers. Starting in June 2027, Meta will procure approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, representing the entire output of the site's nuclear reactor. This agreement will support the plant's continued operation and relicensing, which was at risk due to the expiration of zero-emissions credits. The deal will also expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts, contributing to Meta's goal of 100% clean electricity, though the plant will continue to provide power to the regional grid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that home equity line of credit (HELOC) rates may shift later in 2025, influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. HELOC interest rates, which have seen recent fluctuations, currently average around 8.14% and are closely tied to the fed funds rate. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet in June to discuss monetary policy, and while a rate cut is unlikely in June, potential cuts later in the year could impact HELOC rates. Homeowners should compare offers from various lenders and be aware of the risks associated with HELOCs, including the potential for foreclosure if payments are not met. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that new college graduates feel less prepared for participating effectively in work meetings compared to other forms of workplace communication.

          <p>Max Homa carried his own bag at a US Open qualifier after parting ways with his caddie, Bill Harke, just two months into their partnership. Homa, currently ranked 90th in the world, said he preferred to focus on his golf game rather than discuss the split. He ended up in a five-man playoff for the final spot to get to the US Open, but ultimately lost, suggesting that he may need to walk by himself more often, as it seemed to improve his game. Despite the setback, Homa is not entirely out of the US Open and is playing in the Canadian Open this week.</p>

          <p>Decision coach Nell Wulfhart advises individuals struggling with difficult choices to spend less time deliberating and avoid getting mired down in analysis.

She emphasizes that some regret is inevitable and that moving faster can minimize regret, as people often regret taking too long to make a decision more than making a decision too quickly. Wulfhart also recommends testing things out and limiting the number of people consulted for advice to three to five trusted individuals.</p>

          <p>A new COVID variant, NB.1.8.1, first detected in China, is spreading globally, accounting for 10% of SARS-CoV-2 sequences tested worldwide. The CDC is monitoring the variant, but only 20 sequences have been identified in the US. Infectious disease specialists say symptoms are similar to other variants, including cough, nasal congestion, fatigue, fever, sore throat, and muscle aches. There is no evidence suggesting the variant causes more severe disease, and scientists expect vaccines to hold up well, though protection versus infection may be limited.</p>

          <h2>Luang Prabang's Poverty-Free Status Raises Questions About Laos' Overall Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 08:22:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Luang Prabang in northern Laos has achieved a significant economic boom through tourism, becoming virtually free of poverty, but Laos as a whole still struggles with poverty and development. While Luang Prabang has seen a surge in tourism and infrastructure improvements, generating substantial revenue and lifting thousands of families out of poverty, Laos faces challenges such as inflation, public debt, and reliance on agriculture. Analysts suggest that not all tourism benefits the local population, and that the country needs to focus on improving agriculture and logistics to reduce poverty nationwide. The province demonstrates how tourism can significantly reduce poverty, but the country as a whole still has a long way to go.</p>
