          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a threatened tariff hike by the Trump administration. The deal establishes a 15% tariff rate on many EU imports, a reduction from the proposed 30%, and includes provisions for tariff-free trade on select items like aircraft and some generic drugs. The EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years, although some details, such as tariffs on European wine, are still being negotiated. The legality of the tariffs remains under judicial review, with a case pending in an appeals court. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a significant slump in July, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to strengthen their roster by acquiring a position player before the trade deadline, with a focus on improving outfield defense. While the team's superstar hitters have struggled, defensive weaknesses have also become a glaring issue. Veteran Harrison Bader of the Minnesota Twins has emerged as a prime target due to his elite defensive skills and solid offensive performance this season. The potential move suggests the Dodgers are prioritizing run prevention to support their strong starting pitching as they prepare for a postseason run.</p>

          <h2>Hulk Hogan's Lawsuit Against Gawker Left a Lasting Legacy on Media and Privacy Rights</h2>

          <p>The death of Terry Bollea, known as Hulk Hogan, brings his landmark legal victory against Gawker Media back into focus, a case that reshaped discussions on First Amendment rights and privacy. His successful $140 million lawsuit, filed after Gawker published a secretly recorded sex tape, led to the site's bankruptcy and set a powerful cultural precedent. Legal experts note that while it didn't create new law, the case served as a "shot against the bow" for media outlets, clarifying the limits of newsworthiness when publishing graphic content. It also affirmed privacy rights for both celebrities and ordinary citizens in the digital age.</p>
