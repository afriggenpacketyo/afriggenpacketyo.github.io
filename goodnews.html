        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts explained his decision to initially hold back ace reliever Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the NLDS, opting for Blake Treinen instead. Roberts cited Sasaki's workload management, given his recent return from injury and limited experience in a relief role. The strategy nearly backfired, leading Sasaki to enter the game for the final out anyway. Moving forward, Sasaki is confirmed as the primary option for save situations, though his usage will remain carefully balanced throughout the postseason due to his unique circumstances.</p>

          <p>Arizona Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon has reportedly been fined $100,000 for a sideline altercation with running back Emari Demercado. The incident occurred after Demercado fumbled before scoring a potential 72-yard touchdown, contributing to the team's 22-21 loss to the Tennessee Titans. Gannon apologized for letting "the moment get the better of me." This article details the disciplinary action, marking the first time an NFL head coach has been fined for a player altercation since Bruce Arians in 2022.</p>

          <p>Best-selling author and illustrator Charlie Mackesy revealed that much of his new book, "Always Remember," was lost when his iPad, containing many drawings and writings, was stolen from his car. The theft, along with personal grief over losing his mother and dog, extended the book's completion to six years. Mackesy, known for his uplifting messages, views the setback as a challenge to overcome and emphasizes the importance of connection through his art. He also shared his recent extravagance of planting 2,000 trees, reflecting a desire to give back.</p>

          <p>Spot gold prices have surged past $4,000 an ounce, hitting a record high due to investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst global economic and political uncertainty. The rally, which began after U.S. tariff announcements, is further fueled by delays in economic data release caused by the U.S. government shutdown. Analysts attribute the rise to a weakening U.S. dollar and increased retail investor interest, though they caution that prices could dip if the shutdown ends or interest rates rise.

          <p>The City of Dyersburg, Tennessee, has issued a boil water notice for specific areas following a significant water main line break. The incident caused a substantial loss of pressure in the drinking water system, prompting residents to boil water for three minutes or use bottled water for consumption, hygiene, and food preparation. City officials are actively repairing the line and expect to lift the notice within two days once pressure is restored and bacteriological tests confirm water safety.

This $35.6 million investment is part of a push to develop domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, aiming to secure U.S. supply chains and reduce reliance on China. Opponents, however, raise concerns about environmental harm to Alaskan landscapes. (not investment advice)</p>
