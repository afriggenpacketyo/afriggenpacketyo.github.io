          <p>The Canadian government has scrapped its planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies just hours before it was set to take effect. The reversal came after President Trump threatened to impose higher tariffs on Canadian imports and broke off trade talks, calling the tax a "blatant attack." Canada's finance minister stated the tax would be rescinded to facilitate a comprehensive trade agreement, with negotiations expected to resume. The tax would have imposed a 3% charge on Canadian revenue for tech giants like Google and Amazon, a policy that had been a long-standing irritant in U.S.-Canada relations.

Both banks saw their stress capital buffer requirements lowered more significantly than their peers, which could free up billions in capital. This easing of capital requirements may allow the banks to increase shareholder returns through dividends and stock buybacks, as well as pursue more loan growth and new investments. The results are seen as another sign of a more favorable regulatory environment for large banks under the current administration. (not investment advice)</p>
