          <p>China is actively expanding the use of its currency, the yuan, in Africa, viewing the continent as a key area for its global rollout. Recent agreements between the central banks of China and Egypt aim to facilitate yuan-based trade and investment, including enhancing electronic payment systems like UnionPay and CIPS, China's alternative to SWIFT. This move follows similar deals with other African nations like South Africa and Nigeria, signaling a strategic effort by Beijing to increase the yuan's international influence and reduce reliance on the US dollar.

          <p>Bank of America announced mixed financial results for the second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations on earnings but falling short on revenue. The bank reported earnings of 89 cents per share, slightly ahead of the 86 cents estimated, while its revenue of $26.61 billion was just below the anticipated $26.72 billion. These results come as other major financial institutions like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo posted stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue. The bank's performance reflects the complex economic environment influencing the U.S. financial sector's profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be retitled as "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The review, prompted by safety concerns and a lack of clarity over their roles, also suggests they wear distinct uniforms and not be responsible for making new diagnoses. This proposal aims to clearly define their supportive function within medical teams, following tragic cases where patients were treated by PAs they believed were doctors. The recommendation has sparked debate between doctors' unions and PA representatives.</p>

          <p>China has experienced a substantial increase in foreign entries during the first half of 2025, with 38 million trips marking a 30% year-on-year rise. Officials attribute this growth to the country's expanded visa-free transit and entry policies, which have successfully attracted more tourists and business travelers. These measures, which build upon earlier city-specific 72 or 144-hour transit policies, are part of a broader strategy to boost inbound tourism and consumption. The surge in visitors indicates the effectiveness of these facilitation measures in reopening the country to international travel and commerce.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Indonesia have finalized a trade agreement that will see U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods reduced from a threatened 32% down to 19%. In return, President Trump stated that Indonesia has agreed to provide "full access" for American firms and purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets. This deal is the latest development following the White House's spring tariff offensive, which targeted numerous major trading partners. While the agreement marks a de-escalation with Indonesia, high U.S. tariffs and unresolved issues remain with many other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's advertising watchdog has banned an ad for Trip drinks for making unauthorized claims that its products can "help you feel calm" and reduce stress. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that these claims, which were linked to ingredients like magnesium and L-theanine, were not permitted under health and nutrition regulations. The investigation found the language implied the drinks could treat anxiety, a prohibited claim. The ASA also found a "0g added sugar" claim to be inaccurate, ordering the company to not run the ad again and to cease making claims that its drinks can treat human disease.</p>

          <p>Singer Miley Cyrus has announced that she has "no desire" to go on a major tour, despite releasing a new album. Speaking on Good Morning America, she explained that the difficulty of maintaining her sobriety and mental health while on the road is a primary deterrent. Cyrus, whose last major tour was over a decade ago, feels there is insufficient support for artists' well-being during the demanding schedule of touring. Her decision comes after previously revealing she has a rare vocal cord condition that also makes touring challenging, highlighting a growing conversation around the pressures faced by major recording artists.</p>

          <p>A church deacon in Wayne, Michigan, is being praised as a hero for thwarting a mass shooting by ramming an armed attacker with his pickup truck. Richard Pryor saw the man, equipped with a rifle and tactical vest, begin firing in the church parking lot and advancing on the building. Realizing there was no time to wait for police, Pryor drove his truck directly into the shooter, temporarily stopping him and allowing the church's armed security team to intervene and fatally shoot the assailant. Pryor's decisive action is credited with saving the lives of over 100 congregants, including children.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that while cognitive functions like memory and processing speed naturally decline after age 40, certain lifestyle choices can significantly preserve brain health. A large-scale study called MindCrowd is examining "exceptional" brain performers who function like people 30 years younger. Early findings suggest that quality sleep, cardiovascular health, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol are crucial. Experts emphasize that managing vascular risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol can result in a "younger-looking" brain. These behaviors help maintain both the structural and functional integrity of the brain as people age.</p>

Moore, who runs a successful business restoring high-end Midcentury Modern pieces, is breaking from the trade's tradition of gatekeeping secrets. His mission aligns with a renewed interest in skilled trades among younger generations, aiming to preserve what he calls "a lost art."</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia has become the first publicly traded company to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization, cementing its position as the world's most valuable firm. The company's value has soared due to its dominance in producing the powerful chips essential for the booming artificial intelligence industry. A recent boost came from U.S. government approval to sell certain AI chips to China, which sent its stock price higher. Nvidia's technology powers everything from generative AI like ChatGPT to supercomputers, making it a central player in the current tech landscape, though it faces challenges from geopolitical tensions.

          <p>England's Tom Curry is reportedly set to be named as the starting openside flanker for the British and Irish Lions in their first Test match against Australia. This selection means that Wales' Jac Morgan, who has had a strong tour, is expected to miss out on the starting lineup. In the backline, an all-Scottish midfield is anticipated, with Sione Tuipulotu poised to start at inside centre alongside his Glasgow club-mate Huw Jones and fly-half Finn Russell. The official team announcement from head coach Andy Farrell is scheduled for Thursday, confirming the lineup for the highly anticipated series opener.</p>
