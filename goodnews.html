          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind a planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies, a move aimed at restarting trade talks with the United States. The decision came just hours before the first payments were due and followed a threat from President Trump to halt all trade negotiations over the tax, which he called a "blatant attack." The tax would have applied a 3% charge on Canadian revenues for tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta. White House officials have confirmed that negotiations will resume following Canada's reversal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo were identified by Wall Street analysts as the biggest winners of the Federal Reserve's 2025 stress tests, which assess how major banks would handle a hypothetical economic crisis. Both banks saw their stress capital buffer requirements lowered more significantly than their peers, signaling improved resilience since last year's tests. This reduction in capital requirements could allow the firms to increase share buybacks and dividends, as well as free up capital for new loans and investments. The results were viewed as further evidence of a more favorable regulatory environment for large banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Canada's decision to rescind its digital services tax (DST), a senior Trump administration official indicated that the White House will likely demand other countries do the same. National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett stated that countries with similar taxes should expect to face pressure from the U.S. government over what he termed "unfair trade practices." The comments signal an aggressive U.S. trade stance, using the threat of tariffs and stalled negotiations to dismantle digital taxes targeting American tech giants. The administration is reportedly preparing for a series of final decisions on tariffs for multiple countries. (not investment advice)</p>

While Luckin gained market dominance in China partly through lower prices, its initial U.S. menu prices appear to be comparable to those at Starbucks.

          <p>Financial experts suggest that the decision between opening a certificate of deposit (CD) or investing in the stock market depends heavily on an individual's financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. CDs are recommended for short-term goals as they offer a guaranteed, albeit lower, rate of return and protect the principal investment. In contrast, stocks offer higher potential long-term growth but come with significantly more risk and volatility, making them better suited for goals that are many years or decades away. Ultimately, experts note that it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing decision, as a balanced approach can serve different financial purposes. (not investment advice)</p>
