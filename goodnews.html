          <p>The Runcorn and Helsby by-election is extremely close, with Reform UK and Labour separated by only four votes, leading to a full recount. The election, triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury, is a significant test for Sir Keir Starmer's leadership as prime minister. Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed confidence in a victory, which would be the party's first by-election win, bringing their number of MPs to five. Reform is also hoping to gain ground in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral contest and council elections, while support for the party has been rising nationally.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to halt direct funding to NPR and PBS, instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to cease financial support. The order prevents indirect funding by prohibiting local public radio and television stations from using taxpayer dollars to support the organizations. The White House claims NPR and PBS have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer funds. NPR and PBS are primarily funded through a mix of public and private sources, including the CPB and private donations.</p>
