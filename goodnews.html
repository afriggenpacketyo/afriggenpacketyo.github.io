          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after more than a week of aerial attacks following Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear program. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war is over, according to Trump. Iran carried out a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday, two days after the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran. There are no reports of casualties at the base, according to a U.S. official, but the attack was in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs over Iran on Saturday, leading to what Trump called "Monumental Damage" to Iranian nuclear sites. </p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to insert the U.S. into the conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire, with Trump announcing that the two countries have agreed to halt hostilities. While neither Israel nor Iran has definitively confirmed the development, White House officials are touting it as a diplomatic breakthrough. The ceasefire follows a tumultuous day in the region, with Iran retaliating for U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, and the U.S. warning of an overwhelming response to any Iranian attacks on U.S. interests. If the ceasefire holds, it would mark a significant step back from the brink of a conflict that threatened to engulf the region.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Republican lawmakers congratulated President Trump, praising his negotiating skills. Democrats, however, appear to be withholding their congratulations, with no congratulatory messages from Democrat congressional leadership on social media. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated that the president admitting to unilaterally bringing the United States into a war without congressional approval is a grave and illegal admission. Representative Thomas Massie, who was pushing for a resolution requiring congressional approval before attacking Iran, said he would not advance the measure if the ceasefire holds.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer stated that international law is central to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government and its approach to foreign policy. He defended Starmer's decision to seek a "warm" relationship with President Trump, arguing it has enabled the UK to strike economic deals with the US, India, and the EU. Hermer emphasized the importance of complying with international law to serve the national interest, secure trade deals, and address fundamental problems like migration. He also highlighted the UK's commitment to being a good faith player in international law, which is essential for maintaining trust and securing international agreements.</p>

Harvard alleges that Trump is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to the administration‚Äôs demands to control the school‚Äôs governance, curriculum, and ideology.</p>

          <p>Chongqing, China's largest inland city, has evolved into a hub of international trade, thanks to the launch of two expansive cross-border rail networks. One rail network runs west to Germany, and the other extends south, reaching as far as Singapore, giving China faster, more reliable access to global markets. The city aspires to become a central node in the global economy, connecting Asia and Europe through rail. Shipping goods from Asean to Europe via Chongqing by rail is 10 to 20 days faster than traditional sea transport, and the city is deepening its global trade footprint amid rising geopolitical risks.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that the Iranian government provided "early notice" about missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying Iran's response to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites as "very weak." Trump thanked Iran for the early notice, which he said made it possible for no lives to be lost and nobody to be injured. Diplomatic sources indicated that the counterattack from Iran was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials meeting over the weekend to prepare. The move to give advance notice echoes Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq.</p>

          <p>NHS England will offer at-home HPV tests to women who have delayed coming forward for cervical screening, starting in January, in an effort to increase screening rates. The DIY test kits contain a long cotton-wool bud to swab the lining of the vagina and test for human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes most cervical cancers. The scheme aims to tackle barriers such as embarrassment, discomfort, lack of time, and religious or cultural concerns that keep women away from cervical screening. A recent trial showed that the rollout of home test kits could increase the proportion screened to 77% over three years.</p>
