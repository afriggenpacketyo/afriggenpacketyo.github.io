          <p>Public affairs network C-SPAN has reached agreements to be carried on YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, addressing financial pressures caused by the decline of traditional cable subscriptions. The move, which follows a U.S. Senate resolution urging streaming services to carry the network, will provide millions of new viewers with access to its unfiltered coverage of government proceedings. Facing a significant revenue drop over the past decade due to cord-cutting, these deals are crucial for the nonprofit's financial stability and its mission to offer transparent access to government.</p>

          <p>Following a drop in Salesforce's stock price after its latest earnings report, CEO Marc Benioff described the company's disappointing guidance as "appropriately conservative." Despite beating estimates on earnings and revenue, the forward-looking forecast concerned investors. In an interview, Benioff highlighted strong results, customer satisfaction with the company's AI products, and significant business with the U.S. government, including winning a deal over competitor Palantir. He also noted that Salesforce has used its own AI agents to reduce headcount in its service and support divisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova secured a place in her first US Open semi-final by defeating Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-3 in a powerful quarter-final performance. The victory served as redemption for Anisimova, who had suffered a heavy defeat to the Polish star in the Wimbledon final just weeks earlier. Anisimova displayed fearless and aggressive play, overcoming an early break to control the match with 23 winners. The win marks a significant career milestone for the 24-year-old, who is now the first American woman since the Williams sisters in 2002 to reach the semi-finals at Grand Slams on all three surfaces.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to freeze approximately $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling that the action violated the university's First Amendment rights. The administration had cited concerns over antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies when it halted the funds in April. However, Judge Allison Burroughs determined the government used these concerns as a "smokescreen" for an ideologically motivated attack, as the freeze was not the government's "true aim." The ruling vacates the freeze orders and blocks the administration from withholding further payments on existing grants.</p>

          <p>Five years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Los Angeles Unified School District has settled a lawsuit filed by parents who alleged the district failed to provide adequate education during campus closures. The agreement will provide at least 45 hours of high-dose tutoring per year to an estimated 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students over the next three school years. The lawsuit claimed that Black and Latino students were disproportionately harmed by the lack of live instruction and technology access. The settlement also mandates regular assessments and more transparent reporting on student progress.</p>

          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a federal judge decided against forcing Google to sell its Chrome web browser, a decision that caused parent company Alphabet's stock to surge by 9%. While Judge Amit Mehta had previously deemed Google a monopolist in online search, he described the potential divestiture of Chrome as "incredibly messy and highly risky." The ruling did impose other remedies, including requiring Google to share some of its search data with rivals to foster competition. The decision is seen as a major victory for Google, though some advocacy groups expressed disappointment that the penalties were not more severe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision for New York state, a judge has ruled that evidence from advanced whole genome sequencing can be used in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This cutting-edge DNA testing method, which can analyze degraded and rootless hair samples, linked Heuermann and his family members to hairs found on the remains of six victims. The ruling is a significant victory for prosecutors, establishing a new legal precedent for forensic evidence in the state. The defense immediately challenged the decision, arguing the lab used is not licensed in New York.</p>

          <p>This article outlines three key areas for investors to watch ahead of Broadcom's upcoming earnings report, highlighting the company's growing importance in the artificial intelligence sector alongside Nvidia. Investors should focus on Broadcom's AI revenue, which is projected to comprise nearly a third of its total revenue, and any management commentary on the demand for its custom AI chips (ASICs) versus GPUs. The piece also notes that Broadcom's massive market capitalization gives its financial results the potential to influence the broader stock market, particularly the concentration of value in top tech companies.

          <p>Veteran all-rounder Ravi Bopara scored a spectacular 45-ball century to lead Northamptonshire to a seven-run victory over Surrey in a rain-shortened T20 Blast quarter-final. The 40-year-old's unbeaten 105 rescued his team after an early collapse, powering them to a total of 154-4 from just 14 overs. Despite a strong chase led by Surrey captain Sam Curran, who scored an unbeaten 69, the home side fell just short. The victory sends Northamptonshire to Finals Day for the first time since 2016, the year they last won the competition.</p>

          <p>Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime has reached his first Grand Slam semifinal since 2021 with a hard-fought victory over Alex de Minaur at the US Open. Auger-Aliassime came from a set down to win the quarter-final match 4-6, 7-6 (9-7), 7-5, 7-6 (7-4). The result marks another quarter-final disappointment for Australia's de Minaur, who has now reached that stage at six major tournaments without advancing further. Acknowledging that the match was not always pretty due to nerves, Auger-Aliassime said he was willing to "dig really deep" for the win and is ready for his next challenge.</p>
