          <p>A superintendent in a low-income Pennsylvania school district is leveraging technology to make music education more accessible. By using over 30 3D printers, the California Area School District produces violins for just $50 each, a fraction of typical rental costs. This initiative provides the instruments to students for free, fostering confidence and a love for music in a community where over 70% of students are from low-income families. The program, inspired by a similar effort from the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, has successfully produced over 200 violins in five years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advise that the amount of money to invest in a certificate of deposit (CD) depends heavily on an individual's financial situation, including the stability of their emergency fund. When considering a CD, savers should compare potential returns against other low-risk options like high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts. It is also crucial to consider current and future interest rate trends, as the Federal Reserve's potential rate cuts could make locking in current CD rates advantageous. A strategy like CD laddering can help maintain liquidity while benefiting from higher interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated the group's agreement to the latest ceasefire proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The two-stage plan involves a 60-day temporary truce during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining 50 Israeli hostages. This period would also be used for negotiations on a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. This development follows a period of stalled talks, with Israel previously demanding the release of all hostages at once, while Hamas insisted on a complete end to the war before freeing any captives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has proposed the idea of a significant league realignment based on geography, which would coincide with future expansion to 32 teams. The proposal aims to reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason television slots, particularly for West Coast audiences. However, the idea has been met with criticism from many baseball fans who value the historical tradition of the separate American and National Leagues, which have existed for over a century. Potential expansion cities mentioned include Nashville, Tennessee, and Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>

          <p>Contrary to some claims, data from the Kiel Institute indicates that European nations combined have committed more financial, military, and humanitarian aid to Ukraine than the United States. Between January 2022 and June 2025, Europe's total support is calculated at $165.7 billion, compared to the U.S. contribution of $130.6 billion over the same period. While the U.S. remains the largest single national donor, the collective European effort is greater. The aid provided by both sides consists of a mixture of grants and loans, though the U.S. has offered more in grants while the EU has provided more in loans.</p>

This price is less than half of the medication's monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and the drug savings company GoodRx. This move aims to expand access for uninsured or underinsured patients and to compete with cheaper, unregulated compounded versions of the drug that gained popularity during previous shortages.</p>

          <p>Google and nuclear startup Kairos Power are partnering to deploy an advanced nuclear reactor on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid by 2030. The TVA has agreed to purchase up to 50 megawatts of power from the Hermes 2 reactor, which will help power Google's regional data centers. This collaboration is designed to advance new nuclear technology without placing the financial risk of construction on consumers, as Google and Kairos will bear the initial costs. The project aims to demonstrate that smaller, advanced reactors can be built more affordably and quickly than traditional large-scale nuclear plants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study in rural Kenya has found that giving no-strings-attached cash payments of $1,000 to low-income households can be as effective as medical interventions in saving infants' lives. Researchers found that infants born to families who received the cash were nearly half as likely to die compared to a control group. The payments were associated with a 48% drop in infant mortality, largely because the money enabled families to access better healthcare, such as hospital deliveries. The cash also led to better nutrition and allowed pregnant mothers to reduce physically taxing work.</p>
