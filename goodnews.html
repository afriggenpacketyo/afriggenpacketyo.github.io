          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian gang leader known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face drug and weapons smuggling charges. Macias, head of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape that triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador. His agreement marks a significant moment for Ecuador, making him the first citizen to be extradited under a new law aimed at combating organized crime. The move is seen as a major victory in President Daniel Noboa's declared war against the country's powerful drug mafias.</p>
