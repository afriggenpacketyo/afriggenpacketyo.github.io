        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. nuclear industry is experiencing a revival, centered on the Urenco uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico, which is the only commercial plant of its kind in the country. This resurgence is driven by surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers and a strategic push to expand domestic manufacturing. The situation is made more urgent by a forthcoming ban on Russian uranium imports, compelling the U.S. to rapidly scale its domestic supply chain, though significant bottlenecks in uranium conversion could hinder these ambitious expansion goals.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, received an early-stage diagnosis of the disease after she proactively pushed for early screening. Despite having no symptoms or lumps, a breast MRI she was granted due to her high-risk status revealed two suspicious masses. Her story underscores the critical importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as early detection dramatically improves survival rates for invasive ductal carcinoma, the most common type of breast cancer.</p>

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who died at 91, linked her personal health and ethical principles to her plant-based diet, which she adopted over 50 years ago. She famously stopped eating meat after looking at a pork chop and reflecting on the fear, pain, and death it represented. Citing her ethical opposition to factory farming and the severe environmental impact of the meat industry, her dietary choice was a core component of her broader activism for the planet and its inhabitants.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of American families are beginning to question the high cost of degrees from elite universities, shifting their focus from institutional prestige to practical outcomes like career placement and internship opportunities. With tuition prices soaring and graduates facing a challenging job market, many parents are prioritizing overall value and are more willing to choose less-famous schools that offer significant merit aid. This trend suggests a broader reevaluation of what defines a “good” college, as institutions emphasizing hands-on learning and career readiness gain favor.</p>

Scholars argue that the genre, which has been shaped by Euro-American perspectives that often project bleak, dystopian futures rooted in capitalism, can be used to present alternative visions. This cultural initiative is part of a broader effort by China to stake a claim on imagining the future and critiquing the present from a non-Western ideological framework.</p>
