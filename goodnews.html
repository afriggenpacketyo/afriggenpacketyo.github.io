          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested from its highly profitable investment in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD. The initial $230 million investment, made in 2008 at the strong recommendation of Charlie Munger, had grown substantially over 17 years. While Buffett praised BYD as an "extraordinary company," the decision to sell aligns with recent moves to reduce exposure to geopolitical risks associated with China, similar to the sale of its Taiwan Semiconductor stake. The company indicated it would find other investments for the capital.</p>

          <p>In response to inconsistencies and fracturing recommendations from national health agencies, several U.S. states are forming regional collaboratives to strengthen public health policies. The Northeast Public Health Collaborative, comprising seven states and New York City, aims to coordinate on issues like emergency preparedness and vaccine purchasing. This trend mirrors the West Coast Health Alliance and reflects a growing state-level effort to create reliable health guidance, particularly concerning vaccinations, as federal policies become more variable and politically influenced, creating a patchwork of regulations across the country.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: True Resilience Comes from Mastering Emotions, Not Suppressing Them</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 08:00:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that genuine strength and grit are not defined by the absence of emotion but by the ability to understand and manage one's feelings effectively. Citing psychological research, the author posits that suppressing emotions like anger and fear leads to brittleness, whereas acknowledging them allows for greater self-control and perseverance. The piece suggests that emotional mastery is a critical skill for navigating life's challenges, fueling personal and professional success. It concludes that true toughness is about harnessing emotions strategically rather than pretending they don't exist.</p>

          <p>The United States recently held a significant trilateral military exercise, named Freedom Edge, with allies Japan and South Korea, notably without deploying an aircraft carrier. This departure from standard practice has prompted speculation among analysts about its strategic implications for relations with China. Some experts suggest the move could be a deliberate de-escalation to facilitate diplomatic engagement with Beijing and Pyongyang. Others interpret it as a signal of the Trump administration's strategy to encourage Asian allies to take on more responsibility for regional security.</p>

          <p>Apple has asserted greater control over its hardware by introducing a suite of custom-designed chips in its new iPhone lineup, signaling a strategic pivot towards prioritizing on-device artificial intelligence. The new A19 Pro chip features a significant architectural change, adding neural accelerators to its GPU cores to enhance machine learning performance. Additionally, Apple has developed its own wireless chip (N1) and modem (C1X), reducing its reliance on external suppliers like Broadcom and Qualcomm. This vertical integration aims to improve efficiency, battery life, and user privacy by processing more AI tasks directly on the device.</p>

          <h2>Advocates Argue for Including Fertility and Reproduction Education in School Sex-Ed Curriculums</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical experts and individuals are calling for sex education in schools to include comprehensive information about fertility, not just pregnancy prevention. Many people, particularly women, reach adulthood with significant misconceptions about their reproductive biology, such as the timeline of fertility decline and factors affecting conception. This knowledge gap can lead to difficulties in family planning later in life. Proponents argue that a more robust curriculum could empower young people with the information needed to make informed decisions about their reproductive health, potentially helping them achieve their desired family size in the future.</p>

          <p>Kenyan athletes dominated the 51st Berlin Marathon, with Sabastian Sawe winning the men's race and Rosemary Wanjiru securing first place in the women's event. Sawe finished with a time of 2:02:15, while Wanjiru completed the course in 2:21:05. Despite Berlin's reputation as a fast course, both winning times were slower than world records, a factor attributed to the unusually warm and humid late-summer conditions in the German capital. The event saw over 55,000 participants, including celebrities like pop star Harry Styles and former German footballer André Schürrle.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane. The National Hurricane Center expects the storm to remain over open waters, passing east of Bermuda without making landfall.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are urging consumers to carefully assess the value of premium travel rewards credit cards as major issuers like American Express and Chase increase annual fees to over $500. While these cards offer perks such as airport lounge access and travel credits, their worth depends heavily on an individual's spending and travel habits. Carrying a balance on these high-interest cards can quickly negate the value of any rewards earned. Before applying, consumers should determine whether a general travel card or a brand-specific one better suits their lifestyle to ensure the benefits outweigh the significant cost.</p>

          <p>Despite a general decline in other forms of leisure, Americans' fascination with theme parks continues to grow, prompting operators to push the boundaries of ride engineering. In an era where immersive digital experiences are available on any smartphone, parks are creating increasingly intense and physically demanding attractions to offer something that cannot be replicated at home. Industry insiders note that to maintain their appeal, modern rides must deliver experiences that are more death-defying than ever before. This trend reflects a need to continually innovate to capture the attention of a public with ever-expanding entertainment options.</p>

          <p>Despite the struggles of the mainstream box office and the dominance of streaming, repertory cinemas in Los Angeles are experiencing a resurgence. Theaters like Vidiots, the New Beverly, and those run by American Cinematheque are drawing sold-out crowds by offering unique, curated communal experiences, such as screenings of rare 35mm prints and events with filmmakers. These independent venues have cultivated a niche audience of cinephiles who seek more than just passive viewing. Their success suggests a strong public desire for shared cultural events and a deeper engagement with the art of film that streaming platforms cannot replicate.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is expected to officially recognize a Palestinian state, a significant diplomatic move that diverges from the position of its close ally, the United States. The decision follows a deadline set by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had conditioned the recognition on Israel taking steps toward a ceasefire and long-term peace in Gaza. While largely symbolic, the move is intended to increase pressure for a two-state solution and keep the prospect of peace alive. The announcement comes ahead of the UN General Assembly, where other nations like France and Canada are also preparing to take similar steps.</p>
