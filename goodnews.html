          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Walmart will absorb some of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, a claim reportedly confirmed in a phone call with Walmart's CEO. This assurance comes after Walmart indicated it would need to raise prices due to the tariffs, prompting an angry response from President Trump. Bessent suggested that Walmart's initial statement was a worst-case scenario presented to avoid potential lawsuits. Trump's tariff strategy, which initially caused market turmoil, has since been partially walked back with reduced tariffs on China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Air Jordan sneaker, first released 40 years ago, revolutionized the sneaker industry and became the most successful basketball shoe in history. Howard White, a Nike veteran, recounted how Nike took a major risk by offering Michael Jordan $2.5 million to wear their shoes, a sum triple what any other player was making. Nike initially hoped to net $3 million over four years, but sold $126 million in the first year alone. The Jordan Brand continues to generate approximately $7 billion annually for Nike, with Jordan still involved in the design process.</p>
