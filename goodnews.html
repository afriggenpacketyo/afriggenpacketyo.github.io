          <p>Insurance costs are rising dramatically in states within Tornado Alley, primarily due to the increasing frequency and severity of hailstorms rather than tornadoes themselves. Hailstorms cause widespread damage to homes, breaking windows, tearing siding, and puncturing roofs, leading to a significant increase in homeowner insurance claims. Insurance companies are responding by raising premiums and scaling back coverage, particularly on roofs. While fortified roofs can offer some protection, they may not be financially worthwhile for the average homeowner, and they provide limited defense against the most powerful tornadoes.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the revocation of its ability to enroll international students. The lawsuit argues that the administration's decision violates the First Amendment and due process rights, jeopardizing the education of over 7,000 visa holders. The administration claims Harvard failed to comply with requests for information and fostered an unsafe campus environment, while Harvard insists it responded adequately to the demands. This legal challenge marks an escalation in the ongoing conflict between Harvard and the administration over campus policies and governance.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs after President Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on the European Union and Apple. Trump's social media posts recommending a 50% tariff on the EU and a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S. triggered a flight to safety, driving down yields. This move reversed some of the upward pressure on yields that had been driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and the U.S. deficit, highlighting the market's sensitivity to trade policy uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer flexibility for summer financial needs, but experts advise caution. Utilizing a HELOC to consolidate high-interest credit card debt or fund home improvements can be beneficial, particularly with potentially falling interest rates. However, using a HELOC for non-essential expenses like vacations or non-essential home additions like pools is discouraged due to the risk of long-term debt and potential foreclosure. Careful consideration and a solid repayment plan are crucial before leveraging home equity. (not investment advice)</p>
