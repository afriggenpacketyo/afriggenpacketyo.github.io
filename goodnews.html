          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his ace potential by pitching five dominant innings in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 5-1 win against the Cincinnati Reds. Returning from his second Tommy John surgery, Ohtani adopted a more varied pitching strategy, relying heavily on his curveball and splitter to keep hitters off-balance. He allowed only one run, struck out nine batters, and earned his first pitching win of the season. This performance demonstrates his capability to handle a full starter's workload, a crucial development for the Dodgers' postseason rotation plans.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need to monitor rising housing prices in Seoul and growing household debt. While keeping rates steady, the central bank upgraded its GDP and inflation forecasts for 2025, anticipating a modest recovery in domestic demand. Officials noted that while household loan growth has slowed, expectations for higher home prices remain a significant concern. The decision reflects a cautious approach as the bank balances economic growth with financial stability risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of Southern California has offered a multi-year extension to Notre Dame in an effort to continue their century-old football rivalry, which was at risk of ending. USC's athletic director, Jennifer Cohen, confirmed the new offer, which addresses Notre Dame's preference for a long-term commitment. Key negotiation points include the game's scheduling, as USC seeks to move the matchup to earlier in the season to better manage its demanding Big Ten travel schedule. Both schools are reportedly hopeful that an agreement can be reached soon to preserve the historic series.</p>

          <p>A controversial, temporary immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," will soon have no detainees, according to a state official. The announcement follows a federal judge's ruling that effectively ordered the winding down of operations at the center. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams denied a request from the Trump administration and Florida officials to stay her order, which also blocked new detainees from being sent there. The facility, constructed in just eight days, was criticized by advocates and became the subject of multiple lawsuits.</p>

          <p>In the civil trial where rapper Cardi B is accused of assaulting a security guard, witness testimony from a doctor's receptionist has supported the performer's defense. The receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, told jurors she saw the plaintiff, Emani Ellis, cornering a pregnant Cardi B and reaching for her during a 2018 confrontation. Malcolm testified that she herself was cut on the forehead during the fracas, which she believes was caused by Ellis. Cardi B has consistently denied touching, scratching, or spitting at the security guard, who is seeking $24 million in damages.</p>

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of China's central bank, has called for a cautious and multidimensional assessment of stablecoins, warning against excessive speculation and potential systemic financial risks. Speaking at a seminar, Zhou expressed concern that hype around stablecoins could be leveraged by companies to inflate valuations rather than build sustainable businesses. His comments come as the U.S. and Hong Kong develop regulatory frameworks for these digital assets.

          <p>A new NATO report indicates that all 32 member states are on track to meet the long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. However, the report also highlights that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the newer, more ambitious target of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but emphasized the need to convert these funds into tangible military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, with a forecast for continued strong sales growth driven by AI infrastructure demand. Despite the positive overall results, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue of $41.1 billion fell slightly short of analyst expectations. Overall revenue grew 56% year-over-year to $46.74 billion, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of over 50% growth. The report confirms Nvidia's central role in the ongoing global AI buildout, though it was the slowest growth period in that stretch. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding its funded childcare program in England, with working parents of children from nine months old now eligible for 30 hours a week of care during term time. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged eligible parents to apply for the final phase of the expansion. Despite the expansion, concerns remain about the sufficiency of staffing and available places to meet the increased demand. Additionally, some providers continue to charge for extras not covered by government funding, which can create affordability issues for some families.</p>
