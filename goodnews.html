          <p>General Motors announced a significant financial beat for its third quarter, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company has consequently raised its full-year guidance for 2025, signaling confidence despite challenges in the electric vehicle market. While EV sales have grown, GM's CFO noted that profitability in the sector is taking longer than anticipated, with the company taking a $1.6 billion charge related to its EV strategy pullback. The improved forecast also reflects a reduced expected impact from tariffs on its operations. (not investment advice)</p>

This development follows previous plans to split into two separate entities and comes after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties. CEO David Zaslav stated that the review aims to identify the best path to unlock the full value of the company's assets. The media giant is still proceeding with its previously announced separation plan while it explores these new strategic alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite bold predictions from tech CEOs that AI will soon write the vast majority of code, many software engineers remain skeptical about its current capabilities and productivity impact. While AI tools are useful for simple, repetitive tasks or creating prototypes, some developers report they can create messy, unworkable code that requires more time to fix than traditional methods. Studies on the topic have shown mixed results, with some indicating modest time savings while others suggest tasks can take longer. This skepticism exists alongside pressure from management in some tech companies to adopt AI tools universally, regardless of their suitability for the task.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect their money's buying power, with many top accounts currently providing returns that exceed the inflation rate. National average yields for CDs are around 1.68% to 1.98% APY, but competitive online banks are offering significantly higher rates, such as 4.45% for a 6-month term and 4.15% for a 5-year term. An inverted yield curve phenomenon means short-term CDs often have higher rates than long-term ones. Experts suggest strategies like exploring online banks and laddering CDs to maximize returns.

          <p>Housing experts suggest that a U.S. government shutdown is unlikely to significantly disrupt the mortgage market, though some delays are possible for government-backed loans. Private lenders will continue processing conventional mortgages as usual. However, borrowers seeking loans insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA may face minor processing delays due to potential worker furloughs. A more significant impact could be felt by applicants for USDA loans in rural areas, as the agency is expected to halt the issuance of new loans. Additionally, securing required flood insurance through the FEMA-administered program could become complicated, potentially delaying closings in high-risk areas.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has advised professionals to give their full, undivided attention during meetings, calling the use of iPads or phones disrespectful. At a recent summit, he stated that appropriate meeting etiquette, such as active listening and being prepared, demonstrates passion and respect for colleagues' time. Dimon emphasized that he expects 100% attention and will ask individuals to put away devices if they appear distracted. Experts suggest that taking notes with a pen and paper can improve comprehension and focus, while asking probing follow-up questions demonstrates active engagement and is a highly effective communication tactic.</p>

          <h2>Overview of Current Interest Rates for Home Equity Loans and HELOCs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 09:03:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and HELOCs represent an affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of October 20, 2025, the average interest rate for a 10-year home equity loan is 8.28%, while the average HELOC rate is 7.84%. Home equity loans provide a lump sum with a fixed rate, whereas HELOCs offer a variable-rate line of credit. It is crucial for homeowners to shop around for the best rates, as offers vary by lender and individual credit profile, and to remember that the home serves as collateral for the loan.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, current mortgage rates remain a key factor in affordability. As of October 20, 2025, the national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.37%, while a 15-year mortgage averages 5.80%. Refinance rates are similar, with a 30-year refinance averaging 6.45%. While rates are higher than in recent years, experts note that a stabilizing federal funds rate may prevent further increases. To secure the best possible rate, prospective borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit scores, pay bills on time, and compare offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A security guard, Gavin Plumb, who was jailed for plotting to kidnap, sexually assault, and murder television presenter Holly Willoughby, has had his sentence appeal dismissed. The Court of Appeal upheld his life sentence with a minimum term of 16 years, ruling that he intended harm "of the gravest and highest possible kind." Plumb was arrested after an undercover U.S. police officer infiltrated an online group where he detailed his plans, leading to the discovery of a "kidnap kit" at his residence. The court noted the "life-changing consequences" for the victim during the proceedings.</p>

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, one of the world's poorest nations, a novel conservation project is underway to combat hunger by restoring collapsing fisheries without restricting fishing access. Overfishing and climate change have decimated coral reefs, which are vital for the livelihoods of coastal communities. A small organization named Reef Doctor is building artificial reefs from limestone and seeding them with marine life to create new fish habitats. This approach aims to directly improve food security and human health, framing environmental intervention as a public health solution, though experts acknowledge systemic change and economic diversification are needed for long-term success.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has become Japan's first female prime minister, a historic moment for a nation with a poor record on gender equality in politics. However, her appointment is viewed with caution by some who see her as a staunch conservative unlikely to advance women's rights. Takaichi, a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, opposes same-sex marriage and legislation allowing separate surnames for married couples. While her rise is seen by some as a symbolic step that could inspire women and girls, critics argue her policies perpetuate the patriarchal system and that her leadership was a tactical move by the ruling party to appeal to its conservative base.</p>
