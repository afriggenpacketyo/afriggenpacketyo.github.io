          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Crypto as Mortgage Asset</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 17:05:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to assess cryptocurrency as an asset for single-family mortgage loans. This move signals a potential shift in the U.S. housing finance system, allowing borrowers to use digital assets without liquidating them into U.S. dollars before closing. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated this aligns with President Trump's vision to establish the U.S. as the crypto capital of the world, marking a significant integration of crypto into traditional finance. Historically, crypto has been excluded from underwriting due to volatility and regulatory uncertainty, but this directive aims to change that. The transition to incorporating crypto in mortgage loan risk assessments may bring new opportunities and challenges to the housing market. </p>

          <p>British tennis legend Sir Andy Murray has voiced concerns about the damaging effects of social media, particularly on athletes, and supports Katie Boulter. Murray noted that athletes have been discussing this issue for a long time without significant change. He and his wife are keeping their children off social media until they are older due to its potential harm. The UK government's Online Safety Act requires technology firms to protect young people from harmful content, and several England women's football team members plan to abstain from social media during their upcoming European Championship defense. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing funds for EV chargers to 14 states, challenging the administration's freeze on the funds. The Department of Transportation announced a temporary pause in February, stating new guidance would be published, but no new guidance has been released. The court order is a preliminary injunction, with a seven-day pause to allow the administration time to appeal. The judge's ruling is an early win for the states, with California Attorney General Rob Bonta expressing satisfaction. </p>

          <p>Bumble shares rallied 25% after the dating app company revealed plans to slash 30% of its workforce, affecting approximately 240 roles. The layoffs will result in $13 million to $18 million in charges for the company in the third and fourth quarters. Management estimates the reductions will help the company save $40 million annually. Bumble said the cuts are part of a reconfiguration to optimize execution on strategic priorities, with plans to invest savings into new product and technology development.

          <p>Louisiana is investing heavily to land Meta's $10 billion data center, which is expected to be the largest in the Western Hemisphere. The state is providing a 20-year sales tax exemption and access to a large, shovel-ready site. The project is anticipated to transform Louisiana's economy, creating 500 permanent jobs and 5,000 construction jobs. The local utility, Entergy, is seeking approval to build three gas-fired power plants to meet the data center's energy needs. </p>
