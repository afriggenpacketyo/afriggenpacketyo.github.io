          <p>A Goldman Sachs report indicates that major Chinese companies are strategically shifting their export focus away from the United States and towards less-developed markets, particularly in Southeast Asia. Since 2018, China's exports to non-US markets have grown at a compound annual rate of 7.5%, while exports to the US have slightly declined. This diversification allows Chinese firms to leverage their cost advantages and build new supply chains, while also moving up the value-added curve by exporting higher-end products to boost profit margins.

          <p>In a significant shift away from console exclusivity, Microsoft has announced it will release a remake of its flagship game, "Halo: Combat Evolved," on Sony's PlayStation 5. This marks the first time the iconic Xbox franchise will be available on a rival platform, reflecting Microsoft's evolving strategy to make its games accessible on more devices, including PC and mobile. While some longtime Xbox fans have criticized the move, many in the gaming community see it as a positive step towards ending the traditional "console wars" and making popular titles available to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>Chef Roy Choi, known for his Korean-Mexican fusion cuisine, is encouraging home cooks to embrace a more vegetable-forward diet with techniques from his new cookbook. He advises preparing vegetables in advance by washing and cutting them at the start of the week, a standard practice in professional kitchens that makes them more accessible for daily meals. Choi also recommends creating flavorful homemade sauces and condiments, such as teriyaki or ponzu, to make vegetable dishes more crave-worthy. He suggests that these simple culinary strategies can help people confidently prepare healthier and more delicious meals at home.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham is preparing for the upcoming El Clásico against Barcelona, a match that provides a crucial stage for him to reaffirm his form after a challenging start to the season due to injury. The fixture is notable as it is expected to be the first El Clásico featuring two English players on opposing sides, with Barcelona's Marcus Rashford also in form. After being left out of the recent England squad, Bellingham will be looking to deliver a statement performance to both club fans and the national team manager, Thomas Tuchel.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Confirms German Christmas Markets Will Proceed Despite Viral Rumors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral social media claim that Germany has canceled its Christmas markets for 2025 is false, according to a fact-check by DW. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like low revenue or renovations, major markets in cities like Berlin, Dresden, and Cologne are proceeding as planned. The false narrative appears to have originated from a single, unreliable online source that used sensationalist language and cited non-existent cancellations. Despite rising security costs for organizers, there is no evidence of widespread closures of the popular holiday tradition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As daylight hours shorten with the end of daylight saving time, many people, particularly in northern latitudes, face symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring seasonal depression is linked to reduced exposure to sunlight and can cause low mood, irritability, and anxiety. To combat these effects, health experts recommend building new "light routines," such as using therapeutic lamps and making a conscious effort to spend time outdoors even on overcast days. Additionally, creating a cozy and comforting indoor light environment with candles and other lights can help improve mental well-being during the winter months.</p>

          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina revealed he decided to invest in the AI voice startup ElevenLabs after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski in 2022, well before the company had a product. Reina was drawn to Staniszewski's deep technical understanding and vision for solving the problem of robotic-sounding AI voices, an area overlooked by other venture capitalists at the time. His early bet paid off, as ElevenLabs, which specializes in text-to-speech and voice cloning, was recently valued at $6.6 billion, highlighting the success of investing in visionary founders in non-hyped sectors.</p>

Officials warned the public about the extreme dangers of purchasing such unauthorized products online, which are untested and potentially deadly.
