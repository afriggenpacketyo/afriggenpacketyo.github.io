          <p>Cracker Barrel, the long-standing American restaurant chain, has reversed its decision to adopt a new minimalist logo following intense public outcry. The company announced it would restore its traditional "Uncle Herschel" logo after a wave of criticism, including comments from Donald Trump and his son, who threatened boycotts. This article highlights the power of consumer sentiment and social media in influencing corporate branding decisions. The brief change was part of a wider rebrand to attract new customers, but it led to a more than 10% drop in shares before the reversal, underscoring the financial implications of misjudging public perception.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its 10th test flight, a critical step after three previous catastrophic failures. The 40-story-tall rocket, the most powerful ever built, performed initial stages smoothly, with the Super Heavy booster completing a planned splashdown and the Starship upper stage reaching its suborbital trajectory. This article emphasizes the importance of the successful test for SpaceX's goals of launching Starlink satellites and eventually carrying settlers to Mars. It also notes the critical role of a modified Starship for NASA's planned 2027 moon landing, highlighting concerns about the timeline and the complex challenges of orbital refueling and safe lunar landings.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's colossal Starship megarocket successfully launched on its 10th test flight from Starbase in southern Texas, following two previous scrubbed attempts. This critical flight comes after a series of explosive failures, raising questions about the vehicle's reliability for Elon Musk's vision of Mars colonization and NASA's lunar missions. The article highlights SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" development approach, contrasting it with rivals' more cautious methods. Despite past setbacks, Starship's success is crucial for its Starlink internet business and its role as NASA's lunar lander, though challenges like in-orbit refueling and a fully reusable heat shield remain significant hurdles.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is urging citizens to "make in India and spend in India" as the Trump administration's 50% tariff rate on Indian exports takes effect. This article highlights Modi's call for self-reliance and his government's efforts to counter the economic blow, including plans for a "massive tax bonanza" and an overhaul of India's indirect tax architecture. The proposed reduction and simplification of the Goods & Service Tax (GST) aim to boost private consumption, which accounts for nearly 60% of India's GDP.
