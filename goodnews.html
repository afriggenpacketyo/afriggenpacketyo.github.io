          <p>Speech and Language UK reports that children with speech and language difficulties are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues like anxiety and depression. According to the charity, almost half of young people referred to mental health services also face significant speech and language challenges, such as difficulty learning new words or understanding non-verbal cues. The charity advocates for improved speech and language training for teachers and mental health professionals, as well as better information sharing between schools and mental health teams. The government has committed to providing mental health support in every secondary school in England by 2030, making it essential to spot and adapt support for children with both communication and mental health needs. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" before launching missile strikes on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the attack as "very weak." He thanked Iran for the warning, which he said allowed for the avoidance of casualties. Trump also announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, following a period of escalating tensions and strikes.

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, though U.S. and Qatari officials report that the missiles were intercepted and there were no injuries.

The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed responsibility, but Trump expressed hope for peace and harmony in the region. The Qatari government condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty, while Iran's supreme leader asserted that they would not surrender. </p>

          <p>NHS England will offer at-home HPV test kits to women who have delayed coming forward for cervical screening, starting in January. The DIY test kits contain a long cotton-wool bud to swab the lining of the vagina, testing for human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes most cervical cancers. The scheme aims to tackle barriers such as embarrassment, discomfort, and lack of time, hoping to increase screening rates closer to the NHS England target of 80%. Women with a negative HPV test will wait five years for their next screening appointment, instead of three, based on research showing they are at very low risk of cervical cancer.</p>

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel stated that he doubts Iran will close off the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage, despite threats following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Braziel explained that Iran has threatened to close the strait during major conflicts for over 20 years but has never done so because it would harm its own oil exports. He added that the market has concluded Iran will not close the strait, as evidenced by the drop in oil prices. Braziel also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose serious issues for exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Trump voters expressed support for the president's actions, believing they align with his "America First" agenda. While some non-interventionist Republicans criticized the strikes, most voters interviewed by ABC News trusted Trump to protect American interests while preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. They also defended Trump's decision to proceed without Congress' approval, viewing it as necessary for swift action. However, some voters expressed disappointment, fearing the potential for a larger conflict.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, suggesting that the high-risk maneuver may pay off if Iran's retaliation ends. Trump claimed that Iran's response to the strikes was "very weak" and that all parties had agreed to a ceasefire. The article draws parallels to a similar situation in 2020, when Trump ordered the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, and the U.S. chose not to escalate despite Iranian missile attacks. If no additional Iranian attacks are forthcoming, Trump seems inclined to hold his fire in the hopes that the Iranians will be willing to negotiate in earnest.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to reform prior authorization practices. The pledge aims to standardize the prior authorization approval process, deliver decisions faster, reduce the number of procedures and drugs subject to prior authorization, and honor existing approvals when patients switch insurers. The announcement echoes a similar pledge made in 2018, which the American Medical Association argued insurers failed to uphold. The goal is to streamline the process and reduce delays or denials of care, although some remain skeptical of insurers' commitment to the agreement.</p>

          <p>Before embarking on missions that can stretch beyond 40 hours, pilots of the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit stealth bomber undergo weeks of preparation, including nutritional education. Understanding how nutrition affects alertness and digestion is critical during intercontinental flights. Pilots are trained to be cognizant of foods and how they slow or speed digestion, with bland meals like turkey sandwiches on wheat bread being preferred. With a 172-foot wingspan and stealth profile, the B-2 can fly 6,000 nautical miles without refueling, but most missions require multiple mid-air refuelings, a process that becomes increasingly difficult as fatigue sets in.</p>
