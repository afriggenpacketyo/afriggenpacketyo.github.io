          <p>President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, suggesting support for the Japanese company's investment while emphasizing that U.S. Steel will remain under American control. Speaking at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump announced plans to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50% from the current 25%, citing national security concerns. Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, but the details of the deal are still under review, with Trump needing to approve the final agreement. Trump emphasized that all U.S. Steel workers would keep their jobs and facilities would remain open under the partnership.</p>

          <p>UC Irvine's baseball team lost to Arizona State 4-2 in the Los Angeles Regional of the NCAA tournament, despite multiple opportunities to score. Jacob McCombs' sacrifice bunt in the fifth inning put runners in scoring position, but the Anteaters failed to capitalize. Trevor Hansen pitched well, but gave up two solo home runs, while Ricky Ojeda's late-game appearance could impact his availability for the next game. UC Irvine will face Fresno State in an elimination game, needing to win four games to reach the NCAA super regionals.</p>

          <p>British officials are proceeding with trade negotiations with the United States despite a recent court ruling that overturned many of Donald Trump's tariffs. The UK aims to finalize deals covering sectors like cars, metals, and aeroplane parts within weeks. Although a federal court paused the ruling, allowing the tariffs to remain, the UK government believes the tariffs will eventually be reinstated. Discussions are ongoing regarding the specifics of the agreement, such as how cars assembled in the UK with foreign parts will be treated and the reduction of tariffs on British-made aeroplane parts.</p>

          <p>Japan is experiencing a surge in inbound travel driven by Chinese tourists, with arrivals exceeding pre-pandemic levels, but their travel habits are evolving. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, more travelers are seeking immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The Japan National Tourism Organization is targeting this market, especially travelers in their 30s and 40s, by opening accounts on Chinese social media platforms. Concerns about a Japanese manga predicting a major disaster briefly impacted visitor numbers from Hong Kong, but April saw a strong rebound.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, announced that talks with US officials are progressing towards a potential tariff deal as early as June.

The two countries plan to hold another round of negotiations before the Group of Seven summit in mid-June. Japan is also offering to cooperate in resurrecting the shipbuilding capacity of the United States, and boost cooperation on strategic sectors such as semiconductors and rare earths.</p>

          <p>China is modernizing its traditional mining industry with the deployment of driverless electric vehicles, exemplified by a fleet of 100 autonomous trucks at the Yimin open-pit coal mine in Inner Mongolia. This initiative addresses a shortage of drivers and improves safety in dangerous working conditions. The Yimin mine, one of China's largest, is part of a broader push to digitally transform the coal industry and develop "intelligent coal mines." The use of photovoltaic-battery-powered trucks highlights China's commitment to upgrading traditional industries with advanced technologies amid a shrinking labor force.</p>
