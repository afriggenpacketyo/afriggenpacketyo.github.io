          <p>Fox Corp. has acquired Caliente TV, a Mexican sports broadcasting platform, to expand its sports programming and attract more viewers to its streaming services. Carlos Martinez, formerly of Turner, Discovery, and Fox, will oversee Latin American operations for Fox Corp. This acquisition aligns with Fox's strategy to bolster its sports content as streaming becomes the primary way viewers watch TV. Fox plans to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service, Fox One, later this year, adding to its existing Tubi platform and broadening its portfolio of original sports content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, providing ¬£150 off energy bills to twice as many households this winter. The change will extend the discount to anyone on means-tested benefits, regardless of property size, benefiting an additional 2.7 million homes, including nearly a million with children. Energy companies will fund the discount, potentially leading to a slight increase in customer bills through the standing charge, but the government anticipates savings from cutting energy companies' expenditure will offset this rise. While welcomed by debt charities and energy groups, some argue the scheme still excludes those on non-means-tested benefits.</p>

          <p>Edith Edmunds, a 99-year-old quilt maker, celebrates Juneteenth by sewing, reflecting on the potential role quilts played in the Underground Railroad. Edmunds learned that runaway enslaved people used encoded messages in quilts to navigate their journey north. These quilts, hung outside homes, contained patterns that conveyed messages about when to escape, which direction to follow, and where to find safe houses. While some historians question the lack of written evidence, others argue the secrecy was essential for survival, noting the tradition of symbolic communication in West African cultures.</p>

          <p>Strawberry Fanta, known as Fanta nam daeng, is a common offering at spirit houses in Los Angeles' Thai Town, where spirits are believed to dwell. This practice originates from animism and Brahmanism, which have mixed with Buddhist beliefs, with the red soda serving as a replacement for blood offerings to ghosts. Spirits are believed to have a sweet tooth, and red Fanta is also associated with Kuman Thong, a household deity who can grant wishes. While red Fanta is the most common offering, other red-toned drinks and black drinks, such as Coca-Cola, are also used depending on the specific deity.</p>
