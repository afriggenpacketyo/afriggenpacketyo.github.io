          <p>President Donald Trump arrived in Israel to address the Knesset, coinciding with the release of the final 20 living hostages held by Hamas since October 7, 2023. This prisoner exchange is part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, which has allowed some Palestinians to return to devastated homes in Gaza. Trump's speech will emphasize translating battlefield victories into lasting peace and stability for the Middle East, while a summit in Egypt, co-chaired by Trump and President El-Sisi, aims to further peace and regional security.</p>

          <p>England striker Ollie Watkins is set to miss the World Cup qualifier against Latvia on Tuesday due to an injury sustained in the 3-0 win against Wales. Watkins, who scored in the match, collided with the post in the first half, leading to his early exit. While manager Thomas Tuchel initially stated he was "OK," the injury was described as "very painful," forcing his withdrawal from the squad. England aims to qualify for next summer's World Cup with two matches to spare by securing a victory in Riga.</p>

          <p>In 1971, Silvana Clark, a high school graduate left to fend for herself, was on the verge of dropping out of college due to financial hardship. Her drama teacher, George Meshke, who had encouraged her to enroll, secretly paid for her second semester's tuition, disguising it as a drama scholarship. This unexpected act of generosity allowed Clark to continue her education, work various part-time jobs, and eventually graduate. Clark never forgot Meshke's profound kindness, which enabled her to overcome significant financial obstacles and pursue her destiny.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa is actively debating the decriminalization of sex work, driven by advocates like Connie Mathe and the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT), who argue that criminalization leads to violence and police harassment. A 2021 study revealed high rates of physical violence and sexual assault against sex workers, often unreported due to fear of arrest. While proponents emphasize bodily autonomy and reduced trafficking, opponents, such as Cause for Justice, argue against it on grounds of human dignity and increased social ills. The debate involves a dual legal strategy, including a constitutional challenge and a stalled Decriminalization Bill.</p>

          <p>Second-year quarterback Drake Maye appears to have transformed the New England Patriots, showcasing MVP-caliber play that suggests an end to the team's post-Tom Brady struggles. Maye delivered exceptional performances in recent wins against Buffalo and New Orleans, demonstrating confidence, composure, and improved processing of defenses. With 10 passing touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns, and only two interceptions this season, Maye has significantly reduced turnover-worthy plays and is piloting a complex offense like a veteran. His accelerated growth has quickly made the Patriots division contenders, offering a stark contrast to other quarterback-starved franchises.</p>
