          <p>Nearly ten years after the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, mothers of children born with congenital Zika syndrome face ongoing challenges. Many of these children, now around nine years old, have severe health issues, cannot walk or speak, and require constant care. The article highlights a community of these mothers in Maceió who have formed a support network, even living together to help one another. After a long battle, they successfully overturned a presidential veto to secure significantly higher lifetime compensation from the government.</p>

          <p>The new BBC series "Parenthood," narrated by Sir David Attenborough, examines the diverse and often extreme ways animal parents raise their young. The show features compelling stories, from mother spiders who sacrifice themselves to be eaten by their offspring to poison dart frogs carrying tadpoles up trees. Director Jeff Wilson notes the series aims to connect with universal parental dilemmas and the need to adapt in a changing world. At 99, Attenborough continues to deliver powerful narration for the five-part series, which highlights the profound commitment of parents in nature.</p>

          <p>The 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" continues to resonate deeply with many South Asian women, who saw their own experiences reflected in the story of a girl pursuing soccer against her family's wishes. The article shares perspectives from women who felt seen and inspired by the main character, Jesminder Bhamra, and her struggle to balance cultural expectations with personal ambition. While women's soccer has grown significantly since the film's release, the movie's themes of representation and challenging traditional norms remain powerful. A sequel is reportedly in development.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake occurred in Bergen County, New Jersey, on Saturday night, with tremors felt across the region, including parts of New York City. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported the quake's epicenter was near Hasbrouck Heights, at a depth of six miles. The tremors were reportedly felt up to 60 miles away from the center. At this time, there have been no reports of any damage or injuries resulting from the seismic event, which is one of several minor quakes to affect the area in recent years.</p>

          <p>Political observers are debating whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend China's upcoming parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Some analysts, like Vijay Prashad, suggest that Modi's presence could provide an opportunity to resolve Sino-Indian border disputes, potentially with Russia acting as a mediator. However, despite a recent improvement in relations between the two nations, most experts believe it is unlikely that Modi will participate in the event in Beijing. The potential attendance is viewed as a significant diplomatic signal amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Propose New Electronic Warfare Tactic to Protect Friendly Forces</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed an electronic warfare technique that can create a protective "storm eye" for friendly forces. The system uses a swarm of drones that coordinate their signals to jam enemy communications while simultaneously creating a null zone where friendly signals are unaffected. This method marks a significant advancement over traditional brute-force jamming, which disrupts all communications within a wide radius. According to a published paper, this targeted approach can effectively reduce electromagnetic interference on allied users to zero, offering a strategic advantage in combat.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine veteran, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time of her arrest, was taken into custody during what she believed was a routine green card interview. Her detention stemmed from a years-old deportation order she was unaware of, issued after her mother missed an immigration hearing. Her case exemplifies the administration's intensified immigration enforcement, but after advocacy from her husband, her attorney, and a senator's office, she was released on bond.</p>

The record-breaking performance was part of a successful night for Team USA, which also saw victories from Gretchen Walsh in the 50-meter butterfly and Katie Ledecky in the 800-meter freestyle. Ledecky's win was particularly notable as she maintained her undefeated streak in the event at major competitions, a run that began at the 2012 Olympics.

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and several other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme. The plot allegedly involved inflating the prices of government contracts for military drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, especially during wartime. The arrests follow a recent public backlash that forced the government to restore the independence of its anti-corruption bodies, a key requirement for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch from a Berlin loft, the Ethereum blockchain has grown from a niche experiment into a foundational pillar of the modern financial system. Initially conceived as a "programmable money" platform, it now underpins a $420 billion ecosystem including decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets. Major corporations and financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are now building on Ethereum, valuing its stability and dependability. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on its unexpected growth while emphasizing the need to maintain its decentralized principles as it becomes more mainstream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is launching a new left-wing political party in the UK, but it currently lacks a name. Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are asking their reported 600,000 registered supporters to help choose a title for the new venture. The party cannot field candidates in elections until it registers an official name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. The process highlights the challenge of creating a brand that effectively encapsulates a new political movement's identity in the modern digital age.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have signaled a clear shift in their franchise focus by signing Luka Doncic to a three-year, $165-million contract extension. The team's public celebration and praise for Doncic's camp position him as the new center of the Lakers' universe. This move intensifies questions about the future of LeBron James, who is on a one-year contract and is accustomed to being the franchise's focal point. While the team's general manager expressed hope that James might retire as a Laker, there is an underlying uncertainty about how the 40-year-old superstar will adapt to a new dynamic.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue comedy. In a BBC radio interview, Hill, who qualified as a doctor, explained that he felt unsuited for a medical career and was deeply affected by his stepfather's inability to enjoy retirement. He recalled feeling out of his depth when breaking bad news to patients and realized he did not want to spend his life in a profession he wasn't passionate about. This realization set him on the path to becoming a successful entertainer.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more careful with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift comes as Chinese tech companies are rapidly advancing and releasing their own powerful open-source models. Experts like computer scientist Andrew Ng have noted that China's competitive open-source ecosystem, with companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI releasing new models, could be a path for the country to surpass the U.S. in AI development. This contrasts with the U.S., where the most advanced models have traditionally been proprietary.</p>
