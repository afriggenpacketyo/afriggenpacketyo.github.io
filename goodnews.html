          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of the year, marking the first decline in a year, as exports fell sharply due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations of a 0.1% decline. The Bank of Japan had previously warned of a likely moderation in the country's economic growth due to the effects of global trade policies, particularly U.S. tariff policy. Despite these concerns, the central bank is expected to continue raising its policy rate, although some members have cautioned about potential deviations from the economic outlook.

The new academies include the PLA Ground Force Service Academy, the PLA Information Support Force Engineering University, and the PLA Joint Logistics Support Force Engineering University. These academies will provide specialized training and recruitment channels for the PLA's new service branches, aiming to improve the military's capabilities in modern and hi-tech warfare by 2027.

          <p>MPs in England and Wales are set to debate an assisted dying bill again, following major changes that include removing the need for a High Court judge's approval for each request. A panel of experts would oversee the process instead, and doctors would be restricted from discussing the option with under 18s unless the patient initiates it. The government quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year. While some MPs express concern over the "chaotic" process, others support the bill, emphasizing the need for a better system for terminally ill individuals.</p>

          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID-19 shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has indicated that substantial updates to existing vaccines, including those for seasonal strain changes, may require additional clinical evaluation. This could affect the availability of both COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccines, with the FDA already requesting more clinical data from Novavax for its COVID-19 vaccine. Some experts fear these new limits could undermine the use of all vaccines by raising safety concerns.</p>
