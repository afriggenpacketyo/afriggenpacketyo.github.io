          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind power capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A report from Global Energy Monitor indicates the country is on track to add at least 9 gigawatts this year, representing more than half of projected global additions. This push is part of a broader government strategy to cultivate a high-quality marine economy, with President Xi Jinping recently highlighting the sector's importance. The development is supported by strong government subsidies and planning, aiming to enhance energy security and economic growth in coastal provinces.</p>

          <h2>Homeland Security Announces End to Mandatory Shoe Removal at U.S. Airport Security</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 19:10:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has ended the nearly two-decade-old requirement for travelers to remove their shoes at U.S. airport security checkpoints. Secretary Kristi Noem announced the nationwide policy change is possible due to layered security measures, including advanced technology and the REAL ID program. While most passengers can now keep their shoes on, TSA agents may still request removal for additional screening if necessary. The original rule was implemented in 2006 following the attempted "shoe bomber" terrorist plot in 2001, and its removal aims to streamline the travel experience.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has appointed Sarah Mahin as the inaugural director of its new Department of Homeless Services and Housing. Mahin, a veteran with two decades of experience, currently leads the county's Housing for Health program, which will be largely absorbed into the new department. The agency was created to provide more direct county oversight and accountability over homelessness spending, much of which previously flowed through the joint city-county authority, LAHSA. Mahin's appointment is seen as a key step in reorganizing the county's approach to its pressing homelessness crisis.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows João Pedro Could Be the Dynamic Striker Chelsea Needs</h2>

          <p>Chelsea's new forward, João Pedro, made a powerful case for a starting position with a two-goal performance in the Club World Cup semi-final against his former club, Fluminense. An analysis of his full debut highlights not just his stunning strikes but also his all-around contribution, including his link-up play and involvement across the entire pitch. Compared to other Chelsea forwards, his style of dropping deep to influence build-up play offers a different dynamic for manager Enzo Maresca. The performance suggests the £60m signing from Brighton could be the answer to the club's search for a consistent and versatile central attacker.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that he is a "true believer" in online used car retailer Carvana for the long term, despite its stock being a "wild trader." He pointed to the company's recent strong earnings report and new long-term financial targets as signs that it is on the right track. Cramer believes Carvana's convenient online sales model gives it room to gain market share in a fragmented industry and that it could benefit from potential interest rate cuts and new tariffs on foreign automakers. He suggested investors could start a small position now and buy more on a future pullback (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the feasibility of a massive transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with Peru's Pacific port of Chancay. The proposed 4,500-kilometer (2,800-mile) project would run from Ilhéus, Brazil, across the Andes to the Peruvian coast, potentially reshaping South American trade routes. If constructed, the railway could significantly shorten shipping times to Asia by bypassing the Panama Canal. The agreement currently covers technical, environmental, and economic studies, which are expected to take up to five years to complete for the multi-billion dollar project.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, the recently passed "big, beautiful bill" supported by President Trump does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals and $12,000 for couples aged 65 and over, which can be used to lower their overall taxable income. This deduction phases out for higher earners and does not benefit low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax. Policy experts clarify that this provides some relief but is not a repeal of the tax on benefits (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A central government campaign in China to enforce stricter austerity measures on civil servants is changing behaviors and curbing practices seen as wasteful. The rules, introduced in May, ban the consumption of liquor, cigarettes, and high-end dishes at official receptions to combat the misuse of public funds and potential corruption. This has led some officials to avoid even purely social gatherings at restaurants for fear of being scrutinized. The campaign is the latest in a series of efforts by Beijing to address public resentment over perceived extravagance among government employees and state-owned enterprise staff.</p>

This transaction follows a recent sale of over $736 million in stock at the end of June. Despite the sales, Bezos remains Amazon's largest shareholder, holding over 900 million shares currently valued at nearly $200 billion.</p>
