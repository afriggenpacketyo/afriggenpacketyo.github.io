        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated his "American AI Action Plan" by signing three executive orders, emphasizing a commitment to keeping "woke AI" out of government operations and boosting the U.S. as an AI export leader. A key order, "PREVENTING WOKE AI IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT," mandates that federal agencies avoid AI models that compromise truthfulness and accuracy for ideological agendas like DEI. The administration contends that DEI in AI can lead to biased results and manipulate information. These directives emerge amidst recent controversies surrounding AI models, such as Google's Gemini and xAI's Grok, highlighting the broader challenges of ensuring neutrality and objectivity in artificial intelligence development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigerian artist John Madu, inspired by his vibrant upbringing in Lagos, is currently featured in an exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam titled "Van Gogh x John Madu: Paint Your Path." Madu created ten large-format paintings for the show, blending Vincent van Gogh's 19th-century motifs with a modern West African perspective. A self-taught artist, Madu shares similarities with Van Gogh, including influences from East Asian art. He prefers to be known as "an artist from Africa" rather than an "African artist," identifying as a global citizen whose work reflects his environment and addresses social phenomena like the "Japa" trend of young Nigerians leaving the country.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 03:20:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deutsche Bank announced a second-quarter net profit of 1.485 billion euros, surpassing expectations despite facing challenges within its investment banking division and the strengthening euro. The bank's CFO expressed confidence in achieving full-year targets, citing strong business momentum and cost management. While its fixed income and currencies unit saw an 11% revenue increase, corporate banking revenues declined due to reduced corporate activity and foreign exchange translations. The bank is adapting to a lower interest rate environment set by the European Central Bank and acknowledges that potential U.S. tariffs could create headwinds for European exporters, but overall, the firm is on track.

          <p>China is actively seeking to enhance its trans-Himalayan projects in Nepal, aiming to bolster its regional influence amidst ongoing competition with India. A recent visit by a Chinese official highlighted Beijing's commitment to developing more projects in key sectors such as agriculture, new energy, health, and education, with the goal of promoting Nepal's economic and social advancement. Traditionally, India has been Nepal's closest ally due to cultural ties and proximity, but China has increasingly drawn the Himalayan nation into its orbit through significant investments in infrastructure, including roads and hydropower plants. This strategic move signifies China's broader diplomatic push for partnerships and influence in the region.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in the UK, poised to sign a "landmark" free trade agreement with the British government on Thursday. This highly anticipated deal, the culmination of nearly three years of negotiations, is designed to reduce tariffs on goods and enhance market access for both countries. Projections indicate it could significantly boost bilateral trade by an additional £25.5 billion per year by 2040. The agreement is being finalized amidst a backdrop of global trade uncertainties, including potential new tariffs from the US. Both Prime Minister Modi and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have lauded the pact as a major win, expected to foster trade, investment, and job creation.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to implement a program offering subsidy vouchers to its senior population, representing a rare instance of direct fiscal support. This initiative aims to alleviate the financial strain on the rapidly aging demographic and stimulate the consumption of elderly-care services. The monthly electronic coupons will partially cover costs for seniors assessed with moderate to severe disabilities. This move signals a strategic shift for Chinese policymakers, who have typically refrained from direct cash handouts. Economists consider these measures vital for strengthening the social safety net and boosting domestic consumption, aligning with Beijing's broader objective of fostering new growth drivers and integrating economic development with social welfare amidst increasing demographic pressures.</p>

States like Utah have strengthened mandates, requiring municipalities to provide accessible housing and encouraging measures such as reduced parking requirements and streamlined permitting. This state-level intervention seeks to alleviate a significant housing shortage that has pushed median home prices beyond the reach of many, especially younger generations. While developers contend with high costs and some local governments resist perceived infringements on their autonomy, proponents argue that increasing housing supply is essential for ensuring economic stability and the American dream of homeownership.</p>

MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the event's business value but conceded its shortcomings for players, suggesting a need to re-evaluate its structure.

          <p>A significant study published in The Lancet Public Health indicates that walking just 7,000 steps daily can considerably enhance brainpower and mitigate the risk of various serious health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, and depression. This research challenges the popular 10,000-step guideline, revealing its origin as a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign rather than evidence-based science. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults worldwide, concluding that even moderate increases in daily activity, starting from around 4,000 steps, provide tangible health benefits. While existing exercise guidelines often focus on time, the study suggests that step counts could serve as a practical and accessible supplementary recommendation for promoting physical activity throughout the day.</p>
