          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the southern U.S., centered near Greenback, Tennessee, causing tremors felt as far away as Atlanta. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) received over 23,000 reports from the public within the first hour after the quake. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, residents described shaking walls and rumbling noises. Earthquakes are not uncommon in the region, which lies within the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, but this event served as a reminder of the importance of earthquake preparedness.</p>

          <p>Google has reached a settlement in principle with the state of Texas, agreeing to pay $1.375 billion over allegations of violating users' data privacy. The agreement resolves two lawsuits covering three products, with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stating that Google secretly tracked people's movements, searches, and biometric data. Google said the agreement settles claims encompassing Incognito mode, location history, and biometrics-related allegations, but did not admit any wrongdoing.

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced that Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state to settle allegations of violating the data privacy rights of state residents. Paxton sued Google in 2022 for allegedly unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data. The attorney general said the settlement, which covers allegations in two separate lawsuits against the search engine and app giant, dwarfed all past settlements by other states with Google for similar data privacy violations.
