          <h2>Price Gap Between Chinese Companies' Hong Kong and Mainland Shares Narrows to Five-Year Low</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 04:30:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The shares of dual-listed Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong are now at their smallest discount compared to their mainland counterparts in nearly five years. This convergence is driven by a weaker U.S. dollar, which is encouraging global investors to diversify into the Hong Kong market, and a surge of mainland investors seeking exposure to China's leading tech firms. Analysts remain optimistic about Hong Kong stocks, citing their relatively low valuations and the anticipated benefits from global capital reallocation and future interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 04:30:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies is striving to evolve from a strategic partnership into a significant geopolitical force capable of challenging Western dominance. At its recent summit, the bloc condemned coercive economic tactics and promoted de-dollarization, signaling a move against U.S. unilateralism. However, this article argues that internal contradictions and diverging interests among member nations, such as India's balancing act and Brazil's pragmatic diplomacy, continue to undermine its coherence. The bloc's future depends on its ability to overcome these fractures and become a true alternative to the G7.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 04:03:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FTSE 100, the UK's leading stock index, has broken the 9,000-point barrier for the first time, reaching a new all-time high and marking a gain of over 10% in 2025. Analysts attribute this surge to several factors, including investors diversifying away from U.S. markets due to concerns over trade policies and the UK's relative advantage from its trade deal with the U.S. The index's composition of reliable, long-established companies has also proven attractive in uncertain economic times, with strong performance from sectors like precious metals, defense, and banking.

          <p>Following the recent Club World Cup, FIFA is reportedly considering expanding the tournament from 32 to 48 teams by 2029 and is facing calls from some clubs, like Real Madrid, to hold the event every two years. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has hailed the tournament as a commercial success, generating over $2 billion in revenue, and seems determined to grow the event despite criticism from players' unions over welfare. The high prize fund has successfully attracted top clubs, ensuring that despite concerns about scheduling and player burnout, the competition is set to become a more prominent fixture.</p>

          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) curriculum to include topics like recognizing misogyny and understanding consent. The curriculum will also address modern challenges such as AI-generated "deepfakes" and the influence of online figures like "incels." Instead of imposing strict age limits for topics, the guidance will outline what should be taught by the end of primary and secondary school, giving schools more flexibility. The changes, which will become mandatory in 2026, aim to help students identify positive role models and navigate complex social issues safely.</p>

          <p>Bronny James delivered one of his strongest performances in the NBA Summer League, scoring 17 points and adding five rebounds and five assists for the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite his impressive play, which drew excitement from a crowd that included his father, LeBron James, the Lakers lost to the rival Los Angeles Clippers, 67-58. James showed growing confidence, particularly with his three-point shooting, and earned praise from the Lakers' summer league coach for his energy and effort.

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering buyers discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars costing less than £37,000. The £650 million program aims to make zero-emission cars more affordable as the country moves toward its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. While the automotive industry has welcomed the move, some argue that the primary barrier to EV adoption is the insufficient number of public charging points, not just the initial purchase price. The government has also recently pledged investment to expand the charging network.</p>

          <p>This article details how world number one golfer Scottie Scheffler overcame a significant putting slump by working with sought-after coach Phil Kenyon. Despite being the best player from tee to green, Scheffler's performance on the greens was poor until he sought help in late 2023. Kenyon helped him with green reading, his grip, and, most crucially, a switch to a mallet-style putter, which sparked a remarkable turnaround. Within a year, Scheffler won seven PGA Tour events, including his second Masters and an Olympic gold medal, solidifying his position as the world's most dominant player.</p>

          <p>Mainland China is poised to set a new record for the issuance of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2025, having already launched 166 new funds in the first half of the year. This pace puts the country on track to surpass its 2021 all-time high of 277 ETF launches. The surge is driven by a combination of favorable regulations, including streamlined approvals and reduced fees, and strong investor demand for diversified, exchange-traded investment products. The majority of the new ETFs track domestic equities, with others focused on bonds and overseas markets, reflecting a broader global trend in ETF growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly surpassing economists' forecasts and keeping the country on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. However, the expansion slowed from the first quarter, and underlying data reveals persistent weaknesses. Retail sales growth decelerated, and the real estate slump deepened, fueling concerns about deflationary pressures. While industrial output was strong, economists note that this may be driven by price-cutting. The mixed results have intensified calls for further government stimulus and deeper structural reforms to support domestic consumption and ensure sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preserving the protected status for nearly 12,000 Afghans in the U.S. after the Trump administration moved to end it. The Department of Homeland Security had planned to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for this group, which would have exposed them to deportation and revoked their work authorizations. The decision to end TPS was based on the administration's claim that conditions in Afghanistan had improved, a conclusion heavily disputed by advocates. The court's intervention provides a brief reprieve while it considers the case, which is part of a broader push to end TPS for multiple nationalities.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with fully electric models accounting for over 93% of new car sales so far in 2025. This success is the result of long-term, consistent government policies, including significant tax exemptions for EVs and progressively higher taxes on petrol and diesel cars. The country has also heavily invested in a robust public charging infrastructure, with over 10,000 fast chargers now available nationwide. This comprehensive approach has made EVs the default choice for consumers, visibly transforming the country's roads and improving air quality in its cities.</p>
