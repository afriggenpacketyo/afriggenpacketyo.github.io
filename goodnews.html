          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to prevent U.S. Steel from closing its Granite City, Illinois, plant, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. This action marks the first use of "golden share" rights, a condition established during the company's $14.1 billion acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel. These rights grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures, showcasing a significant expansion of governmental influence in the private sector. The administration emphasized its commitment to protecting American jobs and manufacturing capabilities as part of the national security agreement tied to the takeover.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump held a nearly two-hour phone conversation, which both sides described in positive terms, fostering hopes for improved bilateral relations. During the call, they discussed trade issues and a potential deal concerning TikTok, with Trump announcing plans for a meeting at the upcoming APEC summit and a visit to China early next year. Despite the constructive dialogue, analysts remain cautious, pointing to persistent friction points such as tensions in the South China Sea, the status of Taiwan, and potential U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>The United States has noticeably reduced public announcements of its warships transiting the Taiwan Strait since Donald Trump returned to office, with only three known operations compared to the regular declarations under the previous administration. Beijing, which has historically protested the "public hype" of these transits, has been quieter in its response to the less-publicized operations. While some observers see this as a tactical shift to de-escalate tensions, the U.S. has continued to confirm the transits when asked, suggesting the underlying policy of freedom of navigation remains unchanged despite the change in communication strategy.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the U.K., and Asia, driven by rising tuition costs and political turmoil within the United States. Data indicates a significant increase in U.S. students studying abroad over the past five years, with consultants noting a surge in interest following the 2024 election. While the lower cost of international education is a primary motivator, some students also cite concerns about safety and the political climate as reasons for seeking opportunities overseas. The article explores both the benefits, like cultural exposure, and the potential drawbacks, such as challenges entering the U.S. job market.</p>

          <p>Louisa Serene Schneider, a former Wall Street executive, founded the ear-piercing company Rowan from her attic after identifying a market gap for a safe, medically supervised piercing experience.

Schneider's journey involved overcoming skepticism from investors and bootstrapping the company initially before securing substantial funding. Rowan's success is built on combining medical safety with a celebratory customer experience, and it is projected to reach $150 million in revenue by the end of 2025.</p>

          <h2>Dermatologist Warns of UVA Ray Exposure Risk Even When Indoors Near Windows</h2>

          <p>A dermatologist highlights the often-overlooked danger of UVA ray exposure, even for those indoors. While windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin and are linked to accelerated aging and skin cancer. This "silent" exposure can occur without any visible signs like burning. To ensure comprehensive protection, it is recommended to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, which shields against both types of ultraviolet radiation, especially when spending extended time near windows.</p>

Their family had expressed grave concerns about their health during their captivity, and their return marks the end of a long period of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Germany is modernizing its traditionally strict burial laws, with two states, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt, introducing significant reforms. The new legislation will permit river burials in the Rhine and other major rivers, allow families to keep cremation urns at home, and enable the creation of "memorial diamonds" from ashes. These changes reflect a societal shift towards more personalized and varied forms of mourning, driven by secularization and changing family structures. While the move is welcomed by funeral directors, it has drawn criticism from Christian churches and conservative politicians concerned about the decline of traditional cemeteries.</p>
