          <p>This article provides live updates from the Trump administration, highlighting comments from an official named Vance who stated that Russia's demands to end the war with Ukraine are excessive. The administration is also closely monitoring the situation between Pakistan and India following an exchange of fire. Simultaneously, Republicans on Capitol Hill are working on a legislative package that includes President Trump's agenda, with officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Energy Secretary Chris Wright testifying before committees. The President also announced the US would stop bombing the Houthis in Yemen, stating the group 'capitulated' to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's shares experienced a significant drop after Apple's Eddy Cue suggested that AI search engines could replace traditional search engines like Google. Cue indicated Apple might integrate AI services from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic into Safari. His comments came during testimony in the Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet, which focuses on Google's dominance in advertising technology markets and its agreements with platform providers like Apple. The article suggests that Cue's comments cast doubt on the long-term stability of the relationship between Apple and Google, as searches on Safari have begun to decline due to the rise in AI usage.</p>

          <p>In response to state laws in Utah and Idaho that restrict the display of unofficial flags on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted new official city flags. Salt Lake City approved flags with rainbow, transgender Pride, and Juneteenth symbols, while Boise designated the rainbow Pride flag and an organ donation flag as official. These actions are seen as a way to circumvent state laws that civil rights groups believe target flags supporting L.G.B.T.Q. people. The Utah House speaker criticized Salt Lake City's move as a waste of time and taxpayer resources.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are reintroducing the "SAFE Home Act," which aims to prevent agencies receiving federal funding from discriminating against prospective adoptive parents who prefer to raise a child of their biological sex. The bill, sponsored by Sens. Jim Banks and Tom Cotton, and Rep. Mary Miller, ensures adoptive parents aren't required to provide gender-affirming treatments to children. The legislation is partially inspired by a Biden-era HHS rule promoting homes that affirm a child‚Äôs sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill seeks to protect parental rights and counteract what Republicans see as dangerous gender ideologies.</p>
