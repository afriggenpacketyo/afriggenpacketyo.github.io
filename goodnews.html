          <h2>Chinese Scientists Validate Mach 16 Engine Concept Proposed by US Air Force</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese research team has reportedly achieved a significant advancement in hypersonic engine technology, potentially reviving a concept initially proposed by the US Air Force in 1958. The scientists successfully tested an oblique detonation engine (ODE) chamber using standard jet fuel. The experiment simulated flight conditions at Mach 8 and an altitude of 18 miles, maintaining stable detonation waves for over two seconds. This research, conducted by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology and Northwestern Polytechnical University, suggests the technical feasibility of ODEs for military applications, despite previous skepticism due to technical challenges.</p>

          <p>Japan's National Police Agency plans to revise the rules for converting foreign driver's licenses to Japanese licenses following a series of accidents involving foreign drivers. The changes include requiring a copy of the residence certificate and increasing the difficulty of the knowledge test. The current system allows short-term visitors to obtain licenses easily, which has raised concerns about public safety. The commissioner general of the National Police Agency stated that these measures are necessary to address the increasing number of accidents involving foreigners who obtained licenses under the current system.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill that would provide $1,000 to every American baby born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029.

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000. The price increase has been attributed to positive momentum, growing optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. The rally occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, potentially indicating that investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Macro concerns, such as Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, also contributed to Bitcoin's rise as a hedge against fiat instability. (not investment advice)</p>

The aim is to set a precedent for soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, following local opposition to demonstration projects in Tokyo. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry, would be used for flowerbeds and other purposes. This move is part of Japan's efforts to reduce the total amount of contaminated soil requiring disposal after the 2011 nuclear disaster.</p>
