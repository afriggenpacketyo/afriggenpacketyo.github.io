          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the Constitution by refusing to overturn the 2020 election results. In his acceptance speech, Pence emphasized the importance of the Constitution as a unifying force and highlighted his differences with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues like spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine. Pence recounted his duty to ensure the peaceful transfer of power, referencing the pressure from then-President Trump and the events of January 6th. The award recognizes public officials who take principled stands, regardless of potential consequences, and Pence has emerged as a Republican willing to challenge the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities. Neuroscientists have found that learning a new language reshapes neural pathways, improving information processing. A German study showed that Syrian refugees' brains rewired as they became more proficient in German, leading to increased gray matter in language processing areas and enhanced connectivity between brain regions. While multilingualism may improve memory and problem-solving, it's unclear if it directly correlates with higher intelligence; however, it definitely broadens verbal repertoire and opens doors to new cultural experiences.</p>

          <p>After eight years of weekly written dialogues, New York Times columnists Gail Collins and Bret Stephens conclude their popular feature, "The Conversation," and reflect on its impact. The columnists discuss the ease and popularity of their conversational tone, highlighting how they maintained civility and humor despite political differences. They attribute the column's success to a silent majority's desire for a different tone in political discourse, contrasting it with the outrage-driven algorithms of social media. Collins and Stephens emphasize the importance of entering conversations without the intent to "win" and striving to understand opposing viewpoints, as well as the importance of humor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed a potentially universal antivenom using antibodies extracted from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who intentionally subjected himself to hundreds of snake bites over 18 years. Friede's self-immunization process made him "hyper-immune" to snake neurotoxins, enabling researchers to isolate antibodies effective against 19 of the world's deadliest snakes. The new antivenom, proven protective in mouse trials against venom from black mambas, king cobras, and others, offers hope for a broad-spectrum antidote that could be administered in rural settings via a "venom EpiPen." The researchers plan to expand trials to treat dogs and create antivenom for viper bites.</p>

          <p>Kosmos 482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere, posing a small risk of damaging property or injuring someone. The probe, originally intended to reach Venus, became stranded in low Earth orbit due to an engine malfunction. Experts believe that the lander, designed to withstand Venus' atmosphere, is likely to survive re-entry mostly intact, rather than burning up. The re-entry could occur across a wide swath of the globe, and the lander may impact the Earth's surface at approximately 150 miles per hour.</p>

          <p>A podcast discusses the complexities of defining old age and challenges the conflation of aging with disease. Dr. Kiran Rabheru, a geriatric psychiatrist, recounts his successful effort to prevent the World Health Organization from classifying old age as a disease, arguing that it perpetuates ageism. The discussion explores how societal views on aging have evolved and how classifications can impact healthcare, research, and cultural perceptions. The conversation emphasizes the importance of promoting dignity, purpose, and opportunity for individuals of all ages and extending healthspan, the period of life spent in good health, rather than solely focusing on lifespan.</p>

While global investors are showing renewed interest in Chinese assets, they remain cautious and are awaiting tangible signs that China can withstand Washington's challenges.
