          <p>Microsoft is retiring its infamous "Blue Screen of Death" after more than four decades, replacing it with a black background and a simplified message. The change, part of a broader effort to improve Windows' resilience, was announced following the major 2024 Crowdstrike IT outage that affected millions of systems. The new error screen, which will roll out on Windows 11 this summer, removes the sad face icon and displays a more condensed text to streamline the user experience during unexpected system restarts and help users recover more quickly from disruptions.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech company Xiaomi saw its stock surge to a record high after the launch of its new electric SUV, the YU7.

This success builds on the company's previous electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan, which also competed aggressively on price with Tesla. The YU7 boasts a longer driving range than its Tesla counterpart and integrates AI features, highlighting Xiaomi's rapid expansion into the competitive EV market.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers made several trades to move up in the NBA draft, ultimately selecting 6-foot-8 Arkansas wing Adou Thiero with the 36th pick. The team views Thiero as a highly athletic player who can address their need for wing defense, though he will need to develop his shooting. In other team news, guard Austin Reaves has reportedly declined a four-year, $89 million maximum contract extension. Reaves, who had a career-best season, still has two years remaining on his current deal with a player option for the final year.</p>

          <p>A large and bright meteorite, described as a fireball, was witnessed across Georgia and South Carolina before exploding over Georgia with the energy equivalent of 20 tons of TNT. NASA reported the meteor was about 3 feet in diameter, weighed over a ton, and was traveling at 30,000 miles per hour when it entered the atmosphere. The explosion created a pressure wave that resulted in sonic booms heard by residents on the ground. Experts suggest the rare daylight event could be part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower, which is active in late June.</p>

          <p>A pilot project in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is demonstrating innovative ways to combat the urban heat island effect, where dense city areas become significantly hotter than greener suburbs. An environmental group called GreenRoots has transformed a single "cool block" by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. This urban laboratory aims to create a template for other cities struggling with rising temperatures due to climate change. Researchers are studying the project's effectiveness, as such interventions can reduce peak temperatures and improve public health.</p>

A spokeswoman stated the deadline is "not critical," suggesting that negotiations with key trading partners, including Japan, could continue. This provides a potential reprieve for countries facing steep, country-specific tariffs on top of the baseline 10% duty on imports. The statement came as Japan's top negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks aimed at securing concessions from the U.S. administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old in the UK has become the first patient in Europe to receive a newly approved drug that could potentially cure her life-threatening genetic disorder, APDS. The condition, which severely weakens the immune system, claimed the lives of her mother and other relatives. The drug, leniolisib, is the first targeted treatment for APDS and was developed after researchers identified the faulty gene in the patient's family only 12 years ago. The treatment works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function properly and offering new hope.</p>
