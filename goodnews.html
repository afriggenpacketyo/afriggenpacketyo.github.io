          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the lower house of parliament for the time being, according to a lawmaker. This decision makes same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely, as the ruling bloc led by Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party does not hold a majority in the House of Representatives. Yoshihiko Noda, head of Japan's main opposition party, stated that a political vacuum should be avoided amid concerns over higher U.S. tariffs and rising tensions in the Middle East. Ishiba had previously expressed readiness to dissolve the lower house if a no-confidence motion was submitted. </p>

Comac expects the C929, similar to the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, to be certified in China by 2032. The C929 will carry up to 440 people and have a maximum range of 12,000km. </p>

          <p>Kate Middleton canceled her Royal Ascot appearance at the last minute, with royal experts suggesting that this is part of a broader trend of her prioritizing her health as she recovers from cancer treatment. Despite being cancer-free, she is still trying to find the right balance as she returns to public-facing engagements, acknowledging that she experiences both good days and bad days. Experts believe that Kate will maintain a lighter schedule of engagements for the foreseeable future, making responsible and dignified decisions with her health as the top priority. This approach marks a shift in the royal playbook, with Kate, as a future queen consort, prioritizing her well-being while still fulfilling her royal duties. </p>

          <p>South African politician Julius Malema has been denied entry to the UK by the Home Office, which deemed him "non-conducive to the public good." The UK government cited his vocal support for Hamas, including a speech he made after the October 7 attacks, and his threat to call for the "slaughter of white people" and to "take up arms." The decision highlights the UK's stance against extremism and hate speech. The UK deemed it "undesirable" to grant him entry based on his statements. </p>

The deal includes $11 billion of investment in U.S. Steel operations and a golden share issued to the U.S. government, allowing it to veto key management decisions. Hashimoto believes these conditions are rational and that the deal ensures profitability for both Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel.
