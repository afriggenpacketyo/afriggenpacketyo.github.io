This breakthrough provides a powerful tool to decode how a single fertilized egg develops into the hundreds of cell types that form complex tissues and organs. Researchers believe this detailed model will be crucial for understanding the origins of developmental defects and diseases, as abnormalities during this critical stage are highly likely to cause health issues later in life.</p>

The panel suggested that for China to become a truly wealthy nation and harmonize its global trade relationships, it needs to shift its focus and government incentives toward boosting internal consumption and the services sector.
