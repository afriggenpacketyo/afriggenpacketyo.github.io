          <p>As Warren Buffett announces his impending retirement, this article explores his investment strategy, focusing on his concept of a business as a 'castle' with a 'moat'. Buffett evaluates potential investments based on the business's fundamentals, such as earnings consistency, cash flow, and debt. He prefers businesses that are fundamentally sound and can withstand competition, often holding onto assets for long periods.

          <p>China has released an action plan to reduce the amount of grain used in livestock feed, particularly soybean meal, to maintain food security. The country aims to cut the proportion of grain in animal feed to 60% and soybean meal to 10% by 2030. This move is part of a larger campaign to secure staple crop supplies amidst global trade uncertainties. The proportion of soybean meal has already decreased in recent years as China shifts to a lower-protein feeding pattern.</p>
