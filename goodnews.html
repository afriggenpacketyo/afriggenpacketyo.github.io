          <p>The Army is preparing to ship Abrams tanks and other military vehicles to Washington, D.C., for a parade marking its 250th anniversary, which coincides with President Donald Trump's birthday. The celebration has sparked speculation that Trump is seeking a grand military parade similar to one he desired in his first term. The event is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, with heavy equipment being staged at West Potomac Park and the parade proceeding along Constitution Avenue, concluding near the White House with a parachutist delivering a flag to Trump.</p>
