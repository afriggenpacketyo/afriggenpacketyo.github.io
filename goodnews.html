          <p>The government is contemplating introducing stricter online safety measures, potentially limiting children's time on social media, with proposals including a two-hour cap on individual social media apps and a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited the addictive nature of some apps and smartphones as a key concern. An online safety campaigner criticized the government's delay in enacting new laws to protect children, highlighting the potential harm caused by weak regulation and inaction by big tech. While parental controls and screen time limits are available on some platforms, their usage is reportedly low, and some parents find the options overwhelming.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously decided the case of Ames v. Ohio, concerning discrimination based on sexual orientation, with Justice Jackson playing a key role. The case involved a heterosexual woman who sued after being passed over for a promotion and subsequently demoted in favor of gay employees. The court's decision highlights the question of how much the law should treat a person as an individual versus as a member of a group. The ruling underscores the importance of ceasing malicious discrimination, but also raises questions about whether institutions should provide assistance to targeted groups to increase diversity and overcome systemic discrimination.</p>

          <p>A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck central Colombia early Sunday, causing widespread alarm among residents.

Images on social media showed people evacuating buildings in Bogota, but rural areas appeared to have sustained no damage, as Colombia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region prone to seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Costco has introduced a new frozen strawberry lemonade at its food courts, sparking mixed reactions from members. The drink, priced at $2.99, is made with real fruit and contains no artificial flavors or colors. While some customers praised it as refreshing, others found it too tart or preferred the previous strawberry banana smoothie. Some customers reported issues with the fruit getting stuck in the straw, while others longed for the return of discontinued items like the churro. The introduction of the new beverage follows recent changes to Costco's food court menu, including the revival of the combo pizza in calzone form and the replacement of Pepsi products with Coca-Cola.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples has identified the most frequent causes of conflict in relationships, with tone of voice or attitude topping the list due to its signal of contempt. Family relations and unmet needs, especially regarding support and parenting values, also contribute significantly to arguments. Uneven distribution of household chores and the associated "invisible load" are often sources of tension, as is ineffective communication that escalates conflicts. The article suggests strategies for moving past these issues, such as naming the effect of contemptuous behavior, reassuring one another, acknowledging the invisible load, and using a designated word or phrase to signal a time-out during arguments.</p>

West Indies had earlier posted a challenging total, led by Shai Hope and Johnson Charles, but a late onslaught of runs from Rovman Powell and Jason Holder boosted their score. Adil Rashid's expensive spell contributed to England's struggles in restricting the West Indies' scoring.</p>
