          <p>The global pursuit of valuable deep-sea minerals, including rare earths, is gaining attention, but commercial exploitation remains stalled due to a lack of legal clarity. The International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN agency, is tasked with establishing a comprehensive mining code, yet its finalization is delayed by environmental concerns. This article highlights China's struggles in this domain while the US shows increasing interest, emphasizing the complex interplay of technological potential, environmental protection, and international law in unlocking these vast ocean deposits.</p>

The "rare attack" resulted in non-life-threatening injuries to his leg and foot, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The swimmer was conscious and talking when pulled from the water about 12 miles off Catalina, an area where shark attacks are highly unusual.

          <p>China is rapidly integrating robotics into its economy and society, strategically aiming for independence in core artificial intelligence technologies. Last year, Chinese factories installed nearly 300,000 new robots, surpassing the rest of the world combined. This article highlights China's distinct public-private collaboration model, which focuses on integration and scale across diverse sectors like manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture. Initiatives like "Made in China 2025" and the "AI Plus action plan" create massive domestic demand for advanced AI chips and systems, exemplified by Huawei's open-source Atlas 950 SuperPoD.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to reduce disaster relief and anti-terrorism funding for states with "sanctuary" policies. California and ten other states, along with D.C., argued in a lawsuit that the policy illegally cost them hundreds of millions. This article details that U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy granted the temporary restraining order, stating the administration's actions were an unlawful attempt to tie unrelated grant funding to state immigration policies. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta praised the decision, emphasizing the importance of these funds for public safety.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is exploring a proposal to raise the minimum wage for residential construction workers to over $32 an hour, plus an additional healthcare credit. This article details a city council motion to study the effects of this increase, aimed at attracting workers to rebuild units lost during the Palisades fire and addressing worker shortages exacerbated by immigration raid fears. Backers, including construction unions and housing groups, argue that higher wages and benefits are crucial to protect often non-union, foreign-born workers vulnerable to exploitation and wage theft.</p>
