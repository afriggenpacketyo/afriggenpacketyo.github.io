          <p>A major Japanese tutoring company, Trygroup Inc., has issued an apology for incorrectly describing Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study materials. The misinformation appeared in a video lesson for junior high school students, leading to strong public criticism and prompting the company to take the video offline and correct the inaccurate phrasing. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning, affecting thousands of people who consumed contaminated seafood near Minamata Bay in Kumamoto Prefecture. The company has been urged to make corrections by patients, victims, and the Environment Ministry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's South Western Railways has become the first private operator to return to public ownership as part of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire network by the end of 2027. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander called it a watershed moment, aiming to end 30 years of fragmentation and improve services for passengers. Rail unions have welcomed the move, citing the poor reputation of privatized rail services due to frequent cancellations and high ticket prices. The Labour government estimates that renationalization will save up to ¬£150 million in compensation fees paid to rail operators. </p>

          <p>A group of Japanese physicians and social workers are denouncing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, arguing they violate human rights. Despite the government downgrading the threat of COVID-19, many hospitals still maintain strict visitation policies, even for terminally ill patients. These policies include mask requirements, temperature checks, time limits, and visitor restrictions, and one doctor recounted his family's difficulty visiting his wife's mother in the hospital. While the health ministry recommends balancing visitations with infection control, specific measures are left to individual facilities, leading to concerns about arbitrary and overly strict policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who dwell on work-related problems may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their pets. Researchers found that dogs of owners who frequently ruminate about work during their free time showed more signs of stress, such as whining and pacing. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that stress can spill over from humans to their canine companions. Dogs are sensitive to their owners' moods and changes in care routines, making it essential for employed dog owners to avoid work-related rumination at home to protect their pet's well-being.</p>
