          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is optimistic that the budget bill, which failed to exit committee on Friday, will reach the House floor before Memorial Day. Johnson stressed the importance of the timeline for this "historic" bill and stated that the budget committee will reconvene to get it through committee, moving it to the rules committee by midweek and the House floor by the end of the week. The bill faces resistance from some Republicans concerned about Medicaid requirements and spending, as well as potential challenges in the Senate. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emphasized the need to pass the bill by July 4.</p>

          <p>Howard White, a founding father of the Jordan Brand, reminisces about Nike's decision to bet on Michael Jordan 40 years ago. The initial offer of $2.5 million was triple what any other player was making at the time. Nike hoped to net $3 million over four years, but instead, they sold $126 million in the first year alone. The Jordan Brand, now a standalone division within Nike, generates approximately $7 billion annually.

Hawaiians present leis for various occasions, from weddings to funerals. However, the future of lei making is threatened by suburban sprawl and climate change, leading to increased flower imports. Some lei makers are adapting by using alternative materials like unripe fruit and wood beads to create "forever leis," reflecting a blend of tradition and innovation.</p>
