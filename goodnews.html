          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-expected contraction in August, falling 0.1% year-on-year, marking the fourth straight month of decline but an improvement from July's 2.6% drop. This figure was better than the 1.9% contraction economists had anticipated. Imports also contracted by 5.2%, while exports to the United States saw a significant 13.8% drop despite a recent trade deal. The data comes just ahead of the Bank of Japan's upcoming interest rate decision, where it is expected to maintain current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

This pricing falls at the midpoint of the company's expected range as it prepares to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." After being reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, the company's public debut follows several delays and comes amid a recovering IPO market. The company reported a 10% increase in first-quarter revenue but also a wider net loss compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 this week, with economists closely watching for the size of the reduction and signals about future policy. The decision comes amid conflicting economic data: a slowing labor market suggests a need for a cut, while inflation is rising due to administration tariffs. The central bank faces political pressure from the White House to lower borrowing costs, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that decisions are based on economic data. This announcement is considered one of the most consequential of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his death, Robert Redford is remembered not just as a Hollywood star with classic good looks but as an actor who deliberately pursued complex and challenging roles. He frequently rejected simple, heroic parts to explore flawed and morally ambiguous characters in films like "The Candidate" and "Three Days of the Condor." This appreciation highlights how Redford used his all-American image as a "Trojan horse" to critique American ideals and expose societal rot. His career, both as an actor and a director, was defined by a commitment to giving audiences thought-provoking stories rather than easy entertainment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Attorney's office has announced that five partially built homes in Laurel Canyon will finally be demolished, ending a two-decade-long legal saga. The structures were part of a larger development project halted in 2002, with a demolition order issued in 2003 that was never enforced through multiple changes in ownership. Under a recent plea agreement with the current developers, who faced criminal charges for attempting to restart construction illegally, the homes must be torn down by August 2026. This resolution is seen as a victory for the local community.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified JPMorgan Chase as a potential candidate to join the exclusive club of non-tech companies with a $1 trillion market capitalization. He praised the bank's strong performance across lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon. Cramer noted that the entire banking sector is performing well, but JPMorgan's global reach and consistent quality set it apart. He argued that the "real rocket fuel" for the stock's growth is the expansion of its price-to-earnings multiple as Wall Street shows renewed confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality have been reported in parts of Washington state after strong winds stirred up old volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs when dry conditions and high winds lift the loose material back into the atmosphere. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have confirmed that this is not due to any new volcanic activity. The volcano's alert level remains at "Normal," though pilots have been warned the resuspended ash can be hazardous.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur's 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal showcased the team's new "clean sheet mentality" under manager Thomas Frank. This defensive focus marks a significant shift from the more attack-oriented style of the previous season. The team has now kept four clean sheets in five games, with players highlighting the new emphasis on a strong defensive structure. While effective in preventing goals—Villarreal had no shots on target—the pragmatic approach resulted in only one shot on target for Spurs, offering less excitement for fans but delivering a crucial win.</p>

Bettman acknowledged that past participation had challenges, but the decision to return was driven by the players' strong desire to represent their countries in a best-on-best international tournament.

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), believes it is unlikely that major sports teams or ownership groups will go public. Speaking at a conference, he explained that sports assets have consistently been valued more highly in private markets than in public ones. Harris argued that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which public markets, with their short-term earnings focus, may not embrace. He noted that leagues are instead opening up to private equity investment for minority stakes, which better aligns with the long-term nature of team ownership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell sharply to 6.13%, its lowest point since late 2022. This decline occurred as investors anticipated a widely expected rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. Analysts note that this follows a historical pattern where long-term rates adjust ahead of the Fed's official announcement. However, some experts caution that rates could paradoxically move higher after the cut is confirmed, suggesting the current low may be temporary. (not investment advice)</p>
