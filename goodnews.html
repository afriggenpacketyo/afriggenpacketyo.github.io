        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a third-round victory at Wimbledon, American tennis player Ben Shelton made a public plea during his on-court interview for his sister to get more time off from her job at Morgan Stanley. Shelton credited his sister, Emma, as his "lucky charm" and asked if anyone with connections could help her stay for the remainder of the tournament. The lighthearted request was successful, as Shelton later confirmed in a social media video that his sister's leave was approved, thanking the investment bank for their flexibility. Shelton now advances to the fourth round.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Military experts writing in the PLA Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, have called for significant structural changes to effectively counter drone warfare. They argue that the increasing role of unmanned aircraft in recent global conflicts necessitates the creation of specialized counter-drone units capable of rapid response. The article suggests that while dedicated units are a long-term goal, current efforts should focus on integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into existing electronic warfare teams. This reflects a strategic shift that began as early as 2016.</p>

Doherty, whose band sponsors the club, played for approximately five minutes before being substituted to prepare for a concert later the same day. The club's chairman described the event as a fantastic and fun way to kick off their pre-season, generating positive reactions from supporters and on social media.

          <p>A new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow delves into the complex life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the roots of his iconic humor and enduring cultural impact. The book traces Twain's journey from a modest upbringing in Hannibal, Missouri, to becoming a global literary figure whose work continues to resonate with modern themes of politics, class, and race. Chernow argues that Twain's sardonic wit was often rooted in personal pain and a lifelong fear of poverty. Despite his fame, Twain's life was marked by ill-fated investments and personal tragedies, all of which shaped his unique American voice.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its release, a look back at the making of Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" reveals the legendary difficulties that plagued the production. Filming on the open Atlantic Ocean with a frequently malfunctioning mechanical shark, the budget doubled and the schedule tripled, leading many involved, including star Richard Dreyfuss, to believe the film would be a failure. However, the 27-year-old Spielberg turned these challenges into opportunities, creating suspense that terrified audiences and ushered in the era of the summer blockbuster. The article features interviews with Dreyfuss, co-star Lorraine Gary, and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, who share their memories of the chaotic but ultimately historic shoot.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday, bringing winds of up to 50 mph. The storm has since weakened as it moves inland and is expected to become a tropical depression later today before dissipating on Monday. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for a portion of the Carolina coast, including Myrtle Beach, with forecasts of 2 to 4 inches of rain and the potential for flash flooding. Flood watches have been issued for areas from Myrtle Beach into inland North Carolina, and isolated tornadoes remain a possibility.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a 3,500-year-old city in Peru's Barranca province, which is believed to have been a vital trading hub for early American civilizations. The city, named Peñico, likely connected communities from the Pacific coast with those in the Andes and the Amazon basin. Researchers suggest the discovery provides insight into the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, after it declined due to climate change. The site contains 18 structures, including temples and residential complexes, where ceremonial objects and sculptures were found, highlighting its strategic importance for trade and cultural exchange.</p>

          <h2>The Evolving Meaning of the Statue of Liberty as a Symbol of Immigration</h2>

          <p>Originally conceived as a tribute to the end of slavery in the United States, the Statue of Liberty was not initially associated with immigration. This article traces its transformation into a powerful beacon for immigrants, a shift largely credited to Emma Lazarus's 1883 poem "The New Colossus." The opening of the Ellis Island immigration facility in 1892, within sight of the statue, solidified this new meaning. The narrative explores how, despite periods of restrictive immigration laws, the statue's identity as a "mother of exiles" has endured, shaping America's self-image as a nation of immigrants.</p>

          <p>Despite rising geopolitical and trade tensions at the national level, many local government officials in the United States continue to welcome Chinese investment. According to the chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce in Chicago, city leaders are receptive to Chinese-funded projects, particularly in manufacturing, to stimulate their local economies. While potential investors are concerned about the political climate, the desire to access the wealthy U.S. market, intensified by tariffs, remains strong. Mayors in Midwestern cities like Wausau, Wisconsin, are reportedly actively seeking Chinese investment in sectors such as agriculture and automotive manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A communication expert and author outlines five common phrases that, despite good intentions, can make a person seem judgmental and erode trust in relationships. Phrases like "Why don't you just…" and "Actually…" can come across as dismissive or condescending, implying the other person is wrong or illogical. Similarly, using preambles like "To be honest…" can suggest prior dishonesty and put others on the defensive. The article suggests alternative, more collaborative phrasing, such as asking curious questions, using "yes, and..." to build on ideas, and framing opinions with humility to foster more positive and open communication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new animated film "The King of Kings," based on a Charles Dickens book about the life of Jesus, aims for broad appeal but ultimately may only resonate with its core Christian audience. Despite a star-studded voice cast and efforts to avoid a preachy tone, the film's on-the-nose evangelism and jarring shifts between solemn drama and uncanny humor may alienate nonbelievers. While successful with its target demographic, the movie misses the opportunity for the nuanced character development and artful storytelling seen in other faith-based hits like "The Prince of Egypt" or "The Chosen." This leaves it feeling more like a Bible explainer than compelling cinema.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Say Hello to the Bad Guys," chronicles the pivotal moment in 1996 when wrestling superstar Hulk Hogan, the all-American hero, turned into a villain. This "heel turn" shocked fans and created the New World Order (nWo), a storyline that revitalized World Championship Wrestling and blurred the lines between performance and reality. The analysis suggests this event was more than just a wrestling narrative; it tapped into and perhaps seeded a cultural shift toward celebrating stylish malevolence. The article posits that the success of the nWo's reality-bending, anti-hero antics may have been a precursor to the political style of Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>In response to low demand, FIFA has drastically cut ticket prices for the Club World Cup semifinal match between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Standard tickets that were priced as high as $473.90 earlier in the week were reduced to just $13.40. This move is part of a dynamic pricing strategy used for the tournament, which has seen similar price drops for other quarter-final matches. In contrast, tickets for the other semifinal between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid still start at nearly $200, indicating significantly higher interest in that matchup.</p>
