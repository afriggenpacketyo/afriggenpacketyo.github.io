          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is taking on his most dramatic role yet, portraying real-life MMA fighter Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." Johnson revealed that he was nervous about the role but felt a deep need to tackle a part that allowed him to be more vulnerable, a departure from his blockbuster action films. He explained that he drew upon personal childhood trauma to connect with the character's struggles with addiction and depression, marking what he calls the start of a "new book" in his career.</p>

          <p>In a commentary for Rosh Hashanah, Rabbi Angela Buchdahl reflects on the Jewish New Year's theme of "Teshuvah," which translates to "return." She explains that this period of atonement is a communal and hopeful practice of returning to one's better self and taking collective responsibility for societal shortcomings. Buchdahl suggests that the United States as a nation could benefit from this practice of self-reflection and a collective return to its core values of compassion, goodness, and generosity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. The article identifies nine key practices, including openly discussing feelings to build emotional vocabulary, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by trusting children to try and fail. Rather than focusing on rote memorization of manners, these methods teach emotional regulation, conflict repair, and social awareness, which are the true foundations of strong interpersonal skills.</p>

          <h2>Credit Expert Identifies Common Mistakes in Using Rewards Credit Cards</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 10:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy, many consumers fail to maximize the value of their rewards credit cards by making key mistakes. He advises against defaulting to no-annual-fee cards, as those with modest fees often provide superior benefits that justify the cost. Kelly also warns against hoarding points, as their value can be devalued by issuers at any time, and encourages cardholders to contact their credit card company to negotiate the annual fee before deciding to cancel or downgrade a card.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the historic 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, which fundamentally altered civil rights in America. The ruling declared state-sponsored segregation in public schools unconstitutional, overturning the "separate but equal" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson nearly 60 years earlier. It highlights the crucial role of the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund and its lead attorney, Thurgood Marshall, who successfully argued that segregation was inherently unequal and psychologically harmful to Black children.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed a dominant win at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, strengthening perceptions of him as a potential title contender. The race was disastrous for McLaren's Oscar Piastri, the current championship leader, who crashed out on the first lap after an uncharacteristic mistake. His teammate and main rival, Lando Norris, was unable to fully capitalize, finishing seventh after getting stuck in traffic, thus only slightly reducing Piastri's overall lead in the drivers' standings.</p>

          <p>This article explains that the tiny, pin-sized holes located near the charging port on most iPhones and Android devices are microphones. Modern smartphones are typically equipped with a full microphone array, often including two or three separate mics placed at the top, back, and bottom of the device. These multiple microphones work together to provide features like noise cancellation during calls, improved audio capture for video recording, and better voice recognition for digital assistants like Siri.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested its stake in the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, concluding an exceptionally profitable investment. The initial $230 million purchase in 2008, championed by the late Charlie Munger, grew in value by approximately 3890% over the 17 years Berkshire held the shares. While Buffett has praised BYD, the sale aligns with a broader reduction in exposure to geopolitical risks associated with China, similar to the firm's quick exit from Taiwan Semiconductor.

          <p>In response to inconsistent and politicized health recommendations from federal agencies, several U.S. states are forming regional public health collaboratives to create unified, evidence-based guidance. The newly formed Northeast Public Health Collaborative, which includes seven states and New York City, aims to coordinate on issues like vaccine policy, emergency preparedness, and lab capacity. This trend, also seen on the West Coast, reflects a significant shift as states increasingly decouple their public health decisions from the national level to ensure consistent access and information for their residents.</p>

They believe that providing this knowledge earlier could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about family planning throughout their lives.</p>
