          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intent of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean after 53 years in space. The mission failed due to a booster malfunction, leaving the spacecraft stranded in Earth's orbit. The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the ambitious Soviet Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus. The spacecraft may have remained intact during its plunge. During the space race, the Soviet Union focused on Venus, while the United States focused on Mars.</p>

          <p>Media executive Barry Diller shares his insights on decision-making, emphasizing the importance of instinct over relying solely on data and research. He argues that data can only tell you what has happened, not what will happen, and that instinct is crucial for both creative and business decisions. Diller recalls instances where trusting his instincts led to successful projects, such as the movies "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." He also critiques the overreliance on data and structured information, particularly among MBA students.</p>
