          <p>President Donald Trump is considering nearly a dozen candidates to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, with many favoring a reduction in the Fed's benchmark interest rate. The prospective candidates, including current and former Fed officials, economists, and market strategists, have voiced diverse opinions on the central bank's future direction. Some advocate for a fundamental "regime change" in monetary policy, while others emphasize the need for greater transparency in the Federal Open Market Committee's decisions. Their collective insights highlight a critical juncture for the Fed, with a prevailing sentiment that current interest rates are excessively high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. consumers are maintaining strong demand for jewelry, contrasting with weaker sales in Europe and China, according to Danish brand Pandora. Pandora's CEO noted an 8% rise in U.S. sales, while China and several European markets saw declines, a trend echoed by luxury group Richemont. However, the industry faces challenges from tariffs, with Pandora forecasting a significant financial impact from increased duties, particularly on goods manufactured in Thailand. The company is absorbing some costs through optimization, but tariffs remain a fresh headwind that could undermine future U.S. consumer strength alongside rising input costs like silver prices.

          <p>With Federal Reserve interest rate cuts likely in September, Certificate of Deposit (CD) account holders whose accounts are maturing soon should take proactive steps to maximize their earnings. Savers are advised to compare current CD rates from various banks, including online options, as rates remain relatively strong despite recent declines. Re-evaluating personal budgets to potentially increase deposit amounts or opt for longer-term CDs can also optimize interest earnings. Crucially, informing banks of plans before the grace period ends is essential to avoid automatic rollover into potentially lower-rate accounts, ensuring continued financial success in a cooling rate environment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analyst Gil Luria stated that government intervention in struggling chipmaker Intel is "essential" for national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company. Luria argues such a move is necessary to revive Intel and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign chip manufacturers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor. The administration is reportedly discussing using CHIPS Act funds for this purpose, with Intel already having received significant federal support. This intervention is seen as crucial for ensuring domestic high-end technology production, especially given the strategic importance of chips for advanced AI and defense capabilities.

          <p>A 321-year-old Stuart-era shipwreck, "The Northumberland," which sank in the Great Storm of 1703, has been documented in unprecedented detail off the coast of Kent, England. Divers found an extensive hull structure, exposed deck planks, and the ship's wooden frame, along with well-preserved artifacts like wooden chests containing musketballs, a sealed chest, iron cannons, copper cauldrons, and rope. The wreck's remarkable preservation is attributed to marine sediment, but shifting sands now pose a threat, risking rapid deterioration if exposed. Experts emphasize surveying the site over artifact removal to maintain its integrity and unlock more insights into 17th-century English naval history.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group shares experienced their best day in five years, jumping 12%, after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a significant $1.6 billion stake in the health insurer. This investment, alongside disclosures from other prominent investors like Michael Burry and David Tepper, signals a strong vote of confidence in the company. The surge comes after UnitedHealth's stock had fallen nearly 50% year-to-date, facing public scrutiny over rising healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation into Medicare billing. Analysts suggest Berkshire's move could establish a near-term trading floor for the managed care organization (MCO) sector, encouraging other investors to re-enter the space.

          <p>Homeowners seeking to borrow against their substantial home equity are weighing options like home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), especially with anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts in September. While current rates for both are around 8%, HELOCs, with their variable rates, are generally better positioned to become cheaper as market rates decline, offering a potential advantage over fixed-rate home equity loans. However, the choice depends on individual needs, as HELOCs entail fluctuating monthly payments, while fixed-rate loans offer predictability despite potentially missing out on future rate reductions. Consulting a financial advisor is recommended to determine the most suitable and affordable option. (not investment advice)</p>

This breakthrough, detailed in Nature, could significantly extend the range of electric vehicles and drones, potentially tripling drone endurance and alleviating EV "range anxiety." The battery also demonstrates superior thermal and mechanical stability, withstanding low temperatures, fire, and nail punctures. If scaled for mass production, this innovation could transform the EV market and help China achieve its "Made in China 2025" goal for high-tech industries, reducing reliance on imports.</p>
