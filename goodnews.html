          <p>A potential landmark peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, aimed at ending the war in Gaza, has reportedly been brokered with the help of Donald Trump, who is preparing to visit the Middle East. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed how Trump's pressure was a key factor in bringing the parties together, particularly influencing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Analysts noted that Netanyahu's reliance on American support made him susceptible to pressure from Trump, marking a significant turning point in the long-standing conflict. The stability and long-term viability of the deal remain key questions.</p>

          <p>In a phone call described as "very productive," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged President Trump to apply his recent Middle East diplomatic success to help broker peace in Ukraine. Zelenskyy stated that if war can be stopped in one region, it can be stopped elsewhere, including the ongoing Russian invasion. The conversation also covered bolstering Ukraine's air defense capabilities following recent Russian attacks on the country's power grid. This call reflects a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who had a tense public meeting earlier in the year.</p>

He has held discussions with the club's board and is considered the frontrunner for the position, which became vacant after the dismissal of Matt Bloomfield. While a deal has not yet been finalized, Wilshere is in a strong position to secure the job over other candidates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) in North America to advance their careers and national team prospects. Players like Nashville SC's Patrick Yazbek see the league as a high-quality platform that is on track to become one of the world's best. The article notes that MLS provides professional opportunities, such as full-time coaching roles, that are less common in Australia's domestic A-League. This trend reflects a shift in MLS transfer strategy, with clubs increasingly viewing the league as a place to develop and sell on talented young players from regions like Australia.</p>

          <p>In an era dominated by streaming, independent movie theaters are adapting to survive by fostering community and getting creative with their business models. The article highlights examples like Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas in New Jersey and Vidiots in Los Angeles, which both operate as non-profits to stay afloat. These theaters emphasize a social experience, hosting events and becoming local hubs to attract audiences. New York's Metrograph demonstrates a successful for-profit model by offering a premium experience with a restaurant and bar, proving that a strong sense of community is key to drawing people back to the cinema.</p>

          <p>In observance of the U.N.'s International Day of the Girl on October 11, NPR is featuring photographs by Danielle Villasana that highlight the persistence and spirit of girls and young women worldwide. The images capture subjects in challenging circumstances, from a young Venezuelan migrant at the border to others who have faced kidnapping or violence. Villasana's work aims to convey the message that when provided with opportunity, education, and resources, girls are "unstoppable." The day serves as a call to recognize the voices and limitless potential of girls around the globe.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 10:06:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of a ceasefire agreement with Israel, Hamas is demanding the inclusion of prominent Palestinian prisoners, such as Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat, on the release list. Israel's justice ministry published a list of 250 prisoners to be freed but excluded these key figures, who are viewed by many Palestinians as symbols of resistance. This disagreement has become a potential sticking point in the U.S.-brokered deal, which involves the release of 20 Israeli hostages. It is unclear if Israel's firm refusal to include the high-profile prisoners will impact the timeline for the exchange.</p>

          <p>The Welsh political party Plaid Cymru has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000 if it wins the next Senedd election. The policy is designed to retain teaching staff in Wales, with a particular focus on Welsh-medium instruction and high-demand subjects like math and science. The payments would be conditional on the recipient working in Wales for five years after qualifying. The party aims to match similar incentives offered in England by 2030 to prevent young professionals from leaving for better financial opportunities.</p>

Ndam Njoya has been actively campaigning, including outreach to the Cameroonian diaspora in Europe, and has garnered endorsements from several former presidential candidates.

          <h2>The Psychological Benefit of Re-framing Regret as a Tool for Present-Day Learning</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the emotion of regret, suggesting that instead of being a purely negative experience focused on the past, it can be a valuable tool for self-discovery. While looking backward with "what ifs" can be painful, the piece posits that embracing feelings of disappointment or guilt can lead to learning something new about oneself in the present. Regret is described as the "emotional price we pay for free will," an unavoidable consequence of having choices. By reframing the experience, individuals can potentially use it for personal growth rather than simply wallowing in past mistakes.</p>
