          <h2>Cardiologist Identifies Five Foods to Avoid for Children's Health</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A board-certified interventional cardiologist outlines five food categories he avoids feeding his own children due to long-term health risks, particularly for heart disease. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation and train taste buds to crave unhealthy options. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt, and using an air fryer to achieve a crispy texture for foods.</p>

          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut made a triumphant return to the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, reclaiming his title on the Fourth of July after a one-year ban. He consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in the ten-minute period, securing his 17th career victory in the iconic Coney Island event, though he did not surpass his 2021 world record of 76. Chestnut's return was highly anticipated following a contractual dispute that kept him out of the 2024 competition, making this win particularly significant for him and his fans. The women's competition saw reigning champion Miki Sudo continue her dynasty, earning her 11th victory.</p>

          <h2>Filmmaker Ken Burns Discusses the Global Significance of the American Revolution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 15:29:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history, primarily because it introduced the concept of a 'citizen' rather than a 'subject.' He argues that the Declaration of Independence 'turned the world upside down' by establishing the principle that all people have unalienable rights, setting a precedent for subsequent revolutions globally. Burns, whose new film on the topic is forthcoming, also emphasized the importance of embracing America's complicated history, including the fact that the Declaration's promises did not initially apply to women, enslaved people, or Native Americans, as this complexity makes the nation's story richer.</p>

          <p>Reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz overcame a challenging match against Jan-Lennard Struff to advance to the fourth round. After dominating the first set 6-1, Alcaraz lost the second set as Struff found his rhythm, but the world number two regained control to win the match in four sets. Alcaraz demonstrated his quality under pressure, particularly with a crucial break of serve at 4-4 in the fourth set, ultimately securing his 21st consecutive win. He expressed his satisfaction with the hard-fought victory and will next face 14th seed Andrey Rublev as he continues his quest for a third straight Wimbledon title.</p>

          <p>England and Manchester City defender Kyle Walker is set to join Premier League newcomers Burnley on a two-year contract after passing a medical examination. The 35-year-old right-back spent the latter half of the previous season on loan at AC Milan, but the Italian club chose not to make the move permanent. The transfer marks the end of Walker's highly successful eight-year tenure at Manchester City, during which he won 17 major trophies, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League. His contract with City was originally set to expire next summer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new provision in a major budget package signed into law will eliminate federal income taxes on tips for many service industry workers. The measure creates a new deduction, though it does not affect state, local, or payroll taxes, and is set to expire in 2028 unless renewed by Congress. The White House projects this will increase the average take-home pay for eligible workers by over $1,600 annually. However, critics and policy experts note that the deduction will not benefit the lowest-earning tipped workers, who often have no federal income tax liability to begin with, and suggest that raising the minimum wage would be a more effective way to help low-wage employees.

          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Donald Trump proposed a novel idea for celebrating the nation's 250th anniversary next year: hosting a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds. Trump stated he had discussed the plan with UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, who would handle the event logistics. The proposal involves building a temporary venue for 20,000 to 25,000 spectators for a full championship fight card on July 4th. This would be an unprecedented use of the White House grounds, which has never before hosted a professional sporting event of this nature.</p>

The summit also focused on bolstering Moldova's resilience against Russian hybrid threats and disinformation, particularly as the country heads into elections.

          <p>England's Jamie Smith scored a spectacular maiden Test century, making 184 not out to lead a dramatic fightback against India on the third day at Edgbaston. After England collapsed to 85-5 early in the day, Smith and Harry Brook, who made 158, forged a remarkable 303-run partnership for the sixth wicket. However, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj, stormed back with the second new ball, causing a late collapse as England lost their last five wickets for just 20 runs. Despite the heroic partnership, India holds a commanding overall lead of 244 runs with nine wickets in hand heading into the fourth day.</p>

          <p>Cars manufactured in China accounted for a record 10% of all new car sales in the UK in June, a significant increase from 6% the previous year. This surge, driven by new brands like BYD and established ones like MG, comes as other Western nations, including the U.S. and EU, have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. The UK has not followed suit, creating a major opportunity for Chinese automakers who are seen as producing innovative and competitively priced vehicles. The trend has prompted some industry leaders to warn that the UK's domestic industry may struggle to compete without new government measures. (not investment advice)</p>

Nevertheless, the project is underway, aiming to capture a perceived gap to the left of Keir Starmer's Labour. Polling suggests such a party could gain up to 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters, which could significantly impact the UK's political landscape.</p>

This trend reflects a broader shift where financial giants like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock are leveraging Ethereum for tokenization and stablecoin settlements.

          <p>In an effort to save Florida's iconic reefs from rising ocean temperatures, scientists are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a reef near Miami that was devastated by bleaching. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami and other organizations, involves crossbreeding Florida's Elkhorn corals with corals from a naturally warmer reef in Honduras. The goal is to introduce greater genetic diversity and thermal tolerance, helping the reef ecosystem become more resilient to the effects of climate change. This marks the first time internationally crossbred corals have been permitted for planting in the wild, offering a potential blueprint for future reef restoration.</p>
