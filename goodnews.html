          <p>Mortgage application volume has jumped 12.5% after adjusting for the Memorial Day holiday, reaching its highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Despite this increase, overall volume remains historically low, and interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances saw a marginal rise to 6.93%. Refinance applications surged 16% for the week, while purchase applications rose 10%, potentially driven by increased housing inventory and easing home prices. While economic uncertainty persists, homebuyers appear to be capitalizing on the loosening housing market, although it remains to be seen if inflation data will affect these numbers.

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in Europe are experiencing a resurgence in 2025, with over 2.2 million electrified vehicles registered from January to April, marking a 20% increase compared to 2024. Battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations have surged by 26%, indicating a strong shift towards zero-emission driving. The recovery is primarily driven by a January 1 EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions by 15%, incentivizing corporate sales through attractive leasing deals and new EV models. While public enthusiasm for EVs remains moderate, Chinese brands are gaining ground, challenging European and Japanese rivals in the rapidly evolving market.</p>
