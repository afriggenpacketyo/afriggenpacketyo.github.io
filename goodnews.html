          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. The company's enhanced detection methods, including auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, contributed to the rise in flagged submissions. Tripadvisor identifies four categories of fake submissions: boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews, with boosting and member fraud being the most prevalent. The company is continuously working to improve its technology to combat fake reviews, employing AI and behavioral biometrics to identify patterns and penalize violators.

Economic concerns dominate voters' minds, but foreign policy demands equal attention due to South Korea's position in major power competition.
