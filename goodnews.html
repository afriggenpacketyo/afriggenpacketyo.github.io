          <p>The White House indicated that President Trump is likely to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, potentially addressing trade tensions between the two nations. This follows accusations from Trump that China violated a previous trade deal negotiated in Geneva, claims which Beijing refuted by accusing the U.S. of provoking economic frictions. The potential dialogue aims to address ongoing disputes over tariffs and trade agreements, which have been a source of market volatility. White House officials have not provided a specific date for the call, but expectations of the discussion helped the market recover from earlier losses. (not investment advice)</p>
