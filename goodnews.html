          <p>MicroStrategy's bitcoin treasury strategy, which significantly boosted its market capitalization, is now being adopted by various companies, including meme stock firms and media conglomerates. Despite this growing interest, Wall Street remains skeptical, as evidenced by the stock performance of companies like Trump Media and GameStop following their bitcoin-related announcements. Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, views this trend as a global shift in corporate finance and emphasized the long-term popularity of having bitcoin on the balance sheet. The Biden administration previously treated corporate bitcoin adoption with caution, but under President Trump, there's a move towards establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, signaling a change in regulatory perspective. Optimism about bitcoin's future and the increasing number of actors in the ecosystem contribute to its robustness.</p>

Unlike larger platforms like Uber Eats and DoorDash, Fantuan employs a strategy of in-person outreach to restaurant owners, often communicating in Chinese to build trust. These platforms cater to first-generation immigrants and international students seeking authentic flavors from their home countries, with app designs reminiscent of Chinese platforms. Fantuan has seen significant growth in the U.S. and aims to "co-exist" with larger companies by connecting authentic businesses to customers.

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed a spinal tumor from a patient through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. Karla Flores, who was initially diagnosed with a brain stem tumor, had a second chordoma discovered on her spine during an MRI. Dr. Mohammed Labib developed a unique surgical plan, called the "third nostril" approach, to access the tumor through Flores' eye, as traditional methods were not viable. The procedure involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to reach the tumor, ultimately removing it entirely and reconstructing the eye socket. The success of the surgery offers hope for treating other difficult-to-reach tumors.</p>

          <p>Lyft, under CEO David Risher, has shown significant operational and financial improvements, including increased revenue and positive free cash flow. However, its share price remains undervalued due to industry dynamics and suboptimal capital allocation practices.

          <p>The 'Mission: Impossible' franchise initially distinguished itself through stand-alone stories with bold authorial styles from directors like Brian De Palma and John Woo, focusing on individual creative strengths rather than consistent lore. Later films by J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird stretched the limits of tone, further showcasing the adaptability of the franchise. In contrast, recent installments have leaned into cinematic universe conventions, attempting to connect disparate story threads, which some critics argue diminishes the unique appeal of the earlier films. The earlier films prove the value of ignoring brand-building pressures that have become the norm for big-budget features today.</p>

While more people plan to travel compared to last year, summer travel budgets have been scaled back following President Trump's tariff announcements and stock market volatility. Travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, opting to stay with family and friends, and choosing to drive instead of fly to save money.
