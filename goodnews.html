Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called his detainment a violation of his First Amendment rights. A judge ruled that Khalil is neither a threat nor a flight risk, and that the government's actions were an effort to punish him for his anti-Israel speech.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced that Neuralink will begin human trials for its first implants for vision within the next year. The implant, called "Blindsight," aims to restore vision to individuals who are completely blind by writing directly to the visual cortex. Musk says the vision offered from the implant would initially be in low resolution but will improve over time. The BCI has already seen some success in a paralyzed man who is now able to control computers with his thoughts. Long term, it'll be very high resolution and you'll be able to see multi-spectral wavelengths.</p>
