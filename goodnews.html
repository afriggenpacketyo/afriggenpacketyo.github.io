        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The price of Bitcoin reached as high as $109,500, with cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking its price exceeding $40 billion. Upcoming regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments are expected to further drive prices higher, with the number of bitcoins held by public companies growing significantly this year. The Senate is also advancing legislation to create the first regulatory framework in the U.S. for stablecoins. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) services have surged in popularity, offering consumers the ability to split purchases into smaller payments, often without interest. However, missed payments can lead to debt collection efforts, similar to traditional credit arrangements. BNPL providers may attempt in-house collection before outsourcing or selling the debt to third-party agencies, which can impact credit scores. Consumers facing BNPL debt in collections should verify the debt, understand their rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and explore options such as negotiating a settlement or seeking debt relief. </p>

          <p>The FDA is considering limiting future COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or those with underlying health conditions, a significant policy shift. This change would require vaccine makers to fund extensive placebo-controlled trials for broader access, raising concerns about the availability of updated vaccines for younger, healthy individuals. Experts caution that lengthy clinical trials may result in vaccines that are no longer effective against circulating variants. This decision comes as the FDA's vaccine committee prepares to discuss vaccine safety and efficacy data. </p>

          <p>T. Chaz Stevens, founder of "Satanology," is advocating for the display of Satanology banners at Brevard Public Schools in Florida, citing First Amendment rights. This request follows the presence of a Trinity Church banner at a high school, which Stevens views as an advertisement creating a "limited public forum." Stevens seeks to promote his religion, the "Ministry of Chaz the Bropostle and his Bro-Minions," with the motto "Satan loves the First Amendment." He argues for either equal representation of all religions or the removal of all religious banners to maintain separation of church and state. </p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of Congressional representatives is advocating for a streamlined visa processing system to ensure international visitors can attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Concerns have been raised that proposed cost-cutting measures by Secretary of State Marco Rubio could hinder visa processing and reduce attendance. The 2026 World Cup is expected to generate significant economic activity, particularly in Southern California, but success depends on efficient visa processing for spectators, athletes, and media. The representatives emphasize that the U.S. has an obligation to put its best foot forward as the host of these games. </p>
