          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Rachel Feintzeig discusses her complicated relationship with zombie shows, particularly HBO's "The Last of Us." Despite finding the show terrifying and disruptive to her sleep, she can't stop watching it. Feintzeig posits that the horror genre provides a distraction from real-world anxieties by presenting a fictional, albeit frightening, alternative. She recounts how horror movies helped her cope with personal grief in the past, but acknowledges that "The Last of Us" is pushing her limits, even as she anticipates the next terrifying alternate reality to escape to after the season ends.</p>

          <p>Several countries are launching programs to attract scientific talent from the U.S. as the Trump administration cuts federal funding for research. Programs like "Canada Leads" and France's "Safe Place for Science" promise academic freedom and competitive salaries to researchers potentially affected by budget cuts in the U.S. While it's too early to determine the extent of a potential 'brain drain,' institutions abroad are reporting increased interest from U.S.-based scientists, particularly in fields like AI and astrophysics. However, practical hurdles such as language barriers and differences in pension programs may deter some from relocating.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are expressing a desire to reduce their smartphone usage, with a British survey indicating that nearly half would prefer a world without the internet. The Offline Club, a Dutch startup, is capitalizing on this trend by organizing offline meetups where smartphones are prohibited, offering activities like reading, games, and arts and crafts. These events have expanded to multiple cities, reflecting a broader movement toward digital detox and political measures aimed at limiting social media use among young people, given concerns about mental health issues associated with excessive smartphone use.</p>

The move aims to end 30 years of fragmentation and save up to ¬£150 million in compensation fees. Four operators were already taken under public control due to poor performance, but this marks a shift toward a fully nationalized system.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their dogs. The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors. This connection is driven by "work-related rumination," where owners mentally take work home, affecting their pets' well-being. This stress transfer may occur due to emotional contagion or changes in the owner's care routine.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to raise the salaries of chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to improve working conditions and attract talent. The annual salary will increase to over 6 million yen, and chefs will be allowed to opt for government-covered rented accommodation. This move comes as Japanese cuisine gains popularity worldwide, intensifying competition for skilled chefs. The government hopes that better working conditions will encourage chefs to promote Japanese food more proactively.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to transfer to public ownership under the Labour government. The government plans to integrate SWR trains into Great British Railways (GBR), which will oversee all railway infrastructure. While the government is not promising lower fares, it aims to improve services and reinvest profits into infrastructure. Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing, while the opposition Conservatives are urging Labour to deliver on its promises.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has pledged to reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolish the two-child benefit cap if elected. This announcement intensifies the pressure on Prime Minister Starmer, who has already faced internal dissent over these policies. Reform UK plans to fund these measures by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotel accommodations for asylum seekers. The move aims to appeal to left-leaning voters and highlight divisions within the Labour party.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing problems at the World Exposition in Osaka, Japan, distressing visitors and raising hygiene concerns. The insects are found on walls and pillars throughout the venue, and while they do not bite, dead ones can cause allergic reactions. The expo organizer is taking measures, such as spraying insecticide and installing insect repellent lights, to address the issue. The insects are believed to be emerging from the Water Plaza, and experts suggest they could persist until the end of autumn.</p>

          <p>New York City beaches have opened for the season, but are facing a lifeguard shortage with only 280 certified lifeguards available. The city is implementing strategies to recruit more lifeguards, including increased hourly wages, signing bonuses, and improved facilities. Despite the shortage, officials expect staffing to increase as summer progresses. Last year, the city had certified over 900 lifeguards by July 4th. This year, the city has loosened requirements for some pools and held lifeguard exams in more boroughs.</p>
