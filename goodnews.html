          <p>Actor Matthew McConaughey is sharing marriage advice from his new book, "Poems & Prayers," suggesting that a smaller bed can foster greater intimacy between partners. He explains that he and his wife, Camila Alves, switched from a king-size to a queen-size bed to eliminate the physical distance that had grown between them. McConaughey emphasizes that this change brought them closer, literally shoulder-to-shoulder, which he believes is beneficial for a marriage. The actor also discusses the importance of prioritizing the couple's relationship, even while raising children, to set a positive example for them.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Currently, the storm is moving northwest with sustained winds of 50 mph and is not expected to pose an immediate threat to land. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict that Gabrielle will continue to strengthen over open waters, likely becoming a hurricane by Sunday. While its projected path keeps it north of the Caribbean, the system could pass east of Bermuda early next week, potentially bringing some impacts to the island as it intensifies.</p>

          <p>A Hermosa Beach, California, resident who remodeled his family home to be a net-zero energy building over a decade ago offers insights into the process. The "Green Idea House" produces more energy than it consumes through solar panels, eliminating utility bills and powering two electric cars. Key strategies included disconnecting from the gas line, using all-electric appliances, and incorporating passive design elements like strategic roof overhangs for natural heating and cooling. The project demonstrates that sustainable living is achievable with standard materials and technologies, though it requires significant research, planning, and persistence from the homeowner to execute successfully.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement at the end of the season, concluding an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kershaw is celebrated not only for his numerous accolades, including three Cy Young Awards, but also for being the cornerstone of the franchise's revival from a period of turmoil and mediocrity. He made his debut in 2008 when the team was struggling under chaotic ownership and led them through to an era of sustained success, culminating in multiple championships. His final season saw the Dodgers clinch another postseason berth, solidifying his legacy as a transformative figure in the team's history.</p>

          <p>A wave of intense, youth-led protests against government corruption and unemployment has led to the resignation of Nepal's prime minister and the appointment of Sushila Karki, the nation's first female leader. The upheaval began after police opened fire on demonstrators, sparking widespread violence that resulted in over 70 deaths. The protests were fueled by a Gen Z-led social media campaign exposing the lavish lifestyles of politicians' children. Karki, a former chief justice known for her anti-corruption stance, was chosen as the interim prime minister, reflecting the protesters' demands for systemic change in the country's political leadership.</p>

          <p>Edible insects, such as caterpillars and palm weevil larvae, are both a traditional delicacy and a dietary staple in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sold in bustling markets in the capital, Kinshasa, these insects provide a crucial source of protein and vitamins in a country where conventional meat is often unaffordable for much of the population. While caterpillars can be expensive, the larvae, known as Mpose, are more common and are even being commercially raised by NGOs to feed orphans. The practice highlights a sustainable and organic food source that is deeply ingrained in the local culture and economy.</p>

          <p>Angel Minguela Palacios, a 48-year-old delivery driver, has been released from immigration detention and reunited with his family in Los Angeles. He was arrested by Border Patrol agents in August while making a delivery in Little Tokyo, becoming what his lawyer called "collateral damage" during a nearby political event. After spending nearly a month in detention centers in California and Arizona, where he witnessed harsh conditions, he was granted a $1,500 bond, which was paid by his employer. The story provides a personal look at the impact of immigration enforcement on a family that had built a life in the U.S. for a decade.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains the Science of Limerence and How to Overcome Romantic Obsession</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book, "Smitten," delves into the concept of "limerence," a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and extreme emotional swings. Bellamy explains that while this state is a natural part of early love, it can become a form of addiction if the object of affection is unavailable or unreliable, leading to anxiety and craving. To break the cycle of unhealthy limerence, he recommends strategies such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative "daymares," and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the obsession.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrats gather for their annual conference, the party is grappling with its future strategy following a successful general election. Leader Sir Ed Davey's frequent use of playful, attention-grabbing stunts, like bungee-jumping, helped raise the party's profile but now faces questions about whether it's time for a more serious approach. Polling suggests many voters, including some Lib Dem supporters, feel the antics make the party look less serious. The party's challenge is to build on its recent gains by defining a broader policy platform while deciding how to appeal to centrist voters in a political landscape increasingly shaped by populism.</p>
