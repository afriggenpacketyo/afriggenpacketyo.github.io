          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 16:32:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the latest Consumer Price Index report showing inflation holding steady at 2.7%, financial experts argue that pursuing debt forgiveness remains a sensible strategy for many Americans. The core issue is that credit card interest rates are still at historic highs, averaging around 22%, which far outpaces the rate of inflation. Holding onto high-interest debt while waiting for potential economic improvements carries a significant opportunity cost. This article suggests that the current stable environment might be an optimal time to aggressively tackle debt before potential future economic headwinds arise. (not investment advice)</p>

The July Consumer Price Index showed a 2.7% annual increase, slightly below economists' forecasts, bolstering hopes for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. This positive economic data fueled a broad rally, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising over 470 points.

          <p>Tottenham's new manager, Thomas Frank, is quickly establishing his leadership style, characterized by a "glass half-full" and inclusive approach. In a notable early move, he invited all club staff, from catering to administration, to his first team meeting to emphasize a collective ethos where everyone is treated equally. This contrasts with his predecessor, as Frank is known for being hands-on and a protagonist in daily training sessions, with a keen attention to tactical detail. His culture is rooted in hard work and honesty, as demonstrated by his decision to leave a key player behind for persistent lateness.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment for 2026 Estimated to be 2.7%</h2>

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data for July, policy experts are projecting a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026. This estimated increase would be slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment received in 2025. The official COLA is calculated by the Social Security Administration based on the average inflation over three months—July, August, and September—and is typically announced in October. The projection provides an early glimpse for millions of seniors and other beneficiaries into how their benefits may be adjusted to keep pace with rising consumer prices.</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates that Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a significant 19-point lead in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows Mamdani with 44% of support among registered voters, compared to 25% for former Governor Andrew Cuomo and just 7% for incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, both of whom are running as independents. Mamdani's strength is particularly pronounced among younger voters, though Cuomo leads among Black and Jewish voters. The results signal a potential major political shift in the city, even as leading centrist Democrats have yet to formally endorse Mamdani.</p>

Both Vance and Jenrick share similar political views, including opposition to diversity initiatives and concerns over free speech.

          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $50,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between guaranteed rates and potentially higher, but variable, returns. This article breaks down the potential earnings, showing that for short terms like three months, a high-yield savings account might currently earn slightly more. However, for longer terms of six months to a year, the fixed rate of a CD often provides a better and more predictable return. The decision depends on the saver's risk tolerance and time horizon, especially with potential future interest rate cuts looming. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, has been rescued after being lost for nine days in the remote Canadian wilderness of British Columbia. Barber survived by drinking pond water, eating what he could find, and building a shelter from moss and sticks. Demonstrating resourcefulness, he carved "HELP" on a rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud, which aided in his discovery. A search and rescue helicopter spotted his truck and then found him nearby, severely dehydrated and with a leg injury. Rescuers noted that despite his survival skills, he was lucky to have been found when he was.</p>

          <p>Germany is reportedly planning a multi-billion dollar investment in Rheinmetall's Skyranger anti-aircraft gun system to address the growing threat from drones. This move marks a significant reinvestment in short-range air defense (SHORAD), a capability largely dismantled after the Cold War. The conflict in Ukraine has highlighted the effectiveness of such systems, like the older Gepard guns, against modern threats. The new Skyranger 30, mounted on an armored vehicle, features a 30mm cannon with advanced airburst ammunition and can be supplemented with missiles, providing a modern solution to protect both troops and critical infrastructure.</p>

Officials see this as an opportunity to become an attractive assembly hub, capitalizing on global trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian goods.
