          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its AI model Claude falls under "fair use" and is "transformative." Judge William Alsup stated that the AI models did not reproduce the creative elements or identifiable expressive style of the original works. The ruling is considered a significant victory for AI companies navigating legal challenges related to the use of copyrighted material in training large language models. This decision helps define the legal boundaries and opportunities for the AI industry regarding copyright law.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended a NATO summit in the Netherlands shortly after announcing a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, though he later stated both nations had violated it. The summit aimed to secure commitments from NATO allies to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP, a goal already agreed upon before Trump's arrival. Secretary General Mark Rutte praised Trump's actions in Iran and the new defense spending levels. Russia's war on Ukraine remains a significant concern for NATO members, with ongoing discussions about designating Russia as the primary threat to the alliance.</p>

Despite a rocky tenure with the Jets, Rodgers believes the Steelers, under coach Mike Tomlin, offer a winning environment. Rodgers will face the Jets in Week 1 and the Packers in Week 8.</p>

          <p>Analysts are suggesting that Apple should prioritize investing in artificial intelligence (AI) over continuing its stock buyback program to revitalize its stock. Despite a robust ecosystem and loyal consumers, Apple's AI integration has been underwhelming, potentially impacting its long-term competitiveness. It is suggested that Apple reduce its buyback allocation to acquire AI companies and top engineers, similar to Meta Platforms' strategy. Focusing on AI could drive sales growth and investor confidence, while prioritizing buybacks may lead to a lower price-to-earnings multiple.</p>

          <p>The housing market is experiencing a slowdown in home price increases due to rising supply and decreasing demand, with the deceleration accelerating.

Markets that were previously popular during the pandemic are now lagging, while the Midwest and Northeast are showing stronger performance. Higher mortgage rates are keeping potential buyers out of the market, contributing to the weakening prices. (not investment advice)</p>
