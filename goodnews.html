        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is deepening its security and defense cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new "E3" alliance. This strategic pivot comes in response to the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty surrounding the United States' commitment to European security under President Trump. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a bilateral treaty with the UK, following a similar state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron. The E3 framework aims to bolster Europe's defense capabilities, potentially supplementing the US security guarantee with French and British nuclear deterrence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the third round of The Open Championship, Rory McIlroy experienced a highly unusual moment on the 11th hole. While hitting his ball from a trampled-down area, his swing unearthed a second, completely hidden golf ball that was buried directly underneath his own. The unearthed ball popped into the air as McIlroy's shot traveled 117 yards into the fairway. McIlroy, who expressed his disbelief at the "weird, ridiculous" incident, went on to bogey the hole but still finished the day strong at 5-under par, moving up the leaderboard.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler has established a commanding four-shot lead going into the final day of The Open Championship at Royal Portrush. Scheffler posted a solid, bogey-free round of 67, bringing him to 14 under par for the tournament. A victory would mark the third leg of the career Grand Slam for the American, who has a perfect record of winning when holding the 54-hole lead. While players like Rory McIlroy and Matt Fitzpatrick made charges, none could consistently keep pace with Scheffler's steady and mistake-free performance.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona is reportedly close to signing Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has been out of favor at his current club since last December. The deal is expected to be an initial loan with an option to buy, a financially strategic move for the Spanish club given its ongoing economic constraints. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, Barcelona's sporting director has expressed that the 27-year-old could improve their squad, particularly on the left wing. The potential transfer has sparked debate over whether Rashford can rediscover his peak performance at the club.</p>

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler is being observed, remembering the actions of Claus von Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators. The plot, known as "Operation Valkyrie," involved planting a bomb in Hitler's military headquarters but failed to kill the dictator, leading to the swift execution of the plotters. While initially viewed as traitors, the conspirators are now honored in Germany as symbols of resistance. Historians note the plotters were conservative elites motivated by looming military defeat, and their remembrance often overshadows other resistance efforts.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold an additional 75,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $12.94 million. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares. The sale follows a previous divestment of about $37 million worth of stock earlier in the week. Nvidia's stock has surged dramatically due to high demand for its AI-powering GPUs, making it the world's most valuable company and significantly increasing Huang's personal net worth.

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open, calling it inconsistent and "out of control." Both players' groups were warned for their pace during the third round, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. Stenson noted the irony of being pushed for being a few minutes over schedule on Saturday, when the first two rounds ran nearly an hour over their allotted time. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player, arguing it would be fairer.</p>

Their mission is to promote chastity, which they define not just as abstinence but as seeing others with dignity beyond their physical attributes. They feel this message is countercultural in an era of social media and hookup culture. The activists attempt to connect with young people by discussing the negative impacts of social media on relationships, hoping to plant seeds of self-worth and reflection.</p>

Muncy, who was injured in a slide at third base on July 2, has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings. Doctors told him he was extremely lucky to have avoided a more severe, season-ending injury. His return is seen as crucial for the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled significantly in his absence.
