          <p>British authorities have seized 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port, a haul with an estimated street value of ¬£96 million. The drugs were discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. According to the UK's Home Office, this is the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record in the country. The bust highlights the ongoing efforts by the UK Border Force to combat large-scale drug smuggling operations, as cocaine-related deaths have been on the rise.</p>

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, has confirmed he will attend the upcoming peace ceremony in Nagasaki, marking the 80th anniversary of the 1945 atomic bombing. This comes after Israel was not invited to the 2024 ceremony due to the conflict in Gaza, a decision which prompted other G7 ambassadors to withdraw in solidarity. The city of Nagasaki has since adopted a more inclusive approach, inviting all diplomatic missions in Japan to this year's event. Russia's ambassador is also expected to attend for the first time since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

The article emphasizes that no house is perfect and that buyers should focus on key, unchangeable factors like location. The agent also introduces a "L.O.V.E.

A recent spike in oil prices due to the Israel-Iran conflict is expected to be temporary, with prices resuming their downward trend. Factors contributing to the expected drop include increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks, alongside a year-over-year price decrease of 12%.
