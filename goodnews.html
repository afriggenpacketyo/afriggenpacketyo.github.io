          <p>Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, announced his plan to give away the vast majority of his fortune by 2045, accelerating his philanthropic efforts through the Gates Foundation. Gates cited Andrew Carnegie's essay 'The Gospel of Wealth' as inspiration, emphasizing the duty of the wealthy to return their fortunes to society. He aims to eliminate preventable diseases, infectious diseases, and poverty, criticizing the US, UK, and France for cutting foreign aid. Gates also addressed comments he made accusing Elon Musk of endangering children's lives through cuts to US aid, specifically mentioning grants to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique.</p>

          <p>Stocks closed higher after President Trump announced a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which includes increased market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and the elimination of non-tariff barriers. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both rose by 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite increased by 1.1%. The deal maintains a 10% baseline U.S. tax on imports but provides exemptions for the first 100,000 vehicles exported from British automakers, with additional vehicles facing higher rates.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have agreed to reduce import taxes on British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free, offering relief for key UK industries. The agreement reduces the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year and slashes tariffs on steel and aluminum. The deal also includes reciprocal access for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers, although some analysts believe the deal does not meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries before Trump's tariffs.</p>
