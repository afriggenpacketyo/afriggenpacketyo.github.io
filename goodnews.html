          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose, tracking a tech rally on Wall Street, despite underlying economic fears. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained with SoftBank and Nvidia suppliers, though Nidec plunged on accounting probe news. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed due to increased household spending. Global bond markets remain in focus, with US 30-year Treasury yields rising above 5% after a court ruled most of the Trump administration's tariffs illegal, raising questions about future tariff revenues.</p>

          <p>Martha's Rule, a vital initiative allowing patients and families to seek urgent second opinions on care, is being rolled out across all acute hospitals in England. This expansion follows a successful pilot in 143 sites, which saw nearly 5,000 calls and 241 potentially life-saving interventions. The rule was championed by the parents of Martha Mills, who died after her family's concerns were overlooked. It aims to foster a more equitable doctor-patient relationship, encouraging immediate reviews from critical care teams when a patient's condition deteriorates.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion for Saturday's drawing, following no grand prize winner in Wednesday's $1.4 billion drawing. This potential windfall would be the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, with an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes. The current streak of 41 drawings without a jackpot winner ties a game record. Hope remains high for players across 45 states, as the odds of winning the top prize stand at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Experts have determined that the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, illegally felled in September 2023, was at least 100 to 120 years old. Dendrochronological analysis, or tree-ring counting, of a cross-section of the trunk provided the estimated age, narrowing down previous debates about its planting date. The tree, believed to have been planted between 1860 and 1890, was a significant landscape feature near Hadrian's Wall. This research provides further insight into the history of the beloved sycamore, whose felling sparked global outrage and led to the imprisonment of two men.</p>

          <p>European stocks are expected to open slightly higher as global markets weigh the future of President Trump's trade tariffs. Traders are closely monitoring Trump's appeal to the Supreme Court after a federal court deemed most tariffs illegal. Additionally, markets await key US labor market insights, including the ADP private payrolls report and jobless claims data, ahead of Friday's comprehensive jobs report. These economic indicators will significantly influence the near-term stock market outlook, building on a mixed performance from Wall Street and Asia-Pacific markets.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that ordinary Chinese citizens hold nuanced and flexible views on US rivalry and global leadership, offering potential avenues to reduce US-China tensions. While optimistic about their nation's future, economy, and military, a plurality of respondents (48%) expressed interest in a shared leadership role with the US. This suggests an openness to peaceful coexistence, contrasting with American perceptions of China seeking to displace the US from its global perch. The survey's authors cautioned that some findings might be influenced by self-censorship.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has overturned the Trump administration's decision to cut billions in research grants to Harvard University, ruling it violated the Ivy League college's free speech rights. Judge Allison Burroughs blocked the administration from withholding federal funding, despite acknowledging Harvard's need to address antisemitism. The judge suggested the government used antisemitism as a "smokescreen" for an ideologically motivated attack on universities. This marks a major legal victory for Harvard, though the White House has vowed to appeal the decision.</p>

Sununu, part of an influential political family, aims to appeal broadly and will decide on a run by the end of next month.

          <p>A long-lost 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, looted by the Nazis during World War II, has been recovered in Argentina. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before it disappeared in 1945 after being auctioned to Hermann Göring. The painting was spotted in an online real estate listing by Dutch journalists researching a Nazi lawyer who escaped to Argentina. This recovery marks a significant step in returning stolen cultural heritage and bringing closure to a historical injustice.</p>
