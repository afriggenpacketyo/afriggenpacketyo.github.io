          <p>Following Starbucks' announcement of a $1 billion restructuring plan that includes store closures and corporate layoffs, CNBC's Jim Cramer has endorsed the company's stock. He described the move to close underperforming stores as a "necessary" and "very bullish" step in the CEO's turnaround strategy. Cramer believes reallocating resources to better-performing locations will strengthen the company, reiterating his "buy" rating and a $100 price target for the coffee giant's shares.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan could play a significant role in resolving the war in Ukraine by ceasing purchases of Russian oil. Speaking to reporters, Trump emphasized that if Erdoğan chose to get involved, his most effective action would be to cut off this key source of funding for Russia's war effort. The comments were made ahead of discussions between the two leaders, which were set to focus on the war and trade, including Turkey's interest in purchasing U.S. fighter jets.</p>

          <p>With the cost of senior care rising significantly, planning for long-term care expenses has become a critical component of retirement strategy. This article examines the value of long-term care insurance, which can protect savings from being depleted by costs for services like nursing homes and in-home health aides, which are not typically covered by Medicare. It suggests that applying for coverage while still in good health is advantageous, as premiums increase with age and pre-existing conditions can lead to denial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billy Crudup, a two-time Emmy winner for his role as network executive Cory Ellison on "The Morning Show," reflected on his unexpected success late in his career. He discussed his journey from studying acting at NYU to taking on challenging roles in film and theater, including a one-man show that caught the attention of co-star Jennifer Aniston. Crudup attributes his career longevity to seeking complex parts rather than traditional leading man roles, a strategy that ultimately led to his popular and critically acclaimed television performance.</p>

          <p>Beginning September 30, the Social Security Administration will end its 85-year practice of issuing paper checks, moving nearly 70 million recipients to electronic payments. Beneficiaries will now receive their funds via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card, a change aimed at improving efficiency, enhancing security, and reducing costs. While the move is part of a broader federal mandate to digitize payments, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other means of receiving their benefits.</p>

          <p>HSBC, in partnership with IBM, announced it has successfully used quantum computing to improve the accuracy of its algorithmic bond price predictions by 34%. The bank hailed the trial as a "ground-breaking world-first," demonstrating a practical application of the emerging technology in the financial services industry. By combining classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor, HSBC was better able to analyze complex market data, potentially leading to increased margins and greater liquidity in over-the-counter markets.</p>

          <p>American golfer Bryson DeChambeau has expressed his hope that an appearance by President Donald Trump at the Ryder Cup will inspire the U.S. team to victory against Europe. Trump is expected to attend the first day of the event at Bethpage Black in New York, a visit DeChambeau believes will create an "electric environment" and rally support for the American side. In contrast, European player Robert MacIntyre downplayed the visit, stating that Trump is "just another spectator" and will not be a distraction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. new vehicle sales have received an unexpected boost as consumers rush to buy cars before potential price hikes from new tariffs and the expiration of EV tax credits. Cox Automotive has raised its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million vehicles, citing this trend of 'pull-ahead' buying driven by policy uncertainty. While this has benefited automakers in the short term, analysts expect sales to slow in the fourth quarter and into next year once the policy changes take full effect. (not investment advice)</p>
