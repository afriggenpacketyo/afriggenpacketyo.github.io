        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The integration of artificial intelligence in education is creating a divide, with some teachers embracing it as a valuable tool while others worry about its impact on critical thinking. Proponents highlight AI's ability to save teachers time on tasks like lesson planning, with a recent survey indicating average savings of nearly six hours per week. However, critics raise concerns about potential cheating and a decline in students' analytical skills. Tech companies are investing in training programs to help educators navigate this new landscape, emphasizing that AI should enhance, not replace, the fundamental teacher-student relationship in the classroom.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government plans to acquire a non-voting equity stake in Intel in return for funds allocated through the CHIPS Act, as confirmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This strategic shift aims to ensure that American taxpayers benefit from the federal investment intended to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. The move, which converts a previously planned grant into an equity investment, is part of a broader administration strategy to reshore critical manufacturing. The announcement led to a significant increase in Intel's stock price, reflecting market response to the potential government backing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Southern California family has found a grandmother for their twin boys through an unconventional online solution, Surrogate Grandparents USA, a Facebook group connecting families with seniors seeking grandchildren. The Turner family, feeling the absence of active grandparents in their children's lives, connected with Janet Firestein Daw, who was looking to fill the void of not having biological grandchildren. The relationship has flourished over two years, with "Nana J" becoming an integral part of the family, highlighting a growing trend of forming non-traditional family bonds to create a supportive "village" for raising children in modern society.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has announced it will gradually resume operations after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, ending a strike that disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers. The strike, which began over the weekend, was resolved after talks resumed with a mediator. A key issue resolved in the new agreement is guaranteed pay for work performed while planes are on the ground. The airline cautioned that a full restoration of its regular schedule, which includes about 700 daily flights, could take a week or more and asked for customer patience during the transition.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with top rates currently available from online banks. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.02% APY, some online institutions are offering rates as high as 4.40% for similar terms. Experts suggest that savers consider shorter-term CDs, as an inverted yield curve has made their rates higher than those for longer terms. To maximize returns, consumers are advised to compare rates from different banks, particularly online ones with lower overhead costs, and consider laddering CDs of various term lengths.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $643 million, the largest of the year, after no tickets matched all six numbers in Monday night's drawing. While the grand prize remains unclaimed, two players did win $1 million each by matching the first five numbers. The odds of winning the jackpot are approximately 1 in 292 million, but Americans continue to participate widely in the lottery. Drawings for the multi-state game are held three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, with the next opportunity for a winner to emerge on Wednesday night.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose approximately 4% after the retailer maintained its full-year sales outlook, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations for the second quarter. The company reported adjusted earnings of $4.68 per share on $45.28 billion in revenue, citing a continued "deferral mindset" among homeowners for large projects due to economic uncertainty. However, Home Depot noted positive signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. The company's forecast does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate home improvement activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kentucky has implemented an emergency ban on bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug known as "designer Xanax," making its sale and possession illegal. The action follows a request from the state's attorney general, who is also leading a coalition of 21 attorneys general urging the federal DEA to classify the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance nationwide. The unregulated drug, which has never been approved for medical use, is being illicitly sold and has been linked to a growing number of fatal overdoses, including nearly 50 in Kentucky last year, posing a significant public health threat.</p>

This gesture followed Melania Trump's own public letter to Vladimir Putin, urging him to consider the welfare of children affected by the conflict.
