          <p>The New York Knicks are expected to name Mike Brown as their next head coach, following the surprising dismissal of Tom Thibodeau after a successful season. The team advanced to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000 under Thibodeau's leadership before being eliminated by the Indiana Pacers. Brown, who most recently coached the Sacramento Kings, brings extensive experience, having previously led the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers. He has coached legendary players like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and served as an associate head coach for the Golden State Warriors, though a formal contract with the Knicks has not yet been finalized.</p>

Separately, Apple's stock has seen a recent rally, fueled by speculation that the company may partner with an AI-native platform to bolster its artificial intelligence capabilities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration plan that sought to severely limit migrants' access to the U.S. asylum system at the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president's proclamation, which cited an "invasion" to justify the new rules, overstepped executive authority as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act. The judge stated that while the executive branch faces significant immigration challenges, it cannot unilaterally create an alternative system that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The order has been temporarily stayed for 14 days to allow the administration to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot prematurely end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants currently living in the United States. The administration had planned to revoke their status in September, well before the previously established 2026 deadline. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The ruling provides immediate relief for migrants who have established lives in the U.S., though the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, citing executive authority over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>On the first day of the second Test at Edgbaston, India captain Shubman Gill scored a patient century to help his team reach a solid total of 310-5 against England. Despite a battling effort from England's bowlers on a flat pitch, Gill's unflustered performance, supported by an elegant 87 from Yashasvi Jaiswal, anchored the innings. England's bowlers, particularly Chris Woakes, managed to take key wickets throughout the day to keep India in check. However, a late partnership between Gill and Ravindra Jadeja ensured India ended the day in a favorable position as they look to level the series.</p>

          <p>A new mission is being organized to locate Amelia Earhart's missing aircraft, spurred by a satellite image that may show wreckage on a remote Pacific island. Researchers from the Archaeological Legacy Institute and Purdue University believe the object, visible on the island of Nikumaroro, could be part of Earhart's Lockheed Electra. Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan vanished 88 years ago during their attempt to circumnavigate the globe. The expedition, planned for November, hopes to finally solve one of aviation's greatest mysteries, though some experts remain skeptical, suggesting the object in the image could be natural debris.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is escalating its efforts to combat the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that poses a severe threat to livestock, wildlife, and pets. The plan involves breeding billions of male screwworm flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This sterile insect technique has been used successfully in the past to eradicate the pest, which can kill a large animal within two weeks and has recently reappeared in southern Mexico.</p>

          <p>With the economic landscape shifting due to lower inflation and anticipated interest rate cuts, savers with significant funds should carefully consider their options. This article suggests asking three crucial questions before placing $10,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD). Savers should first determine whether a short-term or long-term CD is more advantageous, given that short-term rates are currently higher. They must also assess if they can afford to have a large sum of money inaccessible for the CD's entire term. Finally, it is essential to compare CDs with high-yield alternatives like savings and money market accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

This surge in interest follows recent developments, including Robinhood's plan to enable trading of tokenized US stocks in Europe and the growth of stablecoins on the Ethereum platform.
