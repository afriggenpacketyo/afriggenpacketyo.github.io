          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is shifting its focus towards global arms exports to strengthen ties with allies and enhance the interoperability of its forces. This change is driven by security concerns rather than solely seeking profits from increased global arms demand. By exporting arms, Japan aims to standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities with purchasing countries. The move also seeks to bolster Japan's defense industrial base, which has faced challenges due to reliance on U.S. weapon purchases. The article underscores Japan's desire to build domestic capacity and ensure its security in a changing global landscape. This is a relatively stable development.</p>

          <p>The city of Xian in western China has long been a prime destination for tourists from home and abroad. Chang Youli, a stylist of traditional Chinese clothing (hanfu) based in the city, has noticed many people are joining her trade to cater to a particular type of traveller. The elaborate costumes, typically donned for photoshoots at scenic or historical points of interest, have exploded in popularity in tandem with calls from the government to embrace traditional culture as a means of expressing national confidence. A cottage industry has developed to meet this new demand, employing costumiers, make-up artists and photographers ‚Äì with some enterprising minds packaging these services together for an all-in-one experience. Tourism is up.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, which will bring into force parts of a tariff deal agreed between the two countries last month. Speaking at the G7 summit in Canada, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the move a "very important day" for both countries. It comes after weeks of talks to implement parts of the pact, which the UK government hopes will shield British businesses from the impact of Trump's tariffs. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. It is a partial deal.</p>
