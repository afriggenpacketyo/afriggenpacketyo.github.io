        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has urged the United States to cancel "unreasonable tariffs" to create better conditions for bilateral trade, specifically highlighting the impact on soybean imports. The statement comes as American farmers enter harvest season without the usual bulk purchases from China, traditionally their largest market. A ministry spokesman emphasized that positive action from the U.S. is needed to restore normalcy to the agricultural trade relationship. This call for tariff removal followed a meeting between Chinese trade officials and a delegation of political and business leaders from the American Midwest, a region heavily reliant on soybean exports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>H&M's shares surged after the fashion retailer reported third-quarter operating profit and sales that exceeded analyst expectations, signaling its turnaround plan is taking effect. Operating profit rose 40% year-over-year, driven by tight cost controls and a renewed focus on core product lines under CEO Daniel Erver. This marks the second consecutive quarter of strong performance as the company works to improve efficiency through store revamps and increased digitization to better compete with rivals like Zara-owner Inditex. However, the company cautioned that the full impact of U.S. tariffs on imports could lead to price increases later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review of Patricia Lockwood's new novel, "Will There Ever Be Another You," examines its contribution to the literature of sickness. The book follows a writer, also named Patricia, as she navigates the debilitating and transformative effects of long COVID over four years. The novel captures the alienation and cognitive disruption of the illness, including memory loss and a shattered sense of identity, using poetic and fragmented prose. The reviewer notes that the book stands out by focusing on the prolonged, unresolved state of being sick, exploring the narrator's deep curiosity about how the illness has remade her mind and her relationship with language.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has launched a formal antitrust investigation into German software company SAP over concerns about its practices in the software support services market. The probe will examine whether SAP has unfairly restricted competition for maintenance and support services related to its on-premises enterprise software. SAP, one of Europe's most valuable tech firms, stated its belief that its actions comply with EU competition laws but is cooperating fully with the commission. The company does not expect the investigation to have a material impact on its financial performance, though its shares saw a slight decline following the announcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple is attempting to address the rampant problem of spam calls and texts with new features in its latest iOS update. A new AI-powered call screening tool, which is off by default, has Siri intercept calls from unknown numbers to ask for the caller's name and purpose before the user's phone rings. The system then transcribes the response in real-time for the user to review. Additionally, the Messages app now includes enhanced, multi-layered filtering to automatically sort texts from unknown senders and suspected spam into separate inboxes. While these tools offer more user control, they also add complexity and reflect a broader industry trend of using technology to reclaim the basic functionality of phones.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has acknowledged that Labour MPs have contacted him about a potential challenge to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. While stating it is a matter for the party in Westminster to decide, his comments have fueled speculation about his ambitions. Burnham, who is not currently an MP, emphasized the need for a "proper plan for the country" and offered to support Starmer in developing new policies. The discussion comes amid some disquiet within the Labour party over the government's performance and the rise of Reform UK in opinion polls.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark ruling, a Spanish court has convicted a man for killing a puppy by applying a gender violence law, recognizing the act as a form of psychological abuse against his partner. The court on the island of Gran Canaria found that the man intentionally threw the four-month-old puppy off a cliff to inflict emotional suffering on the woman, an act defined as "vicarious violence." This is the first time Spain's pioneering legislation against gender-based violence has been extended to a case involving an animal. The ruling establishes a new legal precedent for how animal cruelty can be prosecuted when used as a tool to harm a human partner.</p>

          <p>An education researcher argues that while generative AI has introduced new tools for academic dishonesty, it may not have significantly increased the overall rate of cheating, which was already high. Citing survey data from before and after the release of ChatGPT, the article suggests that AI is replacing older methods like copying from websites or peers, rather than creating a new wave of cheaters. The piece delves into the complexities of why students cheat, including academic pressure and assignments perceived as busy-work. It also highlights the ambiguity around what constitutes permissible AI use, as teachers and schools are still developing clear policies for this new technology.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Ticketmaster has agreed to improve how it communicates ticket prices to consumers. The probe was launched after complaints that fans were misled during the sale of Oasis reunion tour tickets, where a tiered pricing system led to significant price variations for similar seats without clear explanation. Ticketmaster will now have to provide more upfront information about pricing structures and use accurate labeling. While the CMA found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing," the agreement aims to prevent consumers from being surprised by high costs and ensure transparency in the ticket-buying process.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), once the world's third busiest, has fallen to 11th in global rankings as its passenger recovery post-pandemic lags behind other major hubs. Airport officials cite a slower recovery and increased competition from regional airports as contributing factors. The dip in traffic is seen as an opportunity to accelerate a $30-billion modernization project aimed at transforming the airport before the 2028 Olympics. Key projects include the long-delayed Automated People Mover train, terminal renovations, and infrastructure upgrades, all intended to improve the notoriously difficult passenger experience and restore LAX's status as a world-class facility.</p>

Overcoming historical gender barriers at institutions that once barred women, Mueller not only supported the research of countless astronomers but also made significant discoveries of her own. Using the observatory's powerful telescopes, she discovered 15 comets, numerous asteroids, and over 100 supernovae, leaving a remarkable legacy in observational astronomy.</p>

          <p>Millions of California residents will see a credit on their electricity bills this October as part of the state's biannual California Climate Credit program. The refund, which varies by utility provider but can be over $50 for many, is derived from the state's cap-and-invest program. This system requires large industrial polluters to purchase permits for their greenhouse gas emissions, and a portion of the revenue is returned directly to residential and small-business customers. The credit is applied automatically in April and October for electricity, and with recent legislation extending the program, these refunds are expected to increase in the coming years.</p>
