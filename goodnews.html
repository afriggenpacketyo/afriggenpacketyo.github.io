          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng reported its eighth consecutive month of delivering over 30,000 cars, demonstrating resilience amid an intense price war in China's EV market. While competitors like Nio and Li Auto showed mixed results, market giant BYD continued its dominance with over 2.1 million passenger car sales in the first half of the year. The fierce competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government, is also pressuring international players like Tesla, which saw its market share and sales decline in the face of new, competitively priced models from local brands such as Xiaomi.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has accepted the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal brokered by Qatar and Egypt. The proposal aims to halt the conflict, which began after the October 7th attack, and facilitate negotiations to end the war and secure the release of remaining hostages. This development comes as Israeli officials continue to state that the war will only end with the dismantling of Hamas, while Hamas has demanded a permanent truce and a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory.</p>

          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia, collectively known as the "Quad," have announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals. The move is a direct response to concerns over China's dominance in the processing and refining of these materials, which are essential for high-tech industries like semiconductors. In a joint statement, the group highlighted the risks of economic coercion and supply chain disruptions from relying on a single country.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year, blocking a plan to end the program in September. The Brooklyn-based judge stated that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to vacate a country's TPS designation before its previously scheduled expiration date of February 2026. The ruling provides temporary relief for Haitians who enrolled in schools, took jobs, and began medical treatments in reliance on the existing deadline, though the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who passionately testified before lawmakers in 2023 while dying from a rare cancer she believed was linked to the chemicals in her community's water. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential PFAS products by 2032.
