          <p>Start-up companies like Better Dairy are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to produce casein, the key protein in milk, without involving animals. The goal is to create a product that mimics the taste and texture of traditional dairy cheese, addressing the quality gap often found in plant-based alternatives. Despite the innovation, these products face hurdles, including high initial costs, regulatory approval, and a recent decline in the vegan food market. Firms are targeting commercial release within a few years, hoping to overcome consumer concerns about price and ultra-processed foods.</p>

          <p>The television show 'Love Island' is experiencing a revival in viewership, with figures returning to levels not seen in years, largely attributed to its massive social media presence. The show's official accounts have gained millions of followers, particularly on TikTok, where short clips, recaps, and fan analyses drive engagement. This shift reflects a changing media consumption habit where many viewers prefer to keep up with the show through bite-sized online content rather than watching the full nightly episodes. While this boosts the show's reach, some critics worry it provides a decontextualized and less authentic viewing experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting 'indiscriminate' immigration arrests. The ruling bars officials from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish, and from denying them access to legal counsel. The order stems from a lawsuit filed by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were unlawfully detained. The judge found a 'mountain of evidence' suggesting unconstitutional 'roving patrols.' The Department of Homeland Security criticized the decision, claiming it undermines efforts to remove dangerous criminals from communities.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers secure a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants and end a seven-game losing streak. In his return to the mound following Tommy John surgery, Ohtani pitched three scoreless innings, striking out four and allowing only one hit. Although a relief pitcher was credited with the win, Ohtani's dominant start set a positive tone for the team. The performance is a promising sign as he continues to build up his pitching workload while contributing as one of the team's key players.</p>

          <h2>Expert Suggests AI's Impact on China's Population Decline May Not Be Entirely Negative</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 18:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for exacerbating China's population decline by reducing incentives for marriage and childbearing, a demography expert suggests this view may be too narrow. As AI technology advances, it could fulfill roles traditionally met by family, such as providing emotional companionship and elderly care. This shift may redefine societal structures around life, death, and family, making traditional concerns about population numbers less relevant. The article explores the perspective of young professionals who see AI as a viable alternative to traditional family support systems, potentially leading to new social paradigms.</p>

          <h2>Campaigners Advocate for English Ingredient Lists on Cosmetics to Protect Allergy Sufferers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advocates, including a Member of Parliament with a severe nut allergy, are campaigning for cosmetic and skincare products to list ingredients in English instead of Latin. They argue that the current system, which uses the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), puts people with allergies at risk as many consumers cannot recognize allergens written in Latin. While the industry association defends the Latin-based system for providing global consistency, families affected by allergic reactions say clear, English-language labeling, similar to food packaging, is a necessary safety measure to prevent potentially life-threatening incidents.</p>
