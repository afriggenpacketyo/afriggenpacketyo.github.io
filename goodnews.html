          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, residents of the small community are reflecting on the event that thrust them into the national spotlight. The attack, which wounded Trump and killed firefighter Corey Comperatore, left a lasting mark on the town. However, many locals express pride in how the community unified to support the Comperatore family and each other in the aftermath of the tragedy. They hope that Butler will be remembered not for the violence, but for the resilience and solidarity demonstrated by its residents, who describe themselves as 'tough cookies'.</p>

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are leading a bipartisan effort to pass a sanctions bill aimed at pressuring Russia to end its war in Ukraine. The legislation would provide President Trump with a "sledgehammer" to target Vladimir Putin's economy by imposing tariffs of up to 500% on countries that support Russia's war machine, such as China, India, and Brazil. With 85 cosponsors, the bill signals strong congressional unity and comes as the Trump administration considers new measures, including potential weapons sales to allies, to increase support for Ukraine.

          <p>In a central Denver neighborhood, an old fortune cookie factory from the 1940s has been transformed into a unique, free-to-the-public art gallery. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago and, after an eight-year renovation, opened the Cookie Factory gallery in May. The privately funded space aims to provide a place for community connection and healing through art, reflecting Precourt's personal journey with mental wellness. The inaugural exhibition features nature-based works by artist Sam Falls and will run through September before a new artist is featured.</p>

According to a recent study, nearly half of Gen Z singles now use AI for dating help, a significant increase from the previous year. While some users find the technology to be a valuable confidence booster and icebreaker, experts caution against over-reliance, stressing that AI should supplement, not replace, genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell has emphasized that improving the nation's weather warning systems is a "national responsibility." The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is pushing for a significant, bipartisan investment to upgrade forecasting infrastructure, including Doppler radar and ocean buoys. Cantwell argues that enhanced science and data analytics at the federal level can provide more advanced warnings for events like floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes, ultimately saving lives. Her call comes amid scrutiny of NOAA and the National Weather Service's performance during the disaster.</p>

The family, which has ties to the property for nearly a century, survived by sheltering in the attic as the Guadalupe River surged. Lacking flood insurance due to its high cost, they face an estimated half-million-dollar repair bill. Despite the increasing frequency of such disasters, the family's deep emotional connection to the home and its memories is driving their determination to restore it for future generations.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a preliminary investigation into last month's fatal Air India crash, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing have privately notified authorities that the fuel switch lock design on Boeing aircraft is safe. A preliminary report on the crash, which killed 260 people, had raised questions about the engine fuel cutoff switches. However, an FAA notification stated the issue is not considered an "unsafe condition" that would warrant a mandatory airworthiness directive. This comes as the Indian pilots' association calls for its inclusion as an observer in the ongoing investigation.</p>
