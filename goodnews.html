          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who was born with a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, is highlighting the significant accessibility issues within the Houses of Parliament. Despite the Equalities Act being passed in the very same buildings 15 years ago, she points out numerous challenges, from hard-to-use door handles and long distances to accessible toilets to the physical demands of parliamentary procedures like voting. Tidball is working with the House of Commons Modernisation Committee to advocate for changes, stating that Parliament must better reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities to enrich the nation's politics.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris has confirmed that his vision is fine following a Fourth of July fireworks accident that resulted in an eye injury. Addressing the incident for the first time, Harris described it as a humbling experience but stated the injury was superficial and he expects to play in the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. Having been cleared for contact, he is gradually increasing his workload in practice. Coach Jim Harbaugh noted Harris has looked "really, really good" since returning, though his official status for the upcoming game in Brazil remains to be confirmed.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, stands as a historic and architectural treasure, considered a benchmark for national park design. Constructed in 1904 from approximately 10,000 trees, including uniquely twisted logs sought out as "freaks of the forest," it was once advertised as the world's largest log cabin. The inn has hosted presidents and millions of travelers, surviving natural disasters and the passage of time. Its distinctive style, known as "parkitecture," heavily influenced the design of other famous lodges in national parks like Yosemite and Glacier, cementing its legacy in American history.</p>

          <p>After his son Frederico was diagnosed with a recurrent medulloblastoma brain tumor, Fernando Goldsztein launched the Medulloblastoma Initiative (MBI) to accelerate research for the rare childhood cancer. When doctors advised him there were no further treatment options, Goldsztein collaborated with a leading researcher to create MBI, which funds a global network of over a dozen labs required to work together. The initiative has successfully fast-tracked clinical trials for new treatments, including programming white blood cells to target tumor cells, offering new hope for his son and thousands of other children facing the same diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Musician Tom Odell discusses the unexpected impact of his live performances, revealing that a 2016 show he considered a failure inspired Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell to pursue their own music careers. This connection led to Eilish inviting Odell to open for her world tour, coinciding with a new peak in his own career driven by TikTok fame and his hit song "Black Friday." Odell reflects on the vulnerability expressed in his new, darker material and how it has created a profound connection with his audience, allowing him the freedom to record his latest album, "A Wonderful Life."</p>

          <p>Two-time champion Naomi Osaka delivered her most impressive performance since returning from childbirth, defeating defending champion Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-2 to reach the US Open quarter-finals. Osaka capitalized on an unsteady performance from Gauff, whose game was marred by unforced errors, particularly on her forehand. This victory marks Osaka's first major quarter-final appearance since winning the 2021 Australian Open and represents her highest-ranked win in six years. She described the match as one of the moments she plays tennis for and will next face Karolina Muchova in the last eight.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new spending record, with the total outlay for the summer transfer window surpassing £3 billion for the first time. This figure is significantly higher than last summer's £1.96 billion and exceeds the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. The deadline day was highlighted by Alexander Isak's British record £125 million move from Newcastle to Liverpool, which pushed the total to £3.087 billion. The massive spending, particularly from clubs like Liverpool, Chelsea, and Arsenal, underscores the league's immense financial dominance in European football.</p>

          <p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is receiving critical acclaim and potential Oscar consideration for his dramatic role in the film "The Smashing Machine," which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Johnson portrays real-life UFC fighter Mark Kerr, a role he says he had a "burning desire" to take on after years of feeling pigeon-holed as a blockbuster action star. Early reviews praise his transformative performance as a revelation, noting his warm, sincere, and ego-less portrayal of the fighter's life and struggles with substance abuse. The actor stated the role was less about proving something to Hollywood and more about an internal desire to explore a deeper, more intense character.</p>

          <p>The Swiss food giant Nestle has fired its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, after an investigation found he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate. The dismissal, which is effective immediately, was triggered by a report made through the company's whistleblowing channel and represents a conflict of interest. Nestle's chairman stated the decision was necessary to uphold the company's strong values and governance. Freixe, who had been with the company for nearly 40 years, will not receive an exit package.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a bloc including China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a development bank to serve its member nations. The move is aimed at insulating the 10-country group from the risks associated with the U.S. dollar-dominated trade system and accelerating key infrastructure projects. Analysts suggest that creating such a concessional lender is a logical step for the Eurasian group to enhance financial sovereignty and deepen economic integration. The decision was confirmed in an official statement following the SCO summit, marking a significant push for an idea that had long been on hold.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across much of the United Kingdom in the coming days. A recent coronal mass ejection from the sun has increased solar activity, potentially pushing the phenomenon further south than usual. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies and can be affected by cloud cover and light pollution, forecasters suggest Monday and Tuesday nights offer the best opportunity. The Midlands may have the clearest skies, but northern regions of the UK will, as usual, have the highest probability of a sighting.</p>
