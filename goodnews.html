          <p>Bill Clinton and James Patterson have collaborated on a new thriller, "The First Gentleman," where the commander-in-chief is a woman, and her husband is accused of murder. Clinton drew on his experiences and thoughts about the role of a presidential spouse, which he considered during Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. The authors discussed how their partnership has evolved, with Clinton noting they've played more golf, while Patterson joked about Clinton having more 'presidencies' but fewer holes-in-one. They hope the book offers an escape for readers amidst real-life political drama while reminding them to believe in the democratic system.</p>
