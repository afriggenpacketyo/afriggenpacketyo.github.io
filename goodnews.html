          <h2>New Biography Alleges Gwyneth Paltrow Felt Brad Pitt Lacked Sophistication</h2>

          <p>A new biography by author Amy Odell claims that during their relationship in the 1990s, Gwyneth Paltrow harbored doubts about her then-fiancé, Brad Pitt. The book alleges that Paltrow felt she was more educated and sophisticated than Pitt, a sentiment rooted in their significantly different upbringings. Odell writes that Paltrow expressed these concerns to a crew member while filming and even admitted to having a crush on actor Hugh Grant at the time. The couple met in 1993, became engaged in 1996, and ultimately ended their relationship in 1997.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that Kyiv has formally proposed a new round of peace talks with Moscow, suggesting they take place as soon as next week. The stated goal is to accelerate the negotiation process and make tangible progress towards achieving a ceasefire. This diplomatic initiative occurs even as Ukraine continues to endure intense military assaults from Russian forces. In a separate development, Ukraine also accused Russia of weaponizing deportations after it had to evacuate 43 of its citizens who were abandoned without documents near the Georgian border.</p>

The successful event coincided with the UK government's announcement that it would support a bid for London to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships, adding to the day's positive atmosphere.</p>

          <p>According to a new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold an additional 75,000 shares of company stock, valued at approximately $12.94 million. This sale is part of a pre-arranged trading plan that was adopted in March, allowing for the sale of up to 6 million shares over a set period. The transaction follows another recent sale of about $37 million worth of shares by the CEO. These sales are occurring as Nvidia's market value has soared past $4 trillion, driven by immense demand for its AI-powering processors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Flanker Tom Curry delivered a powerful and aggressive performance that was instrumental in the British and Irish Lions securing a 27-19 victory over Australia in their first Test match. Curry, who had faced public criticism regarding his recent form, was a dominant force on the field, making crucial tackles, winning turnovers, and scoring a try. Coach Andy Farrell praised Curry and fellow flanker Tadhg Beirne as "immense" following the match. The hard-fought victory gives the Lions a crucial 1-0 lead in the three-match series as they head to Melbourne for the next game.</p>

          <p>Major golf champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have publicly criticized the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules during the third round of The Open championship. Both golfers were warned by officials about their pace of play, with Stenson calling the approach "inconsistent" after his group was timed despite earlier rounds running significantly over schedule. DeChambeau, who also felt rushed, advocated for a simpler and more transparent system where every shot for every player is timed. The complaints highlight ongoing frustrations among professional golfers regarding how pace of play is managed at major tournaments.</p>

After selling her home in Wisconsin, she was inspired to quit her job and has since been journeying along the Pan-American highway. Her monthly expenses average around $1,305, with gas and food being the largest costs. Kaye's story highlights the growing trend of "overlanding," a self-reliant form of adventure travel, detailing both the freedoms and the logistical challenges of living in a small, mobile space.</p>

          <p>Thymen Arensman of the Ineos Grenadiers team has claimed his first-ever Tour de France stage victory on a grueling mountain stage, while top contender Remco Evenepoel was forced to abandon the race.

Overall race leader Tadej Pogacar further extended his advantage by finishing second on the stage.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is reportedly recovering from a left knee bone bruise much more quickly than the initially projected six-week timeline. Muncy, who was injured during a slide at third base on July 2, has already resumed running, performing agility drills, and taking swings. He described himself as extremely "lucky" that the injury wasn't more severe, as doctors informed him that a slight difference in the impact's timing could have required surgery. His accelerated recovery is a positive development for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled since he was sidelined.</p>

The team, which included notable athletes like Roger Black and Iwan Thomas, was officially upgraded from silver after the U.S. team was disqualified due to a 2008 doping admission by team member Antonio Pettigrew. A belated medal ceremony was held during the London Diamond League meeting, where the athletes received a warm and rousing reception from the home crowd, finally providing official recognition for their performance.</p>

          <p>The initial wave of second-quarter corporate earnings reports underscores the importance of looking beyond immediate, knee-jerk market reactions. For example, Wells Fargo's stock initially fell on a lowered net interest income outlook but recovered as investors recognized the company's strategic focus on more predictable fee-based revenue. Similarly, BlackRock's stock dropped after its report but quickly rebounded to a new high as the market digested the positive long-term implications of a major acquisition. These cases suggest that initial stock movements may not accurately reflect a company's full quarterly performance or future prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and self-made millionaire Scott Galloway contends that the worst piece of career advice, often given by the ultra-wealthy, is to "follow your passion." He argues this is a luxury that only the already-rich can truly afford. Instead, Galloway advises people to find the practical intersection of what they are genuinely good at and what can be profitable in the marketplace. He emphasizes that success is more often the result of enduring rejection and being willing to pivot when necessary, rather than blindly pursuing a passion without regard for its financial viability.</p>
