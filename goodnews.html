          <h2>Chinese Researchers Experimentally Observe Quantum Friction Effect in Graphene</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to experimentally observe quantum friction between solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not uniformly increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds exhibited less resistance. This counterintuitive effect is linked to how bending the material alters electron movement, restricting energy conversion into heat. The breakthrough, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient nanodevices with minimal wear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Princeton, a city north of Dallas, Texas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the country by the Census Bureau, with its population surging from 17,000 to 37,000 in just three years. The boom is driven by affordable housing, with homes selling for significantly less than the county median, attracting many first-time buyers. This rapid expansion has created significant growing pains, forcing the city to pause construction to allow infrastructure like roads and sewer lines to catch up. Officials project the population could reach 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, age 45, was defeated by Magdalena Frech at the DC Open, ending her bid for a first back-to-back tour-level victory since 2019. Williams had made headlines earlier in the week by becoming the oldest woman to win a WTA match in two decades. Her return to the court follows a long absence due to surgery for uterine fibroids. Despite the loss, Williams was met with a standing ovation from the crowd, celebrating her enduring presence and competitive spirit in the sport.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced an amended stadium agreement with the Washington Commanders, moving the team closer to building a new venue at the RFK Stadium site. This development comes despite President Trump's recent threat to block any deal unless the team reverted to its former "Redskins" name, a comment the council chairman dismissed as a distraction. The deal, which now includes $950 million in revenue benefits for the district, still requires council approval and must navigate the complexities of transferring the federal land. The proposal is set for a crucial vote on August 1st.</p>

          <p>When automated postal machines cannot read a handwritten address, the mail is not returned to sender but instead sent electronically to a specialized facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. At the U.S. Postal Service's Remote Encoding Center, hundreds of "keyers" work around the clock to decipher poor penmanship, processing roughly one billion images of mail annually. These experts can decode about 900 addresses per hour, ensuring that even the most illegibly addressed letters reach their intended destinations. This unique operation serves as a critical final step in the mail delivery process.</p>

          <p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle Desmond Watson, known as the heaviest player in the NFL, has been placed on the non-football injury list at the start of training camp due to his weight. Coach Todd Bowles stated the move is about helping Watson become a "healthier player" and that he is currently considered day-to-day. Watson, an undrafted rookie from the University of Florida who weighed 464 pounds at his pro day, has been working with a team nutritionist. The team has not specified an ideal playing weight for the 6-foot-6-inch lineman.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a new program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to immigrant parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing federal immigration raids. Archbishop José Gomez stated that many hard-working people now fear being arrested and deported.

          <p>Pop star and actor Renée Rapp, known for her candid and unfiltered interview style, says she finds conventional media training "boring" and prefers authentic conversation. In a recent interview, she reflected on how her outspoken personality became a talking point during the "Mean Girls" press tour, which initially made her feel insecure. Now, she embraces it, even referencing it in her new single "Leave Me Alone." The song was born from the pressure and depression she felt last year, channeling her frustrations into her upcoming album, "Bite Me."</p>

          <p>The 2028 presidential race appears to have already begun, as several potential Democratic candidates are increasing their media visibility and shifting their messaging. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are appearing on a diverse range of podcasts and shows, including those with conservative hosts, in an apparent effort to reach new voters. This emerging strategy signals a course correction for the party, with some candidates adopting more centrist stances on cultural issues and a more direct communication style. The moves are seen as an attempt to fill a leadership vacuum.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues Big Tech is Underspending, Not Overspending, on Artificial Intelligence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies are not overspending on artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending in a "winner-take-all" race. He pointed to Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditure as evidence that these investments are both urgent and necessary for future dominance. While acknowledging skepticism about the current capabilities of AI chatbots, Cramer believes the technology will improve as companies invest in more advanced hardware from firms like Nvidia. He argues the ultimate winner of the AI race could achieve a near-monopoly and massive profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As regulators, particularly in the U.S., move to ban or phase out artificial food dyes like Red Dye No. 3, technology and food science firms are racing to develop stable, vibrant natural alternatives. Companies are exploring sources like microalgae and specially grown vegetables to create pigments for food and drinks. French firm Fermentalg has successfully developed a blue pigment from algae that has been approved by the FDA. While natural colors can be more expensive and challenging to stabilize, major food giants are pledging to reformulate their products to meet new health standards.</p>
