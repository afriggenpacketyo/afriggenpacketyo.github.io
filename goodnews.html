          <p>Sony Group shares saw a rise of over 3.5% amid volatile trading following the announcement of a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last three months beat analyst estimates, despite being down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, distributing over 80% of shares to Sony Group shareholders. However, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster, tempering some of the positive market reaction.</p>

          <p>Robert F.

They argue that welfare should be a short-term hand-up, not a lifetime handout, and that current programs are failing to deliver self-sufficiency. Citing the success of the 1996 welfare reform, they propose that able-bodied adults work, participate in job training, or volunteer at least 20 hours a week to receive benefits, with limited exceptions for childcare and health issues. The officials believe this approach will prioritize the vulnerable, empower individuals, and protect taxpayers.</p>
