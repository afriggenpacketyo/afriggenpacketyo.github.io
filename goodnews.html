          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.3% in September, bringing the annual inflation rate to 3.0%, a figure slightly below economists' expectations. This report, one of the few economic data releases permitted during the government shutdown, was driven largely by a jump in gasoline prices, while core inflation remained more subdued. The softer-than-expected inflation data has reinforced market expectations that the Federal Reserve will proceed with another interest rate cut. The data provides a crucial, albeit limited, snapshot of the economy amidst the ongoing data blackout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has affirmed his commitment to the club, stating he will not discuss his future until after the 2026 World Cup. Approaching his 300th appearance, Fernandes revealed he rejected a substantial offer from Saudi Arabia's Al-Hilal after discussions with club management and his family affirmed his desire to achieve more with United. He emphasized that his primary motivation is winning team trophies rather than individual accolades. Fernandes also dismissed the idea of competition with teammate Kobbie Mainoo, viewing their different skills as complementary.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru secured a significant victory in a by-election for the Caerphilly constituency, a seat historically held by the Labour Party since 1999. The result is a notable setback for both the governing Labour Party and the populist Reform UK party, which had invested heavily in its campaign. Plaid Cymru framed the win as a choice for a "positive, pro-Wales vision" over division and the status quo. The outcome is being interpreted as a bellwether for shifting political sentiments in Wales ahead of the 2026 Senedd elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase the average retiree's monthly benefit by approximately $56. This annual adjustment is designed to help Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits keep pace with inflation for roughly 75 million recipients. The increase is in line with expert projections but may be partially offset by expected increases in Medicare Part B premiums, which are often deducted from benefit checks. Beneficiaries will be notified of their new payment amounts starting in December. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral social media graphic claiming the UK has an exceptionally high rate of sexual assault compared to other European nations is highly misleading, according to a fact-check analysis. While the numbers used are technically accurate, experts warn that such cross-national comparisons are flawed due to vast differences in legal definitions, crime reporting practices, and cultural factors affecting victims' willingness to come forward. For instance, the UK's consent-based laws and methods for counting offenses can inflate its numbers relative to countries with narrower definitions. Criminologists suggest victim surveys provide a more accurate measure of prevalence than police-reported crime statistics.</p>

One of the forgeries was a copy of Rembrandt's famous "De Staalmeesters," the original of which hangs in Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum.

Trump stated on social media that Lurie had "asked, very nicely" for a chance to address the city's issues himself, and that calls from supportive tech leaders also influenced his decision. The move de-escalated a tense situation that had prompted protests and concern among local leaders about federal overreach and immigration crackdowns. While the immediate deployment is canceled, the president noted he would "stay tuned" on the city's progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an introduction to a new edition of Mary Shelley's classic novel, filmmaker Guillermo del Toro reflects on the profound impact "Frankenstein" had on him as a child. He argues that horror stories serve a spiritual purpose, allowing society to confront its deepest anxieties and internal conflicts in a safe, metaphorical space. Del Toro sees the novel as a powerful parable about abandonment, the arrogance of creation, and the tragedy of an existence without purpose, a story that requires no true villain. He connects its themes of lonely, wandering creations to his own recent films, "Pinocchio" and his upcoming "Frankenstein."</p>

          <p>A new study of ancient DNA extracted from the teeth of soldiers in Napoleon's Grande Armée has identified two additional diseases that likely contributed to its disastrous 1812 retreat from Russia. Scientists found genetic evidence of bacteria causing paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever in remains from a mass grave in Lithuania. These findings add to previously identified pathogens like typhus and trench fever, painting a grim picture of soldiers under a multi-front microbial assault. The research demonstrates how modern paleogenomic techniques can uncover new details about historical events and the devastating role of infectious disease in warfare.</p>
