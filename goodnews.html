        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter but significantly better than the 0.1% growth that had been forecasted. This positive performance was primarily driven by the services and construction sectors, with officials noting a strong recovery in June after a weaker April and May. Despite the better-than-expected figures, which led some banks to revise annual growth forecasts upward, economists remain cautious about future growth due to the weak global economy and potential impacts from tax policies.

          <p>Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer Foxconn reported a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, surpassing analyst expectations. This significant growth is attributed to the surging demand for its artificial intelligence server business, which has become a key partner for Nvidia. For the first time, sales from server products constituted the largest share of the company's revenue at 41%, overtaking its smart consumer electronics division. The company anticipates its AI server business will continue to drive growth, though it remains watchful of evolving global political and economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department's decision to designate the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization is seen as a significant boost to Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts. This move by the Trump administration is also expected to have positive side effects for regional stability, particularly for China. Analysts suggest that the designation could alleviate Beijing's concerns over terrorist attacks in the region, which have often targeted Chinese nationals and interests. This shared security concern might create an opportunity for increased counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and China, facilitated through their mutual partner, Pakistan.</p>

BTecs are offered at different levels, with Level 2 "Firsts" being equivalent to GCSEs and Level 3 "Nationals" being equivalent to A-levels, often serving as a pathway to university or direct employment. The article also discusses recent changes, where the government has reversed plans to scrap funding for many BTecs, acknowledging their importance in sectors like engineering and health.</p>

          <p>A podcast from NPR's "Throughline" series delves into the history of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarifies the procedures for presidential succession and disability. The episode focuses on the efforts of lawyer John Feerick, who, even before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, recognized a critical gap in the Constitution regarding what happens if a president is unable to serve. Feerick's campaign to address this constitutional vulnerability ultimately led to the creation and ratification of the amendment. The story highlights the foresight and determination required to enact this crucial piece of legislation.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court of South Korea has rejected a copyright infringement claim against The Pinkfong Company, creators of the viral children's song "Baby Shark." U.S. composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that Pinkfong's 2015 hit copied his 2011 version of the song. The court upheld lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection. It concluded that both versions are based on a traditional American summer camp chant that is in the public domain, therefore affirming Pinkfong's right to use the melody.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record $6.1 billion. This figure marks the highest price ever paid for an American professional sports team, surpassing the $6.05 billion for the NFL's Washington Commanders. The deal will see Chisholm's group acquire at least 51% of the team initially, with a path to full control that could raise the total value to $7.3 billion. The sale concludes the successful ownership era of Wyc Grousbeck, which began in 2002 and included two NBA championships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A startup named Voltify is working to decarbonize the U.S. freight rail industry by convincing major railroad companies to adopt its battery-electric technology. The company has developed "VoltCars," which are essentially large sodium-ion batteries on wheels designed to connect to existing diesel locomotives, providing a rechargeable power source. To overcome industry skepticism about charging time and reliability, Voltify is also building a network of solar-powered microgrids along rail routes. The company is in active talks with major railroad operators and aims to demonstrate the financial and environmental benefits of switching from diesel, which costs the industry over $11 billion annually.

          <p>A new survey indicates that "bleisure" travel, the blending of business and leisure trips, is a widespread practice, with 55% of business travelers admitting to having loved ones join them. The trend is even more common among C-suite executives, with 73% having brought partners, children, or friends along. Travelers cite companionship and the ability to reclaim family time as key motivations. Others point to significant cost savings, as company-covered expenses like hotels and flights can make a personal vacation more affordable. While many companies quietly accept the practice, employees often navigate a policy gray area regarding expenses and insurance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of American adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline coincides with a growing belief, particularly among young people, that even moderate drinking is unhealthy. Only 50% of adults aged 18-34 reported drinking, and this group is more likely to view moderate consumption as harmful. Experts suggest the trend is driven by increased health awareness, the social acceptability of not drinking, and financial pressures, which may lead younger generations to view alcohol as a luxury.</p>
