          <p>During a record-breaking heat wave in Southern California, temperatures soared into the high 90s, prompting multiple rescues due to heat-related issues. In Orange County, fifteen individuals were rescued, including a group of eleven hikers in Newport Coast, while Riverside County saw nine rescues across various locations. Los Angeles also reported a hiker airlifted from the Hollywood Hills due to heat exhaustion. Authorities are urging people to avoid strenuous outdoor activities until the weather cools down, with the National Weather Service forecasting a dip in temperatures and May gray skies early next week.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of crucial trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating tensions arising from President Trump's trade war. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng, seek to address tariffs that have disrupted global supply chains and threaten economic growth. Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs to 80% if China makes concessions, while China has remained firm on not making trade concessions in response to tariffs. Economists remain skeptical about a quick resolution, even if the United States reduces tariff rates, as the overall effective tariff rate would still be significantly higher than pre-Trump levels.</p>

Now friends, Gumpright and Hudson are advocating for legislation in Louisiana to grant retrials to inmates convicted by split juries.

          <p>President Trump's consideration to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has ignited widespread condemnation from Iranians across political and ideological divides.

Experts emphasize the significance of the Persian Gulf as a symbol of Iranian nationhood, highlighting the deep-rooted connection between Iranians and their geographic heritage. While Trump has the authority to alter geographical names within the United States, the international community and Iran are unlikely to adopt the change.</p>

Zongertinib targets the HER2 protein and blocks the activity of tyrosine kinase, which signals cell growth.

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler based in Bedfordshire, is spreading awareness about the health benefits of platonic touch. She hosts "cuddle puddles" and offers one-to-one cuddle therapy, believing that human touch boosts serotonin and oxytocin levels while lowering cortisol. Samii screens clients, obtains consent, and sets boundaries to ensure a safe and nurturing environment. While some may be skeptical, she emphasizes the importance of connection, particularly in a society increasingly disconnected due to online interactions. Studies suggest touch can benefit physical and mental health, although the relationship between the people involved is important.</p>

          <p>Despite challenges facing coffee chains in China, Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are regaining momentum by focusing on lower-tier cities. Starbucks experienced flat same-store sales but saw a 4% increase in transactions, while adding 665 stores in China. This growth indicates that the company is successfully defending its market share amid price competition. The article notes that much of the growth in coffee shops across China is concentrated in second and "new first-tier cities," where consumers are increasingly embracing coffee culture.</p>

          <h2>Unusual Atmospheric River Event Expected to Impact Southeast U.S.</h2>

          <p>An atmospheric river event is forecast to bring widespread rainfall to the Southeastern United States, potentially resulting in 4 to 6 inches of rain, with isolated areas experiencing up to 12 inches. The event, which is slightly unusual for the region, is due to a jet stream over the Gulf of Mexico reaching an area it doesn't typically hit. While the rainfall could alleviate recent drought conditions in some areas, there is also a risk of flooding and flash floods. Residents are advised to take precautions and avoid driving through flooded areas.</p>
