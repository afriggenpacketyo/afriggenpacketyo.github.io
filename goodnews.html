          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have resumed sensitive tariff talks in Switzerland, seeking to de-escalate trade tensions that threaten the global economy. The initial day of prolonged negotiations concluded with plans to continue on Sunday, but without immediate indications of progress. Discussions are expected to focus on de-escalation, with both sides acknowledging that the current high tariffs are unsustainable. President Trump hinted at potentially lowering tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its unilateral tariffs first.</p>

          <p>Jockey Junior Alvarado, who rode Sovereignty to victory at the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days for violating Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority rules.

The fine was doubled due to a prior violation, and the funds will go towards a jockey mental health program.

          <p>Negotiations for President Donald Trump's tax agenda are intensifying, with the House Ways and Means Committee releasing a preliminary text of its portion of the bill. Republican lawmakers aim to pass the package without Democratic support through reconciliation, but face challenges due to a narrow House majority and competing priorities. Key proposals include potential changes to individual tax provisions, and the outcome could significantly impact millions of Americans. The process could be difficult because a handful of votes can block the bill.</p>
