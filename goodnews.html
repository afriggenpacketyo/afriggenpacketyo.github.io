          <p>As summer approaches, the question of whether shorts are appropriate for office wear remains a debated topic. Many companies are moving away from strict dress codes, allowing employees to dress comfortably and professionally, but shorts are still considered a casual item. Stylists suggest that the appropriateness of shorts depends on the company culture and role, with tailored shorts being more acceptable than beach or sports shorts. Some companies embrace casual attire, while others maintain a more formal standard.</p>
