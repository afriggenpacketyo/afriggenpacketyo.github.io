          <p>A new company named Jams, backed by prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, has launched a line of frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to compete with the market-dominant Uncrustables. Differentiating itself with a health-conscious approach, Jams sandwiches contain no seed oils, artificial ingredients, or high-fructose corn syrup, and boast 10 grams of protein. The product will be sold exclusively at 3,000 Walmart stores at a slightly higher price point than its main competitor. The company aims to capture the athlete and health-focused consumer market.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China has stated it will maintain a "moderately loose" monetary policy, carefully calibrating its measures to help the nation achieve its 5% GDP growth target for the year. A deputy governor noted that the full impact of previous policies, such as cuts to reserve ratios and interest rates, is still unfolding due to inherent time lags. The central bank will continue to monitor economic conditions and market performance to effectively stimulate domestic demand and stabilize public expectations without being overly aggressive.

          <p>During the first visit by an Indian foreign minister in five years, China's Vice-Premier Han Zheng urged for mutual respect on sensitive issues to foster stable bilateral relations. The discussions aimed to maintain a positive trajectory in a relationship strained by border tensions. India's top diplomat, S. Jaishankar, expressed confidence in the talks and noted that the recent resumption of an Indian pilgrimage to Mount Kailash in Tibet was a widely appreciated gesture. Both sides are seeking to advance practical cooperation while managing their long-standing concerns.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has formally accepted an invitation from King Charles III for a second state visit to the United Kingdom, scheduled for September 17-19. The visit, which is unusual for a second-term president, will be hosted at Windsor Castle and will involve senior members of the Royal Family. This diplomatic engagement is seen as a tool of soft diplomacy by the British government, which hopes to influence the U.S. president on issues such as the war in Ukraine and trade tariffs. The event will include a full ceremonial welcome and a state banquet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, a former member of New York City's rent guidelines board argues that mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposal for a rent freeze is a realistic and necessary policy, not a 'pie-in-the-sky' idea. Drawing on her experience as a tenants' rights attorney and board member, the author asserts that rent freezes have been implemented before and serve as a crucial lifeline for New Yorkers struggling with affordability. The article frames the opposition to such measures as part of a broader agenda by the real estate industry to deregulate housing and weaken tenant protections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting it could be transformed into a mutual, employee-owned business. This proposal comes in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, where hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongfully convicted, highlighting a need for a profound cultural shift within the organization. The consultation will also seek public input on the services the Post Office should offer and whether the current requirement for 11,500 branches should be maintained. The move aims to restore trust and create a more stable future for the state-owned service.</p>

          <p>A Colombian military dog named Sanson is being celebrated as a hero for saving the lives of dozens of soldiers and civilians. While on a reconnaissance operation, Sanson detected a bomb planted on a community path by ELN guerrilla fighters; the device exploded, and the dog lost one of his legs in the blast. Despite his severe injuries, Sanson's detection prevented a much larger tragedy. The army reported that the dog is recovering after surgery and, while he can no longer serve, his legacy of bravery will be remembered.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the YIMBY ("yes in my backyard") movement, which advocates for increasing housing supply by reducing building restrictions, is fundamentally a progressive cause. The author refutes claims that YIMBYism is a pro-business, deregulatory scheme, instead framing it as a populist effort to break the "regulatory capture" by wealthy landowners who use zoning laws to create artificial scarcity and hoard wealth. The essay posits that building more homes is essential to address the cost-of-living crisis, climate change, and segregation, aligning it with core progressive values rather than conservative ones.</p>

          <p>Despite modern marvels like comfortable beds and climate control that should enable a golden age of sleep, many people still suffer from restless nights. This article examines the paradox, attributing poor sleep to a mix of behavioral, systemic, and environmental factors. Modern lifestyles, including 'revenge bedtime procrastination' and constant screen use, sabotage sleep, while systemic issues like housing insecurity, shift work, and racial discrimination create significant barriers. Experts suggest that while personal habits matter, addressing these larger societal and environmental obstacles is crucial for improving sleep health.</p>

This marks China's first joint drill with a European country since its exercises with Belarus last year. Serbia, a candidate for EU membership but not NATO, is considered one of China's closest European partners, with ties strengthening since the 1999 NATO bombing of former Yugoslavia.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 06:54:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer inflation rate cooled to 2.10% in June, extending a decline to its lowest point in over six years and coming in below economists' forecasts. The drop was driven by a continued fall in food prices, which registered at -1.06% for the month. This sustained easing of inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with more room to continue its accommodative monetary policy, potentially through further interest rate cuts. A strong harvest and good monsoon season are expected to keep food inflation low, which could boost consumer purchasing power. (not investment advice)</p>
