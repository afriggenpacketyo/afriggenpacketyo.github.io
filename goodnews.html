          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has addressed the omission of Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, and Jack Grealish from the squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia. Despite the players' return to fitness and form, Tuchel stated he chose to maintain consistency with the group that achieved a decisive 5-0 victory over Serbia, emphasizing the high level of teamwork and spirit. He clarified that there are no personal issues with any of the players, describing Bellingham as a "special player" but noting he has not yet regained his full rhythm at Real Madrid. The decision highlights Tuchel's focus on cultivating a club-like cohesion within the national team.</p>

          <p>China's extended "super golden week" holiday has commenced with a significant surge in domestic travel, signaling a positive start for the nation's tourism sector. On the first day, railway travel set new records, and tickets for many popular tourist attractions were sold out, reflecting strong consumer spending. The Ministry of Transport reported year-on-year increases across various travel modes, including a 20.5% rise in waterway passengers and a 3.2% increase in air travelers. This travel boom is a welcome development for Beijing, which has been implementing measures to stimulate domestic consumption and bolster economic activity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes are exempt from the Trump administration's recent rollback of the "de minimis" rule, which now applies tariffs to many imported packages valued under $800. This protection stems from the Cold War-era Berman Amendment, which prevents the regulation of "informational materials," including physical music. The exemption is a significant relief for the booming vinyl industry, which has seen a resurgence driven by artists like Taylor Swift and younger consumers. While fans and record labels benefit, some US-based vinyl manufacturers argue that tariffs would have supported domestic production and created more American jobs.</p>

          <p>OnePay, the fintech company majority-owned by Walmart, is set to integrate cryptocurrency services into its mobile banking app later this year. The platform will initially offer trading and custody for Bitcoin and Ether through a partnership with the startup Zerohash. This move signals OnePay's strategy to build an all-encompassing "super app" for digital finance, adding to its existing services like savings accounts, credit cards, and buy-now-pay-later loans. As crypto adoption becomes more mainstream, OnePay aims to leverage its connection to Walmart's vast customer base to compete with other major financial apps that already offer digital currency features.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Against Boycotting Israeli Cinema, Citing Its Role in Fostering Dissent</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary argues that the international call to boycott the Israeli film industry is a counterproductive strategy for achieving political change. The author highlights that Israeli cinema, though often state-funded, is a crucial medium for internal critique, frequently exploring contentious issues like the occupation and militarism. Using the award-winning film "The Sea" as an example, the article contends that boycotts harm artists who challenge the status quo from within. Instead of isolating these critical voices, the international film community should engage with and support them, as their stories have the potential to change Israeli public opinion more effectively than external pressure.</p>

          <p>Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso clocked the fastest time during the first practice session for the Singapore Grand Prix, outperforming Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Alonso finished 0.150 seconds ahead of Leclerc, with Lewis Hamilton of Ferrari placing fourth. While Aston Martin is not widely expected to be a top contender for pole position, the team is hopeful for a strong performance on the low-speed Marina Bay street circuit, which suits their car's high-downforce design. Alonso's leading time is likely attributable to a lower fuel load or a higher engine mode compared to his rivals during the session.</p>

          <p>Financial experts at a forum emphasized that Hong Kong's status as a premier asset and wealth management hub is intrinsically linked to its role as a gateway to mainland China. Panelists argued that as the majority of global wealth this century is expected to originate from China, Hong Kong will be a primary beneficiary due to its unique position within the Greater Bay Area. China's continued economic opening is anticipated to attract more high-net-worth individuals and innovative tech companies to the city. This influx of capital and talent is expected to enhance Hong Kong's function as a vital "superconnector" between Chinese and international markets.</p>

          <p>In a significant blow to the illegal wildlife trade, eleven cheetah cubs were rescued by the coast guard in Somaliland, a major transit point for trafficking to Gulf countries. The cubs, described as being in very poor and malnourished condition, were discovered packed in bags on a small boat. The Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) is now rehabilitating the surviving animals, though two have already died. Conservationists warn that this illicit pet trade is pushing the endangered species, with fewer than 7,000 remaining in the wild, toward extinction and underscores the urgent need to combat the demand for exotic pets.</p>

          <p>Electronic shelf labels are increasingly replacing paper price tags in major U.S. grocery chains like Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods, allowing for rapid, app-based price updates. This technology streamlines operations and can help reduce food waste by enabling quick markdowns on perishable items. However, some lawmakers have raised concerns that these digital tags could facilitate "dynamic pricing," where stores might surge prices during peak demand, weather events, or other factors to maximize profits. While grocery retailers deny any plans for surge pricing, the debate over the technology's potential impact on consumers and market fairness continues to grow.</p>

          <p>With electric air taxi services potentially launching as soon as next year, a major developer is actively seeking locations in Los Angeles for "vertiports," or landing and takeoff sites. VertiPorts by Atlantic is targeting areas with heavy traffic congestion where aerial transportation could offer a significant time-saving alternative to ground travel. Potential sites include open land, parking garage rooftops, and other urban locations in busy centers like Santa Monica and downtown L.A. This move anticipates the arrival of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, which are being developed to provide quieter, more accessible urban air mobility, including for events like the LA28 Olympics.</p>

          <p>Conservationists at the Fort Worth Zoo are undertaking an ambitious mission to save the endangered Houston toad from extinction through a sophisticated assisted reproduction program. Scientists are using techniques like hormone injections and genetic matchmaking to breed thousands of toads in captivity, which are then released into protected habitats. The species, once common in southeast Texas, has declined by over 90% due to habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species. The recovery effort also involves collaborating with private landowners to restore the toad's natural ecosystem, highlighting a hopeful but complex strategy to bring a species back from the brink.</p>

          <p>A viral food trend known as "Dubai chocolate" has become ubiquitous in stores and on social media, prompting questions about its sudden popularity. The confection, a chocolate bar filled with pistachio cream, tahini, and crispy knafeh pastry, was created in 2021 by a Dubai-based chocolatier but exploded in 2023 after being featured in a viral TikTok video. Its appeal stems from its visually striking, gooey interior, which is ideal for social media content, and its expensive ingredients that lend it an air of luxury. The trend is not a government-backed promotion but a classic example of a product achieving global fame through influencer marketing and online virality.</p>
