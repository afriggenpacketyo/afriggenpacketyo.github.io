          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 14:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicha is a multifaceted term in Peru, referring to a fermented drink, popular culture, and a unique musical genre. Originating in the late 1960s, Chicha music is a vibrant fusion of Colombian cumbia, Andean huayno, Cuban guaracha, and psychedelic rock, characterized by its prominent use of the electric guitar. The genre reached its peak in the 1980s with icons like Chacalón, whose songs resonated deeply with marginalized migrant communities in Lima. Decades later, the sounds of Chicha continue to be an integral part of the capital's cultural identity, representing a complex blend of indigenous roots and external influences.</p>

          <p>The price of silver has experienced a substantial surge in 2025, rising 76% from $28.92 to $50.94 per troy ounce by early October. This increase highlights its potential as a more affordable alternative to gold for investors seeking to hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios. The article suggests that factors such as geopolitical instability and domestic economic concerns could contribute to further price increases. As with any precious metal, experts advise limiting such holdings to a small portion of an overall investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has received over 20,000 applications in under two weeks for its newly rebranded "Homeland Defender" roles, formerly known as Immigration Services Officers. This large-scale recruitment campaign, which offers incentives like signing bonuses and remote work, aims to attract what the USCIS Director calls "America-first patriots" to process eligibility for green cards, visas, and citizenship. The surge in applicants comes as the Trump administration continues to ramp up its immigration enforcement and removal efforts. This hiring push reflects a broader trend across DHS agencies, which have seen a significant increase in recruitment.</p>

          <p>First lady Melania Trump announced that she has been working with Russian President Vladimir Putin for months to facilitate the return of Ukrainian children who were displaced by the war. She stated that eight children were reunited with their families in the last 24 hours and that Russia has agreed to coordinate the return of more in the near future. This effort addresses the issue of thousands of Ukrainian children who Ukraine says were forcibly abducted by Russia since the 2022 invasion. Mrs. Trump said an open channel of communication has been established with Putin's team to ensure the safe reunification of these children.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the recently approved Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement reveals that its text contains vague and ambiguous language, potentially by design. The document, brokered by the US, is titled as a plan for a "comprehensive end" to the war, which suggests finality, yet it lacks specific details on crucial next steps like Hamas's disarmament. This leaves room for different interpretations and does not explicitly rule out a return to hostilities if negotiations on future phases stall. While Hamas claims to have received assurances the war is over, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not made such a public declaration.</p>

The firm advises investors to look beyond just the fund's holdings and carefully consider several cost factors. Key among these are the expense ratio, which is the annual management fee, any commissions or transaction fees charged by the broker, and the bid-ask spread, which is the small cost incurred when buying or selling. Understanding these ongoing and transactional costs is crucial for maximizing long-term returns. (not investment advice)</p>

A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of pro-Palestinian students, including a Columbia student, was unconstitutional and designed to chill free speech. This victory highlights a stark contrast between the institute's confrontational legal strategy and Columbia University's own more conciliatory approach to the administration's pressures.

Proponents, including YIMBY groups, hail the bill as a transformative step toward creating more affordable housing and reducing car dependency.

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released its annual inflation adjustments for the 2026 tax year, raising the income thresholds for all federal tax brackets. This change means that taxpayers will be able to earn more money before being pushed into a higher tax bracket, a measure designed to prevent what is known as "bracket creep." In addition to the new brackets, the IRS also increased the standard deduction for all filing statuses. For example, the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly will rise to $32,200 for the 2026 tax year. (not investment advice)</p>
