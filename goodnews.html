          <p>A couple working in the hospitality industry, Marc LeBlanc and Laura Robinson, shared their experiences of living and working in destinations like the Maldives, Bali, and Cambodia. They highlighted the differences between visiting and living in these places, noting that working on a resort island can feel isolating due to being "locked on that island." Managing a multicultural workforce and dealing with environmental challenges, such as saltwater corrosion or forest reclamation, are also part of the job. The couple also navigate the challenges of living far from their families and maintaining a work-life balance as a couple in remote locations.</p>

Japan's ruling coalition has accepted an opposition demand over pension reform to facilitate smooth Diet deliberations ahead of a key national election this summer.
