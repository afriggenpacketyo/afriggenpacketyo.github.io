          <h2>Reform UK Sees Gains in English Local Elections</h2>

          <p>Reform UK has significantly increased its presence in English local elections, establishing itself as a strong challenger to the main political parties in Britain. The party secured hundreds of seats across various councils, gaining control of several authorities previously held by the Conservatives, and also won a key Westminster by-election. Nigel Farage celebrated these results as proof that Reform has surpassed the Conservatives as the primary opposition to Labour. These elections marked the first major electoral test since Labour's landslide general election victory, and the Tories faced substantial losses while the Liberal Democrats and Greens also made gains, indicating a fragmentation of the British political landscape.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding elections amidst a global crisis, similar to the last election cycle, with the People's Action Party (P.A.P.) widely expected to retain power. While the P.A.P. has governed since 1959, there's growing discontent over the rising cost of living and declining housing affordability, fueling support for the opposition. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is facing a test of popularity, as the opposition gains traction and criticizes the P.A.P. for its policies and short campaigning period.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to cease withholding funds from Maine schools, marking a victory for the state after being targeted over its support of transgender rights. The USDA had suspended funds for a child nutrition program after Maine refused to comply with demands to bar trans girls from participating in girls' sports. Governor Janet Mills challenged the administration, leading to a settlement where the USDA will restore funds and refrain from interfering without following legal procedures. This resolves a dispute over alleged violations of Title IX.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked its enforcement. Judge Beryl Howell found that the order, which aimed to punish the firm for its representation of clients and progressive employment policies, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The ruling supports Perkins Coie's assertion that Mr. Trump was using presidential power to retaliate against lawyers for their legal work. The judge noted the order was issued as "retribution" for Perkins Coie's work and Mr. Trump's "grievances."</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. Current therapies require specific matching to the snake species, but Friede's efforts could lead to a universal antivenom. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies from his blood that target neurotoxins and, when combined with a drug, protected mice from lethal doses of various venomous snakes.</p>

Trump had previously proposed a military parade but scrapped the idea due to cost concerns.

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased shipping products directly from China to customers in the United States, opting instead to ship all U.S. orders from local warehouses.

The company has also started recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform. The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.</p>
