        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant number of young people in Germany show interest in starting their own companies, but few follow through due to financial insecurity, lack of networks, and limited business knowledge. The article highlights the success of Knowunity, a peer-to-peer learning app founded by teenagers, as an example of untapped potential. Researchers suggest that providing basic startup security, such as a guaranteed income for the first year, could significantly encourage more young entrepreneurs. The discussion emphasizes the need for better support systems, including mentorship and integrating entrepreneurship into school curricula, to help translate youthful ambition into successful business ventures.</p>

          <p>In a major blow to one of Mexico's most notorious drug trafficking organizations, U.S. drug enforcement agents have seized more than $10 million in cryptocurrency linked to the Sinaloa cartel. The seizure was part of a broader nationwide operation that also confiscated vast quantities of fentanyl and methamphetamine. This action highlights the increasing use of digital currencies by criminal enterprises for money laundering and other illicit activities. The operation underscores the DEA's strategy of targeting the financial networks of cartels to disrupt their operations, coming shortly after a key member of the Guzman family pleaded guilty to drug charges.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 05:36:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs is poised to announce its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts anticipating strong results driven by recent market trends. The investment bank is expected to benefit from increased trading activity in bonds, currencies, and stocks, spurred by market volatility related to U.S. tariff policies. Furthermore, a rebound in investment banking activities, such as mergers and debt issuance, is projected to boost the firm's revenue. The recovery in stock prices also bodes well for its asset and wealth management division, positioning the bank for a potentially favorable quarter following strong reports from rivals like JPMorgan Chase.

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has secured the Democratic nomination in the primary election for an Arizona congressional seat, aiming to succeed her late father, Representative Raúl Grijalva. The elder Grijalva had held the seat for two decades before his death in March, creating a significant political legacy in the district. Adelita Grijalva's victory in the primary positions her as the frontrunner to continue her family's representation in the U.S. Congress. Her campaign leveraged deep community ties and the political goodwill established by her father over his long and influential career serving the constituents of the southern Arizona district.</p>

          <p>With the San Francisco 49ers' recent purchase of Rangers, half of the 12 clubs in the Scottish Premiership are now under American ownership, reflecting a growing trend of U.S. investment in Scottish soccer. The lower cost of entry compared to the English Premier League, combined with access to European competitions, makes Scotland an attractive market. This influx of capital is reshaping the league, with many new owners implementing multi-club ownership models, linking Scottish teams with others in their networks. While the investment brings hope for revitalizing a league long dominated by Celtic and Rangers, it also raises concerns among fans.</p>

          <p>At the midpoint of the Major League Baseball season, several key narratives are taking shape, from bullpen management struggles to the surprising dominance of the Detroit Tigers. The article notes that while controversial "torpedo bats" have not upended the game as some feared, issues like overworked bullpens are a league-wide concern due to starters pitching fewer innings. The Detroit Tigers stand out with the best record in baseball, leading their division by a significant margin. Meanwhile, the struggles of teams like the Colorado Rockies and the Pittsburgh Pirates highlight ongoing issues of competitive imbalance, raising questions about a salary cap.</p>

          <p>A growing number of U.S. states, including Colorado, California, and Montana, are passing legislation to protect the privacy of neural data collected by consumer technology. These laws target non-medical devices like headphones and wearables that measure brain activity to improve sleep or focus, as concerns mount over how this sensitive information is used and shared. Advocacy groups have found that many companies provide few limitations on their access to and ability to share this data with third parties. Lawmakers and experts are acting preemptively to establish consumer rights, such as consent and data deletion, before advancements in AI allow for deeper insights.</p>

          <p>For the first time in four years, Huawei Technologies has become the top smartphone vendor in mainland China, capturing an 18.1% market share in the second quarter. This comeback underscores the company's strong brand resilience and effective shipment management, despite a 3.4% year-on-year drop in its own shipments. The achievement comes even as China's overall smartphone market contracted by 4% due to weak consumer spending and reduced government subsidies. Other major brands like Vivo and Oppo followed Huawei, while Apple saw a minimal decline by adjusting prices to leverage government subsidies for certain iPhone models. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Southernism "y'all" has become an increasingly popular second-person plural pronoun across the United States, particularly among younger generations. Linguists attribute its rise to its utility in filling a gap in standard English, its inclusive and welcoming nature, and its spread through migration and cultural influence, including hip-hop and country music. The word's origins are believed to be a blend of Scots-Irish and West African influences. Its adoption by diverse groups, including queer communities, as a gender-neutral and casual yet respectful term has helped propel it from a regional dialect word into the American mainstream.</p>

          <p>The recorder, a simple plastic wind instrument, has served as the first musical experience for millions of schoolchildren for generations, though its use is declining. Educators praise it as an ideal teaching tool because it is inexpensive, easy to produce a sound on, and perfectly sized for small hands, making it effective for teaching music fundamentals. Originating as a serious instrument during the Renaissance, famously played by King Henry VIII, it was later revived and mass-produced as an educational tool in the 20th century. Despite its reputation as a children's toy, experts note it is a complex instrument to master.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is intensifying in Germany over the country's summer holiday schedule, with several states arguing that the current system unfairly benefits Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. Most German states rotate their summer break slots annually to manage travel and tourism demand, but the two southern states always have their holidays last, a tradition linked to Pentecost. Critics claim this forces families in other states to travel during peak, high-cost periods. Leaders in the south are resisting calls for change, asserting that their established holiday rhythm is part of their regional identity, setting up a political clash over this arrangement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods group Richemont, owner of Cartier, reported a 6% rise in quarterly sales, slightly beating analyst expectations and showing resilience in a slowing luxury market. The growth was driven by strong performance in its jewelry division, even as sales from its specialist watchmakers declined. A key factor was a 15% sales drop in Japan, where a strengthening yen has curbed the tourist spending boom seen last year when the currency was weaker. This slowdown in Japan highlights the significant impact of currency fluctuations on the global luxury sector, which had previously benefited from an influx of shoppers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review of the National Health Service in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The report, commissioned after debate over the roles' responsibilities, also suggests they wear standardized uniforms and should not be responsible for diagnosing patients. The review acknowledged concerns from families whose relatives died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. While a union expressed concern that the change could lengthen waiting lists, the review aims to provide clarity on the scope of these healthcare roles.</p>
