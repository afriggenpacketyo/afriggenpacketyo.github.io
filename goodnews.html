          <p>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has once again been named the world's busiest airport, processing over 108 million passengers in 2024, according to a new report from Airports Council International. While Atlanta's traffic is still slightly below its 2019 levels, global passenger traffic reached a record high of 9.4 billion, surpassing pre-pandemic figures. The report also highlights Dubai International Airport as the second busiest and the top for international passengers. The rankings show a strong recovery in air travel, with several U.S. and Asian airports climbing significantly in the global standings.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a prominent hub for global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. The author contends that the dismantling of agencies like USAID under an "America first" mentality creates a vacuum that China is eager to fill. With Beijing taking a more proactive role in international cooperation, Hong Kong's status as a cosmopolitan city can be leveraged to lead initiatives and mediate disputes. This shift represents a new path to prominence for the city, aligning with the expectations of the Global South.</p>

          <p>An Iranian mother, Mandonna Kashanian, who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, has been released from ICE detention after being arrested in her New Orleans home. Her release followed a significant community outcry and a crucial intervention from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who urged the Department of Homeland Security to reconsider the case. Kashanian, whose husband and daughter are U.S. citizens, had been complying with regular ICE check-ins for decades. Her attorney noted that while her release is a positive outcome, many others in similar situations lack access to political power.</p>

          <p>As hurricane seasons intensify, a growing number of homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are investing in climate-resilient construction. This article highlights homes designed to withstand extreme weather, such as a round house in Florida with an aerodynamic shape that reduces wind pressure and a foundation built to handle flooding. Companies specializing in these designs report high success rates in past storms, and testing facilities are working to improve resilience for both new and existing homes. While these builds can be more expensive upfront, homeowners find they pay off through durability and lower insurance costs.</p>

          <h2>International Criminal Court Issues Arrest Warrants for Taliban Leaders Over Gender Persecution</h2>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The charges are for the crime against humanity of persecution on gender grounds, specifically targeting girls and women in Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power in 2021. The court stated that the Taliban has severely deprived females of fundamental rights to education, movement, and expression. The Taliban dismissed the warrants as "nonsense," while the ICC, which has no enforcement power, must rely on member states to execute any arrests.</p>

          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, a prominent figure from the "Tiger King" documentary, has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison for wildlife trafficking and money laundering. Antle pleaded guilty to illegally buying and selling endangered animals, including cheetahs, lions, and a chimpanzee, for his Myrtle Beach Safari zoo. Prosecutors stated he was a key player in the illegal chimpanzee trade and laundered over half a million dollars to facilitate these black market purchases. The judge's sentence was lighter than the federal guidelines, acknowledging Antle's work in animal care despite his illegal activities.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza and a potential ceasefire deal. The meeting followed suggestions from a U.S. envoy that Israel and Hamas were close to agreeing on a 60-day truce, with only one major issue remaining. The proposed deal would reportedly include the release of ten living hostages and the remains of nine deceased ones. While President Trump stated that talks were going well, Qatar, a key mediator, indicated that more time would be needed for negotiations.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind energy capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A new report from Global Energy Monitor indicates the country is on track to add at least 9 GW this year, representing more than half of projected global additions. This surge is driven by strong government support and is a key component of President Xi Jinping's strategy to advance the "high-quality development" of China's marine economy. The nation is also developing a robust offshore wind technology industry to support projects farther out in deep-sea areas.</p>

          <p>An Instagram post by television personality Gemma Collins promoting a weight-loss service has been banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ad for Yazen, a digital health brand, was found to have illegally promoted prescription-only weight-loss drugs to the public. While the post did not name a specific medication, the ASA ruled it breached its code by leading consumers to request a prescription. This action was part of a broader crackdown by the ASA, which banned nine similar adverts from various companies for illegally marketing these types of medications.</p>
