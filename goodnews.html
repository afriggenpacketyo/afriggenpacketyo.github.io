          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco soon after. The service will begin with approximately 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with the latest version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, known as FSD Unsupervised. Tesla employees will remotely monitor the fleet, with the company carefully watching the cars' performance. Alphabet's Waymo already operates a commercial, driverless ride-hailing service, conducting 250,000 paid trips weekly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 14:08:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Given the recent surge in gold prices and continued economic uncertainty, it's crucial to approach gold investments strategically. Investors should limit gold to a maximum of 10% of their overall portfolio, steering clear of riskier investment types like gold mining stocks. Instead, consider gold bars, coins, or gold individual retirement accounts. Monitoring the economic climate and portfolio performance is essential to identify potential selling opportunities. Gold serves as an income protector rather than an income producer, making it a valuable tool for diversification and hedging against inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
