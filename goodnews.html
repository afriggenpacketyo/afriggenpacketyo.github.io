          <p>In an interview, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty expressed confidence in the implementation of the first phase of the Trump-brokered peace plan for Gaza, which focuses on hostage releases and humanitarian aid. He confirmed that Egypt, in coordination with Jordan, is training Palestinian forces to handle security in Gaza and supports the deployment of an international peacekeeping force under a UN Security Council mandate. Abdelatty emphasized that the ultimate goal must be the realization of a Palestinian state to ensure regional stability and mentioned an upcoming international conference, co-hosted with the U.S., to fund Gaza's reconstruction.</p>

          <p>The 60th World Conker Championships, held in Northamptonshire, have crowned new champions after a day of intense competition. First-time competitor Matt Cross won the men's title and was then named the overall World Conker Champion after defeating women's winner Mags Blake in the final match. The event attracted heightened interest this year following a cheating scandal in the previous competition. Organizers overcame fears that a hot, dry summer would ruin the conker supply, ultimately sourcing suitable nuts from across the country and even the royal estate at Windsor Castle to ensure the historic tournament could proceed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the winless New York Jets 13-11 in a game characterized by dominant defense and offensive struggles. The Jets' offense was particularly ineffective, managing only 82 total net yards and a startling minus-10 passing yards for the entire game. Despite their offensive woes, the Jets briefly took an 11-10 lead in the third quarter after a safety. However, a late 27-yard field goal by Denver's Wil Lutz proved to be the decisive score, as a final Jets drive was thwarted by the Broncos' ninth sack of quarterback Justin Fields.</p>

          <p>Australian captain Alyssa Healy scored a magnificent 142 runs to lead her team to a historic three-wicket victory over India in the Women's Cricket World Cup. Australia successfully chased down a target of 331, the highest successful run chase in women's one-day international history. India had set a formidable total, powered by an opening stand of 155, but Healy's masterful innings of 107 balls anchored the Australian response. Despite a late-innings wobble, Ellyse Perry, who had earlier retired with cramp, returned to hit the winning runs with six balls to spare, securing a remarkable win for the defending champions.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Europe's top strikers highlights the extraordinary early-season form of Erling Haaland, Harry Kane, and Kylian Mbappé, who are all scoring at a rate of well over a goal per game. Haaland leads with 21 goals in 12 matches for Manchester City and Norway, followed by Kane with 19 in 12 for Bayern Munich and England, and Mbappé with 17 in 13 for Real Madrid and France. The article breaks down their statistics, comparing not only their goal-scoring efficiency but also their overall involvement in play, such as touches, passes, and chances created. Their prolific performances have set them apart from other elite forwards this season.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to mark the signing of the Gaza peace plan. Downing Street stated that Starmer will pay tribute to U.S. President Donald Trump's role in brokering the deal and will call for swift progress toward the next phase of the truce. The UK government's claim of having played a "key role" in shaping the plan has been met with skepticism from Israeli officials, who suggested British actions had previously emboldened Hamas. The summit aims to formalize the ceasefire and coordinate efforts for humanitarian aid and lasting peace.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has stated Germany's readiness to provide immediate humanitarian aid to Gaza and to co-host a reconstruction conference with Egypt. He emphasized that any such conference must be politically broad, involve Israel, and operate under a United Nations mandate to outline a political framework leading to a two-state solution. This initiative has received support from Germany's ruling coalition parties, who cite humanitarian, security, and migration policy reasons for their involvement. However, the proposal faces diplomatic hurdles, as an initial meeting in Paris was criticized by Israeli officials as "unnecessary and harmful."</p>

Vance described the impending release as a "great moment" for the country and the world, attributing it to the administration's diplomatic efforts.
