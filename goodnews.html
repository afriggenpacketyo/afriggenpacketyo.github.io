The event also featured a surprise return by R-Truth, which was well-received by fans, and WWE's director of content, Triple H, was amazed by the luchador Mr. Iguana.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, aiming to create 10,000 jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to kickstart economic growth and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband spoke of a new "golden age of clean energy abundance". However, the project faces opposition from groups like Stop Sizewell C, who believe the money could be better spent elsewhere and fear it will increase consumer bills. The final investment decision on the funding model is expected later this summer.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric car brands are expanding into global markets, offering cheaper alternatives but raising concerns about security risks and competition for established manufacturers. BYD, now the world's largest EV maker, is launching affordable models like the Dolphin Surf in Europe. While consumers benefit from lower prices, experts worry about potential spyware and hacking risks associated with internet-enabled vehicles. The US and EU have imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, but the UK has not, leading to debate over fair competition and the future of the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump and several CEOs are promoting savings plans for newborns, with Dell Technologies pledging $1,000 for "Trump accounts" for new children of its employees. The program, part of a Republican-backed budget bill, would seed index fund accounts with government funds for U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028. Other CEOs, including those from Uber and Goldman Sachs, expressed support for the initiative, which aims to provide a strong start in life for American children. The bill is pending in the Senate, where it faces pushback from some Republicans.</p>
