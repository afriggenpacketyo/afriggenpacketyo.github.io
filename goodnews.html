        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is set to accelerate the expansion of its national carbon market, aiming to incorporate major polluting industries like steel, aluminum, and cement by 2027, three years ahead of its original schedule. This ambitious plan also includes a shift to absolute limits on emissions, a more stringent standard than the current intensity-based caps. The move underscores the government's determination to meet climate targets and is expected to invigorate the often-sluggish carbon market. Experts believe this expansion will significantly spur demand for carbon allowances, potentially leading to a more aggressive emissions reduction pathway for the world's largest carbon polluter.</p>

          <p>US Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley faces a significant personal and professional dilemma regarding whether to play in the upcoming tournament, a dual role not undertaken by a captain since 1963. With six automatic qualifiers already set, Bradley is tasked with selecting his half-dozen wildcards, a decision he has described as "defining" and "the biggest of my life." The article explores the complex considerations, balancing his strong playing form and high world ranking against the extensive time and energy demands of captaincy. Should he play, there's a risk of criticism if the US loses; if he doesn't, questions will arise about not contributing on the course. The European team, meanwhile, appears to be in a more settled state.</p>

          <p>Hugo Ortega, an American engineer, found a new and lucrative career path after quitting his unfulfilling job to backpack around the world. A chance encounter led him into the yachting industry, where he progressed from a deckhand to a superyacht captain, now earning up to $20,000 monthly, often doubled with tips. Ortega emphasizes that while prior boating experience isn't necessary, a strong willingness to learn, humility, and a customer service-oriented personality are crucial for success in this demanding field. He also acknowledges the personal sacrifices, such as being away from family for extended periods, but ultimately advocates for pursuing a life that brings fulfillment and allows for extensive travel.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has rescheduled the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket for Tuesday night, following two previous scrubs due to an oxygen leak and adverse weather conditions. This milestone mission aims to test significant fixes and upgrades after three catastrophic failures earlier this year. Key objectives include evaluating the Super Heavy first stage's performance under stress and Starship's suborbital trajectory, Starlink deployment, and engine restart. While NASA's acting administrator remains optimistic about the system's readiness for a 2027 moon landing, some experts express skepticism, citing the complexity of orbital refueling and the ambitious timeline.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a significant policy shift, stating the US would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country, effectively doubling the current number. This announcement follows recent advisories from the Chinese embassy warning students about "unjustified questioning and harassment" at US customs, particularly in Houston. Trump also expressed a desire for improved relations with China, noting that President Xi Jinping had invited him to visit. The move signals a potential de-escalation in tensions regarding academic exchange, contrasting with previous concerns about Chinese students' access to American education.</p>

Beyond weight loss, they show potential for treating various conditions like psoriasis and Alzheimer's, sparking new drug innovation. Economic impacts include increased productivity, healthcare savings, and shifts in consumer spending, particularly in food and beverage industries, though concerns exist about accessibility creating a "two-tier society."

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, the long-sought Mexican cartel kingpin, pleaded guilty in a US federal court to drug trafficking charges, expressing remorse for the extensive harm caused by his actions. Under his and Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán's leadership, the Sinaloa cartel evolved into the world's largest drug trafficking organization, responsible for transporting at least 1.5 million kilograms of cocaine, primarily to the United States. Zambada admitted to generating hundreds of millions annually and bribing Mexican police and military commanders to operate freely. His plea, which avoids the death penalty, marks a significant victory for US law enforcement in its sustained anti-cartel efforts, ensuring he will spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>

The 2021 map, which divided the Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County among four districts, resulted in all four seats electing Republicans by wide margins. Judge Dianna Gibson declared the map illegal because the legislature bypassed a commission established by voters to ensure non-partisan redistricting. While Republican lawmakers have vowed to appeal, the ruling creates uncertainty for the GOP's slim majority in the US House and highlights ongoing national battles over fair electoral boundaries.</p>
