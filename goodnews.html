          <p>Two days of trade talks between the U.S. and China have resulted in a framework agreement, intended to solidify the terms of a truce reached in Geneva last month.

The agreement is designed to promote collaboration between the two nations. The deal aims to solidify terms of a truce that the superpowers reached in Geneva last month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. edged up slightly in May, driven by higher grocery prices that offset lower gasoline prices, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists anticipate that President Trump's tariff policies will exert upward pressure on consumer prices in the coming months, with some evidence of their impact already emerging. While the monthly inflation rate showed a modest increase, economists suggest that the underlying trend points towards inflation returning to the Federal Reserve's target. However, the full effect of tariffs is expected to become more apparent in the summer and fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold has become the world's second-largest reserve asset, driven by central banks' increasing appetite for the precious metal, according to a European Central Bank report. Central banks' gold stockpiles are nearing levels last seen in the 1960s, making gold second only to the U.S. dollar in reserve holdings. Emerging and developing countries find gold attractive due to concerns about sanctions and potential erosion of major currencies. However, there are signs that central bank purchases may slow in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement, similar to the Eurostar system at St Pancras, will involve passport checks by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the deal protects British sovereignty, supports Gibraltar's economy, and allows businesses to plan long-term. All parties are committed to finalizing a UK-EU treaty text on Gibraltar as quickly as possible.</p>
