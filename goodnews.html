          <p>CrowdStrike's shares experienced a dip in extended trading after the cybersecurity firm released a revenue outlook that fell short of expectations. While the company's first-quarter earnings per share exceeded estimates, revenue matched expectations with a nearly 20% increase compared to the previous year. Despite increased costs in sales, marketing, research, and development due to a software outage last summer, CrowdStrike anticipates adjusted earnings per share between 82 and 84 cents for the current quarter, while analysts were expecting 81 cents. CrowdStrike has also earmarked $1 billion for share buybacks and aims for a free cash flow margin above 30% for the 2027 fiscal year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has been exempted from President Trump's executive order that doubled steel and aluminium tariffs from 25% to 50%. While the order raises import taxes for US firms buying from other countries, the levy remains at 25% for the UK. A UK-US tariff pact signed in May, which will eliminate all import taxes on steel and aluminium, has not yet come into effect, meaning UK steel exporters will still face tariffs until then. The UK government has reaffirmed its commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care for transgender inmates, despite President Trump's executive order to halt funding for such care. The ruling allows a group of transgender inmates to pursue a lawsuit challenging the order, requiring the bureau to provide hormone therapy and accommodations. The judge stated that the inmates were likely to succeed in their lawsuit because the bureau did not perform any analysis before cutting off treatment deemed medically appropriate. The decision underscores the ongoing legal battles over transgender rights and access to healthcare.</p>

          <p>Major tech companies, including Google, OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, are vying to create "everything apps" powered by artificial intelligence. These apps aim to consolidate various online functions, such as search, social media, shopping, and work software, into a single, personalized interface. This push is driven by the industry's pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the desire to entrench their products in people's daily lives. However, concerns remain about the reliability of AI models, the potential for misuse, and the concentration of data and power in the hands of a few tech giants. The race to create everything apps reflects the tech industry's ongoing quest for dominance and control over the digital landscape.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has announced the removal of the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, a key catalyst for the stock. The asset cap was a punishment for past misdeeds, including the cross-selling scandal, and prevented the bank from growing key lines of its business for years. The Fed stated that the removal reflects the substantial progress the bank has made in addressing its deficiencies and fulfilling the required conditions. The removal of the cap will allow Wells Fargo to increase deposits, expand loan activity, and grow its dealmaking division, presenting new growth opportunities for the company.
