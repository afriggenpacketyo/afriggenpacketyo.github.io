          <p>President Trump announced a proposal to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the United States, citing a national security threat. He authorized the United States Trade Representative to begin the process of taxing foreign-produced films, claiming it's a concerted effort by other nations. The Motion Picture Association declined to comment, while industry experts questioned the scope and impact of the proposed tariff. The move could affect Hollywood's reliance on foreign locales for filming due to tax incentives and lower labor costs, potentially impacting thousands of middle-class film workers in the United States.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the earliest roses were likely yellow, contrary to the popular association of roses with the color red. The study, which examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealed that the common ancestor of the Rosa genus probably had single-petal flowers with a yellow hue and seven leaflets. Roses are one of the most cultivated ornamental flowers in the world and have become a symbol of love and beauty across the world.</p>

The authors suggest that the U.S. needs to learn from China's open-source approach to AI and accelerate its own innovation and diffusion of technology throughout the economy. They warn that China's growing dominance in these areas could lead to a future where Chinese technology stacks become the global standard.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth place among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming the third position, according to preliminary data. The United States remained the top ODA donor, followed by Germany. The decline in Japan's donations was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years when development projects resumed after COVID-19 pandemic suspensions. Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in promoting a "free and open" Indo-Pacific region, despite facing fiscal constraints.</p>

Aside from improving the quality of care for people in need, the report found that investment in the system could also help drive economic growth.
