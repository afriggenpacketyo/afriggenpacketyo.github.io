          <p>George, a cat recovering from neutering surgery at an animal hospital in Lakeland, Florida, made a daring escape, breaking out of his crate and scaling a fence. Despite being chased by hospital staff, George made his way home, traveling three miles through subdivisions and around lakes. Experts suggest cats have evolved to find their way back using a combination of scent, visual markers, and geomagnetism. His owner, Bob Beasock, joked about the cat needing a human touch after his journey, and was overjoyed to have him back home.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler surged to the lead at the US PGA Championship after a stunning finish to his third round, including an eagle and two birdies in the final five holes.

With only four players this century having won the US PGA Championship after trailing by three or more strokes at this stage, Scheffler's lead makes him a formidable contender for the title.</p>

          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove stated that another Scottish independence referendum could occur if there is "overwhelming support" for one, aligning with SNP leader John Swinney's stance. Gove emphasized the need for politicians to demonstrate the UK's effectiveness and warned against complacency. While Gove doesn't believe a referendum is necessary at the moment, he acknowledged that a significant shift in public opinion could prompt a review of the decision. This comes after Swinney emphasized securing "demonstrable support" for independence, similar to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, turning day to night and creating dangerous conditions. The National Weather Service issued dust storm warnings for Chicago for the first time, as visibility dropped to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. The storm, driven by strong winds from thunderstorms, lifted dust from parched farmland, creating a haboob-like phenomenon. This event is unusual for the region, with the last significant dust storm in Chicago occurring during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s.</p>

          <p>The article provides a glimpse inside Air Force One and discusses the potential for a new presidential plane. The current Air Force One aircraft, which has been in use since 1990, is showing its age and is costly to maintain. There is the potential for the aircraft to be updated, but there are delays and cost overruns for the construction program. Qatar has offered a lavish 747, but converting a foreign 747 for use by an American president creates technical challenges.</p>

          <p>Austria's JJ has won the Eurovision Song Contest 2025 with 'Wasted Love'. Classically trained countertenor JJ of Austria has won the 69th Eurovision Song Contest with his pop-opera song "Wasted Love." The Swiss city of Basel was hosting the final of the contest. Yuval Raphael of Israel came in second with "New Day Will Rise," and Tommy Cash of Estonia came in third with "Espresso Macchiato." Politics was never far from the surface. Despite attempts to focus on the glitz and glamor, politics are never far from the surface. Israel's participation in particular has been controversial, with pro-Palestinian protests being held in Basel against Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen has spoken out against Trump. Springsteen didn‚Äôt oblige. In a resolute three-minute speech from the Co-op Live venue, Springsteen thanked his cheering audience for indulging him in a speech about the state of America: ‚ÄúThings are happening right now that are altering the very nature of our country‚Äôs democracy, and they‚Äôre too important to ignore.‚Äù In my home, they‚Äôre persecuting people for their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. In my country, they‚Äôre taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers.</p>
