          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of science research grants to UCLA that were abruptly suspended last month. The ruling stated the administration's action violated a previous injunction against terminating such funds, dismissing the government's argument that the freezes were merely "suspensions." This decision affects over a third of the $584 million in federal funding that was frozen due to allegations of antisemitism and discrimination at the university. The legal challenge originated from a class-action lawsuit filed by UC professors, not the university system itself.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) has successfully launched its new Vulcan rocket on its first operational mission for the U.S. Space Force, carrying two military satellites into geosynchronous orbit. This flight marks a major milestone, as the Vulcan is now certified to carry expensive and critical national security payloads. The powerful new rocket is designed to replace ULA's legacy Atlas V and Delta rockets, ending the reliance on Russian-made engines for U.S. military launches. The successful mission positions ULA to better compete in the national security launch market.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has introduced a new plan to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost weak household spending and support domestic demand. The year-long program will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on loans for various purchases, including cars and education. This policy is part of a wider government strategy to unlock the spending potential of its citizens and shore up the economy. The central government will fund 90% of the subsidy, with provincial governments covering the remainder. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has submitted a surprise $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google's Chrome web browser, a figure significantly higher than the startup's own $18 billion valuation. The move comes as the U.S. Department of Justice has previously proposed that Google divest Chrome as a remedy in its major antitrust case, where the company was found to have an illegal monopoly. While some industry observers view the offer as a publicity stunt, it highlights the intense competition in the AI sector and Perplexity's aggressive growth strategy.</p>

The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency hopes this change will better equip the millions of new drivers each year with life-saving skills. Since drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of an emergency, officials believe this knowledge could help prevent avoidable deaths.

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has declared the water safe to drink for residents in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, lifting a boil water notice that was in effect for a week. The advisory was issued after a faulty, deeply buried valve from 1967 impeded water flow, causing an outage for about 9,200 households. With service restored, the DWP is now advising residents to thoroughly flush their home plumbing systems and appliances. Affected customers will receive a $20 credit on their bills for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has officially acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the African nation's struggle for independence in the 1950s and 1960s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for events that cost "tens of thousands of lives." This admission follows a 2022 historical commission report which detailed France's use of forced displacement and internment camps to suppress the independence movement. The move is part of a broader effort by Macron to confront France's colonial past.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers in connection with a burglary at actor Brad Pitt's home and a series of similar crimes targeting other high-profile residents. The suspects, described as street gang members, allegedly hopped a fence and broke into Pitt's Los Feliz property in June. The investigation revealed they were part of a crew responsible for multiple celebrity burglaries across the city. Police noted that thieves are becoming more sophisticated, using surveillance and Wi-Fi jammers, and often target celebrities whose travel schedules are public.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Stock Market Surges as Inflation Data Fuels Hopes for Interest Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 20:06:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. stock market rallied sharply on Tuesday, with major indexes approaching record highs, following the release of favorable inflation data. The report showed that consumer prices in July rose 2.7% from a year earlier, slightly below economists' expectations and fueling investor optimism. This has increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will proceed with an interest rate cut at its next meeting in September. Lower rates would reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, providing a potential boost to the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant act of bilateral cooperation, Mexico has extradited 26 inmates, described as "key operatives" of powerful drug cartels, to the United States. The transferred individuals, who have not been publicly named, face charges in American courts for violent crimes and links to organized crime. This is the second major transfer of its kind this year and comes amid continued pressure from the White House for Mexico to intensify its crackdown on drug trafficking. The move demonstrates ongoing collaboration between the two nations on security issues.</p>
