Verstappen has been rapidly closing the gap on championship leader Piastri in recent races, and McLaren's struggles in practice suggest a potentially difficult weekend ahead for the team.

          <p>As winter approaches and daylight hours significantly diminish, particularly in Scotland's northern isles, many individuals face the profound challenges of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring seasonal depression, characterized by low mood, irritability, and anxiety, affects over a million people in the UK. Experts at the University of Glasgow's 'Living with SAD' project are promoting creative and cultural resources, including therapeutic lamps distributed in Orkney libraries, to encourage outdoor activity and develop new "light routines." The article suggests adopting Scandinavian approaches to winter, such as creating cozy interior light environments, can help improve mental well-being and shift attitudes towards the darker months.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against reducing the tax-free allowance for Cash ISAs in the forthcoming Budget, arguing it's unlikely to foster an investment culture in the UK. Reeves is reportedly considering changes to Cash ISAs as part of efforts to address a £22bn budget shortfall, despite significant opposition from banks and consumer groups earlier this year. The current £20,000 limit can be spread across various ISA products, and the proposed change specifically targets cash savings. The article highlights the ongoing debate over fiscal policy and its potential impact on individual savers and the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Drivers Face Dilemma: Manual vs. Automatic Licensing Amidst Electric Vehicle Shift</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:07:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant shift is occurring in UK driving education, with one in three cars now automatic, largely driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales, as electric vehicles lack manual gearboxes. For new drivers, the choice between learning manual or automatic is complex, as an automatic license restricts them to only automatic vehicles. Many young people prefer automatic for an easier test, but a shortage of instructors and higher costs often push them towards manual. The article notes that despite perceptions, the manual test currently has a higher pass rate, influencing decisions about future car affordability and versatility.</p>

          <p>Vote counting is officially underway in the Irish presidential election, following Friday's polls to elect the 10th Irish president to succeed current head of state Michael D Higgins. Voters had a choice between two primary contenders, Catherine Connolly and Heather Humphreys, though Jim Gavin's name remained on the ballot despite his withdrawal from the race earlier in October. Early unofficial indications have suggested a potentially low turnout, possibly struggling to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018. The official result is anticipated to be announced later this evening at Dublin Castle.</p>

The new cohort comprises individuals with backgrounds in federal government work, including military lawyers, reflecting altered qualification requirements to fill roles. This hiring aims to restore integrity to the EOIR and address a backlog of millions of immigration cases, which had been delayed as far out as 2029.</p>
