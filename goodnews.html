          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be involved in the investment group forming a deal to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as participants, describing the investors as "American patriots." This development comes as the White House works to finalize a deal that would place TikTok's U.S. data and algorithm under American control to address national security concerns.</p>

          <p>England defeated Ireland by six wickets in the third T20 match to secure a 2-0 series victory, the first-ever T20 series between the two nations. Jordan Cox, who was a late addition to the squad, anchored the chase with a crucial 55 runs after Ireland set a target of 155. England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, had earlier restricted the Irish batting lineup, setting the stage for a comfortable win sealed with 17 balls to spare.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan initiated a one-day trial to ban traffic from a section of Oxford Street, envisioning it as the start of a "fight back" to rescue the famous shopping thoroughfare. The event, which closed a half-mile stretch to vehicles, is part of a larger plan to permanently pedestrianize the area between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. While many pedestrians welcomed the car-free experience, some local councillors and residents raised concerns about the potential for traffic congestion on side streets and accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges.</p>

          <p>U.S. athlete Cole Hocker won the men's 5,000-meter final at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo with a stunning finishing kick. Hocker was in 11th place at the start of the final lap but surged past his competitors to claim the gold medal, viewing the victory as vindication after a controversial disqualification in the 1500m event earlier in the championships. His performance was a highlight for the dominant USA team on the final night of the competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the far-right's use of Christian symbols, faith leaders and community members are calling for churches to actively stand against the distortion of their beliefs. Contributors to a discussion argue that the core Christian message of peace, justice, and compassion is being nauseatingly misused to promote division and hate. They emphasize that the true expression of faith is found in practical acts of love, such as welcoming asylum seekers and advocating for the vulnerable, rather than in the "oxymoron" of Christian nationalism.</p>

          <p>Luke Donald, the captain of Europe's Ryder Cup team, has suggested that the U.S. team could face negative pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage due to the controversial decision for American players to be paid. Each U.S. player will receive a $500,000 payment, a stark contrast to the European team, which plays for free. Donald believes that if the highly-paid U.S. team underperforms, the New York gallery, facing high ticket prices, might turn on their own players, adding an unusual dynamic to the competition.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, Wall Street strategists are optimistic that the stock market's record-breaking run may have further to go. Some analysts argue that the current S&P 500 is fundamentally different from historical benchmarks due to the dominance of high-margin tech and communication companies, justifying higher valuations. While the AI boom and easier financial conditions are fueling the rally, some experts caution that this could lead to a speculative "melt-up" driven more by investor FOMO than by solid economic fundamentals.

          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. This process can be slowed or even reversed through lifestyle changes that promote cellular restoration. Epel recommends simple, sustainable practices to de-stress, such as eating more fruits and vegetables, incorporating short meditative breaks into the day, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork to create an anti-inflammatory lifestyle.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "Softly, as I Leave You," Priscilla Presley recounts her life after divorcing Elvis Presley, a decision she says was made not from a lack of love but from a need to find her own identity outside of his all-encompassing fame. She describes their uncommonly close relationship post-divorce, her career in business and acting, and the profound grief of losing their daughter, Lisa Marie Presley.
