          <p>Edmund White, a prominent figure in gay literature, has passed away at the age of 85. White was known for his exploration of his own sexual experiences in his extensive collection of over 30 books, spanning both fiction and nonfiction. His works often delved into the complexities of gay identity and culture, making him a significant voice in the literary world. White's candid and introspective writing style resonated with many readers, solidifying his place as a pioneer in gay literature and leaving a lasting impact on the genre.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While timely bill payments are crucial for credit scores, experts emphasize that they are not the sole determinant of a high score. Many Americans mistakenly believe that consistently paying bills on time is sufficient to improve their credit, but factors such as the type of debt and whether the payments are reported to credit bureaus also play a significant role. For instance, payments for rent-to-own services, private school tuition, and some buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans may not be reported, thus not impacting the credit score. Checking one's credit report is a way to know which payments are influencing your credit.</p>

          <p>After 82 years, the remains of a World War II pilot, 1st Lt. Charles W. McCook, have been identified. McCook was credited with saving a fellow airman's life during a bombing raid over Meiktila, Burma, in 1943. His plane crashed, and he and three others died, but not before he maneuvered the aircraft to allow two soldiers to parachute to safety. McCook's remains were recovered in 1947 but not identified until 2022 through advanced DNA analysis. McCook will be buried in his hometown in August 2025.</p>

          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate, encompassing both employee and employer contributions, has reached a new record high of 14.3% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Fidelity's analysis. This rate is nearing the recommended savings target of 15% of pre-tax income. A significant portion of the increased employee deferrals is attributed to "auto-escalations," which automatically increase savings rates over time. While the recommended target provides a benchmark, the ideal savings percentage varies based on individual circumstances, such as existing savings, retirement plans, and pension income.

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive planet orbiting a small red dwarf star, a finding that challenges existing theories about planet formation. The planet, named TOI-6894b, is a gas giant with a radius slightly larger than Saturn but only half its mass. Its existence is puzzling because it was previously thought that small stars could not provide the conditions necessary to form such large planets. Scientists are hoping to use the James Webb Space Telescope to further study the planet and unravel its mysteries.</p>
