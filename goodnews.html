          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods plans to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to expand internationally and gain a stronger foothold in the Nike sneaker market. The deal, structured with a mix of cash and Dick's stock, represents a significant premium for Foot Locker shareholders. Dick's intends to operate Foot Locker as a separate business unit, retaining its existing brands. However, analysts at TD Cowen have expressed skepticism, downgrading Dick's stock and citing concerns about the potential for low returns and integration challenges, while others believe the merger will allow Dick's to enter the international markets for the first time.

          <p>Walmart reported earnings that beat expectations, with e-commerce showing its first profitable quarter, but the company is cautioning that tariffs may lead to price increases later this month.

Walmart is working with vendors to mitigate the impact and plans to maintain a competitive pricing edge. Despite the tariff concerns, Walmart reaffirmed its full-year forecast and has seen steady consumer behavior, though shoppers are mindful of potential price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Golden State Warriors' season ended with a defeat against the Minnesota Timberwolves, exposing the team's over-reliance on Stephen Curry.

Despite midseason acquisition Jimmy Butler's efforts, the Warriors couldn't compensate for Curry's absence, raising concerns about the team's future as Curry ages.
