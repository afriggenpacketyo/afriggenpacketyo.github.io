          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 00:04:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has revised its welfare reform bill following significant pressure from over 100 Labour backbench MPs. In a major concession, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall confirmed that planned cuts to disability benefits will now only apply to future claimants, not current recipients. This change protects the most vulnerable individuals already in the system and has secured enough support from the rebels to likely ensure the bill's passage. The move represents a substantial climbdown and aims to put the social security system on a more sustainable footing while addressing concerns about the pace of reform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, prominent economists argued that China must pivot from a production-focused to a consumption-driven economy to achieve long-term prosperity. Professor Jin Keyu stated that relying on production and exports is creating global trade friction and is unsustainable for fostering harmonious international relations. The panel recommended that China's government incentivize domestic consumption, particularly in the services sector and smaller cities, as a key metric for local officials' success. This shift is seen as crucial for China's continued economic development and its integration into the global economy.</p>

          <p>Tokyo stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Nikkei 225 index climbing above the 40,000 mark for the first time in five months. The surge was driven by easing investor anxiety over U.S. trade policy, following indications from the White House that a 90-day pause on certain tariffs could be extended beyond its July 9 deadline. The positive market sentiment was further bolstered by gains in the U.S. Nasdaq index and a de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East. This optimism led to a sell-off of the yen, which is typically seen as a safe-haven asset. (not investment advice)</p>
