          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly advised President Donald Trump to decline the offer of a $400 million jet from Qatar, expressing concerns about national security and Qatar's history of 'playing both sides.' Pence emphasized the potential for intelligence gathering and the need to ensure the president's safety. Trump has stated the plane would be formally donated to the U.S. Department of Defense and eventually transferred to his presidential library foundation, saving taxpayers money due to delays at Boeing. Pence suggests Qatar could instead invest the funds in U.S. military base infrastructure.</p>

          <p>UK strawberry growers are anticipating a particularly sweet season in 2025 due to a combination of warm days and cooler nights. The dry spring has allowed strawberries to accumulate high levels of natural sugars, resulting in a 'stonking start' to the season. While drought concerns remain, most growers have irrigation systems in place to mitigate the effects of extreme weather. This year's conditions contrast sharply with 2024, when a wet winter delayed ripening.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has confirmed that a document in its archives is an original copy of King Edward I‚Äôs reaffirmation of the Magna Carta, acquired for a mere $27.50 in 1946. The discovery coincides with the Trump administration freezing federal grants to the university. The Magna Carta symbolizes the importance of checks and balances and the need to limit the power of those in authority. The document serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle against autocracy and the duty to push back against unchecked power.</p>
