          <p>Romania is holding a rerun of its presidential election after the original vote in November was annulled due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The initial election saw far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round.

Georgescu is banned from participating in the rerun, but his ally, George Simion, is expected to be a strong contender.</p>

          <p>The increasing scrutiny of baby food pouches as ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is seen as another way of making mothers feel guilty, according to this article. While acknowledging concerns about sugar content and nutritional value, the author argues that such criticism often overlooks the time, labor, and social inequalities that influence parents' choices. The author advocates for societal changes, such as improved parental leave and affordable childcare, rather than placing blame on individual mothers for using convenient food options. The discussion is part of a larger project to re-domesticate women.</p>
