        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An emerging parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" prioritizes emotional attunement and creating a secure environment for children. This approach focuses on accepting children's emotions, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, do internal work to manage their own reactions, and embrace their child's authentic self. The article suggests that emotional safety is a crucial element often missing in homes, offering practical steps for parents to cultivate trust and connection with their children.</p>
