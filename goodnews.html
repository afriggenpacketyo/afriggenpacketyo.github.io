          <h2>UK Conservative Leader Kemi Badenoch Views Argentine President as a Template Amid Party Struggles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch stated that the Tories must offer hope and fix problems, rather than just being a "repository of disenchantment," especially as the Reform UK party gains traction. In an interview, she cited Argentine President Javier Milei, known for his aggressive cost-cutting measures, as a "template" for her leadership style, expressing concern about the state's expanding influence. This comes as the Conservative Party consistently polls behind Labour and Reform, and following a recent reshuffle of her shadow cabinet to include "heavy hitters" like James Cleverly. Badenoch dismissed concerns about her leadership's stability.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations despite challenges from a strong euro. The bank affirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, with its profit before tax rising 34% year-on-year when excluding litigation impacts. Its core investment banking unit saw a 3% revenue increase, driven by fixed income and currencies, although the origination and advisory division declined. The bank noted a slowdown in corporate loan growth but expressed confidence in its overall momentum and cost discipline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Irish centre Garry Ringrose has been withdrawn from the British and Irish Lions' second Test match against Australia after reporting concussion symptoms following a training session. This marks the second time a head injury has sidelined him during the tour. Head coach Andy Farrell praised Ringrose for his honesty and selflessness in reporting the issue, a sentiment echoed by captain Maro Itoje. Huw Jones will now start alongside Bundee Aki in the midfield for the crucial match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, as the Lions aim for a historic back-to-back tour victory.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a pilot program providing monthly subsidy coupons to its senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly care and stimulate domestic consumption. The electronic vouchers, valued between 500 and 800 yuan, will be available to seniors assessed as having moderate to severe disabilities. This policy marks a rare instance of direct fiscal support from Beijing, which has typically avoided cash-style handouts. The initiative aims to alleviate the financial burden on families and encourage the use of services like meal assistance and day care, addressing the challenges of a rapidly aging population.

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, former city traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for rigging the Libor inter-bank lending rate quashed by the UK's Supreme Court. The ruling overturns one of the most high-profile prosecutions following the 2008 financial crisis and is expected to lead to appeals from at least seven other convicted traders. The decision raises questions about potential compensation for wrongful imprisonment and has prompted calls for a public inquiry into the Serious Fraud Office's investigation methods and the role of senior bank managers and government bodies in the scandal.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision to block President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the proposed policy, which would deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen or temporary resident parents, is unconstitutional. The ruling keeps a nationwide injunction in place, with the majority opinion stating the administration's interpretation ignores the plain language of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. This decision marks the first time an appeals court has weighed in, moving the contentious issue closer to the Supreme Court.</p>

While the game provided entertainment and a showcase for top talent, Messi's decision to skip the event, potentially saving himself for more crucial club matches, is seen by some as a sign of disrespect for American sports culture and by others as a professional prioritizing meaningful competition. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to rethink the event's format, especially as the league seeks to grow its viewership and manage increasing fixture congestion for its players.</p>

The research, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, found this more achievable target was linked to substantial health improvements compared to lower activity levels. Researchers note that the 10,000-step goal originated from a 1960s marketing campaign, not scientific evidence. They hope these findings will encourage more people to adopt step-tracking as a practical way to improve their wellbeing.</p>

The snails float on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft and are distinguished by their striking purple shells. Their appearance coincides with notably warm offshore water temperatures, prompting researchers to consider if their presence is a potential indicator of broader climate change impacts on ocean currents and marine life distribution.</p>

Formed in Aston, Birmingham, the band reacted against the "hippy-dippy" music of the era by creating a darker, heavier sound inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident injured his fingertips, was central to their sound, creating detuned, powerful riffs. Their controversial, supposedly satanic imagery sparked moral panic but also attracted legions of fans, cementing their legacy as the architects of a new musical genre.</p>

Devers explained that playing in the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his next at-bat. The change comes after a tense spring training with the Red Sox where he publicly resisted a potential move to a defensive role, citing the team's earlier instructions for him to focus solely on hitting.</p>
