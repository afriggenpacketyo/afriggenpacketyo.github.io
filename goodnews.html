          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, secured a trainee accountant position in London after applying for 647 jobs over 18 months. She faced numerous rejections and a lack of feedback, leading her to question the value of her degree. Morgan believes that the use of artificial intelligence in recruitment filtering processes may have contributed to her initial difficulties, as her CV was not initially optimized for applicant tracking systems. Despite the challenges, she persevered, adjusting her CV and eventually reaching the assessment stages for 221 roles, underscoring the competitive nature of the graduate job market and the importance of adapting to modern recruitment technologies.</p>

          <p>The winning design for the national memorial to Queen Elizabeth II includes a glass bridge, commemorative gardens, and a statue of Prince Philip alongside the Queen. Lord Norman Foster's design team envisions a translucent bridge inspired by the Queen's wedding tiara and gardens reflecting the growth of the Commonwealth during her reign. The memorial, to be built in St James's Park, aims to evoke a sense of her life of service and will feature a separate statue of the Queen and Prince Philip, gardens, and a Prince Philip Gate. The design balances traditional and modern elements, with the location chosen for its visibility from Buckingham Palace.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a nearly 5% drop after Israel agreed to a ceasefire with Iran, easing concerns about potential disruptions to global oil supplies. Prices had previously surged due to fears that Iran could blockade the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping route for oil and gas. The FTSE 100 index in the UK and stock markets in Europe and Asia saw gains following the ceasefire announcement. Despite the initial drop, prices narrowed as Israel accused Iran of violating the ceasefire with a missile strike, underscoring the fragility of the situation.</p>

Pilots undergo sleep studies and carefully consider their diet, often opting for bland meals like turkey sandwiches. Mid-air refueling, a dangerous aspect of these missions, is done blind, relying on visual cues and memorized reference points. The B-2's software has improved responsiveness, but flying in tight formation at high altitude remains challenging, especially as pilot fatigue sets in, and the Air Force plans to replace the B-2 and B-1 fleets with B-21 Raiders.</p>
