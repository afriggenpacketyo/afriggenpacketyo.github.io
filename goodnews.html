          <p>In a significant development for the New York City mayoral race, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani. The endorsement comes just before the start of early voting, providing Mamdani's campaign with substantial momentum. Jeffries praised Mamdani's focus on the city's affordability crisis and his commitment to representing all New Yorkers. This key backing adds to a growing list of support for Mamdani from prominent Democrats and organizations, contrasting with his opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was recently endorsed by the outgoing mayor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, 'The Running Ground,' The Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson reflects on the profound simplicity and complexity of running. He describes the sport as a form of meditation that strips away distractions, forcing an inward focus on one's mind and body. Thompson contrasts the mental openness of a casual run with the intense focus required for a competitive workout, where self-doubt must be actively suppressed. The article highlights how running has shaped his perception of the world and serves as a vital connection to nature and a more adventurous version of himself.</p>

          <p>Following a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the United States is actively working to establish an international peacekeeping force in Gaza to ensure stability. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have emphasized the need for a quick deployment, with several nations like Indonesia, the UAE, and Turkey offering to contribute troops. However, the composition of the force remains a point of negotiation, as Israel must approve any participating country. Key challenges persist, including Hamas's reluctance to disarm and the unresolved question of who will ultimately govern the war-torn territory as it faces a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Following Kim Kardashian's revelation that she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm, medical experts are clarifying the relationship between the condition and stress. While direct causation is not proven, doctors explain that chronic stress can elevate blood pressure, which is a significant risk factor for the formation and growth of an aneurysm, a weak or bulging spot in a brain artery. The primary causes remain genetics, high blood pressure, smoking, and age-related arterial changes. This article explains that most aneurysms are small, asymptomatic, and do not rupture, but managing blood pressure and stress is crucial for prevention and overall health.</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, an accused fentanyl kingpin known as 'Brother Wang,' has been successfully extradited from Cuba to the United States, according to Mexican officials who assisted in the transfer. Zhang, a Chinese citizen, is accused of running a major international drug trafficking and money laundering operation, with close ties to Mexico's Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels. He allegedly coordinated the importation of fentanyl and cocaine into the U.S. and laundered at least $20 million. His capture and extradition represent a significant victory for U.S. law enforcement in its efforts to dismantle the global supply chains for the deadly synthetic opioid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation rose at an annual rate of 3% in September, a figure that came in slightly below economists' predictions of 3.1%. The data suggests that while prices are climbing, partly due to tariffs, the impact on consumers has been somewhat muted as businesses absorb some of the costs. This inflation report is particularly significant as it is used to calculate the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits. The slightly cooler-than-expected inflation could provide the Federal Reserve with more justification to consider another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>
