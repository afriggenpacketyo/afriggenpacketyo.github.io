        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airlines are finding summer profitability more challenging as traditional travel patterns shift, with many travelers now flying earlier in the season or pushing European trips to the fall. This unpredictability, combined with rising labor and operational costs, has forced carriers like American, Delta, and United to reduce their August flight schedules. Consequently, several major airlines have lowered their 2025 profit forecasts, though recent capacity cuts are creating some optimism for a better supply-and-demand balance in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Country music star Luke Bryan has strongly criticized the trend of audience members throwing objects at performers, calling them "idiots" after being hit by a small ball during a recent concert. He expressed frustration not just with the act itself, but also with how the incident was exaggerated, causing unnecessary concern among his family and friends. Bryan noted this is not a new phenomenon, recalling that fans have previously thrown expensive cell phones on stage, which he views as a sign of entitlement.</p>

          <p>The new film 'East of Wall' is a docu-fiction hybrid that explores the lives of a struggling ranch matriarch and her rodeo-star daughter in South Dakota. Directed by Kate Beecroft, the movie features first-time actors playing versions of themselves, lending an authentic grit and warmth to the story of family, financial hardship, and resilience. While the article notes that the film's narrative framework can feel thin at times, it praises the compelling performances of its real-life subjects, Tabatha and Porshia Zimiga, as they navigate their complex world.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described the potential government intervention as "essential" for national security. The move is seen as a way to revive the struggling American chipmaker and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturing, particularly from companies in Taiwan and South Korea. This intervention would align with President Trump's goal of bringing more high-end technology production back to the U.S., though the exact structure of such a deal remains under discussion.</p>

          <p>The supermarket chain Iceland is introducing a new initiative in the UK to combat rising retail theft, offering customers a £1 reward for reporting shoplifters. The company's executive chairman, Richard Walker, stated that theft costs the business approximately £20 million annually, impacting its ability to lower prices and invest in staff. To receive the credit on their loyalty card, shoppers are encouraged to alert staff with a description of the suspect, rather than confronting them directly, as shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have hit a two-decade high.</p>

          <p>With average credit card interest rates near 22%, a recent survey shows that nearly 60% of American adults are making it a top financial priority to pay down their balances. The collective credit card debt in the U.S. has surpassed $1.21 trillion, and managing multiple card balances complicates repayment for many. The article outlines several strategies for tackling this debt, including debt forgiveness programs, debt management plans with credit counseling agencies, and debt consolidation through loans or balance transfers to simplify payments and reduce interest costs.

          <p>This article reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, particularly her most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." The writer explores how Spark uses the story of an unconventional teacher and her favored students in 1930s Edinburgh to delve into the complexities of adolescence, influence, and moral education. The narrative focuses on how the teacher, Miss Brodie, acts as a god-like figure to her pupils, and how one student's eventual conversion to Catholicism represents a final break from that powerful influence, showcasing Spark's deep engagement with themes of faith and individuality.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive and opinionated ranking of the film and television adaptations of John Grisham's legal thrillers. The list evaluates nine different adaptations, from the 1993 movie "The Pelican Brief" to the new 2025 TV series "The Rainmaker," based on their quality and faithfulness to Grisham's signature style of underdog stories. The author rates "The Pelican Brief" as the best adaptation for its pacing and charismatic leads, while placing the 2012 TV version of "The Firm" at the bottom for failing to capture the propulsive nature of Grisham's writing.</p>

          <p>A swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching a magnitude of 4.0, has occurred in a geothermal steam field in Northern California. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such seismic activity is common in this area, which is home to one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The earthquakes are believed to be induced by the power generation process, which involves withdrawing steam and injecting cold water, causing the surrounding rock to contract and shift, rather than being linked to major fault lines.</p>
