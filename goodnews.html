          <p>South Korea's newly elected president, Lee Jae Myung, is likely to pursue stable ties with Japan, especially early in his term, navigating regional security challenges and uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. Despite Lee's past anti-Japan rhetoric, experts believe he will adopt a pragmatic approach, acknowledging Japan as an important partner. Japanese experts suggest that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba should quickly establish personal trust with Lee through summit talks to maintain trilateral cooperation with the United States. Lee's shift in stance is seen as an effort to present himself as a realistic politician amid turbulent times, considering public support for improved bilateral ties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy existed in the Americas for thousands of years before European colonization, caused by the bacteria species Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Researchers analyzed ancient remains in Canada and Argentina, reconstructing and dating bacterial genomes to find that the species spread rapidly across the Americas. Previously, it was believed that Europeans brought leprosy to the Americas via Mycobacterium leprae. The findings highlight the complex relationship between pathogens and humans throughout history, and may improve understanding of modern cases of leprosy.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced ¬£15 billion in investment for transport infrastructure projects in England, focusing on tram, train, and bus initiatives in mayoral authorities across the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The move precedes the government's spending review and aims to address criticism of economic gloom, particularly concerning disability and benefit cuts. The investment marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. Mayors from various regions have expressed enthusiasm, while critics emphasize the need for sustained funding and affordability.</p>

          <p>Charlene Kaye, a classically trained musician-turned-comedian, has gained millions of views for her pop music parodies, dissecting the musical elements of popular songs and highlighting what makes them recognizable. Kaye's comedy work draws from her relationship with her mother, exploring the concept of a "tiger daughter" in her one-woman show. Her journey began with guitar lessons and performances at local open mic nights, eventually leading her to play guitar for the parody "A Very Potter Musical" and join indie rock band San Fermin. Despite initial fears of backlash, her parodies have resonated with audiences and even received positive responses from the artists she parodies.</p>
