          <p>Amazon's Zoox has officially entered the robotaxi market with its launch in Las Vegas, offering free rides from select locations initially, with plans for broader expansion. The electric robotaxi, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, distinguishes itself from competitors like Waymo and Tesla with its unique design centered around the rider experience. Zoox aims to provide a superior alternative to retrofitted cars, emphasizing safety and user-friendly features. The company plans to introduce an early rider program in San Francisco and testing in Austin and Miami, with a focus on scaling production at its California facility. Zoox aims for profitability sometime between weeks from now and decades from now, which is a wide range. Optimism is high for the future of robotaxis and their potential impact on transportation.</p>

          <p>Klarna, a buy now, pay later company, priced its IPO at $40 per share, exceeding expectations and valuing the Swedish firm at approximately $15 billion. The IPO raised $1.37 billion for the company and existing shareholders, with shares to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "KLAR". Klarna had initially planned to go public earlier in the year but delayed its plans due to trade tariff concerns, and the company has been trying to rebrand itself as more of a digital retail bank. The company reported a net loss in the second quarter, but a rise in revenue from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This NPR piece reflects on the experience of returning to a peaceful woodland near the River Thames, a place of childhood memories and family history. The woodland serves as a burial ground, where ashes nourish the soil for growing oak and beech trees. The author contemplates the meaning of home after years of living abroad, acknowledging the privilege of peace that allows for such returns and dignified farewells. The author contrasts this with the experiences of colleagues witnessing the horrors of war, highlighting the importance of cherishing moments of tranquility and connection to loved ones.</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), which measures wholesale prices, unexpectedly declined by 0.1% in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This provides potential leeway for the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. The core PPI, excluding food and energy, also decreased by 0.1%, surprising economists' expectations for an increase. The services prices, a key metric for the Fed, posted a 0.2% drop, helping drive wholesale inflation lower. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts were surprised by Oracle's forward-looking numbers, particularly the company's projected growth in its cloud infrastructure business. Oracle anticipates revenue in this sector to jump significantly, driven by new artificial intelligence deals and a growing customer base. The company's remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue, have also soared, indicating strong future growth. While some analysts express caution about Oracle's reliance on capacity offloaded from other hyperscalers, the overall sentiment is highly positive, with many raising their estimates on the stock. The report signals a potentially transformative shift for Oracle's business.</p>

Financial planners recommend this strategy for higher earners looking for a tax deduction. While many retirement plans offer catch-up contributions, only a small percentage of eligible workers actually utilize them. The higher 401(k) catch-up is a great tool in the toolbox.
