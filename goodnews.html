          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated Jacob Fearnley in a French Open third-round match, overcoming distractions from loud fireworks outside Paris St-Germain's stadium. Norrie, currently ranked 81st in the world, used his experience to control the match against his fellow Scot, who described the noise as "brutal." With the win, Norrie reached the last 16 of the clay-court Grand Slam for the first time and could potentially face Novak Djokovic. Both Jack Draper and Cameron Norrie reaching the last 16 marks the first time since 1968 that two British men have achieved this feat at the French Open.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can result in penalties that increase premiums for life; however, individuals covered by an employer-provided health insurance plan through an employer with 20 or more employees can generally delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying enrollment allows continued contributions to a health savings account, which are no longer allowed upon Medicare enrollment. It is recommended to confirm coverage with the employer's benefits department. This article also clarifies the differences between the home sale exemption and 1031 exchanges, highlighting the conditions for each. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized the introduction of a new rule clamping down on front wing flexibility at the Spanish Grand Prix, calling it "a waste of money." The FIA imposed a stiffer load test on front wings to limit their movement for aerodynamic advantage. Hamilton said the rule has changed nothing, with wings still bending and teams spending more money to make new ones. Hamilton noted that he drove it on the simulator, and it's pretty much exactly the same, potentially suggesting that the money could have been better spent on other areas.</p>
