          <p>The WNBA has renewed its media rights deal with E.W. Scripps, ensuring Friday night games will continue to be broadcast on Ion in a multi-year agreement. The deal includes the addition of a weekly studio show dedicated exclusively to WNBA coverage, marking a significant investment in the league's visibility. Ion has experienced substantial viewership growth with WNBA games, attributed to the rising popularity of stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. The partnership is part of a broader media rights strategy, including an 11-year deal with Disney, Amazon, and NBCUniversal, valued at approximately $200 million per year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has issued a preliminary injunction against parts of President Trump's executive order aimed at overhauling U.S. elections. The ruling prevents the administration from implementing requirements for documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote, finding that the states are likely to succeed in their case. The judge emphasized that Congress has the authority to set election requirements and that the executive order unduly interferes with this power. The decision blocks provisions mandating the Election Assistance Commission to require proof of citizenship on the national voter registration form and directing the Secretary of Defense to update absentee voting applications.</p>

          <p>The FDA has broadened its approval of Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, mRESVIA, to include adults under 60 who are at increased risk of the disease. Previously, the vaccine was only approved for those aged 60 and older. The approval follows a late-stage clinical trial demonstrating the vaccine's ability to boost immune responses in younger adults with underlying conditions. While the FDA has approved the expanded use, the CDC's vaccine advisory committee must vote to recommend the new age group's eligibility, followed by a final recommendation from the CDC director.</p>

          <p>Marine experts believe they have located the wreckage of the Recovery, an 18th-century British ship that sank off the coast of Wexford, Ireland, in 1787. The ship was carrying valuable cargo, including marble, bronze, and art collected by James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont, and John La Touche. The team identified the ship's remains through a copper sheath on the vessel, a technique used in the 18th century to protect ships from marine life. The discovery offers potential insights into maritime history and the possibility of recovering valuable artifacts.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded sharply in early June, exceeding expectations as concerns about tariffs and inflation subsided, according to a University of Michigan survey. The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, a 15.9% increase from the previous month, with both current conditions and future expectations showing significant gains. The improvement coincides with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs and progress in trade negotiations with China. While sentiment remains below year-ago levels, the easing of inflation expectations suggests consumers are becoming less worried about the economic impact of trade policies.
