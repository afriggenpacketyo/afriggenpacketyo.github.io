          <h2>Ioka Fails to Regain WBA Super Flyweight Title in Martinez Rematch</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kazuto Ioka was unable to reclaim the WBA super flyweight title from Fernando Martinez in their rematch, with Martinez winning by unanimous decision. The fight, a 12-round war, was a repeat of their July 2024 bout where Martinez initially took the belt from Ioka. Ioka briefly gained an advantage by flooring Martinez in the 10th round with a left hook, but he couldn't maintain the momentum to overcome Martinez's earlier aggression. This loss marks a setback for Ioka, who aimed to become the oldest Japanese man to win a world title.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research vessel was observed lowering a pipe-like object into the sea within Japan's exclusive economic zone near the Senkaku Islands. The Japan Coast Guard radioed the vessel, urging it to halt its activities, suspecting unauthorized oceanographic research. The vessel later moved to the Chinese side of the Japan-China median line. This incident is part of ongoing tensions in the East China Sea, where China's maritime assertiveness has led to repeated intrusions into Japanese waters near the Senkakus.</p>

          <p>Democrats are preparing to select the state that will lead the 2028 presidential nominating calendar, a decision that follows President Biden's 2024 shake-up favoring South Carolina. Traditional early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada are vying for top billing, with each offering unique advantages to different candidates and segments of the Democratic base. Potential 2028 candidates are already visiting these states, signaling the start of the competition. The decision is crucial for a party grappling with its direction after losing the White House in November.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article explores a growing trend of parents building intentional communities with friends to combat the isolation and challenges of modern parenting. One couple, Charlotte and Raffi, moved next door to their best friends to create a shared support system for raising their children. This arrangement, reminiscent of historical alloparenting, provides mutual aid, shared childcare, and deeper friendships. While challenges exist, such as differing parenting styles and compromises on control, the benefits of shared responsibility and emotional support often outweigh the difficulties.</p>

          <p>A New York Times newsletter discusses the influence of sibling relationships, genetics, and parenting on individual development. Research suggests that siblings significantly shape each other's personalities and academic achievements, particularly in disadvantaged families. While birth order may seem influential, studies show that it has little to do with personality. Genetics and environment both play roles in determining an individual's personality. The newsletter also touches on the India-Pakistan conflict, the new pope, trade negotiations, and foreign policy.</p>

The new pope garnered over 75% of votes in the conclave, and three Chinese were arrested for running an illicit poker den in Tokyo. Tokyo expressway is being redeveloped into an elevated green walkway, and Japan is reluctant to switch to app-based salary payments.</p>
