          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has made history by becoming the oldest person to complete the Badwater 135, an exceptionally challenging ultramarathon. The 135-mile race begins below sea level in Death Valley, where temperatures can exceed 120°F, and ascends to an elevation of over 8,300 feet. Becker finished the race with approximately three hours to spare, successfully settling a score with the course after failing to finish within the 48-hour cutoff time in a previous attempt.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of the planet Mars currently on Earth, with an expected price of up to $4 million. The Martian meteorite, weighing over 54 pounds, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. The rare object offers a significant dataset for scientists studying the red planet.</p>

          <p>A year after historic flooding wiped out their farm and home, a South Dakota family reflects on their difficult path to recovery. Having lost their crops and home without flood insurance, they were forced to sell off land and use savings to rebuild on higher ground. The article highlights the broader agricultural challenges posed by what meteorologists call "whiplash weather," where extreme rainfall is followed by drought. Despite the lingering trauma, local farmers are cautiously optimistic as this year's crops appear to be growing as expected.</p>

          <p>A Jefferies report highlights the growing prominence of Chinese biotech firms, which are attracting significant attention from multinational pharmaceutical companies for their innovation, cost-efficiency, and accelerated development timelines. At the world's largest cancer research conference, nearly a third of the drug candidate presentations came from Chinese companies, a dramatic increase from a decade ago. This trend indicates a shift where global firms are increasingly "shopping" in China's biotech market to acquire promising new drug compounds for further development.</p>

Following a steep decline on Friday, analysts from Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley suggested the proposed fees would likely result in only a negligible cost increase for account setups. They noted that larger fintech platforms, which rely more on other transaction methods, would be largely insulated from significant negative effects. (not investment advice)</p>

This concept of mutualisation, which has been discussed for years, is being revisited as the government seeks a "fresh vision" and a cultural transformation following the Horizon IT scandal. While any change in ownership structure is unlikely before 2030, the consultation will explore this and other models to restore trust and determine the services the organization should offer.</p>
