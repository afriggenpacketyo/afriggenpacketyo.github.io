          <p>FedEx announced better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, driven by the achievement of its $4 billion cost-cutting goal. CEO Raj Subramaniam expressed confidence in the company's transformation initiatives, which focus on integrating networks and further reducing costs. The company plans to cut an additional $1 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. Despite the positive results, FedEx stock dropped about 5% in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance that fell slightly below Wall Street expectations, while CFO John Dietrich mentioned a $170 million headwind from international exports due to global trade policy impacts.

          <p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices experienced a surge following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Republican senators introduced a major bill aimed at establishing clear regulatory guidelines for the crypto industry, defining when crypto is a commodity or a security. The bill would allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulatory oversight of digital assets. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev highlighted the importance of this regulatory development for the U.S. to regain its leading position in the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed a lawsuit filed by hardware startup Iyo, which alleges trademark infringement, calling the case "silly, disappointing, and wrong." The lawsuit arose after OpenAI announced plans to bring on Apple designer Jony Ive by acquiring his AI startup io, leading Iyo to claim unfair competition and trademark infringement. OpenAI removed the blog post about the deal from its website following a court order. Altman shared emails suggesting Iyo's CEO had previously sought investment from OpenAI, indicating that the lawsuit is a surprising turn of events.</p>

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has dismissed all active gang injunctions, citing a 2022 Assembly Bill that narrowed the legal definition of gang activity. The decision affects 317 people across several cities and comes after mounting legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased. Gang injunctions, which can restrict suspected gang members' activities, have been challenged as overly broad and racially biased, with civil rights groups arguing they turn everyday activities into crimes.</p>
