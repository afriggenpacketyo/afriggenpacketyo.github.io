          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge hit his 362nd career home run, moving him into fourth place on the team's all-time leaderboard, surpassing the legendary Joe DiMaggio. This historic achievement came shortly after Judge and his teammates met with President Donald Trump, who was in attendance for a recent game where Judge hit two homers. Judge's performance has been a highlight in an MVP-caliber season, raising his major league-best batting average to .324. The only Yankees with more home runs are franchise icons Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, and Babe Ruth.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, a series of celestial events will be visible in the night sky, beginning with the astronomical autumn equinox on September 22nd. The day before, Saturn will be at its brightest and closest to Earth, appearing as a non-twinkling star to the naked eye, though a telescope is needed to see its rings. Later in the season, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will peak around October 22nd. Viewing conditions are expected to be ideal for the meteor shower as its peak coincides with a new moon, minimizing light pollution.</p>

          <p>Three nuns in their 80s have defiantly fled a care home and returned to their former convent in Elsbethen, Austria, after being moved against their will late last year. Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita, the last remaining nuns of the Kloster Goldenstein convent, regained access with the help of former students and a locksmith. They expressed immense relief to be "home," despite the disapproval of church authorities who cited health concerns and the unsuitability of the old rooms. The nuns are now receiving support, food, and medical care from a community of their former students.</p>

Fox, who never knew her father, was feeling a painful void as her wedding day approached. Sensing her situation, Pulliam, from whom she rents a studio for her makeup business, offered to escort her. Fox described the moment he tightly held her hand as feeling "like a wound had been healed in my heart," creating a powerful bond and adding a father figure to her new family.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel has officially begun his role as the music and artistic director designate of the New York Philharmonic, opening the orchestra's new season. His first program featured a world premiere by Leilehua Lanzilotti, Bartók’s Piano Concerto No. 3 with soloist Yunchan Lim, and a rendition of Charles Ives’ Symphony No. 2. Dudamel's arrival has generated significant excitement, with many hoping he can reinvigorate the orchestra's cultural prominence, much like Leonard Bernstein did decades ago. His performance was met with enthusiasm, suggesting a promising start to his highly anticipated leadership.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a significant piece of legislation designed to address the state's housing crisis by overriding local zoning laws to permit denser housing near public transit. The bill allows for the construction of buildings up to nine stories tall adjacent to major transit stops, including in areas previously zoned for single-family homes. Proponents argue the measure is essential for creating much-needed housing, while critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend it is a state overreach that strips local control over development and could negatively impact neighborhood character.</p>
