          <p>Charter Communications and Cox Communications have agreed to merge, creating one of the largest TV and internet providers in the U.S. The deal, which values Cox at $34.5 billion, will be reviewed by antitrust authorities. Charter and Cox argue that the merger will help them compete against larger rivals, and Charter CEO Chris Winfrey called the deal "good for America," stating it will "return jobs from overseas and create new, good paying customer service and sales careers."</p>

          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is leveraging his ownership of the Maryland Colts horse racing franchise in the National Thoroughbred League (NTL) to build up Baltimore. Jackson purchased the Maryland Colts in 2024, basing the franchise in Baltimore where the Colt moniker was previously attached to a Super Bowl-winning National Football League team. Jackson said beyond the Colts, he has no immediate plans to take ownership in other sports teams. Instead, the two-time NFL Most Valuable Player is focused on creating an impact.</p>

          <p>An Indian PhD graduate, Priya Saxena, has been granted an injunction by a federal judge, allowing her to stay in the U.S. after the Trump administration attempted to deport her. Saxena's student visa was terminated due to a minor traffic violation, but a federal judge ruled that the DHS's actions "appear unlawful and are likely to cause Saxena irreparable harm". This case highlights the Trump administration's pursuit of international students, sometimes targeting them for minor infractions.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has announced that CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen will step down as the company seeks to revive its fortunes amid growing competition in the obesity drug market. The decision comes as Novo Nordisk's stock price has taken a battering over the past year amid increased competition in the ballooning obesity drug market and disappointing trial results for its next-generation treatments. Novo last week reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales of its flagship Wegovy obesity drug and trimmed its full-year sales growth forecast amid increased competition from compounded drug markets in the U.S.</p>
