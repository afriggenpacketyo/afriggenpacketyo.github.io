          <p>A Minnesota mechanic, Chad Volk, discovered a wallet that had been lost for 11 years inside the engine bay of a 2015 Ford Edge. The wallet belonged to Richard Guilford, a retired Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan, who had lost it while working on the vehicle's electrical systems back in 2014. Volk found Guilford through Facebook and mailed the wallet back to him, remarkably with $15 in cash and $250 in still-valid Cabela's gift cards inside. The vehicle had traveled over 150,000 miles with the wallet hidden under its airbox before the chance discovery during a repair.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes a novel 'scissor wing' design, a concept once explored by NASA. The proposed aircraft features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, pivots to 45 degrees at transonic speeds to reduce drag, and aligns parallel to the fuselage at hypersonic speeds, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient 'waverider'. This innovative design aims to solve the aerodynamic challenges of flying at both subsonic and hypersonic speeds.</p>

          <h2>Couples Therapist Explains Five Psychological Triggers for Infidelity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 21:35:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A couples therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why individuals, even those in seemingly stable relationships, risk everything for an affair. These triggers include a lifelong pressure to always be 'good' and follow societal expectations, which can lead to a midlife void. Other factors are the burnout from perfectionism, often rooted in trauma; having poor boundaries from being parentified as a child; and being in an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage. Finally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can act as a catalyst for re-evaluating one's life and priorities, making boundaries more permeable.</p>

          <p>Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. Former tech CEO Mike Conner purchased the abandoned, listed building in 2017 for £555,000 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation to make it habitable. The isolated fort, which now features 40 beds and its own nightclub, required extensive work, including bringing in electricity and running water. Originally built to defend against French naval attacks, the island now offers a unique off-grid experience for its new owner.</p>

          <p>As UK families face the financial strain of providing extra meals during the six-week school summer holidays, parents are sharing their strategies for managing rising food costs. Tactics include meticulous planning, buying reduced 'yellow-sticker' items for the freezer, and batch cooking to make ingredients stretch further. One mother portions out food into daily bags to control snacking, while another emphasizes a strict no-waste policy and organizes her fridge by use-by dates. These efforts come as food prices continue to rise and many families, particularly those who rely on subsidized school meals, struggle with increased household expenses.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in March 2021, just as they were returning to school after a lengthy COVID-19 lockdown. The letters captured their fears about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions ranging from whether they would still need face masks to if they had a girlfriend yet. The exercise, organized by their teacher, served as a poignant reflection on their disrupted secondary school journey. Four years later, the students are now receiving their exam results, with many still holding onto the same ambitions.</p>

          <h2>New Wave of Authentic Chinese Restaurants Expands Globally, Serving as Cultural Diplomacy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 18:07:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, moving beyond Westernized dishes like chow mein to offer authentic, diverse regional cuisines from areas like Hunan, Xinjiang, and Zhejiang. These brands, which first test their concepts in multicultural hubs like Singapore, are leveraging sophisticated supply chains and marketing to introduce the world to the vastness of Chinese gastronomy. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a form of soft power or "ping-pong diplomacy," potentially helping to soften China's image on the world stage by showcasing its rich cultural heritage through food.</p>

          <p>A new box set, "Sunset Boulevard," chronicles the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his last significant burst of creativity before his death in 1977. This period includes his final Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads recorded amidst his divorce from Priscilla Presley. The collection also sheds light on a pivotal moment of disappointment when Presley lost the co-starring role in "A Star Is Born" to Kris Kristofferson. Friends believe this missed opportunity contributed to a decline in his artistic focus during his final years.</p>
