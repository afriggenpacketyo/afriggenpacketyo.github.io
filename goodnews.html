          <p>European Union officials presented the bloc as a stable and predictable partner at the Forte de Copacabana International Security Conference in Brazil, citing growing instability from the strategic rivalry between the United States and China. Brian Glynn of the European External Action Service emphasized the EU's focus on a green, digital, and just transition, contrasting it with China's export-led, fossil fuel-driven economy. Glynn clarified that the EU aims to build a development agenda with Latin America, focusing on cooperation rather than resource extraction. Brussels has been increasing its outreach to Latin America and the Caribbean, offering new financial pledges and political cooperation.</p>
