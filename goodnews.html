          <h2>Tesla Seeks License to Become an Electricity Supplier in the United Kingdom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 00:17:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla, the electric vehicle and energy company led by Elon Musk, has applied for a license to supply electricity directly to households and businesses in the UK. If approved by the energy regulator Ofgem, Tesla could enter the British energy market as early as next year, challenging established utility companies. The company already operates a similar service in Texas, allowing customers to power their homes and charge their vehicles, often at a lower cost. This strategic move leverages Tesla's existing UK customer base of over a quarter-million EV owners and thousands of home battery installations, even as the company faces declining vehicle sales in Europe.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its policy to deport foreign criminals before their appeals are heard, adding 15 new countries, including India, Canada, and Australia, to the scheme. This brings the total number of participating nations to 23 and is intended to prevent offenders from using the appeals system to prolong their stay in the UK. Under this "deport now, appeal later" system, foreign nationals whose human rights claims have been denied will be removed and can participate in their appeal hearings via video link from their home countries. The government stated the move will fast-track removals and save taxpayer money, though critics have raised concerns about implementation and international cooperation.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of road safety regulations for England and Wales, which includes mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 every three years. The proposed strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These changes are a response to concerns that the current system is too lax and that existing safety messaging is ineffective. The move follows a coroner's report that criticized the UK's reliance on self-reporting for vision issues, calling for action to prevent future road fatalities.</p>

          <p>Actress Carrie Coon, a three-time Emmy nominee, embraces her character Bertha Russell's development into a potential villain in HBO's "The Gilded Age." Coon discusses the dramatic Season 3 finale, where Bertha's relentless social climbing leads to a major confrontation with her husband, George, a turn she felt the writers had been building toward. She also reflects on her Emmy-nominated role in "The White Lotus," where she played a lawyer on a fraught vacation with friends. Coon believes the powerful monologue her character delivers resonates because of the genuine bond she and her co-stars formed during the grueling shoot, making the depiction of their complex friendship the "sneaky heart of the season."</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, trapping everything including light and sound, newly formed black holes are anything but quiet. This article explores the concept that during their formation, such as from a star's collapse or the merger of two smaller black holes, the resulting distortion of space-time rings like a bell. These vibrations, or gravitational waves, create a unique and pure 'music' that quickly fades as the black hole settles into a stable, perfect shape defined only by its mass and spin. Scientists are on the verge of being able to detect and experience these cosmic symphonies, offering a new way to understand these enigmatic objects.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three to address its declining birth rate. While the flat-rate subsidy has been piloted in various provinces, its national implementation is expected to have a disproportionately positive effect on less affluent regions. For instance, the handout represents over 13% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in wealthy Shanghai. This structure could lead to a more significant boost in consumption and potentially birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas where the financial support is more impactful.

          <h2>UK Government Announces Measures to Boost Employment for New Nursing and Midwifery Graduates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 19:42:02 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives, addressing a surplus of graduates. With up to three times more graduates than vacancies in some areas, the changes aim to cut red tape by allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated need, even before formal vacancies arise. The Department of Health said the plan will support the record number of students who trained during the pandemic. While nursing unions welcomed the move as a source of hope for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the new measures would be funded amid already strained budgets.</p>
