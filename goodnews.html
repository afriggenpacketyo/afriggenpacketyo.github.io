          <p>An Indiana bankruptcy attorney named Mark S. Zuckerberg is suing Meta, Facebook's parent company, due to repeated account suspensions. Zuckerberg claims his account has been disabled five times in eight years, costing him thousands in lost business. Meta allegedly accused him of not using his "authentic name," despite him providing ample identification. The company has since reinstated his account, acknowledging the error and promising to prevent future occurrences, however Zuckerberg is still suing them for breach of contract due to advertising money lost. The article highlights the frustration and financial impact of mistaken identity in the digital age. </p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has reached an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history. This article analyzes Powerball data to determine which states offer the highest and lowest after-tax payouts. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to receive a larger sum after federal taxes. Conversely, states with higher income taxes, such as Minnesota, Oregon, New Jersey, Washington D.C., and New York, result in lower net winnings for jackpot recipients. The article also notes that the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is seeking Supreme Court intervention to reinstate his authority to fire Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. Lower courts had previously ordered Slaughter's reinstatement after Trump terminated her position. The administration argues that the President has the power to remove heads of executive agencies. Slaughter maintains she intends to serve her term, which ends in 2029, and is focused on her work at the FTC. </p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court upheld an injunction against President Trump's policy to prevent transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports that accurately reflect their gender identities. The policy required applicants to provide their "biological sex at birth," limiting options to male or female. The American Civil Liberties Union sued, arguing the policy violated the rights of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people. The court found the policy reflected "unconstitutional animus toward transgender Americans." </p>
