          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) allegedly due to his pro-Palestinian speech. The judge sided with the ACLU's argument that Suri's detention violated his First Amendment rights, as he was being punished for his views and his family ties to those critical of U.S. policy toward Israel. The judge concluded that Suri was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, allowing his release on bail while he continues to participate in removal proceedings. The ruling emphasized the irreparable harm caused by the chilling effect on free speech due to Suri's detention.</p>

Kennedy avoided sharing his personal views on vaccines, deferring to NIH and CDC doctors, while maintaining that widespread cuts at HHS have not impacted key health programs.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at slashing drug prices in the United States, but the article examines why drug prices are so high in the first place. Americans pay almost three times as much for prescription drugs as people in other high-income countries. This is largely due to price negotiations, as the U.S. lacks universal health care and a single negotiator for drug prices. The effectiveness of Trump's executive order is uncertain, and previous efforts have faced legal challenges. Experts say Congressional action and campaign finance reform are needed to truly change how drug prices are negotiated.</p>

In the current economic climate, borrowers should take the initiative to consolidate their debt, shop around for lenders to find the best rates, and determine the right approach, whether it's a DIY loan or using a debt relief company. It's also important to consider alternatives, such as a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan. (not investment advice)</p>
