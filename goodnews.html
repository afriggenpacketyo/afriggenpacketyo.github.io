          <p>Despite recent market volatility influenced by the Trump administration's tariff policies, investor portfolios have remained relatively stable. The S&P 500 experienced several days of significant declines, but its annualized return during Trump's second presidency remains positive at 1.58%. Experts advise investors to stay calm during market fluctuations, emphasizing that volatility does not necessarily indicate direction. Historical data shows that while some presidential terms have yielded higher returns, others have fared worse, highlighting the importance of long-term investment strategies.

          <p>General Motors plans to invest $4 billion in three U.S. assembly plants, shifting or expanding production of vehicles currently made in Mexico to American facilities. This decision comes amid President Trump's implementation of tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts from Mexico. The investment will include assembling the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox in the U.S., and converting an idled Michigan plant to produce gas-powered SUVs and trucks by 2027. This move is expected to increase GM's U.S. production capacity to over two million vehicles annually and is seen as a win for Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly apologized for some of his recent social media posts about President Trump, admitting they "went too far." The feud between Musk and Trump had previously dissolved a close partnership that saw Musk spearhead the budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The conflict was sparked by Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk claimed would undermine DOGE's work and increase the U.S. budget deficit. Trump had previously stated there would be consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates challenging the bill.</p>
