          <h2>Chinese Stock Market Rally Expected to Continue as Household Savings Shift to Equities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 02:30:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from the People's Bank of China indicates a sustained shift of household savings into mainland China's stock market, suggesting the current rally has further momentum. Deposits at non-banking financial institutions saw a substantial increase for a second consecutive month, driven by low-interest-rate policies that are diminishing returns from traditional bank deposits. This trend highlights a significant capital rotation towards equities, where the earnings yield of China's largest listed companies is notably more attractive than government bonds or demand deposit interest rates. Analysts believe this fundamental shift in investor behavior is setting the stage for continued investment in the capital market, indicating a potential prolonged period of growth.

It discusses how some have opted for secondary share sales to provide employee liquidity while keeping an eye on market conditions. The positive reception of recent fintech listings, including Klarna's, indicates a more welcoming environment on Wall Street, potentially encouraging these unicorns to pursue their own stock market debuts in the near future.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is reportedly considering a strategic initiative to convert its existing coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities, specifically utilizing advanced fourth-generation reactors. This proposal, put forth by the state-owned China Energy Engineering Group Co., Ltd (CEEC), offers a direct pathway to decarbonization while efficiently repurposing valuable infrastructure, particularly in coastal regions. With China possessing over 1.19 terawatts of coal-fired capacity and anticipating the retirement of approximately 100 gigawatts by 2030, this conversion plan represents a significant step towards meeting its environmental goals and enhancing energy sustainability, potentially improving site safety and public acceptance for nuclear energy.</p>

The U.K. faces a busy week with President Donald Trump's state visit and the Bank of England's policy meeting, though no rate cuts are anticipated from the latter. Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures remained stable following the Nasdaq's recent record high, fueled by hopes of Fed easing driven by weakening labor market data and contained inflation. Asia-Pacific markets also traded mixed, keeping a close eye on ongoing U.S.-China trade discussions in Madrid, which are addressing key economic and security issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK and US have established the "Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy," a landmark agreement aimed at accelerating nuclear power development in Britain. This partnership will streamline regulatory approvals, effectively halving the licensing period for new nuclear projects to approximately two years. Significant commercial deals include Centrica partnering with US firm X-energy to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, potentially creating 2,500 jobs. Other ventures involve developing nuclear-powered data centers and micro modular plants, with the broader goal of enhancing energy security, attracting AI investment, and eliminating reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028.</p>
