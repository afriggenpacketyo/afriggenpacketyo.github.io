          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 15:06:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of recent books, particularly Thea Riofrancos's "Extraction," highlights the significant paradox of the green energy transition: reducing fossil fuel reliance requires extensive mining for minerals like lithium and cobalt. This extraction often devastates local environments and disproportionately harms Indigenous and poor communities, leading to water contamination, displacement, and political upheaval. Riofrancos argues against this false choice, suggesting that reimagining societal structures, such as promoting mass transit over individual electric vehicles, could drastically reduce mineral demand and lead to a more just and sustainable future.</p>

          <p>A research team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate a submerged object they believe is Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The "visual anomaly," identified in satellite imagery from a lagoon on Nikumaroro, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. The team plans to use sonar and magnetometers to scan the object before attempting to dredge it for identification. If confirmed, the discovery would solve one of aviation's greatest mysteries and fulfill Earhart's plan to return the plane to the university.</p>

          <p>The remains of U.S. Navy Fireman 1st Class Edward D. Bowden, who was killed during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, have been identified after 84 years. Bowden was one of over 100 crew members who died aboard the USS California when it was sunk by Japanese forces. His remains were among those buried as unidentified at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Through modern DNA analysis and genome sequencing, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency successfully identified him, and he will be reburied at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>

          <p>Recent drops in mortgage interest rates are providing significant savings for homebuyers, particularly for substantial loans. For a $700,000 mortgage, the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.34% results in a monthly payment of approximately $4,351, which is about $273 less per month compared to the 6.93% rates seen in January. This decrease translates to over $3,200 in annual savings and nearly $100,000 in total interest saved over the life of the loan, making home financing more accessible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After struggling to conceive, Bay Area resident Marissa Chase was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common but often underdiagnosed cause of infertility affecting one in ten women. Her fertility specialist explained that many women with PCOS do not ovulate regularly, making natural conception difficult without treatment. After successful treatment led to the birth of her two children, Chase is now a vocal advocate for PCOS awareness. She encourages others facing similar challenges to seek medical help early and maintain hope on their path to parenthood.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year, narrowly beating analyst expectations. The rise in deliveries was partly driven by a rush of U.S. buyers seeking to take advantage of a federal EV tax credit that expired at the end of the quarter. Despite the delivery beat, the company's vehicle production declined slightly year-over-year, and its stock dipped following the report. The results reflect a partial recovery from a sales slump in Europe and ongoing competition. (not investment advice)</p>
