          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded the New York City Democratic mayoral primary to state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani after early results showed Mamdani with a significant lead. Cuomo, who resigned from the governorship in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations, acknowledged Mamdani's successful campaign and appeal to younger voters. Despite conceding, Cuomo indicated he might consider an independent run in the November general election on a "Fight and Deliver" ballot line. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, campaigned on a progressive platform focused on economic issues like rent freezes and fare-free buses.</p>

Witkoff condemned the leaking of an initial intelligence assessment suggesting limited impact as "treasonous," while reaffirming President Trump's assertion that the nuclear sites were "completely destroyed."</p>

          <p>The European Parliament, which has frequently clashed with China over issues like human rights and trade, is undertaking a reset of relations led by President Roberta Metsola. Metsola has been working to normalize relations with Beijing after four years of estrangement, as evidenced by previously unseen correspondence revealing efforts to re-establish constructive parliamentary relations. In a letter to the Chinese ambassador to the EU, Metsola expressed her belief that this is an opportune moment to reset relations between the European Parliament and the National People‚Äôs Congress.

          <p>Michael Conforto showed signs of life in the Dodgers' 9-7 win over the Colorado Rockies, hitting a double and a three-run home run. This was Conforto‚Äôs first multi-hit effort since May 27 and his first game all season with more than one RBI, giving the Dodgers some optimism about his potential contribution. Manager Dave Roberts noted that Conforto's struggles have stemmed from difficulty hitting fastballs, which he addressed in this game.
