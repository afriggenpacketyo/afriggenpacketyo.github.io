          <h2>US Mortgage Rates Remain High, Impacting Home Affordability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 03:21:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. remained steady at 6.76%, close to the year's highest levels but lower than the previous year, as reported by Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors like global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations about the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and increasing home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for prospective homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish start to the spring home-buying season. Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. have declined, marking the largest monthly drop since November 2022.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco's net profit for the first quarter decreased by 5% year-on-year, reaching $26 billion, due to reduced oil prices and production. The company's free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, reflecting ongoing financial pressures. Aramco announced a performance-linked dividend payout of $200 million for the quarter, while increasing its base dividend by 4.2% to $21.1 billion. These figures indicate continued strain on the Saudi state oil giant's balance sheet amid slowing global demand and trade pressures.</p>

          <p>Chinese energy investments in Africa are increasingly shifting towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. The report highlights that Africa has become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, with exports surging 153% from 2020 to 2024. This shift aligns with China's commitment to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas, and reflects Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
