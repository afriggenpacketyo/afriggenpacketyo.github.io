          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its decades-long armed conflict with Turkey, beginning a disarmament process with a ceremonial destruction of weapons. This move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and has been cautiously welcomed by the Turkish government as an opportunity for reconciliation. The success of the peace process hinges on concessions from Turkey, including potential legal reforms, amnesty for fighters, and the release of political prisoners. If successful, resolving this long-standing conflict could significantly improve Turkey's relations with its neighbors and its overall status in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Workers installing a water pipeline in the historic Old Town harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia, have discovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was found embedded in the seabed approximately 30 inches below the ocean floor. A marine archaeologist confirmed the ship dates to the late 18th century based on radiocarbon analysis, making it over 225 years old. The medieval city of Dubrovnik is famously known as a primary filming location for the HBO series "Game of Thrones." The remains of the vessel are now being protected for further examination by experts.</p>

The team will compete in USL League One, the third tier of professional soccer, and play at the recently restored Hinchliffe Stadium. Unlike past iterations, this version of the Cosmos aims to build a sustainable, multi-sport club with deep grassroots involvement, including a professional women's team and programs for other community activities. With former Italy international Giuseppe Rossi as Head of Soccer, the club is focused on creating affordable pathways for local talent.</p>

          <p>Amid a tough business climate in China, some luxury hotels are adopting unconventional strategies to survive, including selling budget-friendly street food. The five-star Zhongwu Hotel in Changzhou, for example, has started offering meal boxes prepared by its high-end catering team, with prices ranging from just 20 to 100 yuan (US$3 to US$14). This move represents a significant pivot from their usual expensive banquet services. The hotel's manager stated that the primary goal is to solve the immediate problem of survival by appealing to a broader consumer base with popular and affordable night market favorites.</p>

          <p>On the 40th anniversary of Live Aid, the monumental 1985 benefit concert is being remembered for its unprecedented global reach and fundraising success for famine relief in Ethiopia. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the event featured a star-studded lineup and was broadcast to nearly 2 billion people worldwide. However, the concert is also being re-examined through a modern lens, facing criticism for its lack of African performers and female artists, which some argue reinforced a "white savior" narrative. Despite the controversy, Geldof maintains the event successfully placed a critical humanitarian issue on the global political agenda through the power of music.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A campaign in the United Kingdom is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English rather than the currently required Latin-based scientific names. Proponents, including MP Becky Gittins who has a severe nut allergy, argue that the Latin nomenclature puts consumers at risk because the terms are not widely understood. Parents of children with severe allergies have shared stories of adverse reactions caused by unknowingly using products with allergens listed under their Latin names, such as 'Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis' for sweet almond oil. The industry's trade association defends the current system, stating that it provides a globally harmonized and consistent language for ingredients.</p>

During one sequence, LeBron instructed Bronny to be more aggressive and get downhill, which Bronny immediately followed with a driving layup on the next play. The performance showcased the younger James's potential and the unique dynamic of having one of the sport's all-time greats as a father and mentor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to fears that China's new mega-dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet could cause droughts in India, a new scientific study suggests it might have the opposite effect. Researchers analyzed data from two existing large dams upstream and found they significantly increased water flow during the dry season. The data, measured downstream since 2014, showed that low flows in February were up by more than 50 percent. This indicates that the massive new dam, rather than withholding water, could potentially regulate the river's flow and provide more water to downstream nations like India during their driest months.</p>
