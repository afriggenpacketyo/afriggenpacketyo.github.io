          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its recent quarter, reporting a modest sales recovery with comparable sales rising 1.6%, the highest growth in three years. CEO Corie Barry expressed confidence for the latter half of the year, trending towards the higher end of sales projections. However, the retailer maintained its full-year forecast due to ongoing uncertainty regarding potential tariff impacts on consumers and the business, which could lead to a slowdown in the third quarter. The company is actively navigating challenges like higher interest rates and cautious consumer spending, while also launching a third-party marketplace to spur growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3.3% annualized rate in the second quarter, an upward revision from the initial 3.0% estimate and exceeding Dow Jones consensus forecasts. This stronger-than-expected growth was significantly boosted by robust consumer spending, which rose by 1.6%, and a key measure of final sales to private domestic purchasers that jumped 1.9%. The data also reflected the unusual impact of tariffs, with a sharp decline in imports contributing nearly five percentage points to the GDP increase. Despite this rebound, experts anticipate the economy will likely maintain a slower growth pace around 1.5% in the coming quarters due to increasing tariff visibility for consumers.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article advocates for the Trump administration to prioritize diplomatic efforts and demand-side solutions over unilateral military force in combating the drug war, particularly the fentanyl crisis. It emphasizes that existing cooperation with Mexico, including extraditions and drone surveillance, is more effective and carries fewer diplomatic risks than military intervention. The analysis argues that historical supply-side strategies, even with significant investment like Plan Colombia, have largely failed to stem drug flow, especially for lab-made fentanyl. Instead, the piece suggests focusing on harm reduction programs, citing encouraging national trends of decreasing overdose deaths as a sign of progress.</p>

          <p>England's Women's Rugby World Cup team has made 13 changes to its starting lineup for the upcoming match against Samoa, with former captain Marlie Packer taking over as skipper. Coach John Mitchell opted to rest regular starters, aiming to provide game time for the entire squad across the initial pool matches. Despite these extensive changes, including the return of Helena Rowland and Claudia Moloney-MacDonald from injury, England, currently on an impressive 28-game winning streak, is widely expected to secure a bonus-point victory. This strategic rotation allows the team to build on their strong opening performance while preparing for the later stages of the tournament.</p>

          <p>The U.S. banking industry is experiencing significant consolidation, with the number of FDIC-insured banks decreasing by nearly half since 2005 due to large institutions acquiring regional and community banks. In stark contrast, Canada's banking system, one of the most concentrated in G7 countries with only 79 banks, was lauded as the soundest globally during the 2008 financial crisis. Experts attribute Canada's stability to the collective economic strength of its major players. However, former FDIC chair Sheila Bair cautions that market domination can stifle competition and innovation, a concern amplified by recent proposals to lower capital requirements for big U.S. banks.

While the original satirized materialistic baby boomers, this version focuses on the relatable dissolution of a relationship due to career pressures and petty jealousies.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The Origin of Language" by Madeleine Beekman, proposes a theory that places the demands of early human child-rearing at the core of language development. Challenging traditional male-dominated evolutionary theories, Beekman argues that the profound vulnerability of early human infants necessitated enhanced cooperation and communication among caregivers. She connects biological changes, such as elongated vocal cords and larger brains, to the urgent need for parents to verbally express needs and coordinate assistance for their immature offspring. This perspective suggests language evolved incrementally as a crucial survival mechanism, fostering shared understanding and significantly increasing the likelihood of both infant and species survival.</p>

          <p>New York City is marking its 400th birthday this year, a significant historical milestone that has largely gone uncelebrated and unnoticed by its residents. Despite Mayor Eric Adams' earlier promise of a year-long celebration, a Columbia University history professor notes that few events have actually materialized. The article suggests this striking lack of fanfare is both "sad" and "somewhat inspiring," prompting a broader reflection on the foundational elements that have historically contributed to the city's greatness. This observation highlights a unique cultural phenomenon where a major urban center's profound historical significance is overlooked in its fast-paced contemporary existence.</p>

This impending shift will fundamentally upend the established economics of college sports, moving away from the long-standing amateurism model.

The piece suggests that Beijing's actions abroad are primarily driven by risk management for regime survival, particularly concerning slowing economic growth, the impact of semiconductor export controls, and critical energy reliance.
