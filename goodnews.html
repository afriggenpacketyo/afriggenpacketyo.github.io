          <p>Alexis Roderick Joel, wife of musician Billy Joel, conveyed appreciation for the outpouring of support following Joel's recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. She noted the family's gratitude for the prompt diagnosis and care received. Joel, 76, has canceled concert dates through July 2026 to undergo physical therapy and focus on recovery, as advised by his doctors. NPH is characterized by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, and while relatively uncommon, it is more prevalent in older individuals, and is typically treated with a shunt to drain the fluid.</p>

          <p>Cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, first identified in China, have been reported in the United States, raising concerns about transmissibility and vaccine effectiveness.

The Trump administration's plan to limit booster vaccine access to specific groups, such as seniors and those with underlying conditions, has sparked controversy. Experts warn these restrictions could create confusion and reduce vaccination rates, highlighting the importance of continued preventative measures like mask-wearing and good hygiene.</p>

This decision followed discussions between Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who agreed to expedite trade negotiations. The EU's offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods remains on the table, while retaliatory tariffs on US goods are suspended until July 14. Trump's initial announcement of a 20% levy on EU goods was later reduced to 10% before being increased to 50% and then delayed, causing uncertainty for businesses.</p>

          <p>Democrats are reportedly moving away from using jargon and phrases associated with progressive activism to regain support from voters who previously switched to the Republican Party and elected Donald Trump. Some party members have said that terms like "Latinx" and an emphasis on issues such as pronouns have alienated some voters. Leaders are now advocating for simpler language and a focus on issues that resonate more broadly with the electorate, such as education and economic opportunity.</p>

          <p>Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar walked from Budapest to northwestern Romania in an effort to garner support from ethnic Hungarians living there. Magyar hopes to gain the support of the ethnic Hungarians for a future election victory. Magyar's success has been attributed to his criticisms of corruption and the poor state of the country's public infrastructure. Orban's backing of a pro-Russian candidate in Romania's recent election put him at odds with the leadership of the UDMR, the political party of Romania's Hungarian minority.</p>
