          <p>A two-minute communications outage at the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center caused pilots flying into Denver International Airport to lose contact with air traffic controllers. The FAA confirmed that multiple radio transmitter failures led to the incident, during which controllers switched to an emergency frequency to communicate with aircraft. The event is under investigation, adding to scrutiny of the FAA following recent communication and radar outages, near collisions, and staffing shortages. The article highlights concerns raised by lawmakers about the agency's safety and infrastructure, particularly in light of previous incidents and the lack of a permanent FAA head.</p>

          <p>Cava, a Mediterranean restaurant chain, reported better-than-expected sales and same-store sales growth of 10.8%, defying the broader restaurant industry's challenges. The company attributed its success to increased traffic and premium purchases, with diners trading up from fast food and down from casual dining. Despite its strong performance, Cava maintained its conservative same-store sales forecast of 6% to 8% for the fiscal year, but it did raise its adjusted EBITDA projections and plans to open more new locations. This financial success indicates Cava's resilience in a challenging economic climate.</p>

This clarity has made Toronto a hub for blockchain growth, attracting interest from Wall Street firms. Robinhood's acquisition of Canadian crypto firm WonderFi and Galaxy Digital's listing in Canada highlight the country's appeal. The article suggests that the United States is shifting its regulatory approach under President Trump, with the FDIC and Federal Reserve easing restrictions on banks handling crypto, and the SEC rescinding its restrictive accounting bulletin.

He removed his shoes, as customary, and praised the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque's beauty and culture. The visit underscores Trump's close ties with the UAE, built partly on the UAE's decision to normalize relations with Israel during his first term. This event contrasts with his earlier rhetoric during his 2016 campaign, where he suggested mosques should be under surveillance, as the Muslim community helped deliver Michigan to him in the November election.</p>

          <p>A House Republican bill proposes to increase the child tax credit, making the $2,000 credit permanent and raising the cap to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. However, the plan has been criticized for excluding low-income families and imposing restrictions on eligibility. The bill requires both parents to have a Social Security number if filing jointly, which could exclude millions of U.S. citizens and lawfully present children from receiving the credit. While middle-income families currently benefit the most from the existing credit, this new proposal does little for the neediest families.</p>

Several justices expressed skepticism about the legality of Trump‚Äôs order, with Justice Sotomayor stating it violated established Supreme Court precedents.

          <h2>Supreme Court Considers Challenges to Birthright Citizenship Order</h2>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding challenges to President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, specifically focusing on the ability of individual judges to issue nationwide injunctions. The case does not directly address the constitutionality of the order but rather the scope of judicial power. Justices questioned the historical basis for nationwide injunctions and the practical implications of limiting their use. The debate centered on balancing the need for consistent application of laws with concerns about judicial overreach and the potential for unlawful policies to remain in effect during litigation.</p>

          <h2>Belgian Parliament Abandons Nuclear Phaseout Plan</h2>

          <p>Belgium's parliament has voted to scrap its planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a decision adopted over two decades ago. The motion passed with a significant majority, paving the way for a more realistic and resilient energy model, according to Energy Minister Mathieu Bihet. The move comes after Belgium previously delayed the phaseout by 10 years due to energy uncertainty caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. This decision reflects a broader trend in Europe, with countries like the Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy considering or planning to build new nuclear plants.</p>
