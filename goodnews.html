          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 18:46:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally filed a motion to unseal grand jury records related to the federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein. This action follows a directive from President Trump and comes amid significant public and political pressure for greater transparency in the high-profile case. The filing states that while the DOJ stands by its previous conclusions, releasing the transcripts serves the public interest, subject to redactions to protect victim identities. This move occurs as President Trump also engages in a public dispute with the Wall Street Journal over its reporting on his alleged connections to Epstein.</p>

          <p>The United States and El Salvador have successfully negotiated a prisoner exchange with Venezuela, securing the release of 10 detained American citizens. In return, El Salvador repatriated approximately 250 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. and incarcerated in El Salvador's high-security CECOT prison. A senior U.S. administration official confirmed that with this exchange, no American nationals remain in Venezuelan custody. The complex deal highlights the warming relations between U.S. President Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who was instrumental in facilitating the agreement.</p>

          <p>Spanish director Albert Serra's first documentary, "Afternoons of Solitude," offers a powerful and unsparing look into the world of bullfighting, focusing on Peruvian star matador Andrés Roca Rey. The film immerses the viewer in the sport's ornate rituals and gruesome realities without judgment or explanation, forcing an honest confrontation with the spectacle. Using long takes and a minimalist style, Serra captures both the palpable danger for the matador and the inescapable, violent destiny of the bull. The article praises the film as a spellbinding and honest work that intertwines meditation and obscenity to explore a controversial tradition.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent six-day visit to China, which included meetings with Premier Li Qiang, is being interpreted as a sign of Canberra's evolving diplomatic strategy. The trip, which included a CEO roundtable and visits to Shanghai and Chengdu, demonstrates Australia's effort to stabilize its relationship with Beijing after a period of tension. According to analysts, this diplomatic engagement shows a "stiffening of Canberra's spine" as it navigates the complex rivalry between its key security ally, the United States, and its largest trading partner, China, reflecting a common challenge for nations in the region.</p>

          <p>After falling behind competitors like OpenAI and Google in the generative AI race, Meta is restructuring its efforts by creating a new division called Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been personally recruiting top researchers with massive compensation packages to join the new lab, which aims to build "personal superintelligence for everyone." This represents a significant strategic pivot for the company, which once led in AI research but struggled to translate its work into competitive consumer products. The move signals a high-stakes attempt to regain a leading position in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Shares of Block, the fintech company founded by Jack Dorsey and formerly known as Square, surged more than 10% in extended trading after it was announced that it will join the S&P 500 index.

Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index funds and other portfolio managers must purchase the shares to rebalance their holdings. The move adds another major technology-focused company to the benchmark U.S. stock index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has revised its internal practices to ensure that its engineers based in China will no longer provide technical support for the company's U.S. Department of Defense cloud clients. The change was announced in response to national security concerns highlighted in a recent ProPublica report, which detailed the Pentagon's reliance on Chinese engineers managed by U.S.-based "digital escorts." The move impacts Microsoft's Azure cloud services division, a significant source of the company's revenue, and is intended to mitigate potential cybersecurity risks associated with having foreign nationals supporting sensitive government contracts.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly high among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission continues to be viewed positively, with a large majority believing it was a worthwhile endeavor. The poll also indicates that most Americans feel the U.S. space program contributes to national pride and, to some extent, produces technological advancements that benefit society as a whole.</p>

          <p>The stock price of online real estate company Opendoor skyrocketed 189% in one week, largely driven by social media posts from hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, whose firm EMJ Capital had nearly shut down, announced he had taken a new position in the struggling stock, predicting it could be a "100-bagger." His cheerleading ignited a massive rally in the cash-burning company, which had been trading below $1.

          <p>Amid recent violence in Syria, this article provides a brief overview of the Druze, a religious sect that originated about 1,000 years ago as an offshoot of Ismaili Shiite Islam. With a global population of roughly one million, the majority of Druze live in Syria, with other significant communities in Lebanon and Israel. Their religious practices are largely secret, conversion is not permitted, and intermarriage is strongly discouraged. A core tenet of their social doctrine is the defense of fellow Druze, fostering a tight-knit community that has historically navigated complex political landscapes to ensure its survival.</p>
