          <p>Decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a massive statue of Robert E. Lee, have been melted down and transformed into art pieces for a new Los Angeles exhibition titled "Monuments." Curator Hamza Walker spent eight years acquiring the statues, which once sparked nationwide protests due to their association with white supremacy and slavery. The exhibit, opening October 23, displays these reimagined pieces alongside contemporary art, challenging historical narratives, particularly as President Trump advocates for reinstalling such monuments. This artistic transformation aims to purify a toxic representation of history.</p>

          <p>Hollywood actor Cate Blanchett is actively involved with Kew's Millennium Seed Bank (MSB), which is celebrating its 25th anniversary. The MSB stores over 2.5 billion seeds from 40,000 wild plant species globally, initially conceived as a "doomsday vault" but now focused on environmental restoration. Blanchett, an ambassador for Wakehurst, emphasizes the importance of this "insurance policy" against plant extinction, especially after events like the Australian wildfires. The project utilizes these seeds to restore threatened habitats worldwide, including chalk grasslands and tropical forests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are poised for a mostly higher open as investors await a series of economic data releases from China. Analysts project China's third-quarter GDP growth to slow to 4.8% year-on-year, a decrease from the previous quarter's 5.2%. Futures for Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index indicate stronger opens, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 opened slightly lower. This regional anticipation follows a positive close for major U.S. averages, influenced by a softening U.S. stance on trade talks with China and a recovery from earlier credit concerns.

          <p>The global secondhand luxury market is experiencing rapid growth, expanding three times faster than the firsthand market and projected to reach $360 billion by 2030. As counterfeit items become increasingly sophisticated, robust authentication processes are now paramount for resale platforms. Companies like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in proprietary verification systems, combining visual inspections, scientific equipment, and AI to combat "superfakes" and build consumer trust. This focus on authenticity is driving significant business growth in the luxury resale sector, attracting a new wave of consumers, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, who prioritize affordability and access to rare items.</p>

          <h2>Judge Orders X's Antitrust Lawsuit Against Apple and OpenAI to Remain in Fort Worth</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI must stay in Fort Worth, Texas, despite the companies having minimal connections to the area. In a sharply ironic order, Judge Mark Pittman encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, even flagging the city's business services website. This decision implicitly criticizes the practice of "forum-shopping" by some plaintiffs seeking favorable rulings from specific judicial districts. The lawsuit alleges an anticompetitive scheme by Apple and OpenAI in AI markets, with X accusing Apple of favoring ChatGPT over competitors like xAI's Grok.</p>

          <p>Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, President Trump's son-in-law and a close friend, successfully brokered an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage exchange using unconventional real estate deal-making tactics. Their efforts faced a major challenge when Israel bombed Hamas leadership in Qatar, killing the son of a top negotiator, which almost derailed talks. President Trump intervened, securing an apology from Netanyahu and introducing a peace plan that shifted the dynamic. The duo then met directly with Hamas, a break from diplomatic protocol, to offer assurances, culminating in a deal that secured the release of hostages and aims to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming Five Year Plan, to be decided by its top leaders, will outline the nation's goals for 2026-2030, building on a history of plans that have significantly reshaped the world. Past plans, like Deng Xiaoping's "reform and opening up" in the 1980s, transformed China into an economic powerhouse and led to "the China shock" in Western manufacturing. More recently, focus on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology (EVs, solar) and "high quality development" has positioned China as a leader in renewables and AI, challenging American technological dominance and sparking diplomatic disputes over export controls.</p>

          <p>Lakers center Jaxson Hayes sustained a minor wrist sprain during a preseason game but is expected to be ready for the regular-season opener. Hayes, who has developed strong chemistry with teammate Luka Doncic, is now being recruited to join the Slovenian national team and is actively pursuing a Slovenian passport. This opportunity arose from his growing on-court connection with Doncic and his desire to play on the international stage, as USA Basketball does not hold open tryouts. The team is also adjusting to Doncic's passing style, aiming to improve assist opportunities.</p>

Ministers also intend to reduce GCSE English and maths resits by offering an alternative qualification. While the Sixth Form Colleges Association expresses concern about V-levels filling the gap left by BTecs, the initiative seeks to provide clearer pathways for students, potentially allowing a mix-and-match approach with A-levels.</p>

Qian emphasizes that the US-China rivalry extends beyond trade into technology and ideology, urging for healthier competition.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that in today's multipolar world, great powers must choose between rigid alliances leading to conflict or managed accommodation, drawing lessons from Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai's diplomacy. It highlights that nuclear weapons make total war irrational, and technological interdependence creates immense costs for systemic rupture, compelling nations towards cooperation. The article suggests that despite current great power competition, powerful domestic constituencies in major economies have a strong interest in avoiding breakdown. The question remains whether contemporary leaders will demonstrate the statecraft needed to prevent catastrophic confrontation.</p>
