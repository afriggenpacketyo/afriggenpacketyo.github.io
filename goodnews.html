He shared a personal account from his time managing in Major League Soccer where a player was racially abused, highlighting the profound impact such incidents have. Rooney's call to action follows a recent event where a Premier League player reported being racially abused by a spectator. He suggests that sanctions like point deductions or significant fines are necessary to compel clubs to address the issue effectively.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur's club captain, Cristian Romero, has signed a new four-year contract, securing his position with the North London team until 2029. The 27-year-old Argentinian defender has been a key player since joining from Atalanta in 2021, making 126 appearances and recently captaining the side to a Europa League victory. This new deal puts an end to summer transfer speculation linking him to other clubs. The agreement follows a similar long-term contract extension for right-back Djed Spence, signaling the club's intent to retain its core players.</p>

Dr. Laura Jacob initiated the program after learning that the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra used plastic instruments, addressing the high cost of renting traditional violins. For just $50 per instrument, the district has produced over 200 violins, offering them for free and fostering a love for music. The innovative program has boosted students' confidence and engagement in school.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising savers on how to approach investing in certificates of deposit (CDs) during the current economic climate. While CD rates are still solid, the decision on how much money to deposit depends on an individual's overall financial situation, including their emergency savings and liquidity needs. Experts suggest considering the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year, which would lower CD returns. Strategies like CD laddering, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with different maturity dates, are recommended to maintain flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investment firm Evercore ISI has issued a short-term negative call on cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, citing concerns about its high valuation combined with subdued channel checks ahead of its earnings report. Historically, CrowdStrike's stock has seen post-earnings pullbacks, which some investors view as buying opportunities. Meanwhile, industry peer Palo Alto Networks is also set to report its earnings, with investors closely watching to see if the company can buck the trend of a mixed earnings season for cybersecurity stocks and justify its recent major acquisition of CyberArk.

          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems to resolve a defamation lawsuit over false claims made about the 2020 presidential election. The settlement was reached before a trial could take place, following a judge's ruling that Newsmax had indeed defamed the voting equipment company. This follows a similar, larger settlement where Fox News paid $787.5 million to Dominion for airing baseless conspiracy theories about its voting machines. Internal documents revealed that Newsmax officials knew the election fraud claims were false while promoting them.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The two-stage plan reportedly involves the release of approximately half of the remaining Israeli hostages during a 60-day temporary truce. During this period, negotiations would continue toward a permanent ceasefire and a complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. There has been no immediate official comment from Israel on this development, which comes amid ongoing conflict and previous stalled negotiations.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Zelenskyy visits Washington, an analysis of international support shows that European nations combined have committed more aid to Ukraine than the United States. According to data from the Germany-based Kiel Institute, Europe as a whole has allocated $165.7 billion, compared to the U.S. contribution of $130.6 billion since Russia's 2022 invasion. While the U.S. remains the largest single-country donor, the figures counter claims that Europe is not contributing its fair share. The aid from both sides consists of a mix of direct grants and loans.</p>

The Hermes 2 reactor will connect to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid, with the TVA agreeing to purchase up to 50 megawatts of its power. This electricity will help supply Google's regional data centers with reliable, carbon-free energy. The collaboration is a significant step toward commercializing smaller, advanced nuclear reactors in the U.S., with Google and Kairos bearing the financial risk of construction.</p>
