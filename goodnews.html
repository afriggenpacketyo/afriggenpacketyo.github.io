          <p>At a White House event with President Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk deflected a question from a Fox News reporter regarding a New York Times article detailing his alleged drug use and family legal issues. Musk questioned the credibility of the Times, referencing a ruling against the publication regarding reporting on Russia-gate. The New York Times had reported on Musk's alleged consumption of ketamine, Ecstasy, and psychedelic mushrooms. Musk avoided directly addressing the allegations and instead criticized the publication's past reporting. </p>

          <p>Joe Flacco's candid remarks about not wanting to mentor younger quarterbacks on the Cleveland Browns have sparked controversy, drawing criticism from former Baltimore Ravens teammate Chris Canty. Flacco, the oldest of five quarterbacks on the Browns, stated he is focused on playing football rather than mentoring Deshaun Watson, Shedeur Sanders, and Kenny Pickett. Canty argued that mentoring benefits the team by improving younger players, emphasizing the importance of sharing knowledge and experience within the quarterback room. Flacco previously won the AP Comeback Player of the Year Award with the Browns after a successful stint in 2023. </p>
