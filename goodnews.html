          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House, former President Donald Trump announced he has initiated arrangements for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy. The goal is to facilitate direct negotiations to end the nearly four-year-long war, with Trump intending to join for trilateral talks afterward. This development represents a potential, albeit early, step toward a diplomatic resolution after previous attempts to bring the two leaders together were unsuccessful. The Kremlin acknowledged the call but did not confirm a direct Putin-Zelenskyy meeting.</p>

          <p>Leeds United celebrated their return to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over Everton, driven by a contentious late penalty converted by Lukas Nmecha. The match at Elland Road was marked by an intense and hostile atmosphere, which Leeds leveraged to dominate the first half, though without scoring. Everton, described as passive and panicky, offered little threat throughout the game. The win provides a crucial surge of belief for Leeds, making them one of two newly-promoted sides to win their opening game, a rare feat in Premier League history.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, is actively lobbying for the NFL to host a Super Bowl in Britain. Mandelson stated he has made a "big pitch" for the event, expressing a strong desire for the first Super Bowl outside the U.S. to take place in the UK. This sentiment is shared by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who also advocates for hosting the game to solidify London's status as a global sports capital. The NFL has held regular-season games in London since 2007, but the Super Bowl has never been played outside of the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill requiring mortgage lenders to pay homeowners at least 2% interest on insurance payouts held in escrow accounts following natural disasters. Previously, lenders could deposit these funds, intended for rebuilding, into an account and keep the accrued interest, which could be significant over the months or years it takes to rebuild. The new legislation, authored by Assemblymember John Harabedian and sponsored by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to close this loophole and provide additional financial support to homeowners during their recovery process. The bill now awaits the governor's signature to become law.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has informed the BBC that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a framework that would involve Hamas releasing about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for an initial 60-day truce, during which negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would occur. It remains uncertain how Israel will respond, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously stated that all hostages must be released at once. The development comes as the Israeli military intensifies its operations in Gaza City.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Debt Forgiveness Eligibility for 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Plans</h2>

          <p>An article examines whether debt from 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay can be included in debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, BNPL plans are technically eligible for settlement, similar to credit card debt. However, because the industry is relatively new, not all providers may be willing to negotiate, and debt relief companies may lack established relationships with them. The article suggests that while debt forgiveness is a possibility, consumers struggling with BNPL payments should also consider direct negotiation with the provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling as alternative strategies.</p>

          <p>Key takeaways from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's meeting with former President Donald Trump include a notable shift in Zelenskyy's approach, marked by a more collegial tone and formal attire compared to a previous acrimonious visit. During the talks, Trump hinted at providing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal, though specifics remain undefined. The possibility of a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Vladimir Putin was also a central topic. The meeting, attended by several European leaders, underscored the complex diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.</p>
