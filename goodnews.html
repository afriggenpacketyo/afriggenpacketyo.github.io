          <p>Artificial intelligence data center provider CoreWeave announced plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds due in 2031, with the capital intended for general corporate purposes and debt repayment. The company, a key partner for Nvidia and Microsoft, has seen its stock price more than triple since its Nasdaq debut in March. This move follows a highly successful $2 billion debt offering in May that was reportedly five times oversubscribed. Despite some investor concerns about its debt levels, CoreWeave's CEO maintains that the company is successfully meeting significant client demand.</p>

          <p>During a recent concert, Coldplay's Chris Martin humorously warned the audience they might be put on the big screen, a subtle reference to a recent viral incident. The joke follows a controversial "Kiss Cam" moment at a previous show where Astronomer CEO Andy Byron was filmed with his company's HR chief, leading to speculation of an affair. The company launched a formal investigation, and Byron has since resigned. The incident sparked widespread online discussion about privacy and workplace conduct, with Martin's lighthearted comment marking the band's first public acknowledgment.</p>

          <p>The All England Club's plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis grounds can move forward after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group. The expansion, approved by the Greater London Authority, includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on the site of a former golf club. The campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful as it was on protected land. The judge ruled the decision was a rational planning judgment, allowing the club to proceed with the project.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece challenges the Silicon Valley belief that the development of human-level artificial intelligence (AGI) is inevitable and that society cannot alter its course. The author argues that technology is a product of human choices, not an unstoppable force of nature. Citing historical examples like the regulation of recombinant DNA, the non-cloning of humans, and nuclear disarmament efforts, the article suggests that society has the agency to restrain potentially dangerous technologies. It calls for a civilization-scale effort to compel governments to resist a blind race toward AGI, which many experts believe poses existential risks.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines will officially end its long-standing open seating policy on January 27, with tickets for assigned seats going on sale July 29. This major shift is part of a broader business model overhaul aimed at generating new revenue to compete with more profitable rivals. The new system will feature eight boarding groups determined by seat selection, loyalty status, and fare type, replacing the current A-B-C boarding process. The airline is also reconfiguring its planes to include extra-legroom seats, signaling a fundamental change for the carrier's customer experience.</p>

          <p>As many high-rate certificates of deposit (CDs) from 2023-2024 begin to mature, financial experts are advising savers on common mistakes to avoid. They warn against automatically renewing CDs, as renewal rates are often much lower than the initial promotional offers. Experts also caution against chasing the highest rate without considering the term length, which could lock up funds needed for other goals. Instead, they recommend reevaluating financial goals and comparing all available options, including high-yield savings accounts, to ensure money remains both productive and accessible.

          <p>Leadership expert Jennifer Schielke argues that bosses who use excessive flattery to be liked by their employees are employing a flawed and ineffective tactic. She suggests that insincere compliments can appear manipulative and often stem from a leader's own insecurity rather than genuine appreciation. Instead of flattery, Schielke recommends building authentic connections through team-building exercises and demonstrating value by listening to employees' needs and perspectives. True leadership, she says, involves investing in employees and addressing difficult issues directly, not winning a popularity contest through empty praise.</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike firms that simply hold cryptocurrency, this company plans to generate yield by staking its ether holdings, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's security. The firm's founders argue this makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin and that current ether ETFs do not offer this yield-generating capability. The company follows a growing trend of entities creating ether-focused treasury strategies for public investors. (not investment advice)</p>

Although she disagrees with the delivery, she is thankful for the feedback, which she says she needed to hear to grow into a leadership role. Mallick now advocates for practicing public speaking like a sport and emphasizes that having an impact is more important than being the loudest voice.</p>

          <p>A new JPMorgan Chase Institute study reveals a growing trend of Americans shifting money from standard checking and savings accounts to vehicles like brokerage accounts and money market funds. This shift helps explain strong consumer spending despite low growth in traditional cash balances. The analysis of 4.7 million households found that total cash reserves are actually increasing when these investment accounts are included. The trend is observed across various income levels, suggesting people are actively seeking higher returns in the current interest rate environment to manage their cash. (not investment advice)</p>
