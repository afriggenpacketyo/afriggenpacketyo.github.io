          <p>A vote on a megabill intended to advance President Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners. Representatives Clyde, Brecheen, Smucker, Norman, and Roy voted against the bill, citing concerns that the bulk of savings would not take effect until after Trump leaves office. This setback poses a challenge for Speaker Mike Johnson, who is working to unify the factions within his conference. House Republican leaders plan to continue negotiations, aiming for a potential House vote before the Memorial Day recess.</p>

          <p>HELOC interest rates have experienced fluctuations in 2025, initially declining to an 18-month low in January before slightly increasing in recent months. Despite these recent increases, HELOCs remain a relatively affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans and credit cards. Homeowners should consider the potential for volatility when borrowing with a HELOC, as rates can change monthly. A HELOC could be a good option for those who need additional financing and are comfortable with variable interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
