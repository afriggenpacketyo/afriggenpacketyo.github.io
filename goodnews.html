          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is advancing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The project, part of a larger $19 billion airport overhaul, will create JFK's largest terminal, dedicated solely to international travel and designed to be flooded with natural light. When fully completed in 2030, the terminal will feature 23 gates, extensive retail and dining space, and its own resilient microgrid. The development is a key part of nationwide efforts to modernize aging airport infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering a compensation scheme that could cost up to £18 billion for drivers affected by the mis-selling of car loans. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively large commissions could render a loan agreement unfair. The FCA will now consult on the details of a payout scheme to address these unfair practices, with most eligible individuals potentially receiving under £950. The regulator stated the court's decision provides needed clarity on what constitutes an unfair relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

The study, conducted by HR technology firm Checkr, ranked the 100 largest cities based on factors like unemployment rates, income growth, and labor force size. Researchers noted that the geography of opportunity is shifting away from traditional coastal megacities. These rising hubs offer robust job markets in sectors like tech, healthcare, and finance, often combined with a more affordable cost of living. (not investment advice)</p>

While the exact number is unclear, reports suggest up to 300 children could be evacuated, each accompanied by a guardian. This official initiative follows criticism from a Foreign Affairs Committee report and the efforts of private charities like Project Pure Hope, which have already brought a few children to the UK. The move comes as the UN reports over 50,000 children have been killed or injured in the conflict.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across the region, including parts of New York City and its suburbs. The tremor occurred Saturday night and is the second seismic event to strike the state in less than two weeks. While no immediate damage was reported, officials have warned of possible aftershocks. This event follows a 4.8 magnitude quake in April 2024 that was felt by millions. Geologists note that New Jersey sits on the Ramapo Fault line, which produces several small, usually unfelt, quakes annually.</p>

          <p>The FIRE movement, which stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early, is inspiring a growing number of people to pursue extreme savings and frugal living to exit the workforce decades ahead of schedule. Proponents advocate for saving a significant portion of their income and investing it, with the goal of accumulating 25 times their annual expenses. The philosophy, popularized by bloggers and authors like Vicki Robin, emphasizes redefining one's relationship with money to prioritize life experiences over material possessions. Adherents see frugality as a tool to buy freedom and time for personal pursuits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, revealed he does not know his exact net worth and instead focuses on building a portfolio of investments and relationships that he can be proud of. Financial planners say this mindset is healthy, as it prioritizes purpose over a numerical target. Experts suggest that focusing on daily cash flow and tangible financial goals, like paying off debt or saving for a specific purpose, is more empowering than obsessing over net worth. This approach helps align financial decisions with personal values and a desired lifestyle.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has stalled on releasing documents from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, several ongoing legal cases could force crucial information into the public domain. A public records lawsuit filed by a news website is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's refusal to release thousands of pages from its Epstein file. Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to reconsider unsealing more documents from a civil case involving an Epstein accuser. These legal battles may succeed in bringing transparency where political pressure has so far failed.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully developed a new type of cryogenic steel, CHSN01, designed to withstand the extreme conditions inside a nuclear fusion reactor. The material must endure both the near-absolute zero temperatures and immense magnetic forces required to contain the fusion reaction. This breakthrough solves a critical materials challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, where previous materials proved too brittle. The development, which took a decade, places China in a leading position in a key area of materials science for future energy.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old CEO of design software company Figma, has joined the ranks of tech billionaires following his company's successful IPO. Field, a former Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Brown University to start the company, saw Figma's valuation soar to over $71 billion after its stock tripled on the first day of trading. The journey included turning down a $20 billion acquisition offer from Adobe after it faced regulatory hurdles. Now, as an independent company, Figma is focused on integrating AI into its collaborative design tools to maintain its market dominance.</p>
