They avoid high-rent spaces, run multiple operations out of shared spaces, and work the room in person to improve their odds of success.

Despite its flaws, ‚ÄúSmart Girls‚Äù highlights Wilson‚Äôs openness to rap and his willingness to enlist expert help from Matt Dike. Wilson's experimentation with various musical styles has resulted in some of the greatest pieces of music, even if ‚ÄúSmart Girls‚Äù is not among them. </p>
