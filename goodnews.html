          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 08:06:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. stock market has demonstrated surprising resilience, largely ignoring recent weak economic data, including slowing job growth and reduced GDP figures. Analysts suggest this stability is driven by strong corporate earnings from major tech companies and investor optimism about potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Despite concerns about a potential recession and the economic condition known as "stagflation," the market's current mindset appears to favor risk-taking in pursuit of immediate rewards over caution about future headwinds.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump to announce a $600 billion investment in the U.S. over four years, a move seen as appeasing the administration without committing to manufacturing iPhones domestically. The plan involves expanding partnerships with long-term American suppliers like Corning for glass and Coherent for sensor components. This strategy successfully garnered praise from Trump and an exemption for Apple from a new tariff on chips, boosting its stock price. Analysts view the announcement as a savvy political maneuver to avoid tariffs, rather than a fundamental shift in Apple's production strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal essay for the L.A. Times, a woman recounts the evolution of her relationship with her partner, who initially stated he never wanted to marry again after a previous divorce. Feeling that marriage was a dealbreaker for her, she ended the relationship, only for him to return the next day, admitting he hadn't considered remarriage until she raised the issue. He promised they would marry someday, a commitment that was enough for her. The couple eventually married after she enrolled in graduate school, and they remain happily together, reflecting on how their journey began with a difficult conversation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 07:39:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's historical four-year price cycle, traditionally centered around its "halving" event, is showing signs of breaking down due to changing market dynamics. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has introduced significant institutional investment, altering predictable patterns by causing a price surge before the last halving, rather than after. Experts suggest that a more supportive regulatory environment and increased accumulation by long-term holders are replacing the old cycle with more stable, macro-correlated behavior. This shift could mean that the era of severe 70-80% price crashes may be over. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Astoria Portfolio Advisors is set to launch a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to help investors manage large tax liabilities from significantly appreciated stock positions. The Astoria U.S. Enhanced Core Equity ETF (LCOR) will utilize a tax-mitigation strategy known as a Section 351 exchange. This allows investors to transfer over-concentrated assets, such as highly performing tech stocks, into the new ETF in exchange for shares, potentially deferring capital gains taxes. The fund's introduction is considered timely, as the outsized performance of Big Tech stocks has left many investors facing substantial tax bills upon selling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is set to host U.S. Vice President JD Vance at his official country residence for bilateral talks on key diplomatic issues. The meeting comes as the two nations navigate differing stances on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the war in Ukraine. The U.S. does not support the UK's recent move toward recognizing a Palestinian state, and European leaders are wary of a potential summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. Lammy and Vance, who have reportedly formed a good working relationship, will discuss these and other topics pertaining to the U.S.-UK relationship.</p>

          <p>Mostafa Tajzadeh, a former deputy interior minister and prominent Iranian political prisoner, is emerging as a figure who could potentially bridge the divide between Iran's internal reformists and anti-regime opponents. Currently serving another prison sentence, Tajzadeh has called for the abolition of the supreme leader's position while still advocating for non-violent, incremental change. His unique stance has earned him respect from both sides of the fractured opposition, including those in the diaspora. Supporters see his willingness to engage in dialogue and pay a personal price for his convictions as crucial for Iran's future.</p>

          <p>A wage dispute at Birtat, a major German producer of döner kebab skewers, has been resolved, easing fears of a potential price increase for the country's most popular street food. Weeks of intermittent strikes had raised concerns among restaurant owners about supply chain disruptions. The Food, Beverages and Catering Union confirmed a new wage agreement that establishes a starting salary of €2,600 per month, creating a more transparent pay structure for the factory's workforce. The settlement is being called a historic result for the döner meat sector, bringing stability to a key part of the industry.</p>

          <p>In Brooklyn, where Black women face alarmingly high rates of mortality during childbirth, community-based doulas are providing crucial support to change these outcomes. The Caribbean Women's Health Association (CWHA), the city's largest free doula service, connects expecting parents with trained professionals who offer psychosocial care, advocacy, and comfort. These doulas help create birth plans, act as liaisons with medical staff, and provide postpartum support, empowering families and ensuring mothers feel heard and included. Their work addresses the fears and systemic disparities that contribute to the Black maternal health crisis.</p>

          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has taken the clearest picture yet of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Discovered last month, the comet is traveling at 130,000 mph and poses no threat to Earth, passing closer to Mars. Hubble's observations have refined the size of its icy core to no more than 3.5 miles across and revealed a teardrop-shaped dust plume. This visitor from another star provides astronomers with a rare opportunity to study an object formed outside our solar system, offering new insights into the composition of materials from distant star systems.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the coast of Norfolk as "illegal migrants." Lowe posted a picture of their boat on social media, stating he had alerted authorities and called for their deportation if they were migrants. It was later confirmed the boat was a crew of four attempting to row from Land's End to John O'Groats for charity. After the mix-up, which the rowers found "hilarious," Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause, which supports motor neurone disease research.</p>
