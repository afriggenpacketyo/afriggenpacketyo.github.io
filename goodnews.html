          <p>In a game against Albany, Iowa's Xavier Williams rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown, contributing to Iowa's 34-7 victory. With this win, Kirk Ferentz, the Hawkeyes' coach, tied Woody Hayes for the most wins in Big Ten history with 205 victories. Quarterback Mark Gronowski, in his first start after transferring from South Dakota State, threw for a touchdown and ran for another before experiencing cramping issues. The Hawkeyes responded quickly, driving 65 yards on seven plays, concluding with Williams' 3-yard touchdown run, marking Ferentz's 23rd season-opening win at Iowa, extending his record to 205-124 with the program.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party is experiencing anxiety over who will succeed Eric Chu Li-luan as chairman in October. This leadership transition comes at a volatile time in Taiwanese politics, as favorability towards the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has decreased. A recent poll indicates that the KMT's favorability rating has risen, surpassing that of the DPP, while discontent with the DPP has reached a record high. The KMT faces the challenge of capitalizing on this shift in public sentiment while navigating its internal leadership dynamics.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to protect residents' rights in anticipation of a potential federal agent deployment for immigration enforcement. The order aims to prevent the Chicago Police Department from being deputized by the federal government and prohibits officers from concealing their identities with masks. Johnson criticized the Trump administration's approach as "unconstitutional" and a "dangerous power grab," vowing to use all available legal tools to counter federal actions that violate residents' rights. The order also directs city departments to provide information on residents' rights during immigration enforcement activities.</p>

          <p>Mark Knoller, a veteran CBS News correspondent, passed away at 73 in Washington, D.C. Known as the unofficial presidential historian and statistician, Knoller meticulously documented every presidential act, movement, and utterance. He generously shared his vast knowledge with reporters, historians, and White House aides, believing the public had a right to know. Knoller covered eight presidential administrations and reinvented himself using Twitter to share White House news and statistics with a large audience, and he was remembered by colleagues for his dedication, generosity, and wit.</p>

          <p>Germans are consuming less beer overall, but non-alcoholic varieties are experiencing a surge in popularity, with sales more than doubling since 2013. The Destatis federal statistics office reports that total beer sales have fallen to their lowest level in over 30 years. Erdinger brewery CEO Stefan Kreisz notes a shift in drinking habits, with non-alcoholic beer promoted at sporting events as a healthy alternative. While non-alcoholic beer is gaining traction, full-strength beer remains dominant, particularly in regions like Bavaria.</p>

          <p>Konami has released a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, titled Metal Gear Solid Delta, a decade after the series creator Hideo Kojima left the company. The original Metal Gear series, known for its cinematic storytelling and tackling complex themes, was left directionless after Kojima's departure. The remake aims to stay true to the original while improving graphics and audio, and Metal Gear Solid 3 was chosen for its balance between gameplay and cinematic storytelling, making it accessible to new fans. Kojima himself has laughed off the suggestion that he would play the new game.</p>

          <p>The BBC's new dating reality show, Stranded on Honeymoon Island, hosted by Davina McCall, combines elements of Love Island, Married at First Sight, and Survivor. Couples meet briefly before being matched by experts, undergo a fake wedding, and are then stranded on a remote island in beach huts. Contestants face challenges like mosquitoes, limited clothing, and basic toilet facilities, testing their ability to find love in isolation. The show aims to strip away superficiality and offer a more authentic dating experience, focusing on building a solid foundation with a partner through adversity.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are employing drones, sniffer dogs, and nuclear waste models to combat the spruce bark beetle, which poses a significant threat to the UK's forests. The beetle, which has devastated conifer trees in Europe, has been detected in the UK, prompting the government to implement measures to eradicate it from at-risk areas. Drones are used to survey forests, while dogs detect pheromones released by the beetles, and models predict incursions. The UK has eradicated the beetle from controlled areas in the east and south-east of England.</p>

          <p>Pupils in England who missed school during the first week back in September 2024 were more likely to miss large parts during the rest of the year, figures suggest. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize attendance at the start of the 2025 term. Data shows that over half of pupils with partial absence in week one became "persistently absent", highlighting the importance of a strong start to the school year. The Department for Education is supporting schools through regional improvement teams to address attendance issues.</p>

Prabowo Subianto's message of "constructive pragmatism" presents a corrective model for a dysfunctional international system.
