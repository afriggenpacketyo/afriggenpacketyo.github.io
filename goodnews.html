          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a slight decline following Warren Buffett's announcement to step down as CEO, marking the end of his 60-year tenure. Greg Abel, the vice chairman of non-insurance operations, is set to succeed Buffett on January 1, 2026, a decision unanimously approved by the board. Despite the transition, Buffett will remain as chairman, providing mentorship to Abel and offering his expertise in capital allocation. The move signals a transparent transition for the conglomerate, valued at nearly $1.2 trillion, with businesses spanning insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing, and energy.</p>

          <p>A World War II-era Philippine navy ship, intended as a target for a joint U.S.-Philippine military exercise, sank unexpectedly due to rough seas hours before the drill. The decommissioned BRP Miguel Malvar, formerly the USS Brattleboro, was being towed off the coast of Zambales when it took on water and sank. The ship was to be used in a live-fire exercise near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, a point of contention between the Philippines and China. While the ship-sinking drill was cancelled, other live-fire maneuvers proceeded as planned, focusing on the defense of Philippine sovereignty in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reduced the withholding rate for overpayments from 100% to 50% for certain beneficiaries, following criticism over the potential financial hardship caused by the full clawback.

Experts caution that even a 50% reduction in benefits can have devastating effects on individuals relying on Social Security to cover essential expenses.

Researchers found an increase in the number of adults receiving psychotherapy between 2018 and 2021, accompanied by a decrease in those using only medication for treatment. The study suggests that psychotherapy is becoming more accessible and that telehealth and the inclusion of licensed counselors and social workers have expanded access to mental health care.

          <p>Comedian Michelle Reiss (Michelladonna) is spotlighting New York City's famous bodega cats through her TikTok show, Shop Cats. Bodegas, more than just corner stores, are community hubs, and their resident cats are part of the experience. Michelladonna's show features interviews with the cats and their caretakers, showcasing the unique personalities and roles these felines play in their neighborhoods. While technically illegal, bodega cats have a global following, and efforts are underway to officially recognize them as working animals and provide them with necessary healthcare.</p>
