          <p>UCLA quarterback Nico Iamaleava overcame early struggles, including two interceptions and a fumble, and shook off a knee injury to lead the Bruins to a gritty 20-17 comeback victory over Maryland. Iamaleava orchestrated a decisive late-game drive, culminating in a 23-yard field goal with just two seconds remaining, securing UCLA's third consecutive win. The defense also made crucial plays, including a goal-line stand, contributing significantly to the hard-fought triumph. This victory, fueled by resilience and key offensive plays like Anthony Frias II's 55-yard touchdown run, sets the stage for UCLA to gain national attention in an upcoming showcase game.</p>

          <p>Ambrocio “Enrique” Lozano, a beloved Culver City palatero, has reunited with his family after 114 days in ICE detention, with a green card now secured. Lozano was detained in June by federal agents while working, an event that galvanized community support and widespread protest against the Trump administration's immigration policies. He was granted lawful permanent residence through a 245(i) petition, a specific provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act. His family, who maintained faith throughout the ordeal, celebrated his return as a significant personal victory amidst broader immigration challenges. The article underscores the impact of community advocacy and the emotional relief of his release.</p>

          <p>AMIES Technology, a new Chinese lithography equipment manufacturer spun off from state-owned SMEE, is generating optimism in China's efforts to reduce reliance on foreign chipmaking machines, particularly from Dutch giant ASML. Advanced lithography remains a critical bottleneck for China, which is restricted from acquiring top-tier DUV and EUV systems due to US export controls. While SMEE focuses on back-end processes, AMIES aims for quicker commercialization of equipment. The article highlights China's ongoing struggle to catch up with global leaders in front-end wafer fabrication, with current reliable tools supporting only older technology nodes, despite past claims of 28-nm development.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen is increasingly disrupting McLaren's Formula 1 championship hopes, with team boss Zak Brown bracing for a "brutal" title climax. At the U.S. Grand Prix, a collision between McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris in the sprint race allowed Verstappen to cruise to victory and later secure a dominant pole position for the main race. This setback significantly eroded Piastri's championship lead, with Verstappen gaining considerable ground in recent events. The article highlights the growing concern within McLaren that Verstappen is inserting himself into their internal battle for the top two spots, intensifying the championship fight as the season progresses.</p>

          <p>The Catalonian town of Terrassa has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters between October 6 and November 10, aiming to protect them from potential harm or use in "sinister rituals" during Halloween. The local animal welfare service noted an increase in black cat adoption requests around this period, despite the animals often being associated with bad luck in Western culture. While Terrassa has no recorded cruelty incidents, the decision was made after warnings from animal welfare groups regarding practices in other areas. The city council emphasizes this "temporary and exceptional" measure as a precaution to prevent impulsive adoptions and ensure the cats' safety.</p>
