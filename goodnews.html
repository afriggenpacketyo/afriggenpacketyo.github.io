          <p>Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his "compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art." Known for postmodern works like "Satantango," he expressed happiness and nervousness upon receiving the news in Frankfurt. Krasznahorkai, born in 1954, draws inspiration from his experiences under communism and his travels, with his debut novel being a literary sensation. He is the second Hungarian to win the prestigious award, which will be presented at a ceremony in Stockholm in December.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene his cabinet to discuss a proposed Gaza Strip ceasefire deal on Thursday, with approval expected for the plan based on President Trump's 20-point proposal. The agreement's first phase involves the release of all remaining hostages, both alive and dead, from Gaza in exchange for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners. The Israel Defense Forces will also withdraw to an agreed-upon "yellow line" in Gaza, with the 72-hour hostage release window beginning after the Israeli government ratifies the deal. Trump hailed the agreement as a "GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America," thanking mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey.</p>

          <p>Google is enhancing its AI offerings for businesses by launching Gemini Enterprise and Gemini Business subscriptions, enabling corporate workers to build AI agents for specific tasks. These subscriptions, priced at $30 and $21 per person monthly respectively, integrate with data from products like Box, Microsoft, and Salesforce. The new services include pre-made Google agents for various functions and incorporate features from the previously announced Agentspace. This move positions Google alongside competitors like OpenAI and Microsoft in the race to get enterprises to adopt AI agents, with a focus on security and governance to ease corporate concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a general slowdown in deal-making, ultra-wealthy family offices are still actively investing in AI and healthcare startups, though direct investments in September were down 46% annually. High-profile investors like Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt participated in a $300 million seed round for AI-powered scientific research startup Periodic Labs. Healthcare also remains a focus, with Michael Dell's DFO Management investing $130 million in primary-care clinic group Harbor Health. Additionally, some family offices are making opportunistic bets, such as the Mitchell Family Office acquiring luxury beauty retailer Cos Bar, with plans to integrate AI-powered smart mirrors.

          <p>US President Donald Trump's announcement of a proposed agreement to release hostages held in the Gaza Strip has sparked widespread delight and relief across Israel. The deal, which still requires Israeli war cabinet approval, is expected to free 20 living hostages and the bodies of 28 dead ones in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Jubilant scenes unfolded in Tel Aviv's Hostages' Square, with families expressing profound gratitude and hope for their loved ones' return. While many celebrate this breakthrough as a potential end to a nightmare, some caution that full celebration awaits the return of the very last hostage.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that Democratic candidates could win back Rust Belt voters by adopting a more critical stance towards their own party establishment. A study across Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin found a "Democratic penalty," where candidates with identical economic populist platforms fared significantly worse when labeled as Democrats. Voters' primary complaints were about competence, honesty, and connection, not "wokeness." The article suggests that full-throated economic populism, condemning corporate practices, and prioritizing concrete measures like capping drug prices and taxing the wealthy, resonate more effectively with working-class voters.</p>

          <p>China's extended "super golden week" holiday saw a decline in box-office revenues, bringing in 1.83 billion yuan ($257 million), the second-lowest total since 2017. This figure is down from the previous year's National Day holiday, despite an extra day off, increased screenings, and lower ticket prices. The National Day holiday is traditionally the second most lucrative film season in China. However, the article notes a positive trend for the year as a whole, with nationwide takings since January already surpassing the total for all of 2024, indicating a broader recovery despite the holiday's underperformance.</p>

          <p>All victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal will now be entitled to free legal advice for their compensation claims, a significant improvement announced by the UK government. This change, responding to recommendations from a public inquiry, aims to address criticisms of slow and inadequate payouts. Over 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software, and hundreds more used personal savings to cover phantom shortfalls. The government also committed to a new appeals process for those who accepted fixed, potentially low, payouts under the Horizon Shortfall Scheme, demonstrating an ongoing effort to deliver justice.</p>

          <p>Terri Lesley, a former library director in Wyoming, has won a $700,000 settlement after being fired amidst a controversy over books with sexual content and LGBTQ+ themes. Lesley, who had served the Campbell County library system for 27 years, sued for wrongful termination, alleging her First Amendment rights were violated when officials sided with objectors seeking to remove the books. The county denied the claims, attributing her dismissal to performance issues. Lesley's attorney hopes the settlement sends a message to other library districts about upholding constitutional obligations and fighting discrimination.</p>

However, this is merely a ceasefire, not a peace deal, with formidable challenges remaining regarding Hamas's disarmament, Israel's troop withdrawal, and the establishment of a Palestinian state.

          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates a surprising and statistically significant decline in alcohol consumption among US Republicans, with the percentage of drinkers falling from 65% to 46% in just two years. This trend is more pronounced than among Democrats or independents, prompting various theories including the influence of figures like Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson, a resurgence of Protestant temperance, or a "Make America healthy again" movement. Young conservatives, in particular, are noted for being more health-conscious, with many abstaining for health reasons or due to a 24/7 news cycle demanding constant attention.</p>
