          <p>Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced new measures to alleviate prison overcrowding in the UK, including limiting the time some offenders spend back in prison for breaching their licenses. Under the new plans, offenders recalled for minor breaches will be released after a fixed 28-day period, bypassing lengthy parole board assessments. Mahmood cautioned that building new prisons alone would not solve the crisis, and the changes will not apply to those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk. The reforms aim to manage the prison population more effectively while prioritizing public safety.</p>

Bondi directed the termination of all DEI programs within the department, emphasizing merit-based hiring and promotion guidelines.

Experts recommend several strategies for reducing credit card debt, including negotiating debt settlements, consolidating multiple debts into a personal loan or home equity loan, and transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card. Credit counseling can also provide assistance in managing debt and lowering interest rates. The article emphasizes that the best approach is one that aligns with individual circumstances and can be consistently followed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, who has died at 85, was appointed to the US Supreme Court in 1990 with the expectation he would be a reliable conservative vote, particularly on abortion rights. However, Souter often sided with the court's liberal justices, notably in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v Casey case, which preserved the right to abortion. This led to disillusionment among conservatives and prompted a focus on ideological purity in future Republican judicial nominees. Souter, a Harvard Law graduate and Rhodes scholar, served on the court until 2009, when he retired to allow Barack Obama to appoint a liberal successor.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed weakening environmental conditions tied to subsidies for farmers, aiming to alleviate administrative burdens and boost competitiveness. The proposal comes after months of farmer protests across the European Union over issues including EU regulations and cheap imports. The changes could save farmers up to ‚Ç¨1.58 billion per year and limit on-site checks on farms to once per year. Smaller farmers would be exempted from conditions tying subsidies to environmental regulations, while certified organic farms would be considered as automatically meeting certain environmental regulations.</p>

Provisional CDC data indicates an estimated 80,000 overdose deaths last year, a 27% decrease from 110,000 in 2023. Experts attribute the decline to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in drug use patterns, and the impact of opioid lawsuit settlement money.
