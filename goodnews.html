          <p>Lando Norris delivered a remarkable qualifying performance to claim pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing his nearest competitor by over half a second. The McLaren driver's lap was significantly faster than Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who will start second, and his own teammate Oscar Piastri, who qualified third. This result is a crucial comeback for Norris, who is aiming to close the championship gap to Piastri after a crash in the previous race. The strong showing from Ferrari suggests their recent car upgrades are proving effective, setting the stage for a competitive race.</p>

          <p>British authorities have intercepted one of the country's largest-ever drug shipments, seizing 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port. The drugs, with an estimated street value of ¬£96 million ($132 million), were discovered hidden within a vessel arriving from Panama following an intelligence operation. The UK Home Office confirmed it was the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record, highlighting the significant scale of international drug trafficking operations. The bust comes as the UK government reports a sharp increase in cocaine-related deaths, underscoring ongoing public health challenges.</p>

          <p>Cooper Flagg, the first overall pick in the NBA draft, has named WNBA star Caitlin Clark to his personal "Mount Rushmore" of the women's league, alongside legends like Candace Parker. Speaking at his introductory press conference, Flagg justified his choice by highlighting Clark's transformative impact on women's basketball, stating she has "changed the game so much." His comments reflect the massive surge in popularity and viewership the WNBA has experienced since Clark's professional debut. The endorsement from a top male athlete underscores the Indiana Fever star's significant cultural influence, which extends far beyond her on-court performance.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the annual Budapest Pride march, defying threats from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a new law restricting gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality and warnings that attendees could face fines or even prison sentences. The march drew international support, with EU officials and Members of the European Parliament in attendance to express solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ community. Organizers and participants framed the event as a powerful demonstration for fundamental human rights and diversity in the face of increasing government pressure.</p>

This marks a return to the event after the city government did not invite Israel in 2024 due to the conflict in Gaza. The 2024 decision prompted a boycott from other G7 ambassadors in solidarity. The city of Nagasaki has since adopted a more inclusive approach, inviting all diplomatic missions for this year's ceremony. The Israeli ambassador stated his attendance is to show respect for the Japanese people and a mutual understanding of peace.</p>

          <p>A leading Chinese expert on the Middle East suggests that Beijing will likely adopt a cautious stance despite Iran potentially seeking military support amid its conflict with Israel and the U.S. Scholar Pan Guang notes that while Iran's defense minister has called for a larger Chinese role, Beijing must balance its partnership with Tehran against its broader regional interests. The analysis suggests that China does not have enough influence to single-handedly stop the conflict and will prioritize regional stability. This perspective highlights the complex geopolitical calculations facing Beijing as it navigates the escalating tensions in the Middle East.</p>

The group included Rauhin, a 24-year-old female, and her three offspring, Yuihin, Saihin, and Fuhin. Their departure for the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding leaves only two of the iconic animals remaining in the entire country. The pandas were on loan as part of China's "panda diplomacy" program, and their return marks the end of an era for the Wakayama-based zoo and its many visitors.</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing international trade restrictions on all eel species, a move that faces strong opposition from Japan. The proposal, submitted under the CITES treaty, would require export permits and proof of legal capture for species like the Japanese eel, a culinary staple. The measure aims to address the global decline in eel populations due to overfishing and habitat loss. If adopted, the restrictions would take effect in 2027 and could have a significant impact on the international seafood market, particularly for nations like Japan that are major consumers of eel.</p>

Key events included brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran following U.S. military strikes, securing increased defense spending commitments at a NATO summit, and a major Supreme Court victory curbing lower courts' power to block his executive orders. The week was capped by a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Petroleum analysts are forecasting a significant drop in gasoline prices, potentially making this the cheapest summer for drivers in four years. Experts predict the national average could fall below $3 a gallon by September, following a brief spike caused by the recent Israel-Iran conflict. With that situation de-escalating, prices are expected to resume a downward trend due to factors like increased refinery production and a leveling off of consumer demand. This anticipated relief at the pump is attributed to a slowing U.S. economy and an increased global supply of oil. (not investment advice)</p>
