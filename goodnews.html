          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift sanctions on Syria took U.S. Treasury officials by surprise, leading to internal discussions about the scope and pace of the rollback. The Syrian government has lobbied for sanctions relief, citing its inability to address economic challenges and rebuild infrastructure. While some work was underway at Treasury for incremental sanctions relief, the sudden announcement created confusion. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that relief may come in the form of waivers that allow foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs for potential price increases, urging the company to "eat the tariffs" instead of passing costs onto consumers. Walmart had warned that prices on various goods could rise due to import duties. Trump argued that Walmart should sacrifice profits to support his economic agenda. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company will strive to keep prices as low as possible, but there's a limit to what they can bear given small retail margins.</p>
