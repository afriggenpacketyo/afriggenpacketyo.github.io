          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, after internal Republican disagreements temporarily halted its progress. A faction of conservative members initially blocked the bill, demanding it be packaged with other measures, including a ban on a central bank digital currency. A compromise was eventually reached to advance the bill, which has already passed the Senate. Proponents argue that regulations for the digital asset market are long overdue, while critics express concerns about potential corruption and insufficient consumer protections.

          <p>Charisma, a quality that makes individuals magnetic and influential, is often perceived as a divine gift but can be understood through science. Psychologists define it as a combination of influence (leadership ability) and affability (making others feel at ease). While charisma is linked to higher income and managerial success, its effectiveness appears to diminish at very high levels, possibly due to an association with narcissism or a focus on vision over execution. Although some aspects of charisma are innate, the article suggests it can be cultivated through practicing specific nonverbal communication techniques, such as studying the gestures of great orators.</p>

          <p>Disneyland is celebrating its 70th anniversary, marking seven decades since it revolutionized the amusement park industry with its immersive, story-driven attractions. The Southern California park, which drew over 17 million visitors in 2023, is hosting a summer-long celebration that includes the debut of a new show featuring a lifelike animatronic of Walt Disney. Despite a famously disastrous opening day in 1955, Disneyland has become a global icon and the world's second-most visited theme park. The park continues to evolve, recently adding Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and planning further expansions to maintain its appeal.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is speeding up its production timeline in the U.S. by several quarters due to strong demand from its leading American customers. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer is investing $165 billion in Arizona, with its first fabrication facility already complete and two more under construction. The company reported record profits, beating estimates, and its CEO expressed confidence in its role within the U.S. semiconductor industry. This acceleration comes amid concerns over potential U.S. tariffs on Taiwanese goods, though TSMC has not yet seen changes in customer behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of a potential 30% tariff on EU imports, this article fact-checks President Trump's claims that Europe does not purchase American cars or agricultural products. Trade data from 2024 shows the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of U.S. agricultural goods, purchasing a record $12.8 billion worth, including soybeans and nuts. Similarly, while the U.S. imports more European cars, the EU still bought approximately 165,000 American vehicles in 2024. The analysis highlights that while trade imbalances and differing tariff structures exist, the assertion that Europe sells to the U.S. while buying virtually nothing in return is inaccurate.

          <p>In response to pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices, Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer will begin selling their blockbuster blood thinner, Eliquis, directly to certain patients at a significant discount. The new program, which bypasses insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, will reduce the monthly cost from about $606 to $346 for uninsured and self-pay patients. This move aims to expand access and provide transparent pricing, though the discounted price remains substantially higher than what commercially insured patients pay and the price negotiated by Medicare, which is set to take effect next year.</p>

The settlement was reached on the second day of the trial in a Delaware court, just before board member Marc Andreessen was scheduled to testify.

          <p>United Airlines has issued a new full-year forecast for 2025, projecting adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share after a stronger-than-expected second quarter.

While second-quarter revenue of $15.24 billion fell slightly short of expectations, the airline noted strong premium revenue growth.

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club has announced the sale of 10 shares of GE Vernova, booking a significant gain on the position. The move is a precautionary one, driven by concerns that the market's high expectations for the company's upcoming earnings report may be difficult to meet, potentially leading to profit-taking. Despite the small sale, the article notes that the long-term outlook for GE Vernova remains bright due to the secular tailwind of AI-driven power demand. The stock has experienced a remarkable 75% run-up year to date, creating a high bar for its quarterly performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a "major disaster" under the Stafford Act, which would allow federal FEMA funds to be directed to affected communities. The proposal comes after a June heat dome broke temperature records across the country but was not eligible for a disaster declaration. Proponents argue this change is necessary to provide funding for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects. However, some, including a former FEMA administrator, argue that extreme heat is already eligible and that the focus should be on better utilizing existing hazard mitigation grants.</p>
