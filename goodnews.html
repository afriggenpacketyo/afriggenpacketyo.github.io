          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and Japan's Nikkei 225 seeing significant gains, even as China reported a 4.8% GDP growth in line with expectations but kept benchmark lending rates unchanged. Japanese markets surged after an agreement to form a coalition government, indicating broader regional positive sentiment. This market resilience suggests investors are looking past specific economic data points, focusing instead on political stability and other regional developments. The overall upward trend in major Asian indices reflects a cautiously optimistic investor outlook despite underlying economic concerns in China. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British military will gain new authority to shoot down drones posing threats to military bases, a measure aimed at enabling faster and more decisive action. This initiative follows numerous drone sightings near UK and European airbases, including those used by US forces, and broader concerns about airspace disruption. While initially limited to military sites, these powers could extend to civilian locations like airports, reflecting a growing response to unidentified drone incursions. The move introduces a "kinetic option" beyond existing GPS disruption methods, addressing evolving security challenges.</p>

          <p>Doctors are appealing to patients to stop lying about crucial health details, such as medication adherence, lifestyle habits, substance use, and "embarrassing" bodily functions. Studies indicate that a significant majority of adults stretch the truth, which can lead to misdiagnoses, unnecessary tests, and ineffective treatment plans. Physicians emphasize that honesty allows them to provide appropriate care, address underlying issues like anxiety or pain, and avoid potentially dangerous health outcomes. Building trust with a primary care provider is highlighted as essential for open communication and improved patient well-being.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen, after his dominant performance at the United States Grand Prix, now openly acknowledges his strong chance at a fifth Formula 1 world championship. His recent run of form, including three wins in four races, has drastically cut the points gap to McLaren rivals Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. Despite McLaren's previous strength, Red Bull's car upgrades and improved understanding have made Verstappen's car the fastest, even on "normal" circuits. With five races remaining, the competition remains tight, but Verstappen's confidence and Red Bull's pace are significant factors.</p>

          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, ending two decades of leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party rule. His victory comes amid Bolivia's worst economic crisis in decades, marked by a US dollar shortage, currency devaluation, and high inflation. Paz has pledged to stabilize the economy by tackling corruption and the black market, while slowly phasing out fuel subsidies, contrasting with his opponent's call for IMF loans. This election signals a significant shift in Bolivia's political and economic trajectory, including renewed overtures to the US.</p>

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of RoboSense, a leading LiDAR maker, asserts that a multi-sensor system is safer for self-driving vehicles than Elon Musk's vision-only approach. Qiu argues vision-only systems struggle with "corner cases" like detecting certain colored cars in challenging lighting, limiting higher automation levels. Despite Musk's dismissal of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," its cost has significantly decreased, and many auto executives, including Ford's CEO, deem it "mission critical." This article highlights the ongoing technological debate in the autonomous driving sector.</p>

          <p>An art exhibit in Los Angeles, "Monuments," showcases 18 decommissioned Confederate statues, including a melted-down General Robert E. Lee and a graffitied equestrian statue. Curator Hamza Walker aims to challenge the "Lost Cause" narrative and confront the historical context of these figures, who he argues fought for white supremacy. This initiative contrasts sharply with President Trump's calls to reinstall such monuments, intensifying the national debate over American history and the legacy of slavery.

This year, India's Supreme Court permitted the use of "green crackers" in Delhi to mitigate pollution, though their effectiveness is debated. Beyond fireworks, Diwali emphasizes family gatherings, home decorations, and the worship of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, drawing participation from diverse communities.</p>

Deng Xiaoping's "reform and opening up" in the 1980s transformed China into a manufacturing hub, leading to the "China shock" in Western job markets. Later, the "strategic emerging industries" focus from 2011-15 propelled China to global dominance in green technology and rare earth supply chains.
