          <p>The White House and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to scale back the Trump administration's federal takeover of the city's police force. Following a lawsuit from the city and a judge's skepticism, the Justice Department agreed that the city's police chief, Pamela Smith, will remain in charge, not a federally appointed administrator. The deal also involves rewriting a directive that would have forced D.C. police to cooperate more fully with federal immigration enforcement, contrary to the city's sanctuary policies. This resolution marks a significant de-escalation in the power struggle over local autonomy and federal authority in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main property. This development comes a year after the city passed a pioneering ordinance to allow such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. ADUs, often called granny flats or in-law units, are seen as a key strategy to address the state's severe housing shortage by providing smaller, more affordable starter homes. While ADU construction is booming, experts are still assessing its overall impact on California's housing crisis.</p>

          <p>Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old World War II veteran, recently fulfilled a unique contract he signed over two decades ago. In the early 2000s, he promised Bruce Moss, conductor of the Wheaton Municipal Band in Illinois, that he would guest-conduct the band on his 100th birthday. Unable to travel due to his health, Gabriel honored the commitment by conducting the band remotely from his home in Virginia. The heartwarming event celebrated the former U.S. Air Force Band conductor's long legacy and his principle that one's word is one's bond, creating a memorable performance for all involved.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Salton Sea Shoreline is a Minor Contributor to Regional Air Pollution</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea accounts for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This challenges the long-held belief that the lakebed is the primary cause of the region's poor air quality and high asthma rates. Researchers from the Pacific Institute suggest that pollution sources are more varied, including agricultural chemicals, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. The study recommends shifting focus from costly dust suppression projects at the sea to protecting residents directly through measures like indoor air filtration and public health alerts.</p>

          <p>New research from India is challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes due to their sweetness. Two recent clinical trials found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like white bread, can actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. The studies showed that mangoes produced a lower glycemic response than bread and, over an eight-week period, led to improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation and incorporating the fruit as part of a calorie-controlled diet, not in addition to it.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, with plans to reopen standalone stores on the UK High Street and host its first catwalk show in seven years. The brand, once a dominant force in youth fashion, saw its physical stores close after its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020. Now owned by online retailer Asos, Topshop aims to recapture its former glory by appealing to both nostalgic millennial shoppers and a new generation of consumers. Industry experts note the brand faces challenges, including stiff competition from fast-fashion giants and the need to reclaim its reputation for being on the cutting edge of trends.</p>

          <p>China's bubble tea industry has grown into a multi-billion dollar market, with three major chains recently raising over $700 million in Hong Kong IPOs. The industry's rapid expansion is fueled by a franchise-heavy model, where parent companies profit from supplying ingredients and collecting fees, allowing for swift global growth. However, the sector faces significant challenges, including intense price wars, market saturation in China, and difficulties in maintaining quality control across thousands of franchised outlets. This raises questions about whether the bubble tea boom is a sustainable consumer trend or a fad facing an eventual downturn.</p>

This renewed optimism is clearing a backlog of high-valued startups that had delayed going public.

          <p>Slate Automotive, an EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is pitching a minimalist, customizable electric pickup truck it claims can sell for about half the average vehicle price in the U.S. The company's strategy is to manufacture a barebones, two-seat base model and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate's main selling point is its low price, which it hopes will remain competitive even after federal EV tax credits expire. However, analysts question whether the simple truck can compete with similarly priced conventional vehicles that offer more standard features.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to terminate President Trump's recent federalization of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). The lawmakers argue that Trump's move, enacted under the D.C. Home Rule Act, is an unlawful overreach as no special emergency conditions exist to warrant it. They contend the president has manufactured a crisis by pushing a misleading narrative about the city's crime rate, which has actually declined. The resolution represents a formal legislative pushback against what they describe as one of the most egregious attacks on D.C.'s local autonomy in decades.</p>
