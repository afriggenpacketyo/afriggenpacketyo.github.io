          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a seat previously held for over two decades by her late father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva. Endorsed by prominent progressives, she will face Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in the special general election on September 23. The district is heavily Democratic, and while the seat will not shift control of the House, its filling is one of three special elections this fall expected to narrow the slim Republican majority. Grijalva's platform focuses on upholding democracy, immigrant rights, and protecting social programs.</p>

          <p>MiniMax, a prominent Chinese artificial intelligence startup, has confidentially filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, with China International Capital Corporation and UBS as sponsors. Founded in 2021 and backed by major tech conglomerates, the company is considered one of China's "AI Tigers" and holds a valuation of $1.2 billion. The move follows reports of a potential Hong Kong IPO by its rival, Zhipu AI, indicating a trend of Chinese AI firms seeking public listings.

          <h2>Cryptocurrency Prices Rise Amid Hopes for US Stablecoin Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 09:00:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a rebound, with Bitcoin and Ether prices increasing, following a temporary dip caused by a legislative snag in the U.S. House. Investor optimism was renewed by the possibility that key crypto-related bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, could still advance this week. President Trump indicated that several Republican holdouts have shifted their support for the legislation. Analysts suggest the passage of these bills is a matter of "when," not "if," which could reduce market uncertainty and reinforce the institutional importance of networks like Ethereum.

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, was flat in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This data, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggests that the inflationary impact of recent tariffs may be marginal so far. While the headline number was subdued, prices for final demand goods rose by 0.3%, offset by a decline in services. On a year-over-year basis, the PPI increased by 2.3%, indicating that some inflationary pressures persist despite the monthly pause in growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-over-year in June, the highest annual rate since February, indicating a slight acceleration in inflation. On a monthly basis, the index increased by 0.3%, driven by rising costs for energy, food, and household furnishings. So-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 2.9% annually. Analysts suggest the data shows early signs of tariffs impacting consumer prices, making it highly unlikely the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting.

          <p>The article explores the growing trend of purchasing physical gold from retailers like Costco, comparing it to traditional gold investment companies. Experts highlight Costco's advantages, such as convenience, high trust factor, and lower markups, making it an accessible entry point for new investors. However, they also note significant downsides, including limited product selection, a no-return policy, and the absence of a buyback program. In contrast, specialized dealers offer more variety, investment strategy support, and buyback options, but may come with higher markups and the risk of sales pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article provides expert guidance on choosing between certificates of deposit (CDs) and money market accounts for savings, especially in a fluctuating interest rate environment. Experts note that CDs are ideal for specific, timed financial goals, as they lock in a fixed interest rate and protect against rate drops, but penalize early withdrawals. In contrast, money market accounts offer greater liquidity and flexibility, making them suitable for emergency funds, though their variable rates can fall. The choice depends on an individual's savings goals, timeline, and need for access to their funds. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professional cycling teams in the 2025 Tour de France are widely adopting heat training as a key strategy to boost performance. This method involves deliberately raising a rider's core body temperature, either actively through intense exercise in warm clothing or passively in a sauna or hot bath. Sports scientists explain that this stressor can increase blood volume and stimulate red blood cell formation, similar to altitude training, but potentially more effective for a wider range of athletes. This technique, once considered unconventional, is now a mainstream tool for gaining a competitive edge in endurance sports.</p>

The equities trading unit was a standout, generating $4.3 billion in revenue, a 36% increase from the previous year.

          <p>An independent review of the UK's healthcare system has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants." The recommendation aims to clarify their roles and avoid confusing patients, who sometimes mistake them for fully qualified doctors. The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, also suggests PAs should only see new patients with minor ailments and wear standardized uniforms to distinguish them from doctors. The proposed changes follow safety concerns and a heated debate over the responsibilities of these growing healthcare roles.</p>
