          <p>West Ham has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, just hours after sacking Graham Potter. Potter's dismissal came after only eight months in charge, with the club positioned 19th in the Premier League table following a poor start to the season. Nuno, who was recently let go by Nottingham Forest despite leading them to a high league finish last season, is tasked with immediately improving the team's performance and league standing, with his first match against Everton.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II, breaking racial barriers as part of the first group of Black military aviators in the U.S. armed forces. Hardy's distinguished career also included combat missions in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and he later became a champion for preserving the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, who were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is positioning itself as a key solution to the American housing affordability crisis by manufacturing homes in a factory setting. The company claims its process reduces construction costs by up to 20% and cuts delivery time in half compared to traditional on-site building, making homeownership more accessible. Fading West recently demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 homes in just two months for residents displaced by the 2023 Maui wildfires, showcasing modular construction's potential for both disaster relief and addressing the nationwide housing shortage.</p>

Born in Vienna, he escaped to France and later emigrated to the U.S., where he was drafted into the military and served as an interpreter during the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. Troller became famous in Europe for his unconventional television interview show, "Personenbeschreibung," where his sensitive and subjective style redefined broadcast journalism and featured luminaries like Marlon Brando, Woody Allen, and Romy Schneider.</p>

          <p>Major online dating companies, including Bumble and Match Group, are integrating advanced AI to combat user swipe fatigue and offer a more personalized matchmaking experience. The new approach aims to move beyond superficial profiles by using large language models to match users based on deeper values, goals, and beliefs, gathered through interactive questioning. However, critics are skeptical, pointing out that romantic chemistry remains unpredictable and past experiments have shown that the suggestion of compatibility can be more powerful than actual algorithm-based matches, questioning if AI can truly solve the complexities of human connection.</p>

          <p>When 6-year-old Imani Dell's eyes suddenly became crossed, her mother initially suspected too much screen time, but the symptom led to a terrifying discovery: a golf-ball sized brain tumor. Doctors at Holtz Children's Hospital successfully removed the mass, which was identified as a medulloblastoma, a fast-growing cancer common in children. Following the surgery, Imani endured 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of a year. Now finished with treatment, she is returning to school and beginning to regain her normal, energetic self.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a rise in serious runway incursions, aerospace company Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system designed to give pilots more time to react to hazards. The system provides automated audio and visual warnings if another aircraft is on the runway during takeoff or landing, potentially adding crucial seconds for evasive action. With serious close calls at U.S. airports peaking in 2023, safety experts and regulators are urging wider adoption of such technologies to enhance the layers of safety in an increasingly congested aviation system.</p>

          <p>The "dirty soda" trend, which involves mixing soda with flavored syrups and cream, has surged from its origins in Utah to become a major driver of innovation in the beverage industry. Major corporations like PepsiCo, McDonald's, and Taco Bell are now launching their own versions, capitalizing on a craze popularized by social media and the drink chain Swig. This movement is credited with helping to reverse a decades-long decline in soda consumption by attracting younger consumers and offering an easily customizable and affordable treat, proving to be a significant growth opportunity for both restaurants and beverage companies.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a community with many Holocaust survivors, to explore the complexities of the First Amendment. The author recalls the pain the event caused survivors but interviews the ACLU lawyer who defended the group's right to demonstrate, David Goldberger. Goldberger, who is Jewish, reiterates the core principle that free speech must be protected even when it is offensive. He argues that if speech can be denied because some find it disagreeable, then officials gain the power to suppress any expression they dislike.</p>

          <p>Broadcast media companies Nexstar and Sinclair have ended their boycott of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," restoring the show to their local ABC affiliate stations. The companies had pulled the program after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr suggested regulatory action could be taken against affiliates over Kimmel's comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk. However, the boycott proved more costly for the stations, which lost significant viewership by replacing the popular late-night show with local programming. The quick reversal demonstrates that despite the growing power of consolidated station groups, major networks like ABC still hold significant leverage.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for an ambitious youth migration scheme with the European Union, hoping its potential economic benefits will be factored into the upcoming budget forecast. Reeves argues that an exchange program for workers aged 18-30 would stimulate growth and has urged the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to include its positive impact in their calculations. This move is seen as an attempt to mitigate the need for significant spending cuts or tax increases to address a potential £20-£30 billion fiscal gap in the autumn Budget. (not investment advice)</p>
