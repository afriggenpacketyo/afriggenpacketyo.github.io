          <p>Following a historic election loss for the Liberal-National coalition in Australia, Sussan Ley has been elected as the first female leader of the Liberal Party, succeeding Peter Dutton. Ley, a seasoned politician with experience in various senior ministerial roles, aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, especially women and young people who felt neglected. She plans to review all party policies, including those on nuclear energy and net-zero emissions, and has promised a fresh approach characterized by collaboration rather than unilateral decisions. Ley's election is seen as a significant milestone for the party as it seeks to modernize and reconnect with a broader base of voters.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is under scrutiny after sharing photos of himself and his grandchildren swimming in waters that handle sewer overflow. This action has ignited debate regarding water quality and public health standards. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about environmental regulations and the safety of recreational waters. Kennedy's actions are being interpreted by some as a disregard for public health advisories, while others view it as a personal choice with limited broader implications.</p>

          <p>A China-led international research team analyzing data from NASA's InSight lander has found seismic evidence suggesting a layer of water-saturated rock exists just a few kilometers beneath the Martian surface. This underground layer, located between 5.4km and 8km deep, could potentially hold a significant amount of water, matching scientists' estimates of Mars' missing water. If confirmed, this discovery would reshape our understanding of the Martian water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet.</p>

          <p>German companies, long-standing investors in the United States, are reevaluating their strategies due to President Trump's tariffs. Surveys indicate a pullback in investments, with companies expressing gloom about their futures in the U.S. Despite automakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz considering shifting some production to the U.S., many German firms are opting to keep investments at home, encouraged by a new government focused on reducing bureaucracy and energy prices. The situation is fluid, contingent on trade negotiations and the potential for agreements between the EU and Washington.</p>

          <p>The American perception of China is split between a technological superpower and an economy on the brink of collapse, each reflecting a real aspect of the country. While companies like DeepSeek and Huawei showcase innovation, China also faces sluggish consumer spending and a housing crisis. Experts suggest that China's technological advances may not be enough to overcome its economic imbalances, especially with a heavy reliance on exports and a real estate sector that dwarfs advanced manufacturing. This complex reality requires the US to understand both the strengths and weaknesses of its geopolitical rival as it navigates trade relations.</p>

          <p>The art collection auction of the Riggio family, founders of Barnes & Noble, revealed a cautious market, with many items presold and little enthusiastic bidding. Experts attributed the anticlimactic sale to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Despite a $272 million total, the sale fell short of pre-sale expectations, with a Mondrian painting failing to spark a bidding war. While some paintings by artists like Gerhard Richter and Vincent van Gogh sold above estimates, the overall event signaled a shift from the frothy art market of 2022.</p>

While gold is considered a safe haven asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations, and past surges have been followed by significant falls. Experts caution that a market bubble may be forming, and investors should diversify their portfolios rather than putting all their eggs in a golden basket (not investment advice).</p>
