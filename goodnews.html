          <h2>Chinese Biotech Firms Increase Drug Licensing Deals with Multinationals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese biotechnology companies are increasingly entering into drug-licensing agreements with multinational pharmaceutical firms as a cost-saving measure. These deals often involve a 'newco structure,' combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate entity. This trend allows Chinese firms to license development rights for innovative medicines to global companies, particularly amid depressed valuations in the stock market. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group, for example, is in talks to license its drug candidates, potentially receiving up to US$5 billion per candidate, showcasing the significant value these deals can bring to Chinese biotech companies. The company's shares surged on the news, reflecting investor optimism regarding the potential financial benefits of these licensing agreements. Optimism surrounding this trend is high as it indicates a growing collaboration and financial opportunity within the biotech sector. </p>

          <p>A woman in China's Hubei province experienced an unfortunate incident when she boarded the wrong high-speed train and became trapped by a door while attempting to disembark.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding a significant crypto enforcement action. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds, as well as enabling trading in unregistered crypto assets. This dismissal signals a potential shift in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency in the U.S., particularly as the Trump administration seeks to foster a more industry-friendly environment. Binance is also deepening its footprint in Pakistan, with Zhao advising the country's newly formed Crypto Council, indicating the exchange's continued global expansion. This move is viewed as positive for Binance, and the broader crypto market. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has agreed to initiate procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, which were banned following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japan's government announced the agreement, stating that Chinese authorities are expected to issue a public notice easing the ban, which has been in place since August 2023. The two nations have reached an agreement on technical requirements for the resumption of seafood exports, with Japan continuing to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from ten Japanese prefectures. This development is seen as a positive step in resolving tensions between the two countries and could lead to solutions for other bilateral issues. The restart of seafood exports is considered a significant milestone, though it may take a few months for shipments to begin due to registration and radiation checks. </p>

          <p>Japan has stated that it has no intention of purchasing defense equipment from the United States in exchange for the easing of tariff measures. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani emphasized that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters. He stated that equipment purchases would be based on what is necessary for Japan's peace and defense capabilities. Nakatani's remarks come after Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that purchases of U.S. defense equipment may help reduce the trade deficit. This position underscores Japan's commitment to making defense decisions based on its own security needs. </p>
