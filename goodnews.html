          <p>The Trump administration has backtracked on its initial decision to revoke Harvard University's certification to enroll international students, giving the school 30 days to challenge the decision. This notice comes after Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem cited Harvard's refusal to provide pertinent information and alleged promotion of an unsafe campus environment. A U.S. District Judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction to protect Harvard's international students during this period, despite the administration's change of course. Harvard argues that the SEVP revocation is retaliation for the school's exercise of its First Amendment rights, claiming the administration is trying to coerce the university into surrendering its academic independence.</p>

Michael Rockefeller's twin sister, Mary Rockefeller Morgan, played a key role in preserving and displaying the family's collection, emphasizing the art's connection to humanity's basic needs and desires. The remodeled wing occupies the same footprint as the original but features a more spacious and light-filled environment.</p>
