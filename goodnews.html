          <p>A large, bright meteorite, also known as a fireball, was observed across the southeastern United States before exploding over Georgia. NASA reported that the space rock, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, detonated with the energy of about 20 tons of TNT. The explosion created a pressure wave that produced audible booms heard by residents in the area. This rare daylight event was reported over 160 times to the American Meteor Society.</p>

This initiative aims to create a template for other cities to adapt to rising temperatures and more frequent heat waves driven by climate change.</p>
