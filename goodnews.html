          <p>Anthony Albanese has claimed a decisive victory in the Australian general election, securing a second three-year term as Prime Minister. The Labor leader thanked Australians for the opportunity to continue serving, with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation projecting a Labor win. Peter Dutton, leader of the Liberal-National coalition, conceded defeat and congratulated Albanese. Surveys indicate that the rising cost of living and economic uncertainty were major concerns for voters. Albanese has promised modest tax cuts, cheaper healthcare, and investments in renewable energy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has secured a second term, marking a significant victory for the center-left Labor Party amid a cost-of-living crisis. The election outcome reflects a rejection of the conservative opposition, led by Peter Dutton, who faced challenges due to associations with President Trump's policies. Albanese's win comes as global economic and trade uncertainties, largely influenced by the Trump administration, weigh on Australian voters. While the Labor Party's majority in Parliament remains uncertain, Albanese's win underscores a preference for stability amid international turmoil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) teaches aides to avoid "elderspeak," which is communication that sounds like baby talk, when addressing older people. The program aims to reduce ageist assumptions of frailty and incompetence by promoting respectful and adult-like communication. Studies show that elderspeak is commonplace in nursing homes and can lead to resistance to care and increased use of antipsychotic drugs. The CHAT training has been shown to reduce elderspeak and resistant behaviors, improving the quality of care for older adults.</p>
