          <p>Bobby Hart, a prominent songwriter who, with his partner Tommy Boyce, crafted some of The Monkees' most iconic hits, has passed away at the age of 86. The duo was responsible for the group's theme song, their first number-one single "Last Train to Clarksville," and "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone." Hart's work was instrumental in defining the sound of the made-for-television band in the mid-1960s. Later, Boyce and Hart pursued their own successful recording career and remained influential figures in pop music for decades.</p>
