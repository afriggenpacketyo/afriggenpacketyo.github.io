        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After weekend talks, the United States and China have agreed to a temporary reduction in tariffs, signaling a de-escalation in their trade war. The agreement involves a 90-day suspension of most tariffs, with the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, and China lowering import duties on American goods to 10% from 125%. This move aims to provide room for continued trade negotiations and has already boosted stock markets globally, with economists warning that trade tensions significantly increased the possibility of an economic downturn. The NYTimes article notes that the temporary reprieve will likely lead to a surge in demand and transport prices as businesses rush to schedule shipments.</p>

          <p>Virat Kohli, a legendary Indian batter, has declared his immediate retirement from Test cricket after a 14-year career. Kohli, 36, played 123 Tests for India, scoring 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, and captained India in 68 of those Tests, winning 40 of them. This decision comes before the summer's five-Test tour of England and follows Rohit Sharma's retirement, though Kohli is expected to continue playing one-day internationals. The article states that Kohli retired from T20 internationals in 2024 after India's World Cup victory.</p>

This move follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for the group to dissolve itself, stating that the Kurdish issue can now be resolved through democratic politics. The PKK, banned as a terrorist group by Turkey, the EU, UK, and US, said it has completed its historical mission.
