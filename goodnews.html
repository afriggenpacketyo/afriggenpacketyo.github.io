          <p>The S&P 500 concluded a successful August with a more than 2% gain, marking its fourth consecutive winning month, although it ended the final week slightly down. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the week's decline. The market also processed the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, which showed core inflation at 2.9%, its highest annual rate since February. Despite this, investors still anticipate an interest rate cut at the Fed's upcoming September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta has announced temporary changes to its AI chatbot policies for teenagers in response to a U.S. Senate investigation into inappropriate and "romantic" conversations. The company is training its AI to avoid generating responses on sensitive topics like self-harm and to point young users toward expert resources instead. Additionally, teen users will now only have access to specific AI chatbots designed for educational purposes. The move follows a recent report from Common Sense Media which advised that no one under 18 should use Meta AI due to what it called "fundamental safety failures."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines with new, more restrictive guidance. Previously available to anyone aged 6 months and older, the updated shots are now limited to individuals who are at higher risk for serious complications. This includes people aged 65 and older and those with other underlying health problems. This policy shift marks a significant change from the broad vaccination campaigns seen earlier in the pandemic, focusing protection on the most vulnerable populations as the public health situation evolves.</p>

          <p>With over a third of Senate seats up for election in 2026, the political landscape for the midterm contests is beginning to take shape. Democrats face a challenging map, defending 13 seats while Republicans defend 24, many in states that President Trump won in 2024. Key battlegrounds are emerging in North Carolina, where a race for an open seat is expected to be the most expensive, and Georgia, where incumbent Democrat Jon Ossoff is considered highly vulnerable. Other competitive races are anticipated in New Hampshire, Michigan, and Ohio, as both parties strategize to gain control of the upper chamber.</p>

The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue of $876 million, a 33% increase from the previous year, signaling strong consumer spending and transaction frequency. This positive performance comes despite losing Walmart as a partner to a competitor, with growth bolstered by partnerships with Shopify and Amazon.

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares climbed nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected profits for its fiscal first quarter, driven by strong performance in its cloud computing unit. Revenue for the cloud division grew 26% year-over-year, an acceleration from the previous quarter, largely due to robust demand for AI-related products. The company noted that AI product revenue has maintained triple-digit annual growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall company revenues slightly missed forecasts, investors responded positively to the significant growth in the high-potential cloud and AI sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California administrative law judge has ruled that a homeowner whose house was destroyed in a firestorm can investigate State Farm's claims-handling practices as part of the insurer's rate-increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to the fires, alleging payment delays and underpayments. The judge denied a motion from the Department of Insurance to separate the inquiry from the rate hearing. This ruling connects the insurer's service quality directly to its request for an 11% rate hike, a move opposed by consumer advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly accepted an offer from Spanish club Real Betis for Brazilian winger Antony. The 25-year-old, who is United's second-most expensive signing ever at £81.3 million, has been given permission to travel for a medical. Antony had a successful loan spell with Betis last season but has since been training separately from the United first team, signaling his impending departure. The permanent move will conclude a disappointing tenure at the English club, where his performance failed to live up to his high transfer fee after a promising start.</p>

          <p>A legislative proposal that would have limited legal challenges against Frank McCourt's proposed gondola project to Dodger Stadium has been rejected by California state lawmakers. The language, which was stripped from a broader transit bill, faced public opposition from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and the City Council. They argued it would create an unfair carve-out for a "billionaire's private project." The decision means the controversial transit proposal will have to proceed through the standard approval and environmental review process without expedited legal protection, facing a court fight that is already 17 months long.</p>

Among the stolen goods was a distinctive Seattle Sounders championship ring with the owner's name on it. The suspect is expected to face criminal charges for the incident.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have revealed a clearer picture of one of the "strangest" dinosaurs ever found, an ancient ankylosaur named Spicomellus that lived 165 million years ago. Newly discovered fossils from Morocco show the herbivore had long, bony spikes that were fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any known vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, suggesting their defensive armor was complex and elaborate much earlier than previously thought. Researchers have nicknamed the uniquely armored creature the "punk rocker" of its time.</p>
