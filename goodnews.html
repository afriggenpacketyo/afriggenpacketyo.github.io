          <p>As artificial intelligence usage grows, researchers are uncovering more cases of potentially harmful AI responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements. These issues are compounded by a lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models. Researchers suggest red teaming, involving individuals testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, and opening testing to third parties for more robust evaluation. Recommendations include adopting standardized 'AI flaw' reports and incentives to disseminate information, mirroring practices in software security, to better understand and manage AI risks. </p>
