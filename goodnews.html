          <h2>Trump Criticizes Fed Chair Powell After Interest Rates Remain Unchanged</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 07:56:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has once again publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a 'fool' after the central bank decided to hold steady interest rates, citing economic uncertainties related to tariffs. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates in order to stimulate the economy, but the Fed remains cautious due to potential inflationary pressures from the tariffs. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the outlook for employment and price stability, disregarding political pressures. Trump's attacks on Powell have previously unsettled markets, raising concerns about the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom are set to sign a 'full and comprehensive' trade agreement, making the U.K. the first country to secure such a deal after the U.S. imposed new tariffs. The agreement aims to strengthen the economic relationship between the two nations. While the specific details are yet to be released, early reports suggest that steel, aluminum, and vehicle duties may play a key role in the deal. The U.K.'s central bank had previously cut interest rates, citing concerns about global growth due to tariff uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Grandparents are playing a larger and more enduring role in kids‚Äô lives, driven by demographic shifts, longer life expectancy, and the increasing need for child care support. Spending more time with grandparents is linked to better educational and mental health outcomes for children. Grandparents are increasingly stepping in to fill gaps in America's child care system, a role they are not always excited about filling. Experts suggest policymakers should embrace reforms that allow grandparents to spend time with their grandkids because they want to, not because their families have no other choice.</p>

          <p>Britain is set to announce a trade deal with the United States, which could help some sectors and boost confidence, but the British economy faces other challenges. The trade deal is expected to ease the impact of recent increases in U.S. tariffs. However, economists caution that the greater threat to Britain is the uncertainty that Mr. Trump‚Äôs trade policy has created globally. The Bank of England cut interest rates, lowering them a quarter point to 4.25 percent.</p>
