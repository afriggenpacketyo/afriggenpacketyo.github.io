          <p>Chinese researchers at Northwestern Polytechnical University have created a "ghost" drone that mimics the appearance and movement of a jellyfish for stealthy underwater operations. Made from a transparent hydrogel material, the small, lightweight robot is designed for near-silent operation and low power consumption. Its lifelike design makes it suitable for sensitive tasks such as deep-sea covert monitoring, observing fragile ecosystems, and inspecting underwater structures without causing disruption. The innovation represents a significant advancement in biomimetic robotics for surveillance and scientific research.</p>

          <p>Rick Senko, a 41-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has built a multi-million dollar business by reselling used clothing and other items online. Starting in 2008 while unemployed, he began by flipping a single cell phone and gradually expanded, focusing on identifying undervalued pre-owned clothing at thrift stores and flea markets. His wholesale company, Technsports, now sells thousands of items daily to other resellers and generated over $6.5 million in revenue in 2024. Senko's story illustrates how dedication and market knowledge can turn a small-scale side hustle into a highly profitable enterprise without significant initial capital.</p>

          <p>A vibrant 1943 Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, has sold for approximately $37 million at an auction in Paris. The painting, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over 80 years. The work captures a poignant moment towards the end of their tumultuous relationship, with experts noting the raw emotion and vivid, unvarnished colors. The final sale price surpassed expectations and marked the highest price paid for an artwork in France this year.</p>

          <p>The Sienna Awards have announced the winners of their annual drone photography competition, celebrating breathtaking aerial images that offer unique perspectives on the world. The top prize went to German filmmaker Dennis Schmelz for "The Lone Horseman," a dramatic winter shot taken in Cappadocia, Turkey. Other winning and commended photos capture diverse scenes, from the urban sprawl of Dhaka, Bangladesh, to the vibrant tradition of Boli Khela wrestling and the symmetrical patterns of seaweed farms in China. The collection highlights how drone technology allows photographers to reveal hidden patterns and tell compelling stories from previously unseen angles.</p>

          <p>A family from West Virginia has experienced a medical ordeal after four of their six children were diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, required brain surgery for severe symptoms, which led to a dramatic improvement in her well-being. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed after exhibiting various symptoms, each requiring surgical intervention. The family's story highlights the challenges of diagnosing a rare genetic condition and the relief of finding effective treatment.</p>

          <p>This commentary reflects on the overwhelming presence of pharmaceutical advertisements during televised sports events like the post-season baseball games. The author humorously notes that the constant mention of symptoms for conditions like psoriasis and Crohn's disease can make a healthy viewer feel ill. The article explains that while the FDA permits such ads with clear risk disclosures, their primary purpose is persuasion, not just information. This direct-to-consumer advertising targets a captive audience, potentially driving patient behavior and medical demand in ways that may not always be beneficial.</p>

          <p>Dr. Roy Meals, an 80-year-old hand surgeon, recently completed a solo hike along the entire 342-mile perimeter of Los Angeles to better understand the city he has called home for half his life. He chronicled his journey in a new book, "Walking the Line," detailing his discoveries, from historical landmarks to diverse culinary spots and unexpected encounters. Meals argues that truly knowing a place requires exploring it on foot, beyond the confines of a car. He prescribes his method to others: venture out of your own neighborhood to stay physically fit, mentally engaged, and connected to your community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While new AI tools like OpenAI's Sora 2 have generated considerable panic in Hollywood over copyright and job displacement, the technology's actual integration into the industry has been slow and challenging. Major studios like Disney have invested heavily in AI but have yet to realize significant cost savings or efficiencies, finding it difficult to fold the new tech into established, secure production pipelines. Issues surrounding copyright protection for AI-generated content and resistance from actors and guilds further complicate adoption. For now, AI remains more of a promising yet problematic curiosity than an immediate existential threat to Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock the value of its significant holding in NuScale Power. Fluor's 39% stake in the small modular nuclear reactor company represents over 60% of its market capitalization, yet Fluor's core business trades at a steep discount compared to its peers. Starboard is urging management to separate the NuScale investment, possibly through a sale or a tax-free spinoff, to allow Fluor's main business to be revalued by the market.

          <h2>Advisors Suggest ETFs as an Accessible Entry Point for Investing in Alternatives</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 07:30:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a recent survey showing 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments like private equity and real estate, financial advisors recommend using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a practical way to gain exposure. Alternatives can be complex and illiquid, often requiring long lockup periods. However, ETFs that hold these assets can be traded freely, offering a more accessible and liquid option for retail investors. While interest in alternatives is growing, especially among younger investors, advisors still recommend they constitute a smaller portion of a portfolio, with traditional stocks and bonds remaining the core.

          <p>Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, defeating Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. The election was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner last month. Powell, who was sacked from the cabinet in September, ran on a platform of giving grassroots members a stronger voice and advocating for a "bolder" direction for the party in government. In her victory speech, she promised to be an ally to leader Keir Starmer but also to champion Labour values and bring critical perspectives to the party's core.</p>
