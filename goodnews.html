          <p>Adobe's stock price increased in extended trading after the company reported fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations. The design software giant posted adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share on revenue of $5.99 billion, exceeding consensus estimates. The company also provided an optimistic forecast for the fourth quarter, projecting revenue and earnings that are ahead of market predictions. This strong performance and positive outlook signal robust health in its digital media business, contrasting with its stock's underperformance earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has confirmed that goalkeeper Andre Onana is joining Turkish club Trabzonspor on a loan deal for the remainder of the 2025-26 season. The move was completed just before the Turkish transfer window closed. Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2m in 2023 by former manager Erik ten Hag, has not featured in the team's first three Premier League games this season under new coach Ruben Amorim. His only appearance came during a surprising Carabao Cup defeat, prompting the temporary transfer to secure more playing time.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that the recently merged Paramount Skydance is actively preparing an all-cash offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, causing shares of both companies to rise significantly. While no formal bid has been received, one could be presented as soon as next week. A merger would create a media titan, combining major film studios, numerous pay TV networks like CBS and CNN, and extensive sports rights portfolios under a single entity. This potential consolidation comes as the media industry continues to adapt to the disruptive shift from traditional pay TV to streaming services. (not investment advice)</p>

Bessent is leading the vetting process on behalf of the Trump administration and is also advocating for significant reforms at the central bank. These reforms include gradually reducing the Fed's large bond portfolio and diminishing its overall economic footprint. The selection process is occurring amid White House pressure for an interest rate cut to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Average interest rates for 30-year mortgages have fallen to 6.35%, their lowest level in almost a year, creating a potential opportunity for homebuyers and those considering refinancing. This decline is attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. While waiting for rates to drop further is a gamble, the current climate may justify taking action for those with higher existing mortgage rates. Experts advise that a rate reduction of at least one percentage point typically makes refinancing financially beneficial, though individual circumstances vary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that profits from U.S. projects funded by Japan's $550 billion investment will be shared equally between the two nations until Japan recoups its initial capital. After the investment is paid back, the profit-sharing model will shift to a 90/10 split in favor of the United States. This arrangement is part of a broader trade deal in which Japan agreed to the investment in exchange for a baseline tariff of 15%. The funds are intended to bolster U.S. domestic manufacturing in critical sectors like nuclear energy and pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Debate in Germany Questions the Relevance of Classic Literature in Modern School Curriculums</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in Germany over whether classic literary works, such as those by Goethe, should remain central to the high school curriculum. Critics and some students argue that the required reading lists are dominated by white male authors and lack relevance to the diverse experiences of today's youth. Proponents, including teacher associations, contend that classics are essential for understanding history and developing critical thinking. The discussion highlights a broader tension in the German education system between preserving cultural heritage and adapting to a multicultural society with evolving interests, like the #BookTok social media trend.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has experienced a surprising sales hit with its new "Kodak Charmera," a palm-sized digital toy camera inspired by 1980s aesthetics. The product, which comes in blind box packaging, sold out quickly on Kodak's website, tapping into Gen Z's appetite for vintage technology and nostalgic trends. This early success offers a potential bright spot for the historic photography company, which has been facing significant financial struggles, including a recent warning about its ability to continue operations. The strong demand suggests a viable market for products that blend retro style with modern digital convenience.</p>

          <p>Belarus has freed 52 political prisoners, including prominent activists and journalists, as part of an agreement with the Trump administration to secure an easing of U.S. sanctions. In exchange, the U.S. will allow the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, to purchase aircraft parts. The release was framed as a humanitarian gesture by authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who met with a U.S. special envoy to discuss rebuilding trade relations. While the move is a significant development, human rights groups note that over 1,000 political prisoners still remain incarcerated in the country.</p>
