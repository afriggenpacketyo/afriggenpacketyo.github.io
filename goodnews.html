          <p>France has denied allegations made by Telegram founder Pavel Durov regarding interference in Romania's presidential election, dismissing them as "completely unfounded." The French Foreign Ministry stated that the claims were a diversionary tactic from real threats of interference by Russia, referencing the annulled first round of elections due to electoral violations. The ministry also emphasized France's support for Romania's EU accession and military assistance. This denial underscores the tensions surrounding the integrity of democratic processes in Romania and the broader geopolitical context of foreign influence. </p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer Jos√© Alvarado has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for external testosterone under Major League Baseball‚Äôs drug-testing program. Alvarado accepted the suspension, which will make him ineligible for the postseason and cost him $4.5 million of his $9 million salary. Phillies' president Dave Dombrowski stated that the positive test resulted from a weight loss drug Alvarado took during the offseason, adding that the team must move forward with other closing options.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have released Chris Taylor, their longest-tenured position player, to make room for Tommy Edman's return from the injured list, marking the end of an era. Taylor, who was in the final season of a four-year, $60-million contract, had seen his production decline, leading to the emergence of rookie Hyeseong Kim. This move follows the release of Austin Barnes and represents a shift towards younger, more productive players. Taylor, once a key player for the Dodgers, struggled to regain his form after elbow surgery, leading to his departure.</p>
