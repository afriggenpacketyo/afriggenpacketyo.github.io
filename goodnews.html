          <h2>Trump Administration Investigates Aircraft Imports, Potentially Leading to New Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs. The Commerce Department will gather industry input on demand, foreign suppliers' roles, and government support for these businesses. Tariffs could negatively impact the aerospace industry, which relies on global suppliers but has historically maintained a trade surplus. Boeing and RTX have expressed concerns about the potential costs associated with these tariffs. The United States and Europe ended a 17-year fight over subsidies, agreeing to work together against China's dominance in major industries.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have declared an outbreak of hepatitis A, a highly contagious liver infection. The condition has infected at least 138 people in 2024, and cases have remained unusually high in 2025. Many of the recent cases have occurred in people without typical risk factors, leading to concerns about food contamination and community circulation. The best way to prevent hepatitis A is through vaccination, and good hygiene is also a wise protective measure.</p>

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada due to concerns that heat is damaging domestic crops. Henan province, which grows a third of China's wheat, issued a risk warning due to hot, dry weather. The purchases from Australia mark the first made by China from the country since last year. While China has large wheat inventories, there is no guarantee that more purchases will follow.</p>
