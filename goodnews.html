          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh has completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the importance of shark conservation. Pugh undertook the 12-day swim in the cold waters off the Massachusetts island, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the film "Jaws," to challenge negative perceptions of sharks. Despite facing harsh weather conditions and the psychological challenge of swimming in shark-inhabited waters, Pugh emphasized the urgent need to protect sharks, which are being killed at an unsustainable rate.

          <p>The European Union has stated that the fast-fashion website Shein is potentially breaching consumer laws with the use of fake discounts and pressure selling tactics. The EU is giving Shein one month to respond to its findings or face potential fines, and is investigating a broad range of practices that are in breach of EU law. The list of offenses includes misleading information, deceptive product labels, misleading sustainability claims, and hidden contact details. The EU has also asked Shein to make sure its product reviews and ratings are "not presented to consumers in a misleading manner."</p>

          <p>Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar walked from Budapest to northwestern Romania to gain support from ethnic Hungarians, a key voter group in Hungarian elections. Magyar's walk, part of a broader campaign against Prime Minister Viktor Orban, aims to address corruption and infrastructure issues. By focusing on ethnic Hungarian minorities, Magyar seeks to capitalize on Orban's political missteps and widen his appeal. Magyar's campaign emphasizes unity and reconciliation, contrasting with the polarized political atmosphere in Hungary, although the effect on voters remains to be seen.</p>
