          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has found a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a potential ban in the United States over national security concerns. In a television interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely. This development comes as the president has repeatedly delayed the enforcement of a law passed by Congress that mandates the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations.</p>
