          <p>Two volumes of the 2,300-year-old Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, considered the earliest known in China, have been returned to Beijing from the National Museum of Asian Art, part of the Smithsonian Institution in the United States. These manuscripts, dating back to the Warring States Period around 300BC, are historically significant and predate the Dead Sea Scrolls. The repatriation follows diplomatic efforts by China's National Cultural Heritage Administration, enabled by the Smithsonian's new ethical returns policy. The manuscripts were illegally excavated in 1942 and acquired by an American collector in 1946 before being gifted to the museum in 1992.</p>

          <p>Surgeons at UCLA and USC have performed the first human bladder transplant on a 41-year-old man who had lost bladder capacity due to cancer treatments. The procedure, part of a clinical trial involving four more patients, aims to offer a new treatment option for those with debilitating bladder conditions, potentially avoiding complications associated with using bowel tissue for bladder reconstruction. The patient, Oscar Larrainzar, reported feeling hopeful after the surgery, and doctors observed immediate kidney function and urine output. While potential organ rejection and immunosuppression remain risks, this marks a significant advancement in transplant medicine.</p>

          <p>Faced with the Trump administration's attempts to roll back environmental regulations, California is mounting a multi-pronged defense through litigation and legislation. The state has filed numerous lawsuits challenging federal actions, including those targeting California's clean air standards and cap-and-trade program. Additionally, California lawmakers are pursuing legislation to strengthen state-level environmental protections, such as requiring corporations to disclose carbon emissions and making polluters pay for climate damages. While the outcome of these battles remains uncertain, California is determined to safeguard its climate progress and continue leading the way on environmental policy.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science suggests that altering the way bricks are stacked in traditional kilns could significantly reduce air pollution in Bangladesh. The study found that by stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to increase airflow and ensuring more consistent coal fueling, fuel use dropped by about 23 percent, potentially reducing carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by 20%. This simple intervention also improved worker conditions and saved kiln owners money, making it a feasible and cost-effective solution for reducing pollution in the region.</p>
