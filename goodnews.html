          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who has a congenital disability, is highlighting the significant accessibility challenges within the Houses of Parliament. Despite the passage of the Equalities Act fifteen years ago, she points to persistent issues like heavy doors with unsuitable handles and long distances to accessible facilities. Tidball is advocating for systemic changes to make the historic buildings more inclusive for disabled individuals, ensuring that Parliament better reflects the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities. While some minor improvements have been made, a modernization committee is reviewing more substantial reforms to address these long-standing barriers.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, is recognized as a pioneering example of national park architecture. Built in 1904, it was designed by Robert Reamer, who utilized uniquely twisted and gnarled wood from some 10,000 trees, earning them the nickname 'freaks of the forest.' Once advertised as the world's largest log cabin, the inn has hosted millions of visitors and set a stylistic precedent for other grand lodges in national parks like Yosemite and Glacier. Today, a dedicated team of carpenters works to preserve its historic character while ensuring its structural integrity for future generations.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Tom Odell discusses the unexpected turns in his career, including learning that one of his 2016 performances inspired Finneas O'Connell and Billie Eilish to pursue their music. After early success with his hit 'Another Love,' Odell faced a period of mainstream obscurity before finding a new audience on TikTok, which propelled his song 'Black Friday' to global success. This resurgence has allowed him the creative and financial freedom to record his new, more introspective album, 'A Wonderful Life,' with his live band. He reflects on the vulnerability in his music and how connecting with audiences over shared feelings has been a profound experience.</p>

          <p>Cole Hauser, known for his role as Rip Wheeler on the popular series "Yellowstone," has shared some of his strange experiences with fans since his rise to fame. The actor noted that while most encounters are respectful, he has been in situations where some older female fans have become overly familiar, especially after having a few drinks. Hauser, who will reprise his role in an upcoming "Yellowstone" spin-off, takes the interactions in stride. The new series, with a working title of "The Dutton Ranch," will also star Kelly Reilly and Annette Bening, continuing the story from where the original show concluded.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spending by England's Premier League clubs during the summer transfer window has shattered previous records, surpassing £3 billion for the first time. The total outlay was significantly higher than last summer's £1.96 billion and exceeded the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. The record was broken following a series of major deadline-day deals, including Alexander Isak's £125 million move to Liverpool. This spending surge highlights the immense financial power of the Premier League, which increasingly functions as the economic engine of the European football transfer market.

          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is receiving early Oscar buzz for his transformative role as UFC fighter Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." Johnson stated he had a "burning desire" to take on a more intense and raw character after years of being "pigeon-holed" into blockbuster action roles. He described the part as life-changing and a welcome opportunity to explore deeper emotional territory, something he felt he had shied away from in the past. Directed by Benny Safdie, the film focuses on Kerr's battles with substance abuse and his complex personal relationships outside the ring.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group of 10 Eurasian countries including China, Russia, and India, has formally decided to establish a new development bank. The initiative aims to create a financial institution that can help member nations insulate themselves from the risks associated with the U.S. dollar-dominated global trade system. Analysts suggest the bank will accelerate key infrastructure projects and strengthen economic ties within the bloc. The move is seen as a logical step to increase financial autonomy and foster regional cooperation among the member states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating on calcite formed on the skull, researchers have placed it firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of conflicting estimates. The fossil, often attributed to the species Homo heidelbergensis, possesses features distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans. This new dating strengthens the theory that this more primitive human population coexisted with early Neanderthals, adding complexity to our understanding of Europe's prehistoric human landscape.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom. The heightened visibility is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which is causing charged solar particles to interact more intensely with Earth's magnetic field. While northern regions typically have the best views, the phenomenon could potentially be seen as far south as the Midlands. Officials advise that clear, dark skies away from city light pollution will offer the best opportunity for a rare and memorable display.</p>
