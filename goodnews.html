          <p>On the 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake, experts are reflecting on its enduring lessons for California's seismic preparedness. The temblor revealed the extreme danger of unreinforced brick buildings, a vulnerability that took decades to address through mandatory retrofitting laws in some, but not all, cities. The article highlights that many areas still lack requirements for strengthening other types of at-risk structures, underscoring a persistent reluctance to enforce property mandates despite known dangers.</p>

          <p>B√§rbel Bas, a politician with a working-class background from Duisburg, has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD), serving alongside Lars Klingbeil. Her election is viewed as a move to provide a left-wing balance to the more conservative Klingbeil and to help rebuild the party following a disastrous recent election result. In her acceptance speech, Bas, who also serves as Germany's labor minister, emphasized solidarity and social justice, earning strong 95% support from party delegates.</p>

Tuipulotu noted that the team is successfully blending the dominant Irish coaching style with the individual instincts of key players, creating a dynamic and hard-to-defend strategy.</p>

          <p>This article provides a look into NPR's standards for using unnamed sources in its journalism, a practice reserved for stories of vital public interest that could not otherwise be reported.

Senior editors must approve any use of anonymity after carefully vetting the source's credibility and the necessity of their information, and the reason for anonymity is always clearly explained to the audience.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by a unanimous points decision in a cruiserweight contest in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Ch√°vez Jr. appeared passive and threw very few punches for most of the bout, much to the visible frustration of his legendary father at ringside. Despite being booed by the crowd, the 28-year-old Paul called the victory "easy work" and stated his readiness to challenge for a world title next.</p>
