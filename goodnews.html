          <p>Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith have strongly defended his conduct against an ethics probe into his investigations of President Trump, labeling the accusations as "imaginary and unfounded." The Office of the Special Counsel, a separate federal agency, launched the probe into potential Hatch Act violations concerning Smith's handling of cases related to classified documents and the 2020 election. Smith's attorneys asserted that he was fiercely committed to evidence-based prosecutorial decisions, followed DOJ guidelines, and did not allow political influence to sway his actions. They argued that the investigation is premised on a partisan complaint that inappropriately suggests justice should yield to political contests, which is antithetical to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Okta, an identity software maker, saw its shares rise after reporting fiscal results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year. CEO Todd McKinnon attributed the strong performance to economic conditions being "better than we thought," despite increased scrutiny from U.S. government customers following the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency. The article notes the company's net retention rate remained stable and McKinnon anticipates future growth from the need for identity management software for AI agents and selling software suites. Okta also announced the acquisition of Axiom Security and provided an optimistic fiscal 2026 forecast, exceeding analyst consensus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard offloaded over 76,000 pounds of illegal drugs, including cocaine and marijuana, in Florida, marking the largest single drug seizure in its history. Valued at $473 million, the immense quantity of cocaine alone could potentially deliver 23 million lethal doses, underscoring the significant threat posed by transnational drug trafficking to the nation. This successful operation, dubbed "Operation Pacific Viper," is a key part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to disrupt drug cartel activity in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea before illicit substances reach American shores. Various U.S. and international agencies, including the U.S. Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy, participated in the 19 interdictions that led to this record haul, resulting in the detention of 34 suspected drug traffickers.</p>

          <p>Nvidia, a leading AI computing technology provider, is poised to release its earnings report, which is highly anticipated due to its market-moving implications. While strong sales and earnings are expected, investors will focus on the magnitude of the beat, as merely meeting expectations could disappoint. The article highlights four key questions: potential customer delays in GB200 orders awaiting the newer GB300 chip, the impact of GB300 production ramp-up on profit margins, clarity on Blackwell chip's total cost of ownership benefits, and the uncertain future of China sales given revised export rules and local pushback. Commentary on networking sales and cloud partnerships is also awaited. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>EchoStar's stock surged over 70% after AT&T announced an agreement to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses for approximately $23 billion in an all-cash deal. This transaction, expected to close in mid-2026 pending regulatory approval, will add about 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network across over 400 U.S. markets. EchoStar stated the sale is part of its efforts to address Federal Communications Commission inquiries regarding its 5G network compliance, following complaints from Elon Musk's SpaceX about underused spectrum. The agreement also expands a network services deal, enabling EchoStar to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator under the Boost Mobile brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 16:12:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors aged 62 or older, a reverse mortgage could be a particularly smart financial move this September, especially with average home equity levels hitting a record high. This article highlights that homeowners can access significant borrowable equity, potentially $200,000 or more, without the immediate stress of monthly repayments. Opting for a reverse mortgage also eliminates concerns about the volatile interest rate climate, as it avoids variable rates seen in HELOCs. Furthermore, it offers a viable solution for paying down high-rate credit card debt, which currently hovers around 22%, allowing seniors to regain financial independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Spanish Civil Guard has successfully dismantled an illegal animal trafficking ring, uncovering over 150 exotic animals, including several endangered and protected species, at an unauthorized pet store in Nules, Valencia. Two men, aged 30 and 35, were found to be selling these animals online without the necessary permits and are now being prosecuted for trafficking protected species and smuggling. The investigation commenced after officers discovered online listings and videos showcasing animals like leopards, ring-tailed lemurs, and Asian otters, some of which hold the highest international protection status. Three macaws found at the site had been reported stolen, and the collective market value of the seized animals is estimated at nearly $81,500.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential movement of gold prices in September 2025, noting the precious metal's significant surge of 64% since early 2024, despite a recent dip from record highs. Predicting gold's price is complex due to various influencing factors. There's a chance prices could fall if August inflation declines, given gold's inverse relationship with inflation, which would reduce the need for alternative assets. However, if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, which is increasingly likely, gold prices could rise, as lower rates typically increase demand for the metal. The article advises investors seeking inflation hedges or diversification to consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging to invest regardless of short-term price changes.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $815 million for Wednesday night's drawing, making it the seventh largest in the game's history, after no winning tickets were sold for Monday night's $750 million grand prize. The estimated cash value for this substantial prize is $367.9 million, both figures being before taxes. The jackpot is anticipated to grow even further as public interest and ticket sales intensify leading up to the drawing. A single jackpot winner has the option to choose between a lump sum payment or an annuity, which provides one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year. This surge follows the last jackpot winner on May 31, and the odds of winning the top prize remain 1 in 292.2 million.</p>
