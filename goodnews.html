          <p>French authorities suspect arson may have caused a major power outage in southeast France, disrupting the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. The outage, affecting approximately 160,000 households, was attributed to a fire at an electrical substation and a fallen high-voltage line, both under investigation for possible arson. Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony and all scheduled events would proceed as planned, thanks to an independent power supply. Traffic lights and train services were also affected by the outage, causing traffic jams and confusion.</p>
