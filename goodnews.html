          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its policy interest rate steady at 2.5%, prioritizing financial stability amidst concerns over Seoul's rapidly rising housing prices and household debt. This move comes after a rate cut in May, but recent data showed a significant acceleration in housing costs and a surge in household loans, prompting the central bank to pause and evaluate the impact of recent cooling measures. The decision highlights the challenge of balancing economic growth with the risks posed by the country's unique "jeonse" rental deposit system, which contributes to high levels of household debt.

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA. This appointment follows the president's withdrawal of his previous nominee, billionaire Jared Isaacman, citing concerns over Isaacman's Democratic political donations and his professional relationship with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX holds major NASA contracts. Duffy takes the helm at a critical time for the space agency, as it continues its mission to return astronauts to the moon and eventually land humans on Mars. The move adds Duffy to a list of Trump administration officials serving in dual roles.</p>

          <p>The family of Army Reservist Sgt. Kennedy Sanders, who was killed in a drone attack in Jordan, has received her lost cellphone more than a year after her death. The phone, which the family believed was destroyed, was found on the base by another staff sergeant who located her mother's contact information. The device contained videos and photos the family had never seen, providing a profound and unexpected connection to their daughter's final months. The family described the return of the phone and its precious memories as a "gift" that helps them relive her best moments.</p>

          <p>A tentative contract agreement has been reached between the city of Philadelphia and its blue-collar workers, ending an eight-day strike that had disrupted city services. The strike, involving 9,000 workers including sanitation staff and 911 dispatchers, had led to piles of trash accumulating across the city during a summer heatwave. The new three-year deal includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, which is significantly less than the union's initial demands. Workers returned to their jobs immediately, and the city expects trash cleanup to be completed by the weekend.</p>
