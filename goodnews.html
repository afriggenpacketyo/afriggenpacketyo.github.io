          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion for licensing fees and compensation. This move, which is not an acquisition, gives Google a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology while the startup remains independent. The deal underscores the intense "talent war" in the AI sector, where major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are aggressively competing to hire top researchers and engineers. Windsurf, known for its "vibe coding" tools, had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by substantial inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a single day last week, these ETFs recorded $1.18 billion in inflows, their largest of the year, signaling strong institutional buying interest. Analysts suggest this momentum could push the cryptocurrency's value even higher in the near term. The rally is also supported by anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation, which aims to provide a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry and has received backing from the Trump administration.

          <h2>China's June Exports Grow Faster Than Expected as Shipments to Non-U.S. Markets Increase</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June compared to the previous year, surpassing economists' expectations and indicating resilience in its trade sector. This growth was largely driven by a 16.8% surge in shipments to Southeast Asian nations and a 7.6% jump to the European Union, which helped offset a continued decline in exports to the United States. Meanwhile, imports saw their first year-over-year growth of 2025, rising 1.1%, although this was slightly below forecasts. The data reflects Chinese exporters' successful diversification efforts amid ongoing trade tensions and a temporary tariff truce with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indian government is proposing a new rule that would require all new air conditioners to have a minimum thermostat setting of 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit). The initiative aims to generate massive energy savings in a country with a rapidly growing market for AC units, where officials estimate each degree increase saves about 6% on energy consumption. This measure is part of a broader effort to manage India's rising electricity demand, which is straining the power grid and contributing to carbon emissions. While some citizens support the move, others express concern about comfort during extreme heat waves.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the second quarter of 2025, successfully avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the first quarter. The growth, which beat economists' forecasts, was primarily led by a strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Analysts attribute the positive turn to factors like the temporary U.S.-China tariff truce, which may have prompted businesses to front-load exports. Despite the better-than-expected results, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the second half of the year.
