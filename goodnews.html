          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court for emergency access to the Social Security Administration's systems via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). A federal judge previously blocked this access, citing Privacy Act concerns and violations of agency rulemaking processes, arguing that it exposed a 'wide fissure' in the expectation of privacy. The administration is appealing after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined to halt the injunction, with the case raising significant questions about government access to citizens' personal information.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese bargain retailer, has altered its business model in the U.S. following the end of the de minimis tariff exemption and the imposition of new tariffs on Chinese goods. The company has shifted to sourcing products from U.S.-based warehouses and recruiting local sellers to circumvent higher levies, while maintaining unchanged prices for U.S. shoppers. This move comes as the Trump administration's new rules on low-value shipments take effect, forcing Temu to adapt its operations and pricing strategy.</p>

The author visits Finland during its bleakest month to explore whether the country remains mirthful even in gloom. The article questions the measurement of happiness, noting the subjective nature of the Cantril Ladder question used in the report and highlighting surprising discrepancies in the rankings, and contrasts Finland's approach to happiness with that of the United States, where happiness is often seen as a personal pursuit rather than a societal outcome.</p>
