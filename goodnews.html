          <p>Twelve members of an extended family, spread across three states, were diagnosed with histoplasmosis after visiting the Venado Caves in Costa Rica. The family members experienced symptoms such as headaches, fever, and respiratory issues, beginning 8 to 19 days after exposure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has alerted health departments and is working with the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica to inform the public about the risks of contracting histoplasmosis during cave tours. The Venado Caves have been linked to a previous histoplasmosis outbreak in 1998‚Äì1999, and the CDC is now collaborating with the Costa Rican Ministry of Health to include risk information in tour waivers.</p>

This statement comes as Beijing and Washington continue to trade swipes at each other, despite tariff de-escalation following a meeting in Switzerland earlier this month. Chinese authorities pushed back against a U.S. decision that warned companies not to use Chinese-made artificial intelligence chips, particularly those provided by Huawei Technologies.</p>

Starting in June, two squads of 11 horses will perform two services a day, totaling about 10 funerals per week.

          <p>Dr. Maher Abdallah, director of American Reproductive Centers in Palm Springs, vowed to rebuild after a targeted bombing nearly destroyed his clinic. Despite the destruction, the clinic's in vitro fertilization lab remained intact, and thousands of frozen eggs, sperm, and embryos were unharmed. Of the 14 embryos dividing at the time of the attack, eight had become "perfect blastocysts." The bombing, labeled as domestic terrorism, injured four people and killed the suspect, who had "antinatalist" ideations. Abdallah forgave the suspect and is focusing on the future, with the clinic temporarily relocating to a surgical center.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season in 2025, with 13 to 19 named storms expected. Six to 10 of those storms are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes. The forecast is influenced by the neutral phase of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation cycle, warmer than average ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear. NOAA emphasizes the importance of preparedness and has upgraded its forecasting model to increase the accuracy of storm tracking.</p>
