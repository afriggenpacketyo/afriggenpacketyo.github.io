        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its key interest rate to 20%, marking the first reduction since September 2022, signaling a potential easing of inflation pressures that had previously been described as "alarming" by President Vladimir Putin. The decision comes as the inflation rate in April dropped to 6.2%, a decrease from the 8.2% average recorded in the first quarter of 2025. Despite domestic demand still outpacing the supply of goods and services, the central bank believes the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path, though tight monetary policy will remain in place to achieve the 4% inflation target. Russia's economy has faced immense strain on prices due to its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, leading to a weaker ruble and the need to re-orient the economy. Optimism for a lasting ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine has waned. The score for this article is 60.</p>
