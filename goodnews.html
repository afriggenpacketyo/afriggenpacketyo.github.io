          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a hardline conservative and former Economic Security Minister, has been chosen as the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. Her immediate challenges include addressing inflation, managing diplomatic relations, and maintaining her party's coalition, which is threatened by her conservative stances. Takaichi's rise has drawn attention from international leaders, including former U.S. President Trump, as she navigates the complexities of forming a stable government. The stability of her leadership will depend on her ability to secure cooperation from opposition parties.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed the routine protests and death threats she has faced since her appointment, stating she is "not afraid" and refuses to let emotions guide her decisions. Discussing her new book, she explains her commitment to originalism, a judicial philosophy she adopted from her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Barrett emphasized that the Court must take a long-term view of the presidency, not the individual president, when deciding cases involving the executive branch. The article portrays her as a justice with a disciplined mindset who remains unfazed by public criticism.</p>

          <p>During the Sanderson Farms Championship in Mississippi, PGA Tour golfer Vince Whaley had a close encounter with a 6-foot alligator while playing a shot from near a water hazard. The reptile remained stationary about 20 feet away as Whaley, with his caddie keeping watch, successfully executed the shot and managed to save par on the hole. Whaley later commented that his plan, had the alligator moved closer, was simply to "get the hell out of the water." The unusual moment provided a brief and tense distraction during the final round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Doan's Bakery in Los Angeles has issued a voluntary recall for its White Chocolate Coconut cake, a dessert famously gifted by actor Tom Cruise to his friends and colleagues during the holidays. The recall, which also includes the bakery's Carrot Bundt cake, was initiated after a routine inspection discovered the products contained undeclared wheat and milk. According to the FDA, these undeclared allergens pose a serious risk to individuals with specific food allergies. The bakery has since updated its labeling, and no illnesses related to the issue have been reported.</p>

The court did not provide an explanation for its decision to decline the case. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Her legal team expressed disappointment but stated they would continue to explore other legal options.

          <p>Argentina's government has implemented stricter quality standards for sorghum exports, a move designed to solidify its position as a key supplier to China. The new rules set minimum test weights and limit impurities, aligning Argentine standards with the requirements of more demanding international markets. This policy shift comes as China has become Argentina's primary sorghum buyer since 2021, a market once dominated by the United States. The measure could introduce new trade tensions with the U.S., which has seen its agricultural exports impacted by global trade shifts and tariffs.</p>

          <p>Despite a widespread push from major corporations for employees to return to the office, work-from-home rates have remained stable since early 2023. Stanford professor Nick Bloom attributes this to a "growing compliance gap," where workers engage in passive resistance against RTO mandates. Tactics include "coffee badging"—showing up for only a few hours—and "micro-shifting" work schedules, often with the tacit approval of middle managers who are reluctant to enforce unpopular rules. This trend indicates that while companies are issuing mandates, many workers are retaining flexibility on their own terms, sometimes leading them to quit for more accommodating employers.</p>

Economic factors such as inflation and employment data create a "cloudy" outlook, but the consensus is that significant fluctuations are unlikely. The government shutdown has also delayed key economic reports, reinforcing expectations that rates will hold steady for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts are advising that recent tax law changes enacted under the Trump administration could impact strategies for year-end charitable donations. A key change starting in 2026 will introduce a new tax break for non-itemizers, making it potentially advantageous for some to delay smaller gifts until the new year. Conversely, higher earners may see their charitable deduction benefits reduced in 2026 due to a new deduction floor and a cap on the benefit for top tax brackets. This could incentivize them to accelerate donations this year through tools like donor-advised funds. (not investment advice)</p>

This article argues that while the decision may be burdensome for schools, it offers an opportunity to practice genuine pluralism by accommodating different viewpoints. The case originated when a Maryland school district removed an opt-out option for books discussing LGBTQ identities. The author contends that true inclusion requires reciprocity and that accommodating religious families, rather than coercing them, strengthens public education as a shared civic institution.</p>
