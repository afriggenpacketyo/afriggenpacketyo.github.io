          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 19:13:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university spot, even if they narrowly miss their grades. This leniency is attributed to financial uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment, making domestic undergraduates a more stable source of income for institutions. The trend emerges as UK universities face significant financial strain, with over 40% expecting to be in a deficit. Concurrently, tuition fees for domestic students are set to rise for the first time since 2017, from £9,250 to £9,535 for the upcoming academic year.</p>

The company reported earnings of 65 cents per share on revenue of $3.28 billion, beating the expected 44 cents per share and $3.16 billion in revenue. This represents a 25% year-over-year revenue increase, with the company achieving a net income of $285 million compared to a loss in the same period last year. The positive report reflects a 20% rise in total orders and a 23% increase in gross order value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italy has approved the construction of the Strait of Messina Bridge, a $15.5 billion project that will connect the island of Sicily to the mainland. The bridge is designed to be the world's longest suspension bridge, spanning over two miles and capable of handling 6,000 cars per hour and 200 trains daily. The project, first proposed in 1969, has been revived by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's administration after decades of debate. Opponents raise significant concerns about potential infiltration by organized crime, environmental impact, and seismic risks from the active Messina fault line, which caused a devastating earthquake in 1908.</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Find Evidence of Post-Eruption Settlement in the Ruins of Pompeii</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 18:39:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research suggests that people returned to live in Pompeii after its catastrophic destruction by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Evidence indicates that some survivors, possibly unable to afford relocating, established a precarious settlement among the ruins, living in the upper floors of buried homes. This informal community, which may have also attracted others seeking shelter, appears to have persisted until the 5th century. The findings challenge the long-held perception of Pompeii as a completely abandoned city, revealing a previously overlooked chapter of resilience and reoccupation in its history.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins, the co-chief executive of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, has resigned from his position. His departure comes just one day before the finalization of David Ellison's Skydance Media's $8.4 billion acquisition of the entertainment giant. The move was anticipated, as Skydance had previously unveiled a new leadership team for the film division that did not include Robbins. Longtime Skydance executives Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein will now co-chair the studio. Robbins, who had been with the company since 2017, oversaw major franchises like "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Mission: Impossible" during his tenure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Open has announced a total prize money purse of $90 million for its 2025 tournament, which organizers are calling the largest in tennis history. This represents a 20% increase from the previous year's $75 million fund. The men's and women's singles champions will each receive $5 million, a significant 39% raise from the $3.6 million awarded in 2024. Even players who exit in the first round will see a 10% pay increase, with their earnings rising to $110,000. The substantial increase positions the U.S. Open's prize money well above that of other Grand Slam tournaments like Wimbledon.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, Apple has announced it will increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion over the next four years. This new commitment brings the company's total planned domestic spending to $600 billion. The investment aims to encourage more of Apple's parts manufacturing to be based in the U.S. and includes plans for new data centers and a smart glass production facility in Kentucky. The announcement came as President Trump detailed a new 100% tariff on imported semiconductors, from which companies investing in the U.S., like Apple, would be exempt.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated there is a "good chance" he will soon meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The statement followed a meeting in Moscow between Putin and Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, which the U.S. president described as "highly productive." This diplomatic development occurs just days before a Friday deadline set by Trump, who has demanded Russia agree to a ceasefire or face significant new sanctions, including secondary sanctions against its trading partners. The White House confirmed that Russia had suggested a meeting and that President Trump is open to the trilateral summit.</p>

Firefly, which develops rockets and lunar landers, recently won a $177 million NASA contract and successfully landed its Blue Ghost vehicle on the moon. The strong pricing reflects rising investor interest in the space technology sector, following a trend of successful IPOs in a reopening market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comparison of savings options shows that a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) currently offers a slightly higher and more secure return than a money market account for a $10,000 deposit. With current rates, a 6-month CD at 4.45% would earn approximately $220, while a money market account at 4.32% would yield about $214. The key difference is that the CD rate is locked for the term, guaranteeing the return. In contrast, money market account rates are variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, potentially widening the earnings gap in favor of the CD.

          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking shoe on the shore of Fish Lake, Utah, has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing in 1997. Investigators used the manufacturing date of the shoe to link it to the 28-year-old cold case. White had disappeared while on a fishing trip, with only his empty boat, a shoe, and a hat found at the time. A five-day search yielded no further evidence. DNA testing on the recently discovered remains confirmed a parental match with his daughter, finally bringing a measure of closure to the family and the original searchers.</p>
