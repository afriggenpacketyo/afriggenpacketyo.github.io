          <h2>Japan's Free High School Policy Sparks Concerns of Public School Exodus</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 03:29:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's new policy of making high school tuition virtually free, even for private institutions, is causing concern among educators and policy experts who fear it may lead to a decline in public school enrollment and exacerbate inequalities. While intended to alleviate financial burdens on households amid inflation, critics argue the policy lacks adequate support for struggling public schools already facing enrollment and budget challenges. Some public schools are adapting by offering unique courses and tailored education, but face challenges in attracting students compared to private schools that promote global education. The government's focus has been primarily on financial relief, with limited discussion on the policy's broader impact on the education system. The potential shift away from public schools has educators worried about the future of public education in Japan.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents discovered and disabled a nearly 3,000-foot-long narcotics smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel, found during construction in early April, ran under the Otay Mesa Port of Entry with a projected exit near a commercial warehouse. Equipped with lighting, ventilation, and a track system, the tunnel reached depths of 50 feet. Authorities found the entrance in a Tijuana house, recently covered with new tile, and plan to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent its use by Foreign Terrorist Organizations. This discovery marks the decommissioning of over 95 tunnels in the San Diego area since 1993.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp.'s top executive, Eiji Hashimoto, expressed confidence that the U.S. government's oversight role in its $14.1 billion acquisition of United States Steel Corp. will not hinder the U.S. unit's business operations. Despite conditions such as an $11 billion investment in U.S. Steel and a golden share issued to the U.S. government, Hashimoto believes the deal is rational and ensures profitability for both companies. The acquisition makes Nippon Steel the world's fourth-largest steelmaker and aims to expand its global capacity, allowing it to tap into the growing U.S. demand for high-grade steel used in electric vehicles. Hashimoto emphasized that trade levies alone will not revive the U.S. manufacturing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster discovered in London, revealing details of a luxurious Roman villa. The frescoes, from at least 20 walls, depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area. The team hopes to find a missing fragment bearing the artist's name. The discovery reveals a thriving settlement outside central Roman London, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London," demonstrating the Romans' commitment to settling and investing in the city.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has halted NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands over wide-ranging deals made with China, citing a breach of trust. The deals, covering infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration, were struck in February without New Zealand's prior knowledge. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters stated that funding relies on a high-trust bilateral relationship and that fresh funding will not be considered until the Cook Islands takes steps to repair the relationship. The Cook Islands responded by saying it highly values New Zealand's assistance and is committed to addressing the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to legally skirt higher duties imposed by the U.S. government. This practice involves changing an item's materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into a different "harmonized system code" with lower tariff rates. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum, or altering materials in clothing and footwear to qualify for lower duties. While not inherently illegal, companies must carefully balance product redesign with accurately representing product classifications to avoid fraudulent misrepresentation. This strategy allows companies to reduce their duty liability by leveraging strategic design choices.</p>

          <p>According to Zillow, specific room paint colors can boost a home's sale price, with olive green kitchens, navy blue bedrooms, and dark gray living rooms being particularly desirable. An olive green kitchen can increase the sale price by up to $1,600, while navy blue bedrooms can add an estimated $1,815 to the value. Staging a home and removing personal belongings can also benefit sellers by increasing sale prices and reducing the amount of time a listing sits on the market. By contrast, bright and playful colors can deter buyers and reduce a home's sale price.</p>
