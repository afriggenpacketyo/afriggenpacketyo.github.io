          <p>Japan is set to enforce rules on the phonetic readings of children's names to curb the use of "kirakira names," which are unusual or flashy readings of Chinese characters. This action is part of a revised law requiring all names in the national family registry to include phonetic readings. The move aims to prevent interpretations considered too disconnected from the characters used, reflecting growing concern over the increasing trend of unconventional name pronunciations.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still addressing police reform efforts, according to Police Chief Brian O'Hara, who assumed his role in November 2022.

O'Hara is focused on restoring trust within the community by emphasizing basic policing principles and changing the department's culture. He aims to reduce crime while building community relationships, even as federal oversight diminishes.</p>
