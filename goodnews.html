          <p>UFC legend Georges St. Pierre voiced his hope for Conor McGregor's return to the Octagon, noting the positive impact McGregor's fights have on the sport. St. Pierre emphasized that McGregor brings significant attention and revenue to mixed martial arts, making him a major figure in the sport's promotion. McGregor, who last fought in July 2021, had a scheduled fight at UFC 303 canceled due to an injury, and has stated he would only return if the fight were in a stadium. Dana White has previously expressed reservations about hosting fights at stadiums due to production challenges and the potential impact on the fan experience.</p>
