          <p>Robinhood's stock surged to a record high following the announcement of tokenized shares for private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX, available to its European users.

While the company is promoting the launch with a giveaway, regulatory hurdles currently prevent a similar offering for U.S. customers, though crypto staking for certain coins has been newly introduced in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its laundry appliance manufacturing from China to a new plant in Kentucky, a decision accelerated by President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. The move is expected to create 800 new American jobs in roles such as engineering and supply chain management, with the new facility projected to be operational by early 2027. While the company states the reshoring aligns with its philosophy of producing goods close to consumers, it acknowledges that the tariffs made the decision more financially urgent.</p>
