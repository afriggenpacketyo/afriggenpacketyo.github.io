Lohan credits her move and the rise of social media with allowing her to reclaim her own narrative and separate her public and private lives.

          <p>Miami's historic Freedom Tower, which processed over half a million Cuban refugees, is reopening as a museum, stirring deep memories for those who passed through it. The article recounts the story of Jorge Malagón Márquez, who arrived as a traumatized five-year-old in 1967 after soldiers in Havana destroyed his teddy bear. The newly refurbished tower features exhibits on Cuban migration, including personal video testimonies, aiming to preserve the stories of those who sought refuge and opportunity in the United States. The restoration seeks to capture the human experience of seeking freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's 'no tax on tips' provision, part of his larger legislative package, is causing questions and uncertainty among tipped workers. The measure offers a temporary deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income, but it does not eliminate state or payroll taxes on those earnings. Key details remain unclear, including which occupations qualify and how employers must report tips for them to be eligible for the deduction. While intended as a tax break, some workers feel the benefit is being misunderstood and may not be as straightforward as it seems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book by Mallary Tenore Tarpley, titled "SLIP," delves into the reality of living in the 'middle place' of eating disorder recovery, between acute illness and a complete cure. The author combines memoir and research to discuss how shifting away from a perfectionist, all-or-nothing approach has allowed her to live a full life. The article highlights the importance of accepting setbacks and normalizing slips as part of a more attainable and compassionate recovery process. This perspective is particularly relevant as diet culture experiences a resurgence in popular media.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those concerned with animal welfare but facing challenges with a strict vegetarian diet, this article offers pragmatic solutions. It suggests a 'reducetarian' approach, which focuses on meaningfully decreasing, rather than completely eliminating, animal consumption. Practical advice includes choosing pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products, eating larger animals like cows less frequently than smaller ones like chickens, and being mindful of misleading food labels. The goal is to balance personal well-being with a serious commitment to reducing animal suffering in a manageable way.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to place a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the moon by the end of the decade, a move seen as critical for establishing a permanent human settlement. This article argues that nuclear power is essential for a lunar base to survive the extreme cold of the 14-day lunar nights. The push is also framed as a geopolitical necessity to counter a planned Chinese-Russian lunar base, which is slated to have an even more powerful reactor. A U.S. base could become a global commons for scientific research, such as radio astronomy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing the threat of diminishing water supplies from traditional sources due to climate change, Southern California is actively planning to avoid a future 'Day Zero' crisis. Water agencies are pursuing a diversified strategy that includes building a massive wastewater recycling facility, capturing more stormwater, and potentially investing in desalination. These costly, large-scale projects are designed to create a more resilient and sustainable local water supply for the region's 19 million people. The goal is to prepare for longer droughts and more extreme weather patterns.</p>

          <h2>Can 'Sponge Cities' Offer a Solution to Los Angeles's Water Management Woes?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As cities like Los Angeles face intensifying floods and droughts, some are looking to the 'sponge city' model for solutions. This approach, exemplified by a new park in Bangkok, uses green infrastructure like wetlands and porous landscapes to absorb and clean stormwater, rather than flushing it away through concrete channels. This method helps mitigate flooding, replenishes groundwater, and provides community and aesthetic benefits. While L.A. has initiated similar projects through its Safe Clean Water Program, progress has been slow due to bureaucratic hurdles and high costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat the overwhelming problem of single-use waste, a growing movement is promoting reusable food-ware systems. A recent 12-week pilot program in Petaluma, California, tested this concept by offering consumers free, reusable beverage cups at 30 local stores, which could be returned to collection bins around the city. The program, sponsored by a consortium including major corporations, achieved a return rate over 50%, surpassing the environmental break-even point compared to single-use cups. Organizers credit the success to building community pride rather than relying on monetary incentives.</p>
