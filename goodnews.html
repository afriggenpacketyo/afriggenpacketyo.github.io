        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior White House official indicated that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are likely to speak this week following recent trade tensions. Discussions come after disagreements over the scaling back of tariffs and accusations of undermining previous agreements. The U.S. has accused China of delaying critical mineral exports, while China criticized the U.S. for issuing warnings against using Chinese chips, leading to heightened uncertainty in bilateral economic relations. The leaders' conversation aims to address these issues and potentially stabilize the trade relationship between the two countries. Optimism remains that a resolution can be reached to avoid further economic friction.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano, erupted on Monday, releasing a lava fountain and a large ash cloud over Sicily. The eruption was caused by the collapse of part of the volcano's southeast crater, resulting in lava flows down the mountain. Authorities blocked off the summit area to tour groups as a precaution, but there were no immediate reports of danger to the local population. Mount Etna frequently erupts, sometimes covering nearby towns in volcanic dust, but typically without causing major problems.</p>

The increase is primarily attributed to the popularity of the revamped Model Y SUV and recent price campaigns.

Norway's strong EV incentives and infrastructure contribute to its leadership in electric vehicle adoption, creating a favorable market for Tesla.</p>
