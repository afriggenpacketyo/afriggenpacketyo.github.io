          <p>The England Lionesses are using the mantra "proper English" to drive their performance at the Euro 2025 tournament. The phrase, first used by Millie Bright, signifies a return to core English football values like tenacity, defensive solidity, and hard work. Following a disappointing opening loss to France, the team embraced this identity to secure a convincing 4-0 victory against the Netherlands. This renewed focus on their roots, combined with manager Sarina Wiegman's tactical flexibility, has revived their campaign as they aim to defend their title.</p>

The spacecraft and its Long March-7 Y10 carrier rocket have been moved to the launch pad at the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site. The mission will deliver essential supplies to the astronauts currently on board the station. Among the cargo are two new sets of advanced, domestically developed spacesuits designed for extended use and specialized devices to help astronauts counteract muscle atrophy in microgravity.</p>

          <p>While many college students believe a finance degree offers the best career prospects, recent data suggests otherwise, with several other fields showing lower unemployment rates. A CFA Institute survey found high confidence in finance careers, but New York Fed data indicates majors like art history and nutritional sciences have better employment outcomes. The report also highlights a rising demand for humanities majors, as companies like BlackRock seek graduates with creative thinking and soft skills, which are becoming more valuable in an AI-driven economy. This challenges traditional assumptions about which degrees provide the most job security. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new “Superman” movie has faced preemptive criticism from some commentators for being “superwoke,” largely based on director James Gunn’s acknowledgment of the character as an immigrant. However, an analysis of the film argues this backlash is overblown, as Superman's origin has always been an immigrant story. The article contends that the movie's themes are more about assimilation, kindness, and American heartland values than radical politics. It suggests that unlike other comic book narratives, Superman's story has rarely delved deeply into the systemic issues faced by immigrants, making the current culture war debate around it misplaced.</p>

While officials state this activity is not a direct precursor to the much-feared Nankai Trough earthquake, it has prompted a renewed focus on preparedness. The revised plans aim to reduce the projected death toll from a major Nankai Trough event by 80% over the next decade. Measures include building more robust sea walls, constructing tsunami refuge towers, and enhancing public education on rapid evacuation procedures.</p>
