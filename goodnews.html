          <p>Temu and Shein are facing new challenges in the U.S. due to the closure of a trade loophole and tariffs on Chinese goods, which has disrupted their business model. Despite this, experts believe these e-commerce companies will remain competitive by onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses. Temu has already started offering goods shipped from local warehouses, while Shein is expanding its manufacturing operations to countries like Turkey and Mexico. While prices may increase, experts remain confident that Temu and Shein will continue to offer competitive prices compared to American retailers, and the loss of the de minimis exemption had long been anticipated.</p>

          <p>In China, the children of senior officials are increasingly choosing careers in the public sector, reversing a previous trend of pursuing lucrative opportunities in the private sector. This shift is attributed to stricter regulations around officials and their families, part of the Communist Party's anti-corruption efforts, and a slowing economy. Government jobs are now seen as secure and stable, despite being lower-paid and more constrained than private sector roles. Officials across various government agencies are now working with colleagues from privileged backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Germany is still painstakingly searching for its fallen soldiers 80 years after World War II, with the remains of 107 Wehrmacht soldiers recently interred in a forest near Berlin. The German War Graves Commission has been working for decades to find, exhumed, and rebury German soldiers across Europe. The search for the dead is a reminder that the conflict's legacy is physical and unfinished, with more than 2 million German soldiers remaining unaccounted for. The Commission frames its mission as one of identifying the fallen and ensuring they are not left to vanish without a name.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's next chancellor, taking office during a period of significant national crises, including economic stagnation and strained relations with the United States. The new chancellor faces the challenge of addressing a rising nationalist party and navigating complex international relations. Despite lacking executive experience in government, Mr. Merz is known for his charm, ability to warm to new ideas, and his commitment to leading a newly muscular Europe. He will be sworn in on Tuesday, and two decades prior, he accepted an invitation to gather with the French Foreign Legion in Corsica.</p>
