          <p>Tron founder Justin Sun has announced ambitious plans for his blockchain network to handle more transaction volume than the Swift international payment system within the next five years. He highlighted Tron's efficiency, processing transactions in seconds compared to Swift's days-long timeframe, and projected that Tron's transaction volume could reach US$8 trillion this year. Sun also praised Hong Kong for its progressive stance on cryptocurrency, seeing it as a key hub for the virtual asset sector's future growth and innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Iowa's 34-7 season-opening victory against Albany, head coach Kirk Ferentz secured his 205th win with the program, moving him into a tie with Ohio State's Woody Hayes as the Big Ten conference's all-time winningest coach. The Hawkeyes' offense, led by a strong running game, dominated the match, with freshman Xavier Williams rushing for 122 yards and a touchdown. Ferentz, who is in his 27th season at Iowa, is the longest-tenured active head coach in college football and humbly downplayed the historic achievement after the game.</p>

The offense was explosive, never punting and generating multiple long-yardage plays, while the defense also impressed with five sacks and a defensive touchdown, securing a dominant but expected win against a lower-division opponent.</p>

Breweries are adapting by promoting alcohol-free options as alternatives to energy drinks at sporting events, though traditional alcoholic beer remains dominant at cultural festivals.</p>

          <p>A decade after the acrimonious split between famed creator Hideo Kojima and publisher Konami, the "Metal Gear Solid" series has returned with a remake of its third installment. The original series was groundbreaking for its cinematic style and complex themes, but was left directionless after Kojima's exit in 2015. The new remake, titled "Metal Gear Solid Delta," joins a growing trend of modernizing classic video games and is seen as a crucial test of whether the iconic franchise can succeed without its original visionary director at the helm.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the United Kingdom are using an innovative arsenal, including drones and sniffer dogs, to combat the spread of the invasive spruce bark beetle. This pest has devastated millions of spruce trees across Europe and poses a multi-billion pound threat to the UK's timber industry. After discovering that the beetles were being carried over the English Channel by wind, a targeted effort has successfully eradicated them from at-risk areas in southeast England, though climate change could make future containment more challenging.</p>
