          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to increase due to changes in the economy and policy uncertainties. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, even with long-term inflation expectations near the Fed's 2% target. He highlighted the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing challenges for both the economy and central banks. Powell also mentioned that tariffs could slow growth and boost inflation, but the extent of the impact remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart reported solid sales growth, particularly in its e-commerce division, but cautioned about economic uncertainty in the coming quarters due to President Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The retail giant will start raising prices soon, as it can't absorb all the pressure from the tariffs. Sales at U.S. stores rose over 3%, and e-commerce sales jumped more than 20%, recording its first profitable quarter. While maintaining its full-year financial forecast, Walmart refrained from projecting profits for the current quarter due to tariff policies and pricing decisions. </p>

This incident is one of many encounters Seinfeld has had with hecklers over his support for Israel. He previously trolled a pro-Palestinian activist by saying, 'I don't care about Palestine.'</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Settling credit card debt can provide relief, but it also has long-term consequences, especially regarding lenders' perceptions. Settling debt for less than the full amount is a major red flag for credit card issuers, making them hesitant to extend new credit. If a credit card was included in the debt settlement agreement, that account was almost certainly closed. While other accounts may remain open, debt settlement can significantly damage your credit score, potentially leading other creditors to reduce credit limits or deny future transactions. </p>

The company is committed to keeping prices low relative to competitors and will absorb some of the higher tariff costs, but shoppers will likely see increases toward the end of May and more in June. Tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia have put pressure on the price of imported items, including bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold is best approached as adding a small but critical component to a portfolio rather than following a strict investment schedule. The conventional wisdom is that gold shouldn't make up more than 10% of the overall portfolio. How often one should invest is determined by how much money they have to invest and how those investments will be spread out over time to get to that 10% maximum. Waiting to get invested in gold is generally not advisable, as over time, the price only increases. (not investment advice)</p>

The Magna Carta is one of the most important documents in history and deeply influenced the framers of the U.S. Constitution.
