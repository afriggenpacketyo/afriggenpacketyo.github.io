          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China Earlier Than Previously Thought</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that pigs may have been domesticated in southern China as early as the Neolithic period, around 8,000 years ago. Archaeologists analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding that pigs were consuming humans' cooked food and waste. This indicates that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed made an albatross, a double-eagle, during the first round of the U.S. Open, holing a 3-wood from 286 yards on the par-5 fourth hole.

Despite the albatross, Reed finished the day at 3-over 73 after a triple bogey on the final hole.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are prioritizing overseas expansion to ensure survival amid ongoing trade tariffs. Despite a temporary truce between the U.S. and China, tariffs on solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the U.S. remain high. Companies are diversifying their production bases, with a shift towards the Middle East and Africa for planned capacity expansion. Executives emphasize the necessity of localizing production abroad to overcome tariff barriers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first in the world to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy for the blood cancer myeloma, where toxic drugs are sneaked inside cancer cells. This therapy, called belantamab mafodotin, has shown to halt myeloma for nearly three times longer than current therapies, while reducing side effects. The drug is an advanced form of chemotherapy that hits cancer with a bigger dose. Clinical trials last year showed the therapy halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current therapies.</p>

Koizumi's actions include releasing government stockpiled rice at reduced prices and drawing attention to controversial issues in the agricultural sector. (not investment advice)</p>
