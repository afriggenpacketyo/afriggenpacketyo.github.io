          <p>The Kremlin has confirmed that a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been agreed upon and is expected to take place next week. This follows Trump's statement expressing a "good chance" of meeting with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to address the ongoing war in Ukraine. The announcement comes as a Friday deadline approaches for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face significant U.S. sanctions. The potential summit marks a shift in tone after weeks of Trump expressing frustration with Russia's lack of progress in ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by a quarter-point to 4.0%, continuing its gradual approach to easing monetary policy. The decision was narrow, with the Monetary Policy Committee voting 5-4 in favor of the reduction, reflecting a division among policymakers. The central bank is navigating a complex economic environment, balancing higher-than-expected inflation with a cooling labor market and stagnant GDP growth. Officials reiterated that future rate cuts will be cautious and dependent on the continued easing of underlying inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly raised its full-year 2025 financial outlook after reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by massive demand for its diabetes and weight loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The pharmaceutical company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion for the fiscal year. However, the company's stock fell in premarket trading after late-stage trial data for its experimental oral obesity pill, orforglipron, showed results that were below analyst expectations. The strong performance comes as the company prepares for potential U.S. tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

Hansen also recalled a mistake early in his career that caused a severe injury to a crew member, a moment that taught him a valuable lesson.

          <p>A scholar from a top Communist Party institute has suggested that China should aim for an annual GDP growth rate of "around 5 percent" during its upcoming 15th five-year plan. Writing in the Study Times, professor Cui Youping argued that a growth rate exceeding 4.5 percent is necessary for China to achieve its 2035 goal of reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country," which is estimated to be around $30,000. China's per capita GDP was $13,400 in 2024. The article highlights the political importance of this economic benchmark for the country's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter results, with overall revenue beating expectations but adjusted earnings per share falling short. The company's performance was bolstered by strong same-store sales growth in its international division and at Tim Hortons. However, Popeyes experienced a decline in same-store sales, acting as a drag on the portfolio. In the U.S., Burger King's turnaround efforts showed modest progress with a 1.5% increase in same-store sales, as the company continues to navigate a competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A viral story claiming that Russian special forces captured three senior British military officers in Ukraine has been thoroughly debunked as false. The narrative, which spread across social media and was amplified by some former UK politicians, used poorly-made, AI-generated images and featured names of officers who do not exist in British military records. Experts in disinformation identify the story as a classic Russian propaganda effort, designed to project military strength to a domestic audience and sow discord abroad. The article highlights the tactics of "media laundering" and the challenge of combating such intentionally fabricated news.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 years after D.C. police officer Denna Fredericka Campbell was killed, her former live-in boyfriend, Amir Jalil Ali, has been arrested and charged with her murder. Campbell, 24, was found shot five times in her Maryland apartment in 1995. Ali was initially charged at the time, but prosecutors dropped the case for reasons that remain unclear. Colleagues of Campbell told investigators she had been afraid of Ali and ominously warned that if she didn't show up for work, "you'll know he killed me." The case was reopened, and investigators cited DNA evidence in the new arrest.</p>

          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force conducted a perilous, high-risk medical evacuation of three people from the American-operated McMurdo Station in Antarctica. The mission was carried out in complete winter darkness and sub-zero temperatures, requiring the flight crew to use night vision goggles to land a C-130J Hercules on a manually prepared ice runway. The U.S. National Science Foundation requested the evacuation due to insufficient medical resources at the remote base. U.S. officials praised the nearly 20-hour operation as "nothing short of heroic," highlighting the extreme challenges and courage involved in the successful rescue.</p>

          <p>The startup Neurable is pioneering non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, embedding electroencephalography (EEG) sensors into everyday devices like headphones to monitor brain activity. Their first product, in partnership with Master & Dynamic, can track a user's focus levels and prompt them to take breaks, with future applications aimed at monitoring broader brain health, including early detection of conditions like Alzheimer's. Unlike invasive BCIs, this technology interprets electrical signals rather than thoughts and is being developed with a strong emphasis on data privacy and anonymization. The goal is to make neurotechnology an accessible platform for health tracking and device control.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly called for a direct meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that "real solutions" to the war can only be achieved at the leadership level. His appeal follows a "highly productive" meeting between Putin and a U.S. envoy, after which President Trump suggested a potential summit could happen soon. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for Russia to take concrete steps to end the aggression it initiated. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has confirmed that preparations for a Trump-Putin summit are underway but reiterated that the prerequisites for a meeting with Zelenskyy have not yet been met.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Lithium Deficiency Could Be a Contributing Factor to Alzheimer's Disease</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Harvard Medical School reveals that a deficiency of the metal lithium, which occurs naturally in the brain, may be a key factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The research found that lithium levels were markedly lower in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, and that this depletion was one of the earliest detectable changes. In mice, restoring lithium levels with a compound called lithium orotate, which is effective at very low doses, helped restore memory. The findings suggest a new potential strategy for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the neurodegenerative disease.</p>

          <p>A complex rescue mission successfully saved two climbers who were left hanging in their harnesses overnight on a sheer cliff on Canada's Yak Peak. One of the climbers had sustained a head injury in a fall, and deteriorating weather conditions, including clouds and wildfire smoke, hampered initial rescue attempts. A fresh flight crew was able to conduct the technical hoist rescue the following morning. The operation involved multiple agencies, night flying with specialized goggles, and complex hoists to retrieve the climbers from the dangerous mid-face position on the 6,500-foot summit.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk, a key indicator of global trade health, has raised its full-year financial guidance after posting stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits. The company cited resilient demand and a manufacturing boom in China, with strong export growth in most regions except for the United States, where tariff uncertainty has had a dampening effect. Maersk now projects global container market volume to grow between 2% and 4% in 2025, an upgrade from its previous forecast. The positive outlook persists despite ongoing disruptions in the Red Sea, which are expected to last all year. (not investment advice)</p>
