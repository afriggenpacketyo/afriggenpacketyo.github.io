        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned that consumers are likely to see price increases later this month due to tariffs, despite the retailer's better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Rainey stated that even with reduced duties on Chinese imports, tariffs remain too high for retailers to absorb. Walmart reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, driven by online advertising and its third-party marketplace. The company expects net sales to increase, but declined to provide earnings guidance due to fluctuating tariff policies.</p>

          <p>An Army anniversary parade in Washington, D.C., coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade, part of the Army's 250th-anniversary celebrations, will include over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters. Trump defended the cost, stating it would be 'peanuts' compared to its value, while critics, including some Democrats, have labeled the plan wasteful and self-aggrandizing. Trump has expressed interest in military parades since his first term.</p>

          <p>A recent aerial fight saw Pakistan Air Force's Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets successfully downing Indian's French-made Rafale jets. This incident is a milestone for China's defense industry, proving the reliability and lethal power of its state-of-the-art weapons. The Gulf War in 1991 prompted China to modernize its military, leading to the development of sophisticated weapons. China is reportedly leading in hypersonic technology and developing sixth-generation stealth fighters. This aerial fight marks the first duel between Chinese and Western weapon systems.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to ease tariffs on Chinese goods has provided some relief for businesses, but long-term planning remains uncertain. While the reduction from 145% to 30% offers a temporary reprieve, many businesses, particularly small ones, still face significant burdens. Walmart has already announced that it will have to raise prices on some items in response to tariff-fueled cost increases. Business owners are concerned about the temporary nature of the easing and are hesitant to make long-term decisions without a stable trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods is set to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to expand its reach and diversify its consumer base. While Dick's has been financially strong, it lacks international presence, which Foot Locker provides with its 2,400 stores across 20 countries. Analysts note that Foot Locker's urban consumer base complements Dick's suburban athlete customer base. However, investors reacted negatively to the news, given Foot Locker's declining sales and store closures. The combined retailers will face challenges from new tariffs and brands selling directly to consumers.</p>

          <p>Prince Royce has released a new album featuring bilingual covers of famous English pop songs from artists like The Beatles, Lionel Richie, and Elvis Presley. The album, which Royce describes as a mix of rock, pop, R&B, and country, includes bachata versions of iconic songs. Royce sought to generate nostalgia while respecting the original versions. He also mentioned that the process of obtaining permissions for the songs took about 10 months. The first single from the album is 'How Deep Is Your Love,' originally by the Bee Gees.</p>

          <p>Florida has become the second state to ban adding fluoride to drinking water, with Governor Ron DeSantis signing a bill that aligns with the views of Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Florida's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo. Public health experts and medical professionals have expressed concerns that the measure will increase tooth decay, especially in children. DeSantis defended the bill as 'legislation to protect against forced medication,' arguing that individuals should have the choice to use fluoride through toothpaste and mouthwash.</p>

          <p>Canada has quietly become a global leader in digital assets due to its early adoption of crypto regulations, starting with anti-money laundering guidelines in 2014. This regulatory clarity has made Toronto a launchpad for blockchain growth, attracting attention from Wall Street. Robinhood's acquisition of Canadian crypto firm WonderFi and Galaxy Digital's listing in Canada are examples of this trend. JPMorgan and Ondo Finance also announced a $100 billion bet on blockchain in Toronto, highlighting Canada's significance in the crypto space.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Retirement Age Increases, Affecting Those Born in 1960</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The full retirement age to collect Social Security benefits has increased to 67 for Americans born in 1960, meaning they will have to work longer to receive full benefits. This change, a result of amendments implemented in 1983, adjusts for longer life expectancies. Workers can still retire early at 62, but will face a penalty that reduces their monthly benefit. The increase to age 67 is the last scheduled increase under the 1983 amendments, though future legislation could further raise the retirement age.</p>

          <p>Alibaba shares experienced a significant drop of 7.6% after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported lower-than-expected earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter. While revenue increased 7% year-on-year, net income fell short of analyst expectations. Alibaba's core Taobao and Tmall group division saw revenue rise, but the company is grappling with macroeconomic volatility and the trade war between Washington and Beijing. Despite efforts to boost sales, Alibaba faces intense competition in China with rivals including PDD and JD.com.</p>
