        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has lifted sanctions on Syria after 45 years, a move hailed by the Syrian Foreign Ministry as a "pivotal turning point." The decision could bring economic relief and facilitate the return of Syrian refugees, with reconstruction potentially costing between $400 billion and $1 trillion. Trump urged Syria to sign onto the Abraham Accords, remove foreign terrorists, deport Palestinian terrorists, help prevent the resurgence of ISIS, and assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers. The lifting of sanctions may also encourage more Syrian refugees to return home, though ensuring protection and socio-economic rights remains crucial for lasting returns.</p>

          <p>Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville remains optimistic about the Democratic Party despite recent polls indicating low favorability, pointing to election victories in Omaha, Nebraska, and a Wisconsin State Supreme Court election. Carville acknowledges the Democratic Party's struggles, including losses in the White House and Congress, and declining favorability ratings. However, he emphasizes the importance of recent electoral wins and looks forward to the gubernatorial election in Virginia as a key test.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seniors should consider Medicare supplemental insurance to cover costs not fully covered by traditional Medicare, potentially saving money on out-of-pocket expenses. Long-term care insurance can cover costs associated with nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or in-home caretakers, offering financial protection in their golden years. Whole life insurance offers a cash component that can be borrowed from while alive and provides beneficiaries with funds after death. Prices for these policies generally increase with age, making it wise to research options and secure quotes sooner rather than later. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has become the second state, after Utah, to ban fluoride in tap water under a law signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, citing concerns about overexposure to fluoride. The move has been met with criticism from dentists and public health advocates, who argue that water fluoridation is a safe and effective way to maintain dental health. Some local governments in Florida, including Miami-Dade County, had already voted to remove fluoride from their water sources prior to the statewide ban. The ban follows a push by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to stop fluoridating water.</p>

          <p>A new genetics study traces prehistoric human migration from Asia to North and South America, revealing that the first people to colonize the Americas migrated from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000-30,000 years ago. The study suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups, comparing them to ancient DNA, to understand population history, migration, and adaptation over thousands of years. The findings also highlight genetic traits that may affect modern South Americans' health and vulnerability to infectious diseases.</p>

The Trump administration is pushing for a sweeping overhaul of the system over the next three years, including replacing radars and control towers. Duffy assured lawmakers that air travel is still safe due to "multiple redundancies," but acknowledged the need for modernization.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. He noted that conditions have changed significantly in the past five years, with the Fed witnessing a period of surging inflation. Powell cautioned that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon and that more frequent supply shocks could pose challenges for the economy and central banks. While he didn't directly mention President Trump's tariffs, he acknowledged their potential impact on slowing growth and boosting inflation.</p>

          <p>Settling credit card debt can provide relief but also has long-term consequences, particularly regarding how lenders perceive you. Issuers generally don't allow continued access to credit on accounts with a settled balance, and debt settlement can significantly damage your credit score. However, you can rebuild your credit by monitoring your credit report, starting with a secured credit card, and keeping balances low while making payments on time. It's also wise to wait before applying for new cards to give your credit profile time to stabilize. (not investment advice)</p>
