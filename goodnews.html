        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, author and activist V reflects on navigating the current political climate, which she describes as suffocating and perilous. She argues for embracing duality‚Äîfeeling pain without succumbing to despair and channeling rage into purposeful action‚Äîas a key survival strategy against rising authoritarianism. Drawing inspiration from activists in the Democratic Republic of Congo and former congresswoman Cori Bush, she emphasizes the power of community care and collective action. V concludes that maintaining one's humanity is a form of resistance and that every small act of love and solidarity helps build a new world.</p>

          <h2>Bartenders Express Annoyance at Gen Z Trend of Paying for Each Drink Individually</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 07:00:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trend among younger bar patrons to pay for each drink as it's ordered, rather than opening a tab, is reportedly causing frustration for bartenders. While some bartenders find the practice "unequivocally annoying" as it slows down service during busy periods, they also acknowledge its potential benefits for customers. Paying drink-by-drink can help individuals better monitor their alcohol consumption and spending, reflecting a more fiscally responsible approach. The habit may also be influenced by a decline in overall alcohol consumption among young adults and concerns about leaving credit cards with the bar.</p>

          <p>Reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, in their first interview since being released from prison, spoke about their experience and the presidential pardon they received from Donald Trump. The couple, convicted of bank and tax fraud, described difficult prison conditions and credited their daughter Savannah's advocacy for their freedom. The pardon has drawn criticism, as their convictions were upheld on appeal, but the Chrisleys defended it and remain unapologetic about their lifestyle. They are now focusing on prison reform and planning a new reality show that will document their life after incarceration.</p>

          <p>Following England Under-21s' victory in the Euro 2025 final, questions arise about which players can transition to the senior squad for the upcoming World Cup. While the triumph marks a second consecutive European title for the Young Lions, history shows that U21 success does not guarantee a senior career. The article assesses standout performers like Tino Livramento and Harvey Elliott, noting that their club futures and playing time will be crucial for senior selection. The success reflects the strength of England's youth development system, but the challenge remains for these talented players to make the final step to the highest level.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One hundred years after a devastating earthquake ruined downtown Santa Barbara, experts reflect on the lessons it offers for modern seismic preparedness. The 1925 quake exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many California cities to address through mandatory retrofitting laws. The event also spurred Santa Barbara to adopt a uniform Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style, reshaping the city's identity. However, experts note that many vulnerabilities, such as soft-story apartment buildings and unbolted single-family homes, still persist in Santa Barbara and across the state, highlighting ongoing challenges in seismic safety.</p>

          <p>Dow Janes, a financial education startup founded by Britt Baker, is gaining traction among Gen Z and millennial women aiming to become more money-savvy. The company addresses a gap in financial education, as many women report not being taught about money management growing up, and offers accessible content on social media and a paid 12-month course. Amid economic uncertainty and the rise of "finfluencers," Dow Janes focuses on foundational concepts and the psychological relationship with money to empower women. The trend reflects a growing demand for financial guidance in a volatile economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran were met with a surprisingly cautious and muted response from Tehran's supposed allies, China and Russia. Instead of rushing to Iran's defense, Beijing emphasized diplomacy and warned against disrupting global trade, revealing the practical limits of their anti-American axis. The article argues that while the three nations share an antagonism toward the West, their strategic and economic interests diverge significantly, especially when global stability is at risk. This lack of unconditional support for Iran suggests that China prioritizes its own economic relations with the West over backing its partners in a direct confrontation.</p>

          <p>B√§rbel Bas, a politician from a working-class background, has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), alongside Lars Klingbeil. Her election is seen as a source of new hope for the ailing party, which suffered a historic defeat in February. Bas, who represents the party's left wing, will serve as a counterweight to the more conservative Klingbeil and has taken on the role of Germany's labor minister. In her acceptance speech, she emphasized solidarity and social justice, criticizing attempts to cut social benefits and receiving strong support from party delegates.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions winger James Lowe humorously dismissed an attempt by the Perth stadium announcer to troll the team's southern hemisphere-born players. Before the Lions' victory over Western Force, the announcer pointedly identified players like Lowe (New Zealand-born), Mack Hansen (Australian-born), and others who now represent northern hemisphere nations. The issue of player ancestry has been a talking point, fueled by comments from Australia's coach. Lowe, who previously played for the Maori All Blacks against the Lions, took the "slagging" in stride, suggesting the gag could continue if it keeps leading to victories for his team.</p>
