          <p>The British government is committing $19 billion to construct a new nuclear power plant named Sizewell C. This project is anticipated to generate 10,000 jobs and ensure a consistent electricity supply for millions of households. The investment aims to bolster the UK's energy independence and reduce reliance on foreign energy sources. It is part of a broader strategy to enhance energy security and stimulate economic growth in the region. The construction of Sizewell C represents a significant step towards a more sustainable and reliable energy future for the UK. The project is expected to take over a decade to complete.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of 277 CEOs indicates a more optimistic outlook for the U.S. economy, with only 28% expecting a recession in the near term, a significant drop from 62% in April. The CEOs anticipate that the Trump administration will successfully negotiate trade deals, mitigating the impact of tariffs. Despite a recent contraction in the gross domestic product, CEOs are hopeful that business conditions will improve as trade tensions ease and interest rates decrease. The survey reveals that 36% of CEOs expect mild economic growth this year, while 6% anticipate strong growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project, aiming to lower household energy bills and enhance energy security. The project is expected to create 10,000 jobs and provide power for six million homes, though completion is estimated in the mid-2030s. While proponents highlight the plant's potential to reduce reliance on foreign energy sources and combat climate change, critics raise concerns about the project's cost and environmental impact. The funding, covering the first five years of the decade-long project, is part of a broader effort to attract private investment and boost economic growth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concentration of wealth in the United States is reaching unprecedented levels, distorting democracy and exacerbating societal tensions. Just 800 families possess nearly $7 trillion, exceeding the wealth of the bottom half of the U.S. combined. The current tax code allows the ultra-wealthy to avoid taxes on a significant portion of their income, while many Americans struggle financially. To address this issue, a wealth tax on billionaires is proposed, such as the Five & Dime tax, which could generate substantial revenue for public investments. This revenue could support programs for working families, boost the economy, and promote fair competition.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples can improve their relationships by creating a "relationship bank account," where they make "deposits" through actions that prioritize their partner's happiness. The account balance reflects the security and safety within the relationship, with a positive balance indicating the ability to handle conflicts effectively. The goal is to make more deposits than withdrawals, leading to less intense and frequent arguments. Common ways to bolster the account include expressing appreciation, spending quality time, offering support, and showing affection. This approach aims to foster a stronger and more resilient partnership.</p>

The discussions involve top aides from both countries, focusing on issues such as tariffs, rare earth minerals, and access to high-end technology. While President Trump reported "good reports" from the talks, relations between the two countries have deteriorated since a tentative truce in Geneva. China has retaliated against U.S. tariffs by halting exports of rare earths, while the U.S. has announced new export controls on semiconductor chip technology.

The revised policy will extend the payment, worth up to ¬£300 a year, to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less. Starmer explained that better-than-expected growth figures, falling interest rates, and trade deals have enabled the government to increase the eligibility threshold.

The Smithsonian's board of regents asserted its independence, stating that personnel decisions are made by the secretary with oversight by the board. Trump had announced Sajet's firing, citing her support for DEI initiatives and alleged partisanship. The board backed secretary Lonnie Bunch and directed him to ensure museum content remains unbiased. The clash is part of Trump's broader assault on cultural institutions, including proposed budget cuts to the Smithsonian.</p>
