          <p>The United States and Iran are scheduled to resume high-level talks in Oman on Sunday regarding Tehran's nuclear program, marking the sixth round of discussions since April. These talks aim to establish a new agreement to replace the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which the U.S. withdrew during Trump's first term. Despite heightened regional tensions, the U.S. delegation is planning to attend, with Iran expressing optimism about reaching a deal that ensures the peaceful nature of its nuclear program under IAEA supervision. Iran seeks a mutually beneficial outcome where it can continue its enrichment program under international oversight, while the U.S. aims to prevent any uranium enrichment.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee is debating clean energy tax credits approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which the House seeks to largely eliminate. The House bill would halt roughly $522 billion in investments approved in the IRA, rolling back incentives for wind, solar, and hydrogen power. A group of GOP senators, including Lisa Murkowski and John Curtis, are advocating against a full-scale repeal of current credits, citing concerns about uncertainty for businesses that have already invested in domestic energy production.
