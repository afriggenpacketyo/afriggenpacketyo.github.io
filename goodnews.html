With a new ‚Ç¨1.35 billion injection of capital, the French state is now Eutelsat's largest shareholder, viewing the company as a strategic asset for Europe's technological sovereignty. However, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near term. The company's satellite constellation is vastly smaller, and it faces challenges in manufacturing, launch access, and replacing its aging satellites. (not investment advice)</p>

Once a heavily militarized front line, it is now a quiet community caught between two political systems. The island's unique position highlights the practical limitations of influence for both Beijing and Taipei. While Taipei views it as a symbol of its democratic governance, its geographical and economic proximity to the mainland creates a distinct local identity and a nuanced reality on the ground.</p>

The rules, which took effect on Sunday, also prohibit smoking near schools, libraries, and bus shelters, aiming to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. The primary goal is to protect non-smokers, especially children, from the dangers of secondhand smoke, which is responsible for thousands of deaths annually in the country.
