          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggests that a combination of Coca-Cola and large fries from McDonald's, dubbed the 'McMigraine,' can alleviate migraine symptoms. Dr. Brintha Vasagar explains that the caffeine and carbonation in Coca-Cola can constrict blood vessels and settle the stomach, while the sodium and carbohydrates in fries can correct electrolyte balance, dehydration, and settle the stomach. The article notes that the psychological benefit of comfort food may also contribute to the perceived relief. However, doctors caution that this is not a prevention method and can worsen migraines for some individuals, with hydration and electrolytes suggested as better alternatives.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey defended his Instagram post featuring seashells arranged to read '8647,' which sparked accusations from Trump allies that he was advocating violence against the president. Comey explained that he and his wife found the message on a beach and interpreted it innocently, with '86' meaning 'to ditch.' Despite this, the Secret Service investigated the post, leading Comey to voluntarily appear for an interview. Comey criticized the Trump administration's use of power to target individuals and erode the rule of law, advising others in similar situations to remain measured and trust the judiciary.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer urged investors to control their market fears following Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt, recalling similar events in 2011 and 2023. He argued that the downgrade prompted more fear than the economic situation warranted, and that investors are conditioned to be fearful. Cramer suggested gold and bitcoin as hedges against excessive government borrowing, but advised against selling, stating that the downgrade is an early warning to invest more, not more aggressively. He cautioned investors to be wary of those who spread fear for their own benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

These experiments aim to challenge the current theory of the universe's creation, which cannot explain the existence of planets, stars, and galaxies.

Third, China is focusing on domestic demand and trade diversification to mitigate the impact of tariffs. These policies aim to stabilize growth and reduce vulnerability to external pressures.</p>

This act is a stark contrast to the aftermath of the robbery, where she scaled back her public displays of wealth and faced criticism for being "too public." The article argues that Kardashian's appearance reflects a shift in societal attitudes, where female celebrities are no longer as harshly judged for flaunting their wealth. The author posits that Kardashian has successfully reclaimed her right to conspicuous consumption.</p>

The dogs, trained through a Virginia Tech University project, have demonstrated their ability to locate egg masses hidden around trees, shrubs, and other surfaces.
