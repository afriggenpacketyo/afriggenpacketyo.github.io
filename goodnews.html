          <p>Supporters of LGBTQ+ rights from approximately 30 countries are participating in the Budapest Pride march, defying a police ban enacted under Hungary's controversial "child-protection" legislation. The event has become a symbol of resistance against the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, which faces criticism for repressing civil liberties. Numerous European embassies and EU officials, including Commissioner for Equality Hadja Lahbib, have voiced their support for the march.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former heavyweight world champion Deontay Wilder made a successful, albeit understated, return to boxing by defeating Tyrrell Herndon with a seventh-round stoppage. This was Wilder's first victory since October 2022, following a series of difficult losses that had cast doubt on his career. The fight lacked the usual spectacle of his major events, suggesting a more focused, stripped-back approach for the 39-year-old fighter. While the win was dominant, Wilder acknowledged he is still working to become a more complete fighter and rebuild his career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China holds a significant competitive edge in the developing field of stablecoins due to its mature third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay. He argues that this existing infrastructure, which functions similarly to stablecoins by pegging to fiat currency, is already supported by a robust regulatory framework. Peng suggests these platforms' stability is ensured by strict safeguards, including customer funds being backed by central bank money, positioning China favorably in the global economic debate.

          <p>A recent study from the Japan Institute for Health Security has indicated a correlation between a Japanese-style diet and a lower incidence of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research examined the effects of a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and green tea. The study found that individuals who adhered to this traditional eating pattern, as well as a modified version that included more fruit and dairy, exhibited fewer symptoms of depression. This is the first study of its kind to specifically assess this dietary link.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Kings General Manager Ken Holland is among those who prefer the traditional, centralized format of the NHL draft over the new, semi-remote version used this year. The new format, which saw teams making picks from their home cities while players were in Los Angeles, was plagued by technical glitches and lacked the energy of past events. Holland, an 'old-school' executive, remarked that the former system better celebrated the draftees, especially later-round picks who could share the moment with their families in the arena. His sentiment was reportedly shared by other GMs.</p>
