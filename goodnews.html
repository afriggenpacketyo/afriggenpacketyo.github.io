          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) retirement plans. This move would allow investments such as private equity, cryptocurrencies, and real estate within these common retirement accounts, a significant change from traditional options. The order is seen as a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for greater access to the trillions of dollars held in American retirement funds. Proponents argue it offers diversification, while critics raise concerns about the higher risks and fees associated with these assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Connected fitness company Peloton reported an unexpected net income of $21.6 million for its fiscal fourth quarter, a significant turnaround from a loss in the previous year. This profitability was driven by better-than-expected sales and aggressive cost-cutting measures under new CEO Peter Stern. Despite the positive results, the company announced it will lay off 6% of its staff as part of a new plan to reduce annual expenses by an additional $100 million. The strategy aims to ensure long-term stability as Peloton navigates a post-pandemic market and new tariffs.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly agreed to a deal with German club RB Leipzig to sign 22-year-old Slovenian forward Benjamin Sesko for a total fee of £73.7 million. The agreement includes a guaranteed payment of £66.3 million, with the rest structured as performance-based add-ons. Sesko, who has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig, is expected to complete a medical before the move is finalized. This signing is part of a significant offensive overhaul for the club, which has already spent heavily on other forwards this summer and is reportedly looking to sell striker Rasmus Hojlund.</p>

          <h2>Archaeological Finds Suggest Pompeii Was Reoccupied After Vesuvius Eruption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 10:24:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological evidence from Pompeii indicates that the ancient city was reoccupied by survivors following the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Researchers believe that some former residents, unable to relocate, returned to live in what they describe as a "precarious and grey agglomeration" among the ruins. These informal settlements lacked typical Roman infrastructure, with inhabitants converting the ground floors of old houses into cellars and workshops. This discovery challenges the long-held narrative that Pompeii was completely abandoned after the eruption, revealing a period of makeshift survival before the area was ultimately deserted centuries later.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England has reduced its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, a move that will have varied effects on household finances. Homeowners with variable-rate mortgages will likely see their monthly payments decrease, offering some financial relief. Conversely, savers will face lower returns, as interest rates on savings accounts are expected to continue their downward trend. The central bank's decision comes despite inflation remaining above its 2% target, reflecting a delicate balancing act to stimulate a struggling economy and a weakening job market without further fueling price increases. The cut aims to make borrowing cheaper to encourage spending and support business growth.</p>

          <p>Rocket maker Firefly Aerospace priced its initial public offering at $45 per share, exceeding its revised target range of $41 to $43. The successful offering raised $868 million and gives the Texas-based company a valuation of approximately $6.3 billion as it prepares to debut on the Nasdaq under the ticker "FLY". This strong market entry reflects rising investor interest in the space technology sector, following other major IPOs this year and the high-profile ventures of billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Firefly, which develops rockets and lunar landers, recently secured a $177 million NASA contract and has partnerships with major defense contractors.</p>

          <h2>NFL Clarifies Policy on Ammonia Inhalants, Allowing Player Use but Prohibiting Team Distribution</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL Players Association has clarified that a new league policy does not completely ban the use of ammonia inhalants, also known as smelling salts. While a memo initially caused confusion and protest from players like George Kittle, the rule only prohibits teams and their staff from distributing the substances. Players are still permitted to bring and use their own ammonia inhalants for an energy boost. The NFL's decision to restrict team distribution stems from an FDA warning that the stimulants could mask symptoms of serious injuries like concussions and lack proven evidence of safety or efficacy for boosting energy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has announced an early rollout for the 2026-27 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). A beta test is already available to a limited group, with broader testing participation opening on September 1, ahead of the typical October launch for all students. Experts hope this extended testing window will allow the department to identify and fix bugs that have plagued previous cycles, leading to a smoother process for families. Completing the FAFSA is a critical step for students seeking federal grants, loans, and work-study programs, and early submission can improve the chances of receiving aid from programs with limited funds.</p>

          <p>The global oil market appears to be discounting President Trump's threats to impose heavy tariffs on countries like India, China, and Turkey for purchasing Russian crude oil. Despite a 25% tariff being announced for India, oil prices fell, suggesting traders view the move as a negotiating tactic rather than a firm policy that will be fully implemented. Analysts believe that a serious disruption to Russia's oil exports would cause a significant spike in global prices, a risk the administration may be unwilling to take. The market's skepticism is also fueled by the administration's past record of not always backing up strong rhetoric on energy sanctions with action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force conducted a perilous, nearly 20-hour rescue mission to evacuate three people requiring medical care from the American-operated McMurdo Station in Antarctica. The operation was carried out in complete winter darkness and sub-zero temperatures, with the flight crew using night vision goggles to land a C-130J Hercules aircraft on a manually prepared ice runway. U.S. officials, who requested the evacuation due to insufficient medical resources at the base, praised the New Zealand crew's actions as "nothing short of heroic." Such mid-winter flights are considered extremely challenging due to the harsh and unpredictable Antarctic weather conditions.</p>

However, the positive earnings report was tempered by disappointing late-stage trial data for its experimental oral weight loss pill, orforglipron, which caused the company's shares to fall in premarket trading.

With average home equity levels high, these products offer significantly lower interest rates, currently averaging in the low 8% range. This article explains the difference between the two products: fixed-rate home equity loans provide a lump sum, while variable-rate HELOCs offer a revolving line of credit. While rates are attractive and may offer tax benefits, homeowners are reminded that their home serves as collateral, making it crucial to choose a product that fits their budget.
