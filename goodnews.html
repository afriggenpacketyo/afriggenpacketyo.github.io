          <h2>Council Criticized Over Presentation on Strangulation During Sex</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bridgend council in Wales faced criticism for a PowerPoint presentation intended for schools that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex, including a slide stating, "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first." The council claims it was a draft version, never shown to children, and was dropped after feedback from professionals, however experts and politicians are questioning why such content was deemed appropriate in any form. The council said the slide was meant to stimulate debate before advising participants that non-fatal strangulation is illegal, but sources claim the presentation was offered to schools, raising concerns about the content being taught to children during sexual education lessons. The incident has sparked a debate about the appropriateness and accuracy of sex education materials in schools.</p>

          <p>Adrian Ramsay, the co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has launched a fresh leadership bid with fellow Green MP Ellie Chowns, hoping to be elected as co-leaders. This comes after Carla Denyer announced she would not be standing for re-election later this year, and they will be joining the party's deputy leader, Zack Polanski, in the leadership contest. Ramsay and Denyer were initially elected for a three-year term, but members voted not to choose new leaders in 2024 because of the general election. Chowns stated that she and Ramsay were "ready to lead our party into its most ambitious chapter yet", while Ramsay emphasized the need to build on their leadership and potentially hold the balance of power.</p>

          <p>In Serbia, a student-led movement is challenging the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. The movement, sparked by a tragedy in Novi Sad, has grown into the largest and most extensive protest in years, uniting diverse groups in Serbian society. Despite government attempts to quell the protests through resignations and financial incentives, demonstrators continue to demand accountability and change. The government's response has included attacks on educators and the academic community, mirroring tactics used by other would-be autocrats.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The decision is also intended to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. A senior Hamas official stated that the group is holding direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar, while the Israeli PM's office said it had only committed to a "safe corridor" for Alexander's release. This announcement comes amid growing frustration in the Trump administration with Netanyahu's position and pressure at home for the prime minister to end the war.</p>

Donald Trump confirmed the news, stating that Alexander is coming home and that it was a step taken in good faith. Israel has agreed to a temporary ceasefire and a halt to drone flights over Gaza to allow Alexander to safely leave the enclave, but will not be asked to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange. The governments of Qatar and Egypt, which have been brokering talks, welcomed the decision as a positive step toward resuming negotiations.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that strained bilateral relations. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea. The South Korean authorities had arrested the thieves and confiscated the statue, but Buseoksa Temple filed a lawsuit claiming it had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. In 2023, South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, leading to the statue's return.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration policies, including English language tests for adult dependents of foreign workers and restrictions on care homes recruiting staff from abroad. This move is seen as a response to challenges from Reform UK and aims to regain control of the narrative on immigration. The new rules also prioritize residency rights for migrants who pay taxes, work in the public sector, or volunteer, while ending automatic settlement and citizenship after five years. The proposals have faced criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with Conservatives calling them "laughable" and questioning their effectiveness.</p>

Mahathir suggests that ASEAN can withstand the impact of the tariff hikes through intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States.

The recall includes sandwiches and protein snacks sold in vending machines and other settings in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington, with "Use by" dates from April 22 through May 19. The recall was prompted by the discovery of a strain of listeria monocytogenes on a piece of equipment at a Fresh & Ready facility, which matched the strain causing illnesses in the 2024 outbreak. No illnesses have been linked to the recalled food, and the company is taking precautionary measures to ensure consumer safety.</p>
