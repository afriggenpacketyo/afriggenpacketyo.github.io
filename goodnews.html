          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults, framed as a "bonus" to help retirees manage their finances. This provision, aimed at adults aged 65 and over, would be available for tax years 2025 through 2028 and would phase out for single filers with incomes above $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes above $150,000. While presented as a significant tax break, experts note that its impact, estimated at a tax cut of less than $500 per year for a median-income retiree, is modest. (not investment advice)</p>

While jewelry sales soared, the company's specialist watchmakers segment experienced a decline, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.

          <p>The European Union is intensifying trade talks with the United States to avoid looming tariffs on transatlantic exports. This follows similar deals struck between the U.S. and China, and the U.K. The EU is weighing its options to counter President Trump's tariff stance, with some member states pushing for bilateral deals. Despite Trump's claims that Europe is "nastier than China," analysts believe economic pressures will prevent him from pushing Brussels too far, although reaching a consensus among the 27 EU member states remains a challenge.</p>
