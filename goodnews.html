The agreement applies a 10% tariff on the first 100,000 vehicles sold annually to the U.S., a significant reduction that provides relief to UK manufacturers. However, questions remain regarding the final tariff rates for British steel and aluminum exports, which are still under negotiation. (not investment advice)</p>
