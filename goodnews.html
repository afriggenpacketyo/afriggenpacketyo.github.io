          <p>England's Charley Hull has positioned herself as a strong contender for the Women's Open title, sitting just three shots behind leader Miyu Yamashita of Japan after a stellar third round. Hull shot an impressive six-under-par 66 at Royal Porthcawl, moving into a tie for fourth place. Yamashita, who held a larger lead earlier, struggled with a two-over 74, narrowing her advantage to a single stroke over South Korea's A Lim Kim. With unpredictable weather forecasted for the final day, the tournament is poised for a dramatic conclusion as multiple players remain within striking distance of the lead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young adults are turning to TikTok for their news, favoring short, algorithm-driven videos over traditional media outlets. According to a Pew Research Center poll, 39% of adults under 30 regularly get news from the app, often from "newsfluencers" like Aaron Parnas rather than established news organizations. This trend is driven by convenience and a preference for simplified, entertaining content, from rapid-fire updates to news-related skits and memes. While critics raise concerns about misinformation and the platform's Chinese ownership, users often trust crowdsourced fact-checking in the comments, signaling a fundamental shift in media consumption habits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting raids in the Los Angeles area based primarily on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that such practices, which led to widespread protests, likely violate the Constitution's protection against unreasonable searches. The ruling requires agents to have reasonable suspicion that an individual is in the country illegally before detaining them. This decision is a significant setback for the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics and was hailed by advocates as a protection of civil rights for the region's diverse communities.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to dismantle the historical and systemic barriers that have led to racial disparities in swimming ability and drowning rates in the U.S. For decades, segregation excluded Black Americans from public pools, creating a generational gap in aquatic skills and safety. Research shows that Black children are significantly more likely to drown than their white peers, a public health crisis these new programs aim to address. By providing accessible lessons and creating a supportive community, these initiatives are empowering a new generation of Black swimmers and challenging a painful legacy of exclusion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has quietly become a powerhouse in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity last year than even California, a traditional leader in the sector. This growth is primarily driven by major utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on favorable economics and streamlined regulations for solar projects. The success of solar-powered communities like Babcock Ranch, which maintained power through Hurricane Ian, demonstrates the technology's resilience. However, the industry's future momentum faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the state's electrical grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in Frontiers in Psychology indicates that aligning your fitness routine with your personality type could lead to greater enjoyment and adherence. The research found that extroverts tend to prefer high-intensity group workouts like HIIT or team sports, while conscientious individuals enjoy goal-oriented activities such as marathon training. People prone to anxiety may benefit more from private, one-on-one sessions, whereas introverts gravitate toward solo exercises like running or at-home yoga. The findings suggest that instead of forcing a particular workout style, individuals may find more success by choosing activities that naturally fit their disposition.</p>

          <p>Following the recent passing of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner at age 54, this article reflects on his iconic and nuanced role as Theo Huxtable on 'The Cosby Show.' Warner skillfully portrayed Theo not as a simple slacker, but as a complex teenager whose journey from apathy to purpose was central to the series. The character's eventual diagnosis with dyslexia reframed his academic struggles, allowing him to find his calling in mentoring other children with similar challenges. Warner's performance gave depth and vulnerability to Theo, creating a character arc that was about more than just academic success, but about finding one's identity.</p>

          <p>A new memoir by Stephen Starring Grant, who became a rural mail carrier in Virginia after a corporate career, is earning praise for its exploration of blue-collar work and community connection. A review in The Atlantic highlights how the book portrays postal workers as a force for order and predictability in a country that can feel unstable, especially during crises. The memoir delves into the quiet heroism of daily mail delivery, a federal service that provides a consistent and reliable link to even the most remote communities.
