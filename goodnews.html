          <p>Country music artist HARDY has spoken publicly about the severe anxiety and panic attacks he experienced following a near-fatal tour bus crash in 2022. The singer detailed the terrifying moments when the bus, driven by someone having a medical emergency, flipped over three times, leaving him with the feeling he was about to die. He and his team sustained major injuries in the accident. HARDY emphasized the importance of addressing mental health, particularly for men, after the trauma led to his hospitalization for panic attacks a year later.</p>

Ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, he acknowledged that such weekends are unaffordable but emphasized focusing on the successful strategies that have worked for most of the season.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 11:13:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate what they believe may be the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The team identified a "visual anomaly" in a lagoon on Nikumaroro island using satellite imagery, an object visible in photos dating back to 1938. This finding supports a long-held theory that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan landed on the island after disappearing in 1937. If confirmed, the discovery could finally solve one of aviation's most enduring mysteries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history behind the conspiracy theories surrounding Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, arguing that they are fueled by public appetite for mystery rather than evidence. It details how Earhart's own husband, George Palmer Putnam, helped create fictions of her as a spy captured by the Japanese, profiting from films and stories. The author asserts that the overwhelming consensus among aviation historians is that Earhart and her navigator simply ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific. The piece calls for remembering her for her real achievements rather than the myths.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in cash. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and utilizes some of the nearly $344 billion in cash the conglomerate currently holds. Occidental plans to use a significant portion of the proceeds to pay down its debt, a move its CEO says will unlock the ability to restart its stock buyback program. The deal deepens Berkshire's existing investment in Occidental, where it already holds a major stake.</p>

          <h2>Why High-Priced Stocks Can Offer More Potential Than Low-Priced Ones</h2>

          <p>This article challenges the common misconception, known as "low-price bias," that stocks with a lower share price have greater upside potential than more expensive ones. It explains that a stock's nominal price is not an indicator of its value or growth prospects. Using the example of Nvidia versus International Paper, the article demonstrates how focusing on a company's fundamental growth outlook, rather than its share price, can lead to far superior returns. The piece advises investors to overcome this cognitive bias and focus on valuation and fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest Reconsidering S&P 500-Focused Strategy Amid Market Highs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 10:44:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the S&P 500 reaches record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to rethink the popular "set-it-and-forget-it" strategy of exclusively holding S&P 500 index funds. They argue the index has become less diversified, with a heavy concentration in a few large-cap technology companies, which increases volatility risk. To achieve better diversification, experts suggest considering total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or adding funds that specifically target other market segments. This approach aims to build a more balanced portfolio resilient to potential downturns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Unity Day, celebrated on October 3, commemorates the formal reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. The date was chosen over November 9, the day the Berlin Wall fell, to avoid conflicting with the anniversary of the 1938 Nazi pogroms. Despite over three decades having passed, polls indicate that many Germans, particularly in the former East, do not feel the country has fully grown together, citing persistent economic disparities in wages and wealth. The national holiday is marked by quiet celebrations and an official festival hosted by a different federal state each year.</p>

          <p>Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, has described the tokenization of real-world assets like stocks and real estate as an unstoppable "freight train" that will eventually transform the entire financial system. Speaking at a crypto conference, Tenev predicted that most major markets will establish regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets within the next five years. Tokenization involves creating a digital representation of an asset on a blockchain, which proponents argue will increase market efficiency. Robinhood has already begun offering tokenized U.S. stocks to its customers in the European Union.</p>

          <p>Following her death at age 91, this article reflects on primatologist Jane Goodall's legacy, focusing on her often overlooked role as a radical advocate for animal rights. Beyond her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees, Goodall used her scientific stature to campaign against factory farming and invasive animal experimentation. She argued that recognizing animals' complex social and cognitive lives created a moral imperative to oppose their exploitation. This stance often put her at odds with the mainstream scientific community but made her a beloved figure within the animal rights movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, a surprising result that beat analyst expectations. The company delivered 497,099 vehicles, likely boosted by a rush of U.S. buyers taking advantage of a federal EV tax credit before it expired. This growth follows two consecutive quarters of decline and comes despite a sales slump in Europe, where the company faces increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk. The company's energy storage business also saw significant growth in deployments during the quarter.</p>
