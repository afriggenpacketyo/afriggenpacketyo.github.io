          <p>India is reportedly nearing a significant trade deal with the United States, which could lead to Washington substantially slashing tariffs on Indian exports from 50% to 15-16%. As part of this potential agreement, New Delhi is considering a reduction in its oil purchases from Russia, a commitment President Trump claims to have received from Prime Minister Modi. The deal also includes India's potential increase in import quotas for non-genetically modified corn from the U.S., even with an import duty. This developing trade agreement aims to bolster the already record-high bilateral trade between the two nations, despite India's complex geopolitical balancing act with Russia and China.</p>

          <p>Netflix has announced it is "all in" on leveraging generative artificial intelligence across its streaming platform, aiming to enhance recommendations, its advertising business, and the creation of movies and TV content. The company cited examples like using AI to de-age characters in "Happy Gilmore 2" and assisting with wardrobe and set designs for "Billionaires' Bunker." CEO Ted Sarandos emphasized that AI would help creators tell stories "better, faster, and in new ways," expressing confidence that it won't replace human creativity. This stance comes amidst broader industry concerns and past labor disputes, such as the SAG-AFTRA strike, regarding AI's impact on human jobs and content usage.</p>

Former Governor Cuomo is actively appealing to conservative voters, urging Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out and avoid splitting the vote, which he believes would ensure a Mamdani victory. Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder, remains resolute in his candidacy and has escalated his critiques of Cuomo. Mamdani intends to concentrate on local concerns, while facing scrutiny over his political resume and warnings from opponents about potential instability under his leadership, even drawing attention to President Trump's threats of federal intervention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Spanish soccer league has officially canceled its plans for Barcelona to play a regular-season match against Villarreal in Miami this December, citing increased domestic opposition and insufficient time for proper event execution. This decision follows growing criticism from players, some clubs, and fans in Spain, despite initial approvals from UEFA and the Spanish federation for the league's first regular-season game abroad. Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois notably criticized the league's president and the perceived unfairness of altering the competition's integrity. The league expressed deep regret over missing a "historic opportunity" for international expansion, arguing such initiatives are crucial for the global growth and revenue generation of Spanish soccer.</p>

The incident took place at approximately 10:37 p.m. at a security checkpoint located at 17th and E streets southwest of the White House complex. Following the apprehension, the vehicle underwent a thorough assessment by both the Secret Service and the Metropolitan Police Department and was subsequently declared safe, mitigating immediate threats.

          <p>Demolition work has commenced on a section of the White House's East Wing to make way for President Trump's privately funded ballroom addition, despite his earlier assurances that it wouldn't "interfere" with the existing structure. The president publicly acknowledged the start of construction, describing it as "music to my ears" and emphasizing that it comes at "zero cost to the American Taxpayer." The project, estimated at $250 million and funded by private contributions, aims to create a grand space capable of hosting 999 people for major functions. However, the National Trust for Historic Preservation has voiced deep concerns that the 90,000-square-foot annex's massing and height could "overwhelm the White House itself."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has issued bans on gambling advertisements from two firms, Kwiff and Betway, which featured Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the Chelsea football club logo. The decision stems from investigations into complaints that these adverts were likely to appeal strongly to individuals under the age of 18, thereby breaching advertising regulations. The ASA highlighted Hamilton's substantial youth following on social media, his presence in a G-rated video game, and his role as a storyteller on a BBC children's program as indicators of his appeal to minors. Both companies have been instructed to avoid using characters with strong appeal to under-18s, with Kwiff already removing similar content.</p>

          <p>Renowned author Sir Philip Pullman has strongly urged the government to revise copyright laws concerning "scraping," the practice where writers' books are used to train artificial intelligence software without providing compensation or recognition. Pullman, echoing concerns from other prominent authors like Kate Mosse and Richard Osman, describes this practice as "wicked" and a form of "theft" that threatens the growth of creative fields. He asserts that while AI is free to utilize his work, fair payment is essential. Although the government has formed expert working groups on AI and copyright, Pullman advocates for immediate legislative changes to safeguard creators' rights against the unauthorized exploitation of their intellectual property by AI systems.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops are slated to arrive in New Orleans by late November, as confirmed by Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, to provide crucial support to local law enforcement. This deployment, initiated at the request of Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, is strategically timed for major events including the Bayou Classic college football event, extending through New Year's Eve and Mardi Gras. Kirkpatrick emphasized that the Guard's role is a "force multiplier" in a collaborative partnership, not an assumption of control, even as the New Orleans Police Department grapples with a significant staffing shortage of approximately 300 officers. Despite a reported decrease in crime rates compared to the previous year, the city continues to leverage Guard assistance for enhanced security during high-profile occasions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles communities are increasingly plunged into darkness due to a surge in copper wire thefts, resulting in millions of dollars in repair costs, as highlighted by the unlit Sixth Street Bridge. The city has received over 37,000 streetlight repair requests in 2025, with nearly half directly attributed to wire theft, leading to extensive repair delays of nine to twelve months. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is scheduled to be implemented next year, designed to curb these thefts by imposing greater responsibility on junk dealers to verify sellers' identity and the lawful ownership of scrap metal. The legislation also criminalizes the possession of certain public scrap metal and escalates penalties for recyclers, aiming to disrupt the market for stolen materials.</p>

Samsung and Google position the Galaxy XR as a crucial precursor to future AI glasses, acknowledging the current market for XR headsets remains niche and expensive without a definitive "killer app." However, significant data privacy concerns arise from Gemini's cloud-based processing, as it necessitates transmitting user activity to Google's servers.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that while the U.S. currently leads in science and technology, its dominance cannot be taken for granted, especially given China's clear and growing edge in STEM education. The author highlights that the Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. universities and immigration undermines the very factors that Nobel laureates Aghion and Howitt's mathematical modeling shows drive growth: innovation and creative destruction. The article suggests that large corporations stifling competition through acquisitions and lobbying also hinder innovation. This perspective emphasizes the need for policy changes to maintain the U.S. competitive edge in a rapidly evolving global tech landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
