          <p>The United States will resume sending weapons to Ukraine, reversing a recent decision to pause some critical arms shipments to Kyiv. The announcement came after days of intense Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, with the White House stating the move was made to ensure Ukrainians can defend themselves. This decision provides relief to the Ukrainian government, which had warned that the halt in aid, particularly for air defense systems like the Patriot missiles, would impede its ability to counter escalating Russian aggression on the front lines.</p>

          <p>England manager Sarina Wiegman believes teenage forward Michelle Agyemang can provide a unique spark for the national team during the Euro 2025 tournament. Despite limited playing time, the 19-year-old has made a significant impression, scoring just 41 seconds into her debut and showing dynamic potential in a recent match against France. Praised by teammates for her strength and on-pitch intensity, Agyemang is seen as a wildcard player who can change the course of a game, providing hope for England as they face a crucial upcoming match against the Netherlands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The initial phase of NBA free agency has seen several teams make significant moves, with the Atlanta Hawks and Houston Rockets emerging as early winners. The Hawks bolstered their roster around Trae Young by acquiring Kristaps Porzingis and other key role players, positioning themselves as a deeper team in the Eastern Conference. Meanwhile, the Rockets executed a major trade to land superstar Kevin Durant, adding a much-needed offensive closer to their young and promising squad. In contrast, the analysis suggests the Lakers have stalled, failing to make urgent win-now moves to support superstars LeBron James and Luka Dončić.</p>

          <p>Several research teams in China have recently made significant advances in optical chip technology, which could be crucial for meeting the immense computing demands of generative artificial intelligence. These new chips use light, or photons, instead of electrons to transfer data, offering the potential for much greater speed and efficiency as traditional electronic chips approach their physical limits. While the underlying theories are not new, Chinese scientists have reportedly demonstrated a hundred-fold increase in computability by expanding the number of light channels used for data transfer, a development described by experts as a significant hardware novelty.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Ban Use of NDAs for Silencing Workplace Misconduct Victims</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 03:18:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to prevent workers from speaking out about workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will void any confidentiality clauses intended to cover up such allegations, a practice described by officials as appalling. The move has been championed by campaigners for years, who argue that NDAs have been abused to protect powerful individuals and silence victims. This legal change would align the UK with countries like the US and Ireland, which have already implemented similar prohibitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has drafted a bill that would allow the government to reactivate military conscription in response to a national defense situation. The plan, seen as a compromise amid the changed security landscape in Europe, would enable the cabinet and parliament to call up conscripts if there are not enough volunteers to meet military needs. The proposal also aims to make voluntary service more attractive by significantly increasing pay for short-service soldiers. This move is part of Germany's effort to bolster its armed forces to meet new NATO guidelines, which require a total of 460,000 troops in the event of a conflict.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has reached an agreement with Nottingham Forest to sign Swedish winger Anthony Elanga for a reported fee of £55 million. The 23-year-old is being brought in to strengthen Newcastle's attacking options as the club prepares for its return to the Champions League. Elanga had a standout season with Forest, scoring six goals and providing eleven assists, which significantly raised his market value from the £15 million Forest paid for him in 2023. His performance metrics show a player who is not only improving but excelling in key offensive categories compared to his Premier League peers.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is bracing for its third heatwave of the summer, with forecasts predicting the most widespread and sustained period of hot weather yet. High pressure is expected to build, bringing hot air from continental Europe and pushing temperatures to a peak of 33C (91F) in England over the weekend. Unlike previous heatwaves focused on the south, this event is likely to affect all parts of the UK, including Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Some areas could experience seven consecutive days of temperatures that meet the official heatwave criteria, along with high UV and pollen levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beijing's recent implementation of export controls on rare earth minerals has triggered a wave of international activity aimed at diversifying supply chains and reducing reliance on China. In response to China's control over these critical materials, companies from the US and Australia are launching new exploration and development projects in countries like Kazakhstan and Brazil. These efforts highlight a growing global pushback against China's long-standing dominance in the rare earths market. Analysts note that while these initiatives are underway, Beijing still holds a very strong hand in the strategic sector.</p>

          <p>The first malaria treatment specifically designed and approved for babies and very young children is expected to be rolled out in African countries within weeks. Until now, infants under 4.5kg were treated with adjusted doses of medicines formulated for older children, which carried a risk of overdose due to their developing livers. Developed by Novartis in collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, the new drug, Coartem Baby, fills a critical treatment gap for the most vulnerable population. This breakthrough is seen as a major public health achievement in the fight against a disease that kills hundreds of thousands of children annually.</p>

The visit, which includes a state banquet hosted by King Charles III, is the first of its kind by an EU leader since Brexit. It symbolizes a significant effort by the British government to reset and improve its relationship with the European bloc.</p>
