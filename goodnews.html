          <p>Japan and the United States are planning to hold summit talks between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump in Canada, during the Group of Seven leaders' meeting in mid-June. Prior to the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, will visit Washington for a sixth round of negotiations on Trump's tariffs, setting the stage for the leaders' meeting. Japan aims to have the Trump administration remove its tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but may consider accepting reduced tariff rates due to the United States' consistent refusal to eliminate them.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated prices. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the farm minister expecting the 2020 rice to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will leave the country with a rice reserve of around 100,000 tons, down from about 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks through auctions in March and April. The government is also investigating suspected hoarding by wholesalers and farmers. </p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted as the fentanyl crisis eases, with fatal overdoses among those under 35 dropping from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. This decline is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of naloxone, less deadly fentanyl, more accessible addiction healthcare, and safer drug choices among teens and twenty-somethings. Despite this positive trend, challenges remain for those struggling with severe addiction, and potential funding cuts to addiction services could jeopardize the progress. While a major decline in drug related deaths is a positive trend, there is still a long way to go. </p>
