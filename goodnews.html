        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fox Corp has acquired Caliente TV, a Mexican sports broadcasting platform, to bolster its sports programming and expand its streaming services. Carlos Martinez, a former executive at Turner, Discovery, and Fox, will lead Latin American operations for Fox Corp. The acquisition is part of Fox's strategy to increase its sports content as streaming becomes the dominant form of TV consumption. Fox plans to launch its own streaming service, Fox One, later this year, adding to its existing Tubi platform. The company's broadcast rights include the Big Ten Conference, The United Football League, and the Premier League and the FA Cup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, providing ¬£150 off energy bills to millions more households this winter. The changes remove property-related qualifications, allowing anyone on means-tested benefits to receive the discount. While welcomed by debt charities and energy groups, some argue the scheme still excludes vulnerable individuals on non-means-tested benefits. The expansion could be funded by raising fees on all customer bills, but the government aims to offset this with savings from energy companies. Current market expectations suggest another rise in gas and electricity bills from October due to higher oil and gas prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump has extended the enforcement deadline for a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. for another 90 days, now until September 17, due to unresolved issues with separating TikTok from its parent company, ByteDance. The delay marks the third extension since January, as Congress passed the law last year citing national security concerns. The administration is working to ensure a deal is reached so Americans can continue using TikTok with data security assurances. Trump has expressed confidence that China will ultimately approve the deal.</p>

          <p>Edith Edmunds, a 99-year-old quilter, celebrates Juneteenth by sewing, reflecting on the role quilts may have played in the Underground Railroad. Edmunds learned that enslaved people used encoded messages in quilts to guide runaways to freedom. The quilts displayed patterns such as the "monkey wrench," "north star," and "bow tie" to convey instructions and warnings. While some historians doubt the use of quilts as codes due to lack of written evidence, others argue that the secrecy surrounding the Underground Railroad would explain the absence of documentation.</p>
