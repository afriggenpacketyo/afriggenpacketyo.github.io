          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America's annual report identifies the most challenging US cities for allergy sufferers, with Wichita, Kansas, topping the list for the third consecutive year due to high tree and grass pollen counts. Dr. Purvi Parikh from NYU Langone recommends starting medications early, washing clothes after being outdoors, and staying indoors during peak pollen times, which are typically in the mornings and late afternoons. The article also notes that allergy symptoms can mimic those of colds and viruses, advising individuals unsure of their condition to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment. The article offers practical advice for managing seasonal allergies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall electric vehicle (EV) exports from China to the UK have decreased, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles have experienced a significant surge, increasing nearly 600% in the first quarter of the year. The UK remains a key export destination for Chinese EVs, subject only to a standard 10% import tariff, unlike the higher tariffs imposed by the European Union. This trend reflects a growing embrace of Chinese car brands among Britons, driven by affordability and a desire for change from traditional European marques. The article highlights the increasing popularity of hybrid vehicles as a viable alternative in the UK market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about upcoming peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, suggesting a "big week" ahead and emphasizing the potential to end the "bloodbath." This follows Putin's announcement of a unilateral three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine stated was repeatedly violated, and Zelenskyy's counter-offer of a 30-day ceasefire. Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday, without preconditions, and Zelenskyy has responded positively, calling it "a positive sign." The article outlines the ongoing efforts to establish a lasting ceasefire and resume negotiations between the two countries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, addresses the anxieties and pressures faced by mothers, arguing that being a "perfect mother" is not only unattainable but also harmful. She emphasizes that flaws are an essential part of motherhood, teaching children to accept their own imperfections and understand the give-and-take nature of relationships. The article critiques the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack, recognizing that their efforts are already good enough. The article offers a quiz to help mothers acknowledge their imperfections and embrace self-compassion.</p>

          <h2>Evaluating High-Yield Stocks: Realty Income and Toronto-Dominion Bank as Potential Investments (not investment advice)</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 04:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses high-yield stocks for dividend investors, cautioning against reaching too far for yield, using AGNC Investment as an example of a mortgage REIT with a high but potentially unsustainable dividend. Realty Income, a REIT with a 5.6% yield and 30 years of annual dividend increases, is presented as a more stable option. Toronto-Dominion Bank, with a 4.7% yield and a long history of dividend payments, is also highlighted as a potentially worthwhile investment. The article suggests that Realty Income and Toronto-Dominion Bank are better suited for dividend investors seeking steady income and growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remains stable at 6.76%, close to the year's highest levels, but below the 7.09% average from a year prior. Rising mortgage rates and increasing home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster spring home-buying season. Recent fluctuations in mortgage rates mirror volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, influenced by factors such as global demand for US bonds and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. The article points to a subdued start to the spring home-buying season due to these affordability obstacles.</p>
