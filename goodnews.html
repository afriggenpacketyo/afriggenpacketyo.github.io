This emphatic win marked their 28th consecutive triumph, with Ellie Kildunne delivering a player-of-the-match performance, scoring two tries and assisting two others, solidifying her status as a tournament face. Despite the team's smooth execution and strong scrum, head coach John Mitchell highlighted the need for improvement in areas like midfield passing and defensive pressure, indicating a strategic focus on refining skills for the increasingly challenging knockout rounds. The team remains committed to building on this strong start to achieve new heights, fueling an appetite for improvement that bodes ill for their rivals.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists and divers have retrieved ancient artifacts, including a sphinx statue and Roman coins, from the Mediterranean Sea near Alexandria, Egypt, dating back over 2,000 years. These historic treasures are believed to be from an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, which existed during the Ptolemaic dynasty and Roman Empire. Damage to the statues, such as missing heads and feet, suggests a natural disaster like an earthquake or tsunami caused the city's submersion. This discovery confirms the area was once a thriving residential city and port, offering crucial insights into Alexandria's rich history as it faces modern threats from rising sea levels.</p>

These consumer-ready glasses, expected to cost around $800, will be paired with a wristband utilizing sEMG sensor technology for hand gesture control, a key input component for future full AR glasses. The device aims to relay simple information like text messages, with Meta setting low sales expectations due to increased components and weight, and acknowledged challenges in wristband wearability. This initiative, despite significant losses in its Reality Labs unit, seeks to advance AR technology and court third-party developers for experimental apps.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is nearing finalization of new three-year media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, with all major rights expiring after the 2028 season. NBC is set to acquire Sunday night games and wild-card playoffs for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix will secure Home Run Derby rights for about $50 million a year. ESPN will receive a new package worth $550 million, including MLB TV and local team games, despite earlier requests to reduce payments. These deals reflect a strategic shift in the media landscape, with streaming services increasingly entering lucrative sports broadcasting, potentially benefiting the league monetarily and in terms of reach.

          <p>Ether (ETH) surged to a new record high, marking its first since 2021, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole hinted at potential interest rate cuts. Powell's comments, suggesting policy adjustments may be warranted, triggered a "panicked repositioning" among traders, leading to significant short liquidations for ETH and a rebound for crypto-focused companies. This momentum shift, coupled with regulatory tailwinds boosting institutional interest in stablecoins (many powered by Ethereum), has positioned ether as a leading crypto asset. Experts like Fudstrat's Tom Lee now call it "the biggest macro trade over the next 10 to 15 years," driven by "Project Crypto" from the SEC and Wall Street's move onto the blockchain.

The move aims to strengthen U.S. leadership in semiconductors and boost domestic manufacturing, following Trump's earlier criticism of Intel's CEO regarding China ties and his broader trade war strategy. While rare, the government previously took a stake in General Motors during the 2008 financial crisis, incurring a loss upon exit, raising questions about blurring public and private sector lines.

          <p>Millions of American retirees rely on Social Security, but many are unaware that their benefits can be reduced by several factors beyond early claiming, making every dollar crucial. Working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an "earnings test," temporarily reducing payments based on income thresholds. Medicare Part B premiums are automatically deducted, with high-income earners facing higher Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA) that can significantly increase costs. Additionally, federal income taxes can apply to up to 85% of benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds, often surprising retirees. Understanding these potential reductions is crucial for comprehensive retirement planning, with options like reverse mortgages, part-time work, or annuities available to supplement income.

The Fed aims for a "Goldilocks balance" between employment and inflation, which has seen recent increases due to Trump's tariffs, causing price growth. The labor market's "curious kind of balance" and slowing economic activity are key factors driving the Fed's openness to rate adjustments, though Powell's overall tone was far from optimistic, hinting at limits to monetary policy's ability to counter executive policies.

His nearly two-decade career, which included over 3,000 wins, ended prematurely in 1978 after a racing accident left him paraplegic. Despite his personal challenges, Turcotte remained an inspiration and advocate for fellow fallen riders, earning induction into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame in 1979 for his enduring legacy.</p>
