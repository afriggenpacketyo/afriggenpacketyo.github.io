          <p>A decade after its launch, Ethereum has transformed from a niche project into a foundational layer for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin and early adopters like EY's Paul Brody reflect on its growth from a cypherpunk ideal to the backbone for stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized finance applications used by major corporations. While celebrating its success in integrating with Wall Street, Buterin also warns of the risks of centralization if a few large entities dominate the ecosystem, emphasizing the need to maintain its decentralized principles.</p>

          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirms that agents cannot base detentions solely on factors like a person's race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish, as such actions likely violate the Fourth Amendment. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over sweeps conducted by the Trump administration that advocates argued were unconstitutional racial profiling. The administration criticized the decision, stating that it undermines law enforcement's efforts to remove criminals.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at a young age was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in entertainment. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for the medical profession and was at his "end of the tether." He recalled a moment of breaking bad news to a patient's family where he felt completely out of his depth. The experience, coupled with his stepfather's passing, inspired him to take a year off to try comedy, a path that led to his successful television career.</p>

This shift contrasts sharply with China, where a competitive open-source AI ecosystem is flourishing, with companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI recently releasing advanced models. AI expert Andrew Ng suggests that this vibrant, competitive environment in China could be the country's path to surpassing the United States in AI development, as Chinese firms rapidly iterate and improve upon foundational models.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic hurdles champion Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone won the 400-meter flat race at the U.S. track and field trials, booking her place at the upcoming World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. Choosing to compete in the flat 400m instead of her signature hurdles event, she dominated the race with a time of 48.90 seconds. The victory demonstrates her versatility and incredible talent on the track. In other events, Jacory Patterson won the men's 400m, and Masai Russell claimed victory in the women's 100m hurdles.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. She was taken into custody in May during what she believed was a routine appointment for her green card application, shortly after giving birth to her second child. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, expressed fury over the arrest, which occurred despite her family ties and his military service. Her release is conditional, requiring an ankle monitor and regular check-ins as her immigration case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus named Winston, a diplomatic gift from Australia to UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, died during its WWII voyage. While wartime rumors suggested the creature died from shock due to a nearby German U-boat attack, archival research tells a different story. By analyzing the ship attendant's logbook, researchers from the Australian Museum and the University of Sydney concluded that the platypus likely succumbed to overheating as the ship crossed the equator, rather than from the stress of naval conflict.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using large-scale theme parks as a tool to stimulate consumer spending and boost local economies. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example of this strategy, adding to the more than 4,400 amusement facilities across the nation. According to the global association for the theme park industry, these attractions have a significant economic multiplier effect. The industry is projected to grow at an annual rate of 19 percent over the next three years, reflecting a strong government and corporate push to expand the leisure and tourism sector.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start since returning from a shoulder injury, but the Tampa Bay Rays secured a 4-0 victory. Over five innings, the left-hander recorded eight strikeouts with no walks, flashing his Cy Young-winning form. However, he surrendered two home runs to Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the team's temporary ballpark. Despite the loss, Snell's promising outing was a positive development for the Dodgers' late-season rotation plans.</p>
