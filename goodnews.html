          <p>The Chinese government has introduced a new plan to strengthen its cattle industry in response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports. The policy, announced by the nation's top economic planner, aims to increase domestic beef production and consumption by implementing a quality-grading system. Officials noted that there is significant room for growth in high-quality protein consumption among Chinese residents. Wholesale beef prices have rebounded slightly from an eight-year low in March but remain significantly lower than in previous years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The court ruled that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore other laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face persecution or torture. This move effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims, although migrants will likely remain detained during processing. The Trump administration had credited the ban with a significant drop in illegal border crossings and may appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a defense deal worth approximately $6.5 billion. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described it as the largest defense-industry agreement ever made between the two nations, strengthening their strategic partnership in the Indo-Pacific. The stealthy, next-generation warships are part of Australia's major military restructuring aimed at enhancing long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion. This deal marks Japan's first warship export since before World War II and reflects Australia's goal to more than double its fleet of major warships over the next decade.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement in a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties over allegations of improper hazardous waste disposal. The lawsuit claimed that UPS facilities were disposing of corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. Prosecutors noted that UPS was cooperative during the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funding for supplemental environmental projects to address the violations.</p>

          <p>Southern California is entering its annual tarantula mating season, which lasts from August through December, leading to a noticeable increase in the spiders' activity. During this period, male tarantulas leave their burrows in search of mates, often traveling long distances and becoming more visible during dusk and nighttime hours. Experts note that while their appearance can be intimidating, local tarantula species are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked. Common sighting locations include Joshua Tree National Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, and various desert and chaparral habitats across the region.</p>

          <p>NFL star Saquon Barkley has turned down an invitation to serve on President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. The Philadelphia Eagles running back stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family decided it was in his best interest not to accept the position. The council is being re-established as part of an executive order that also brings back the Presidential Fitness Test for school children. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, emphasized that his decision was practical and that he respects the office of the president.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been found by archaeologists in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery was part of a broader project surveying caverns in the area, which also uncovered evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. The project, a partnership between researchers and experienced local cavers, is shedding new light on the prehistoric human and agricultural history of the region. These findings underscore the long history of farming and land use on what is now protected common land.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant rally, climbing more than 20% after President Trump publicly endorsed the company's marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ad, which plays on the word "genes/jeans," had drawn criticism from some online commentators who accused it of promoting eugenics, a claim the company denies. In a social media post, Trump praised the "HOTTEST" ad and Sweeney, a registered Republican, while criticizing "woke" advertising from other brands. The presidential endorsement fueled a meme-driven stock surge for the retailer, which has recently faced financial difficulties and slow sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 2.5 million Premium Bond prizes, totaling over £100 million, are currently unclaimed in the United Kingdom, according to a new report. The government-owned bank that runs the savings scheme, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is facing criticism that its process for tracing winners is too difficult, especially for older accounts or those gifted to children. Among the unclaimed winnings are 11 prizes of £100,000 each. While NS&I states it has paid out over 99% of prizes since 1957, critics are calling for reforms to make it easier for people to claim their money.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that lowering the recommended screening age for colorectal cancer to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for that age group. Following updated guidelines, screening rates among people aged 45 to 49 increased by 62% between 2019 and 2023. This corresponds with a sharp rise in the detection of localized cancers, which are more treatable. While researchers celebrate this as promising news, they caution that screening rates in this younger demographic remain suboptimal and inequitable across different education and insurance levels.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's recent rebound is primarily driven by the strong financial performance of the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies, including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Despite a weak labor report and new tariff announcements that initially caused a downturn, the market recovered strongly, with the major indexes showing significant gains. Cramer noted that these tech giants, with their massive cash reserves, diverse revenue streams, and tight expense controls, provide a resilient foundation for the market.

          <p>A Birmingham woman whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held firearm says she feels hopeful after new, tighter gun control measures came into law in the UK. Emma Ambler has campaigned for stricter laws since her family was killed in 2020 by her sister's partner, who had lied on his gun license application. The new rules, effective August 5, increase the number of references required for shotgun certificates and mandate police checks for domestic abuse signs. The changes are a direct response to several recent mass shootings and aim to prevent unsuitable individuals from accessing firearms.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office has saved the state nearly $170 billion by successfully litigating against the Trump administration over the last six months. Speaking alongside Governor Gavin Newsom, Bonta reported that for every dollar of the $5 million spent from special legislative funding, his office has secured a return of $33,600 for the state. A significant portion of these savings came from blocking an administration effort to freeze federal funding for states. Bonta's office has filed 37 lawsuits and numerous legal briefs challenging federal policies on healthcare, education, transportation, and immigration.</p>

The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process and recommends follow-up plans that include healthy eating, exercise, and behavioral support.
