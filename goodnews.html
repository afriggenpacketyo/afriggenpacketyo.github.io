          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not observed a decrease in consumer demand despite President Trump's tariffs. Jassy's comments came during Amazon's annual shareholder meeting. While Amazon acknowledged tariffs as a potential factor that could affect its guidance for the current quarter, the company has not yet seen significant price increases. This contrasts with warnings from rival retailer Walmart, which indicated that consumers could start seeing price hikes due to tariffs later in May and June. Trump responded to Walmart's warning by urging the company to absorb the costs.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, expressed his preference for stocks over real estate as a long-term investment, citing greater opportunities in the security market, especially in the United States. Buffett acknowledged Charlie Munger's fondness for real estate but emphasized that Munger would have chosen stocks over real estate if he had to pick one at 21. This statement aligns with the historical performance of the stock market, where the S&P 500 has significantly outperformed real estate in terms of long-term returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA has cleared the first blood test for detecting amyloid plaques, a key marker of Alzheimer's disease, offering a faster and more accurate diagnosis for individuals aged 55 and older with cognitive symptoms. This test, the Lumipulse assay by Fujirebio, is expected to revolutionize Alzheimer's care by enabling primary care physicians to quickly assess patients and improve diagnostic accuracy. The availability of a readily accessible blood test is likely to lead to earlier diagnoses, allowing more patients to access amyloid-reducing drugs and participate in clinical trials, particularly in underserved communities.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, reversing a decision that affected over 10 million pensioners. The government will change the threshold to allow more pensioners to qualify again. The original decision to restrict eligibility to those receiving pension credit was met with criticism from unions and charities. This policy change will be implemented at the autumn Budget, with details on the new threshold yet to be determined, and ministers emphasize that decisions will be fiscally responsible.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin slipped after reaching a new all-time high, as rising Treasury yields and stock market declines pressured risk assets. The cryptocurrency initially surged to $109,857 before trading flat at $106,678.74, according to Coin Metrics. Despite the pullback, bitcoin has seen a steady climb in May, supported by cumulative inflows into ETFs and recent risk-off scenarios related to concerns about tariffs and deficits in the U.S. On-chain data indicates lower selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market, with investors anticipating regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to drive prices higher.

Analysts cite TJX's strong performance in a volatile market and its ability to thrive in various economic conditions as reasons for the upgrade.
