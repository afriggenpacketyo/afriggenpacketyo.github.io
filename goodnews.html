          <p>The UK's largest road tunnel project, the Lower Thames Crossing, has been awarded ¬£590m by the government as part of a ¬£1bn package to improve transport infrastructure across England. The project, estimated to cost ¬£10bn, aims to link Tilbury in Essex and Gravesend in Kent, with plans approved in March after a 16-year process. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the crossing would facilitate smoother passage of goods from Europe, with construction expected to begin in 2026 and completion by 2032. The government intends to seek private finance for the project, which National Highways hopes will reduce traffic at the Dartford Crossing by 20%.</p>

This law, available in a limited number of states, offers a way for people to protect themselves during moments of crisis.

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is continuing its efforts to reshape the federal government, even after the departure of its high-profile leader, Elon Musk. DOGE's focus is now on embedding its principles within agencies and implementing cost-cutting measures. Many DOGE staffers have transitioned to permanent government positions, and agencies are embracing DOGE-inspired initiatives. Despite criticisms and legal challenges, the Trump administration views DOGE's work as central to its vision of a more efficient federal bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>Music therapy can be as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy in managing symptoms and anxieties associated with cancer. A study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting highlights the benefits of a hybrid therapy combining talk, music, and lyrical composition. Music therapy offers a creative outlet for patients to process their emotions and improve their quality of life. The act of creation and collaboration with a trained therapist can provide a unique path to healing.</p>
