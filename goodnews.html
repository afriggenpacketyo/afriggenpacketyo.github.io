As part of the agreement, Home Depot's subsidiary, SRS Distribution, will purchase all outstanding shares of GMS for $110 per share. The deal, which is expected to close by early 2026, also concludes a potential bidding war for GMS with another building-products distributor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax (DST) just hours before it was set to take effect, a move aimed at restarting trade negotiations with the United States. The decision came after President Trump threatened to impose higher tariffs on Canadian imports, calling the tax a "blatant attack" on the U.S. The 3% tax would have affected the Canadian revenue of large tech companies like Google and Amazon. Canadian officials stated the tax was being withdrawn to facilitate a "mutually beneficial comprehensive trade arrangement" with their largest trading partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo were identified by analysts as the "biggest winners" of the Federal Reserve's 2025 stress tests, which all 22 participating banks passed. The annual tests simulate a severe economic downturn to assess banks' resilience. Both Goldman and Wells saw their stress capital buffer requirements lowered more than their peers, which could free up significant capital for share buybacks, dividends, and new investments. The results are seen as another sign of a potentially easing regulatory environment for large banks, contributing to a rally in financial sector stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly preparing to sign an executive order to ease U.S. sanctions on Syria, following his announcement in May that all sanctions on the country would be lifted. The move comes after the collapse of the Assad regime and the establishment of a new transitional government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa. The new government has been pushing for sanctions relief to help pay civil service salaries and rebuild the war-torn country. While some sanctions require congressional action to be revoked, the Treasury Department has already issued guidance to roll back some restrictions to encourage new investment in Syria.</p>
