        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article explores the debate over whether companies are justified in raising prices in response to tariffs, particularly those imposed by President Trump on Chinese imports. While mainstream economists argue that companies must pass along the costs of tariffs to consumers or absorb them through lower profits, populist thinkers suggest that companies have more pricing power than commonly believed. The article cites examples from the pandemic, where some companies raised prices beyond cost increases due to reduced consumer sensitivity, and includes perspectives from both liberal and conservative economists on corporate pricing strategies and the potential for companies to mitigate tariff impacts through various means.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unveiled plans for a missile defense system called "Golden Dome" to protect the United States from missile threats, reminiscent of President Reagan's "Star Wars" program. The project, estimated to cost tens to hundreds of billions of dollars, aims to integrate with existing defense capabilities and be fully operational within three years. Gen. Michael Guetlein will lead the project, which intends to intercept missiles launched from anywhere, including space. Critics question the necessity and potential financial strain on other vital programs, while supporters highlight the need to counter evolving threats from countries like North Korea.</p>

          <p>Millions of consumers in the UK could receive up to ¬£70 each following a court approval of a settlement in a lawsuit against Mastercard. The lawsuit, initiated by a former financial ombudsman, alleges that shoppers were charged higher prices due to wrongly levied fees on businesses over a 15-year period between 1992 and 2008. Consumers who lived in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland for at least three months between June 1997 and June 2008, and bought goods or services from UK businesses accepting Mastercard credit cards, are eligible to claim compensation.</p>

          <p>European Union foreign ministers have agreed to lift the remaining economic sanctions on Syria, aiming to aid the nation's recovery after years of war and the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad in late 2024.

While the EU will maintain weapons-related sanctions, the removal of economic restrictions is intended to encourage investment in local businesses.

          <h2>Appeals Court Halts Temecula School District Ban on Critical Race Theory</h2>

          <p>A California appeals court has ruled that the Temecula school district must immediately set aside its ban on critical race theory while litigation over it plays out. The court found the policy "unconstitutionally vague" and said teachers experienced anxiety and confusion, fearing repercussions for even accidental violations. The appeals court reversed the ruling of a trial court judge, who had denied a request to halt the policy. The Trump administration has policies that echo those of the Temecula school system on both critical race theory and parent notification.</p>

          <p>A Florida judge denied a request by Travis Hunter's father to lighten his community control supervision sentence for gun and drug possession charges, stating it appeared to be seeking "special treatment" due to his son's football career. Hunter Sr.'s lawyer argued that his circumstances had changed as his son could employ him. The judge maintained that it could be perceived as favoritism. Hunter Sr. was permitted to attend the NFL Draft and will be allowed to attend his son's wedding.</p>

The bust disappeared just seven years later, puzzling Parisian authorities and fans alike. The bust was recently recovered during an unrelated investigation conducted by the police.</p>

          <p>Southampton has identified Lens manager Will Still as their leading candidate for the vacant position at St Mary's Stadium. The 32-year-old, born in Belgium to English parents, announced last weekend he is leaving French side Lens to move back to the UK. The move is complicated by negotiations that need to take place to free Still from his contract at the Ligue 1 club, which runs until 2027, as Lens could be due compensation.</p>

          <p>Google is taking a significant step in artificial intelligence by adding interactive capabilities to its flagship product. Google said it was introducing a new feature in its search engine called A.I. Mode.

Mode, Google is essentially trying to disrupt its traditional search business before upstart A.I. competitors can disrupt it.</p>
