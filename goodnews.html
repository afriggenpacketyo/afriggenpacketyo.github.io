          <p>Fraudsters managed to pilfer ¬£47 million from approximately 100,000 individuals by impersonating taxpayers and targeting the UK's tax authority, HMRC. The tax authority is contacting affected individuals to reassure them that their accounts have been secured, no money has been lost, and no action is required on their part. HMRC clarified that the fraudulent activity targeted the tax authority rather than individual customers. A criminal investigation has been conducted, and arrests were made in the previous year. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the IRS's five-year rule for annuities, which affects how non-spouse beneficiaries must take distributions from an inherited annuity when the original owner dies. It generally applies to non-qualified annuities funded with after-tax dollars and requires the entire value of the annuity to be distributed within five years of the original owner's death. Beneficiaries should make elections early and be aware of tax implications, as withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Careful planning is essential to avoid tax headaches and ensure the money is distributed according to financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The defusal of World War II bombs in central Cologne, Germany, was delayed due to a resident refusing to evacuate the area. The bomb squad cannot begin defusal until the area is fully cleared, with public order officials, police, and the fire department enforcing removal measures. Large areas of the city center were closed off, and approximately 20,000 people were ordered to leave the affected zone as experts prepared to defuse three bombs left over from World War II. The city's major landmark, the Cologne Cathedral, is, however, situated just outside the danger area.</p>

          <p>This article argues that a big government, with proper oversight, is still beneficial even with Donald Trump in power. While some believe a smaller government would limit potential harm, the author contends that the main issue is a lack of oversight. The piece highlights that wealthy economies are products of big government and that a robust state is essential for addressing crises. Reforms should focus on more oversight and checks and balances rather than shrinking government, which can make people more vulnerable.</p>
