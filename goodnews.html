          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought to deport him for his role in campus protests against Israel. Upon arrival, Khalil affirmed his commitment to advocating for Palestinian rights, denouncing the administration's actions as a violation of his First Amendment rights. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who greeted him at the airport, echoed these sentiments, criticizing the administration's attempt to punish Khalil for his political speech. The judge ruled that Khalil was neither a threat to the community nor a flight risk, determining that the government's actions appeared to be an attempt to punish Khalil for his anti-Israel speech.</p>

          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Louisiana following a federal judge's order. Khalil, who had been in custody for months due to the Trump administration's attempt to deport him over "foreign policy" concerns, addressed reporters after his release. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a threat to the community or a flight risk and criticized his detention as "highly unusual." Despite the government's intention to appeal, Khalil was allowed to return to New York, with travel restrictions imposed. The ACLU, representing Khalil, expressed relief, while the White House and Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's decision.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have pledged $1 million to support families impacted by recent immigration raids in Southern California. The team plans to partner with organizations like the California Community Foundation and the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor to provide ongoing assistance. The announcement, carefully worded to avoid political terms, emphasizes support for immigrant families affected by recent events. The Dodgers' move follows criticism and calls for the team to take a stand against federal immigration policies, particularly given their significant Latino fan base. Other local sports teams, including LAFC and Angel City FC, have also expressed solidarity with the immigrant community.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie Jacob Misiorowski made MLB history by starting his career with 11 consecutive no-hit innings. In his second MLB start, Misiorowski took a perfect game into the seventh inning before allowing a home run. He became the first starting pitcher in the modern era to achieve this feat. Misiorowski, who has been clocked at 103 mph, struck out six and threw 60 of 86 pitches for strikes. The Brewers won the game 17-6 against the Minnesota Twins. Misiorowski is the only big leaguer since 1900 to have more wins than hits allowed in his first two career starts.</p>

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, named "Gwada negative." The discovery, made by the French Blood Establishment (EFS), was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. The woman is the only known carrier of this blood type, which was identified after a "very unusual" antibody was found in her blood in 2011. Scientists were able to unravel the mystery in 2019 using high-throughput DNA sequencing, which highlighted a genetic mutation. The patient inherited the blood type from her parents, who each had the mutated gene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This week, the market was influenced by geopolitical tensions, particularly the intensifying war between Israel and Iran, and updates from the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 lost 0.15%, the Nasdaq rose 0.21%, and the Dow was flat, showing a relatively stable market despite underlying news. Investors closely monitored safe-haven assets like gold and the dollar, as well as oil prices, in response to the conflict. The Fed kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged, balancing concerns about inflation and economic growth. The market's direction appears to be more influenced by individual company fundamentals and industry trends than by higher-level dynamics, such as interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
