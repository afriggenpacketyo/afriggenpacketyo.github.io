          <p>Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, has reported to federal prison in Pennsylvania after being sentenced to 57 months for stealing nearly $17 million from Ohtani. Mizuhara pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return, admitting to placing about 19,000 bets with a bookie over two years and accumulating over $40 million in debt. Ohtani publicly addressed the gambling scandal, stating he had never placed a sports bet and that Mizuhara's story about paying off his gambling debt was fabricated.

          <p>For the first time since 2019, all 13 of Yosemite's campgrounds will be open to visitors this summer, according to the National Parks Service. This reopening will provide an additional 500 campsites compared to recent years, enhancing opportunities for visitors to experience the park. Maintenance and staffing challenges had kept several campgrounds closed since 2020, but those issues have been resolved. Reservations for Yosemite are available at Recreation.gov, and visitors can still access the park using day passes when campgrounds are unavailable.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reduced the hours of a nightly curfew in downtown Los Angeles, allowing businesses to remain open later into the evening. The curfew, which had begun at 8 p.m., will now begin at 10 p.m., while still lifting at 6 a.m. The curfew was enacted following protests in response to President Trump‚Äôs immigration crackdown in Southern California, which led to looting and vandalism. The reduced curfew hours reflect progress in reducing crime and vandalism, though the LAPD will maintain a strong presence in the downtown area.</p>

          <p>At the G7 summit in Canada, President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom while standing next to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump accidentally dropped the document, blaming the wind, and initially misstated that the agreement was with the European Union. The White House clarified that the agreement was with the United Kingdom, and Trump said the agreement was not much different from one he signed with the U.K. in May. The White House provided additional details on steel and aluminum in the US-UK agreement, saying that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will determine a quota of products that can enter the U.S. without being subject to the 25% Section 232 tariff.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was "void and illegal." The judge stated that the cuts, which targeted research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), represented unlawful ‚Äúracial discrimination and discrimination against America‚Äôs LGBTQ community‚Äù. The judge ordered that grants previously awarded to the organizations and states that filed the lawsuit against the Trump administration be reinstated.
