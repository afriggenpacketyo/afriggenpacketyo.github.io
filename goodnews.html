          <p>During Indira Gandhi's Emergency in the mid-1970s, her government considered shifting India from a parliamentary democracy to a presidential system. This shift aimed to centralize executive power, sideline the judiciary, and weaken parliament, drawing inspiration from Charles de Gaulle's France. A secret document proposed a president with extensive powers, including control over judicial appointments, but Gandhi remained non-committal. Although the idea never fully materialized, it influenced the Forty-second Amendment Act, which expanded parliamentary powers and centralized executive authority.</p>
