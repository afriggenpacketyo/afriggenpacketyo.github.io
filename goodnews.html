          <p>Language learning company Duolingo saw its stock price increase by over 30% after significantly raising its full-year revenue and bookings forecast. The company attributes this strong performance to a 40% jump in daily active users, now nearly 48 million, largely driven by the successful integration of AI features. To further expand its offerings, Duolingo has introduced new courses like chess and acquired music gaming startup NextBeat. This growth reflects the company's early-stage trajectory and successful implementation of new technologies to enhance user engagement and expand its product line beyond language learning.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are weighing in on investment strategies as the Trump administration's tariffs create market volatility, including a new 100% tariff on imported semiconductor chips. While some advisors suggest long-term investors should ignore short-term fluctuations, others point to tactical opportunities in sectors less exposed to tariffs, such as financials and utilities. Strategists note that the S&P 500 has remained resilient, rising over 12% since April, reinforcing the principle that patience can be more effective than panic. For those seeking to be more strategic, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on areas like cryptocurrency and nuclear energy are seen as potential hedges against trade uncertainty.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an era of increasing incivility, particularly online, being polite is not just a social grace but a key to personal well-being, this article argues. Research shows that both witnessing rudeness and being impolite can negatively impact happiness and increase anger, while courteous behavior, even towards AI bots, is linked to improved mood and prosocial actions. The author suggests three personal rules: making courtesy a habit in all interactions, renouncing snark, and responding to rudeness with dignity instead of retaliation. Practicing politeness is framed as a countercultural act of personal freedom that can lead to a greater sense of self-control and happiness in a coarse society.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A startup named Neurable is commercializing headphones equipped with a brain-computer interface that uses EEG sensors to monitor the user's focus and cognitive state. The technology, currently available in a $700 pair of Master & Dynamic headphones, can detect when a user's attention wanes and prompt them to take a break. While the device does not read thoughts, it interprets brainwave frequencies to measure attention and is being developed to track broader brain health metrics, potentially detecting early signs of conditions like depression or Alzheimer's. This non-invasive approach represents a significant step in making neurotechnology accessible for everyday use, with potential applications in wellness, productivity, and medical diagnostics.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has lowered its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, marking the fifth reduction since last August and reaching the lowest rate in over two years. The decision was narrowly passed after two votes, signaling that future cuts will be carefully considered amid concerns about rising inflation, which is now forecast to peak at 4%. While the cut will reduce mortgage costs for some homeowners, it may lead to lower returns for savers. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey stated that despite higher-than-target inflation, the move was necessary to support a struggling economy and a softening jobs market.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has made the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the 2026-27 academic year available earlier than usual for beta testing. This early release, which will open to all students for testing on September 1 before its official October launch, is intended to identify and fix potential bugs that caused significant problems in the previous cycle. Financial aid experts have praised the move, stating that a longer testing window will lead to a smoother application process for families. Submitting the FAFSA is a critical step for students seeking federal grants, loans, and work-study programs to cover rising college costs.</p>

          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force successfully executed a perilous mid-winter medical evacuation, rescuing three people from the U.S. McMurdo Station research base in Antarctica. The nearly 20-hour mission was conducted in 24-hour darkness and sub-zero temperatures, with the crew using night vision goggles to land a C-130J Hercules on a manually prepared ice runway. U.S. officials requested the evacuation due to insufficient medical resources at the base and lauded the mission as "nothing short of heroic." The challenging conditions, including unpredictable weather and the need to keep the plane's engines running during refueling, highlight the extreme difficulty of such rescue operations.</p>

          <p>Strong performance from its film studios, fueled by several box-office hits, boosted Warner Bros. Discovery's second-quarter financial results. The studios segment saw its revenue increase by 55% to $3.8 billion, driven by successful releases like "A Minecraft Movie" and "F1," which collectively generated $2 billion globally. CEO David Zaslav noted the significant turnaround for the studio, which has moved from "last to first" in performance since key leadership changes were made after the 2022 merger. The company expects this momentum to continue, projecting at least $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the studios segment for the full year. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies like TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix have already pledged billions for facilities in states like Arizona and Texas, which may grant them an exemption from the new duties as Trump stated companies "building in the United States" would not be charged. Chip stocks, including TSMC and U.S.-based GlobalFoundries, rose on investor optimism that their domestic operations will shield them from the tariffs. The policy has brought a sharp focus on the domestic supply chain, with major tech players like Apple and Nvidia also highlighting their U.S.-based production partnerships.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to eliminate congressionally approved grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) was "unlawful." The ruling allows a lawsuit, filed by Oregon Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils, to proceed. The groups sued after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) abruptly terminated funding for thousands of organizations nationwide. In his decision, the judge stated that the groups were likely to succeed in their claim that withholding the funds is unconstitutional, as the power of the purse belongs exclusively to Congress. Humanities groups praised the ruling as a crucial step but noted that vital programs remain unfunded.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have detected a candidate gas giant planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, the closest Sun-like star to Earth, located just 4.3 light years away. This real-world discovery echoes the fictional setting of the "Avatar" movies, where the moon Pandora orbits a gas giant in the same star system. The planet, which is roughly the size of Jupiter, appears to be in the star's habitable zone, where temperatures could potentially support life. While the planet's existence requires further confirmation, scientists speculate it could have moons, raising the tantalizing, though remote, possibility of a life-supporting environment similar to the one imagined in science fiction.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of three key financial tools for seniors: Social Security, annuities, and reverse mortgages, explaining how each can fit into a retirement strategy. Social Security is presented as a reliable foundation, but its benefits are often insufficient to cover all expenses alone. Annuities are highlighted as a tool for those seeking a guaranteed lifetime income stream, similar to a personal pension, to fill income gaps. Reverse mortgages are positioned as an option for house-rich, cash-poor seniors to tap into home equity without selling their property. The article concludes that the best approach often involves a blended strategy tailored to an individual's specific assets, needs, and goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients achieve nearly 12% body weight loss in a late-stage trial, paving the way for regulatory submission. However, the company's shares dropped around 13% as the results fell slightly below some Wall Street expectations of 15% weight loss. While doctors praised the results as a significant advancement for an oral treatment, some noted that discontinuation rates due to side effects were higher than for existing injectable drugs. Despite the market reaction, the pill represents a major step toward a more convenient, needle-free alternative in the booming weight-loss drug market. (not investment advice)</p>

Oil prices closed lower, suggesting traders believe the threat is a negotiating tactic rather than a policy that will be fully implemented. Analysts note that a 25% tariff recently imposed on India, Russia's largest oil customer, was much lower than the threatened 100% and has a 21-day grace period. The market seems to believe that the administration will ultimately back down to avoid a significant spike in global energy prices, which would be counterproductive to its goals.

He acknowledged potential issues with Australia's batting lineup but noted that England has not won a Test series in Australia since 2010-11. McGrath identified the battle between England's aggressive top-order batsmen, like Joe Root and Harry Brook, and Australia's bowlers as the key matchup that will likely decide the series.</p>
