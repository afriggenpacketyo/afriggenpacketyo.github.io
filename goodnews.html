          <h2>Dodgers Pitcher Clayton Kershaw Hailed as the Franchise's Greatest</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article argues that Clayton Kershaw has solidified his status as the greatest pitcher in Dodgers history, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The author contends that while Koufax had an unparalleled five-year peak, Kershaw's 18 seasons of sustained excellence and longevity give him the definitive edge. The piece acknowledges Kershaw's postseason struggles but counters that his much larger sample size of playoff appearances makes direct comparisons difficult. Ultimately, it posits that Kershaw's enduring presence and statistical dominance make him the franchise's most impactful pitcher.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has rescinded its export restrictions on chip-design software for China, as confirmed by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. This move reverses a ban implemented in May that required companies to obtain licenses before exporting such technology to China. The decision, which also affects Siemens EDA, comes amid signs of a broader trade truce between the two nations and caused a significant rise in the stock prices for the affected companies.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw achieved a historic milestone, becoming just the 20th pitcher in Major League Baseball history to record 3,000 career strikeouts. The moment occurred in the sixth inning against the Chicago White Sox, when Kershaw struck out Vinny Capra on his 100th pitch of the game. He is only the fourth left-handed pitcher to reach this elite benchmark and the second in the last century to do so with a single team. The achievement was celebrated with a standing ovation and a video tribute at Dodger Stadium.</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively working to deepen its relationship with China as it diversifies its foreign policy beyond its traditional reliance on Russia. During a visit to Beijing, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan stated that both nations are ready to elevate their ties to a strategic partnership. This diplomatic pivot follows Armenia's disappointment with Russia's inaction during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and its subsequent military conflicts with Azerbaijan. The move signals Armenia's intent to forge new alliances and reduce its dependence on the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation.</p>

          <p>China has developed a record-setting hydropower turbine with a 500-megawatt capacity, the largest single-unit capacity in the world. The massive, 80-tonne turbine was built by Harbin Electric Machinery Company and is destined for the Datang Zala Hydropower Station on a tributary of the Nu River in Tibet. Constructed from durable martensitic steel, the turbine is described as the "heart" of the new power unit. Two of these advanced turbines will be installed at the station, marking a significant engineering achievement for the country's renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has surged dramatically in the first half of 2025, with new listing volumes reaching $14 billion, a massive increase from the previous year. This boom is fueled by a state-backed push for mainland Chinese companies to list in the city, ample market liquidity, and concerns over potential U.S. delistings. The renewed interest has positioned Hong Kong to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year, a stark turnaround from several years of lackluster activity.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deny people who cross the southern border the ability to apply for asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss found that President Trump's executive order, which characterized the border situation as an "invasion," exceeded his legal authority. The judge stated that neither the Constitution nor federal law allows the president to unilaterally create an alternative immigration system that supplants statutes enacted by Congress. The ruling has been hailed by immigrant rights groups as a critical affirmation of existing asylum law.</p>
