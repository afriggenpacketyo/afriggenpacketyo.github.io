          <p>Nintendo has reported record-breaking sales of its new Switch 2 console, with over 3.5 million units sold in the first four days after its launch. This performance puts the company on track to meet its fiscal year sales target of 15 million units by March 2026. The Switch 2 has garnered significant enthusiasm from fans globally, resulting in long lines at midnight release events. Despite the positive sales figures, Nintendo's shares experienced a slight dip, but have otherwise seen substantial growth since the original Switch debuted in 2017. </p>

          <p>Two adaptations of Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion explore themes of violence against LGBTQ+ individuals and the impact of war and displacement in the Middle East. Thomas H√∂ft's "QueerPassion" incorporates stories of queer individuals facing discrimination, while Vladimir Ivanoff's "Arabian Passion" integrates Middle Eastern instruments and Arabic vocals, reflecting on the suffering in the Middle East. Both versions transform Bach's original work to address contemporary issues and bridge cultural divides, with the "Arabian Passion" even performing in Hezbollah-held areas. These adaptations are part of the Bachfest in Leipzig, which focuses on transformation.</p>
