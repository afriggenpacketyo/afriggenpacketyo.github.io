          <p>During a meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have pledged to deepen trust and cooperation. Xi stated that the two nations should be partners, not rivals, while Modi noted a new "atmosphere of peace and stability" between them. This meeting marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years, occurring amid ongoing border disputes and trade tensions with the United States affecting both countries. As a sign of improving relations, Modi announced that direct flights between India and China, which were suspended in 2020 after deadly border clashes, would resume.</p>

          <p>An Indian automotive lobby group, representing major carmakers like Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors, has addressed public concern over the nationwide rollout of E20 fuel, a blend containing 20% ethanol. The group confirmed that using E20 fuel lowers a vehicle's mileage by 2-4% but insisted it poses no safety risk, even for older vehicles not originally designed for it. This announcement aims to quell a recent public outcry from motorists who have complained about performance issues and the lack of choice at fuel stations, where E20 has become the only available option. Automakers stated that no engine failures have been reported and that warranties will be honored.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha has created a significant supply shortage, causing prices for the powdered green tea to skyrocket even in its home country of Japan. The boom is attributed to matcha's growing reputation as a superfood, its popularity on social media platforms like TikTok, and a post-pandemic tourism influx. Japanese green tea exports have quadrupled over the last decade, with much of it being matcha bound for the U.S. The intense demand is straining Japan's aging farming communities and production capabilities, leading retailers to ration supplies and major companies like Ito En to create dedicated divisions to manage the crisis.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made female billionaire at age 30, attributes her drive to a frugal upbringing that motivated her to start making money as a child. Before co-founding the $25 billion AI company Scale AI, Guo's entrepreneurial journey began on the elementary school playground, where she would trade and sell Pokémon cards and colored pencils. Her hustles evolved online, where she sold virtual items for the game Neopets and later developed and sold bots for other games. Guo, who dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, is now the founder of the creator monetization platform Passes.</p>

          <h2>First Week of School Term Deemed Critical for Preventing Long-Term Student Absence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 03:24:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government data from England reveals a strong correlation between missing school in the first week of the academic year and long-term attendance problems. According to the figures, 57% of students who were absent at any point during the first week of the 2024 term went on to become "persistently absent," meaning they missed at least 10% of school days. In contrast, only 14% of pupils with full attendance in the first week became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one, as overall absence rates remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>Chelsea and England defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the best she has ever made for her well-being. The 32-year-old, who captained the Lionesses to the World Cup final, realized she needed a break after a demanding season where she felt on the verge of a mental and physical breakdown. Bright stated that for the first time, she prioritized her own health over pleasing others, a choice she is proud of. After undergoing knee surgery and starting counseling over the summer, she feels mentally and physically rejuvenated ahead of the new season.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 10-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), made as the country opened its borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly changed German society and politics, with its legacy remaining a topic of national debate. While there have been integration successes, with nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave employed by 2022, significant challenges persist. The unemployment rate for migrants remains high, and the current Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has distanced himself from Merkel's approach, emphasizing the need for controlled immigration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative, non-lethal approach to wildlife management, biologists are using drones to protect cattle from gray wolves near the California-Oregon border. The drones are equipped with thermal imaging cameras for night monitoring and loudspeakers that blast sounds like the AC/DC song "Thunderstruck," movie dialogue, and live human voices to scare the predators away from livestock. This experimental technique, developed by the USDA, aims to reduce human-wolf conflicts as wolf populations recover in the western U.S. While the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, initial results have shown success in interrupting wolf hunts and providing a new tool for coexistence.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old British Formula 1 fan, Brandon Burgess, is undertaking an ambitious challenge to attend every one of the 24 grands prix in the current season on a budget of just £20,000. To make the feat even more challenging, he is only using his 28 days of annual leave from his full-time job. Burgess is documenting his journey across five continents, staying in budget accommodations like capsule hostels and strategically planning his travel to minimize costs. Having completed the European leg of the season, he is currently on track with his budget but faces the most expensive part of the calendar with upcoming flyaway races in Singapore, Las Vegas, and Abu Dhabi.</p>

          <p>The recent imposition of 50% tariffs by the United States on Indian goods is creating a new economic dynamic that may push India and China toward a stronger relationship. With both nations facing economic pressure from Washington, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the SCO summit is seen as a potential turning point. Experts suggest that despite their deep-seated rivalry and border disputes, the two Asian economic powerhouses may seek to enhance cooperation to counter their dependence on the U.S. and reshape global trade flows. This pragmatic alignment could lead to eased trade restrictions and renewed Chinese investment in India.</p>

          <p>Crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun has declared his ambition for the Tron blockchain to handle more transaction volume than the Swift international banking system within the next five years. Sun stated that Tron, which is widely used for stablecoin transactions, is already on track to facilitate US$8 trillion in transactions this year and could eventually handle volumes 100 times larger than Swift. He highlighted Tron's ability to process transactions in seconds compared to the days it can take for Swift transfers. This reflects his confidence in the growing influence of blockchain technology in reshaping global finance and asset transfers.</p>
