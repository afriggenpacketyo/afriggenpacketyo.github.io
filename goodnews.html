          <p>A Delta flight bound for Atlanta was forced to abort its takeoff at Mexico City's Benito Juárez International Airport after another aircraft landed on the same runway. The pilots of Delta flight 590 applied the brakes as the plane reached approximately 71 miles per hour, narrowly avoiding a potential disaster with the landing Aeromexico jet. The Delta plane, carrying 144 passengers and six crew members, returned to the gate and later departed safely for Atlanta. Delta is cooperating with U.S. and Mexican authorities who are now investigating the serious runway incursion incident.</p>

          <p>Lynsi Snyder, the billionaire CEO of In-N-Out Burger, has clarified that the company's corporate headquarters will not be relocating to Tennessee, despite her personal family move to the state. Following speculation, Snyder affirmed the popular burger chain's commitment to its California roots, stating that a new office in Tennessee is for regional expansion, not a full relocation. The company plans to close its Irvine headquarters by 2029 but will base its main operations in Baldwin Park, its original home. This announcement addresses criticism that the company was abandoning the state that fostered its success.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 16:04:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an order from President Trump, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has released a vast collection of previously non-digitized federal records concerning the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The documents include FBI memos on the investigation, surveillance records, and details related to the convicted assassin, James Earl Ray. While the release aims to provide transparency, much of the content appears to confirm long-established facts, such as the FBI's extensive and controversial surveillance of Dr. King. King's family expressed mixed feelings, supporting transparency while cautioning against weaponizing the files to tarnish his legacy.</p>

While signaling he would wait for the term to expire, Trump continued his criticism, calling Powell "too late all the time."
