          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald sparked debate by stating his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," in what appeared to be a subtle critique of their American rivals. This year, all 12 American players and their captain are receiving $500,000 stipends, with $300,000 earmarked for charity, a first in the tournament's 98-year history, while European players are unpaid. Donald underscored that the Ryder Cup is about pride, national representation, and legacy. American player Collin Morikawa defended the payments, emphasizing the team's desire to win and the opportunity to support their communities, countering criticism that the stipends diminish the event's spirit.</p>

          <p>Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has publicly stated that several Labour Members of Parliament have privately urged him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the role of prime minister. While not currently an MP, Burnham did not dismiss the possibility of another leadership bid, referencing his two prior attempts for the party's top position. His remarks emerge amidst internal party tensions surrounding Sir Keir, particularly following the resignation of his deputy and the dismissal of Peter Mandelson. Burnham also criticized Downing Street for cultivating a "climate of fear" within the party and called for "wholesale change" to counter an "existential" threat to Labour, indicating his willingness to play any necessary role in revitalizing the party's direction.</p>

          <p>A senior US State Department official has reiterated India's pivotal position as a democratic counterweight to China within the Indo-Pacific region. This reaffirmation comes despite ongoing bilateral trade disputes and historical concerns involving Pakistan, which the official dismissed as fundamentally altering the Trump administration's stance. The official underscored India's critical partnership, metaphorically referring to it as the "indo" in Indo-Pacific, and affirmed the robust nature of ties with New Delhi. Discussions are progressing for a Quad leaders' summit in New Delhi this autumn, with a potential in-person meeting between President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to further enhance strategic collaboration.</p>

          <p>Parents of Mason Connor shared a remarkable story of their son, diagnosed with autism, who began speaking just three days after starting leucovorin, an off-label drug primarily used to mitigate chemotherapy side effects. Pediatric neurologist Dr. Richard Frye is actively researching leucovorin, which is theorized to bypass a folic acid transport blockage in the brain, potentially improving speech in some autistic children. While preliminary evidence from several blinded controlled studies shows positive effects on speech, larger phase 3 clinical trials are still required for formal FDA approval. The article also touches on the challenge of securing funding for research into generic drugs and the broader potential of repurposing existing medicines for new conditions.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Considers Financial Aid for JLR Supply Chain After Cyber Attack</h2>

          <p>The UK government is actively considering various financial support mechanisms for companies in Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, which are struggling significantly after a cyber attack forced JLR to halt car production. With factories suspended until next month, concerns are mounting that smaller suppliers, heavily reliant on JLR, could face bankruptcy. Among the ideas being explored are the government directly purchasing component parts to keep these firms solvent, or providing government-backed loans. A Covid-style furlough scheme, however, has been dismissed by ministers due to its high cost. The Business and Trade Select Committee will convene to gather testimonies from affected businesses.

          <p>The Chicago Bears have achieved a record-setting valuation of $8.9 billion after the NFL's finance committee approved the sale of a 2.35% minority stake to existing team owners. This marks a substantial increase from the team's $6.4 billion valuation just a year ago, elevating them to seventh among NFL teams. The stake, originating from the estate of Andrew McKenna, will be divided between the McCaskey and Ryan families, adjusting their respective ownership percentages. The article also highlights the team's ongoing plans to potentially construct a new fixed-roof domed stadium in Arlington Heights, a move that could significantly enhance non-NFL event revenue and further boost the franchise's financial outlook.

          <p>China's Global Governance Initiative seeks to rectify significant shortcomings within the existing international governance framework, as detailed in an opinion piece. The article identifies three primary deficits: the severe underrepresentation of the Global South, which necessitates boosting their voice and correcting historical injustices; the erosion of authoritativeness stemming from violations of the UN Charter and the imposition of unilateral sanctions; and an urgent demand for greater effectiveness in tackling global issues like climate change and the digital divide. China's initiative aims to address these imbalances by advocating for enhanced inclusivity, stronger adherence to international law, and accelerated progress on the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, reflecting its vision for a more equitable and efficient global order.</p>

          <p>A preliminary trial of a novel one-time gene therapy, AMT-130, has shown highly promising results, indicating a 75% reduction in the progression of Huntington's disease over three years in patients receiving a high dose. This experimental treatment, developed by University College London, operates by employing a harmless virus to deliver specific genetic instructions to the brain, effectively deactivating the toxic proteins responsible for brain cell damage. While these early findings offer significant hope, the therapy remains years away from potential FDA approval, requiring larger-scale studies to confirm its safety and efficacy. If successful, AMT-130 could revolutionize treatment by being the first to slow disease progression, rather than just managing symptoms.</p>

          <p>Building on the historic fusion "ignition" breakthrough achieved at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 2022, a new Bay Area startup called Inertia is working to commercialize this technology for affordable, virtually limitless clean energy. The lab's success involved firing 192 powerful lasers at a tiny fuel capsule to create a 3-million-degree implosion. Inertia, co-founded by a lab researcher, aims to develop much more energetic and physically smaller lasers, establish mass production of fuel capsules, and ultimately construct a new power plant. This ambitious endeavor promises significant environmental benefits, including cleaner air and water, and potential advancements in food and water security, with a working plant potentially within a decade.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to formalize a deal, brokered by his administration, that will permit TikTok to continue its operations within the United States. This agreement is anticipated to be designated a "qualified divestiture," thereby fulfilling a bipartisan congressional mandate that required TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, to either divest or face a ban. Under the proposed terms, cloud-computing firm Oracle will assume responsibility for hosting American users' data and conducting security reviews of the app's code. Additionally, TikTok's content recommendation algorithm will be re-trained to function exclusively with U.S. user data, and a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will acquire a stake in the company.</p>
