          <p>Germany is enhancing its security and arms cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a strategic trio known as the "E3." This pivot towards European partners is driven by the ongoing war in Ukraine and uncertainty surrounding the United States' commitment to NATO under President Trump. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, mirroring a long-standing friendship pact with France. The alliance aims to bolster European defense capabilities, with the French and British nuclear deterrents potentially playing a larger role in the continent's security architecture should US support waver in the future.</p>

          <p>During a remarkable third round at The Open, golfer Rory McIlroy experienced a highly unusual incident on the 11th hole. While hitting a shot from where spectators had been standing, his swing unearthed a second, previously buried golf ball that popped into the air. McIlroy, who expressed his disbelief at the bizarre event, went on to bogey the hole, his only blemish in a round that otherwise saw him surge up the leaderboard. Despite the strange occurrence, he finished the day at 5-under par, positioning himself in contention heading into the final day of the championship at Royal Portrush.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler is poised to win his first Open Championship, holding a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final round at Royal Portrush. Scheffler shot a solid, bogey-free 67 on Saturday, bringing his total to 14 under par and placing him comfortably ahead of his closest competitor, Li Haotong of China. A victory on Sunday would mark the third leg of the career Grand Slam for Scheffler, who has a perfect record of winning major championships when leading after 54 holes. Fellow golfers, including Rory McIlroy, praised Scheffler's consistent and mistake-free play, acknowledging the significant challenge of catching him.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to securing a loan move to Barcelona, with a deal in principle having been reached between the clubs. The 27-year-old England international has been out of favor at Old Trafford since last December and was told to train separately from the first team. Despite United's willingness to offload him, Barcelona sees him as a valuable addition to strengthen their attack, especially after failing to sign other targets. The deal is structured as a loan with an option to buy, a financially advantageous arrangement for the Spanish club given their ongoing economic constraints.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Kyiv has formally proposed a new round of peace talks with Moscow, suggesting they take place next week. In his nightly address, Zelenskyy emphasized the need to increase the momentum of negotiations and do everything possible to achieve a ceasefire. This proposal comes as Ukraine continues to face intense Russian attacks, with Zelenskyy reporting that Russia launched approximately 300 drones and 30 missiles in a single overnight assault. The attacks caused at least one death in Odesa and damaged critical infrastructure in the Sumy region, underscoring the urgent need for a diplomatic resolution.</p>

          <p>According to a recent SEC filing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold an additional 75,000 company shares, valued at approximately $12.94 million. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares. The sale follows a massive surge in Nvidia's stock value, driven by high demand for its AI-powering processors, which has pushed the company's market capitalization past $4 trillion. Nvidia also recently announced it expects to resume sales of its specialized H20 chips to China after receiving positive signals from the Trump administration regarding export licenses.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated Australia 27-19 in a physically demanding first Test match, with flankers Tom Curry and Tadhg Beirne delivering standout performances. Coach Andy Farrell described their efforts as "immense," as Beirne made 23 tackles and secured three turnovers, while Curry played with relentless aggression. Curry, who also scored a try, was notably taciturn with the media afterward, seemingly responding to criticism about his recent form. Despite a drop-off in performance after Curry was substituted, the Lions' early dominance set the stage for their crucial victory ahead of the next match in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>Former major champions Henrik Stenson and Bryson DeChambeau have voiced criticism over the R&A's inconsistent enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open. Both golfers were warned by officials during the third round, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. Stenson noted the inconsistency of being warned for being a few minutes over schedule on Saturday, when the first two rounds ran nearly an hour over their allotted time. DeChambeau, who called the pace of play in the first rounds "out of control," advocated for a new system that times every player for every shot to ensure fairness and transparency.</p>

          <p>The Pennsylvania-based group Generation Life recently sent young activists to the Jersey shore to promote a message of "chastity before marriage" to their peers. The article explores the challenges of advocating for this countercultural view in an era of online dating, secularism, and shifting sexual norms. The activists attempt to connect with young people by discussing the negative impacts of social media on relationships and self-worth, framing chastity not just as abstinence but as a way to reclaim personal dignity. This approach aims to resonate with a risk-averse Gen Z, even as societal trends move further away from traditional religious values.</p>

Doctors told him the injury could have been much worse, potentially requiring surgery, if the timing of the impact had been slightly different.

The team, consisting of Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton, was upgraded from silver after the original winning U.S. team was disqualified. The disqualification followed a 2008 confession from U.S. runner Antonio Pettigrew that he had been doping. After a lengthy reallocation process, the British athletes received their long-overdue medals and a rousing welcome from the home crowd, 28 years after the race in Athens.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a largely positive week, buoyed by strong corporate earnings and moderating inflation data, though concerns over potential new tariffs created some volatility. The June consumer price index showed core inflation slightly below expectations, while the producer price index also came in lower than anticipated, suggesting inflationary pressures are manageable for now. Key companies like Goldman Sachs reported strong results, while others like Abbott Labs saw stock dips despite beating estimates due to cautious forward guidance. Overall, the market continues to anticipate potential Federal Reserve rate cuts by year-end, navigating the complex economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
