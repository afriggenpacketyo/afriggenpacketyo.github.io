        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate has climbed to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years, driven by factors such as rising rice prices. The Bank of Japan is contemplating a pause in its rate hike policy to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy. Economists anticipate a potential easing of core inflation in the coming months due to declining crude oil prices and the strengthening of the yen. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.15% to 143.80 against the U.S. dollar following the release of the inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Road construction in Lubbock, Texas, has led to the discovery of prehistoric megafauna bones dating back to the Ice Age. The Texas Department of Transportation announced the find during an environmental review for Loop 88, a proposed state highway. Among the remains identified is at least one giant ground sloth, with possibilities of mammoth or mastodon bones as well. Archaeologists are also searching for smaller artifacts and using dating techniques to determine the age of the remains, and if any proof of human settlement is found, the project will be temporarily halted.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is resuming horse-drawn funeral carriages at Arlington National Cemetery in June after suspending the practice in May 2023 due to horse deaths and injuries. The Army collaborated with equestrian expert David O'Connor to improve horse welfare and training. Changes include lighter carriages, reduced workload for the horses, and extensive training for unit personnel, with new horses replacing those that have been retired. Starting in June, two squads of 11 horses will perform two services a day, totaling about 10 funerals per week.</p>

          <p>Dr. Maher Abdallah, director of American Reproductive Centers in Palm Springs, has pledged to rebuild his clinic after a targeted bombing nearly destroyed the facility.
