          <p>Junior Alvarado, the jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory in the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days for violating Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority rules by striking the horse eight times with his riding crop, exceeding the permitted six times. This is Alvarado's second violation within 180 days, leading to a doubled fine. All jockey crop fines go towards a jockey mental health program. Sovereignty, owned by Godolphin, will not run in the Preakness Stakes but is expected to compete in the Belmont Stakes.</p>

          <p>Five fishermen, including three Peruvians and two Colombians, were rescued by an Ecuadorian tuna boat after spending 55 days adrift at sea and arrived in the Galapagos Islands. The fishermen had been missing since mid-March after reporting damage to their boat's alternator shortly after setting sail from Pucusana Bay in Peru. The Ecuadorian navy is coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries. This rescue follows a similar incident earlier this year when another Peruvian fisherman was rescued after 95 days at sea.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison after being convicted of defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth, 81, befriended the victim while preparing her taxes and then offered fraudulent investment opportunities promising high returns with no risk. The scheme, which ran from 2013 to 2019, involved Cohen-Roth using the victim's money to pay off earlier investors and fund a lavish lifestyle. The victim was left financially destitute after the Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2020.</p>

          <p>Negotiations for President Donald Trump's tax agenda are intensifying, with the House Ways and Means Committee releasing a preliminary partial text of the bill. Republican lawmakers aim to pass the package without Democratic support through a process known as 'reconciliation.' However, the narrow Republican majority in the House and competing priorities could complicate the process. Some lawmakers are pushing for a more fiscally responsible package, which could impact individual provisions. Key tax proposals under discussion could significantly affect millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay $1.375 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations that the company violated users' data privacy. The settlement resolves two lawsuits concerning three products, with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stating that Google secretly tracked users' movements, searches, and voiceprints. Google said the agreement settles old claims related to Incognito mode, location history, and biometrics, without admitting wrongdoing. The settlement does not require product changes. This settlement follows a similar agreement last year in which Meta Platforms agreed to pay $1.4 billion to Texas over facial recognition data.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, has re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space.

The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which achieved significant milestones in exploring Venus. Although the re-entry is not unusual in the context of current space activity, it represents a historical artifact from a time of great ambition in space exploration.</p>
