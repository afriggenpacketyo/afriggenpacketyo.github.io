          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating the government's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." The ruling came after an emergency lawsuit was filed to stop the expulsion of over 70 minors over Labor Day weekend. Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, found no evidence that the children's parents had requested their return, citing a Guatemalan government report that contradicted the administration's claims. The decision reaffirms legal protections for unaccompanied minors entering the U.S. without legal permission.</p>

          <p>Scientists have uncovered the first known amber deposits in South America containing prehistoric insects, offering a rare window into life on Earth 112 million years ago. Found in a sandstone quarry in Ecuador, the fossilized tree resin preserved ancient beetles, flies, and wasps from the Cretaceous period. This discovery helps fill a major gap in the fossil record, as most similar finds have been in the Northern Hemisphere. The specimens provide new insights into the co-evolution of insects and the then-emerging flowering plants during the age of dinosaurs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, along with seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, alleging they engaged in illegal ticket resale tactics that harm consumers. The lawsuit claims the companies worked with scalpers to unlawfully purchase tickets and used a "bait and switch" approach to inflate final prices, costing fans millions of dollars. The FTC accuses Ticketmaster of effectively "triple dipping" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers on both primary and secondary markets. The agency alleges these practices have injured both consumers and artists.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a move to decertify the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, a division of the University of Miami Health System, citing a history of patient safety failures. The action is part of a broader initiative by the Trump administration to reform the nation's organ transplant system and restore public trust in the donation process. This follows a federal investigation that revealed disturbing practices, including instances where the organ procurement process was initiated on patients who still showed signs of life. Kennedy stated the decision serves as a clear warning to other organizations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 12:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the philosophy of 17th-century thinker Baruch Spinoza as a tool for managing emotional responses to public criticism and online attacks. Despite facing widespread condemnation for his ideas, Spinoza advocated for using rational understanding, or metacognition, to gain power over one's emotions rather than being controlled by them. By observing feelings from a distance, one can move from a reactive state governed by the brain's limbic system to a more considered one in the prefrontal cortex. The article suggests practical steps like pausing before reacting and journaling to achieve this emotional equanimity in the face of modern-day censure.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett indicated that the White House views the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut as a "prudent call." While acknowledging that some within the administration, including new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, had pushed for a more aggressive half-point reduction, Hassett described the decision as a good first step. He characterized the Fed's slow and steady approach as appropriate given the complex economic data, which shows strong growth alongside inflation that is higher than the central bank's target. This signals a degree of alignment between the administration and the Fed. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump's entourage occupied nearly two dozen seats, including his daughter Tiffany and son-in-law Michael Boulos.

According to his agent, Rich Kleiman, they have been unable to track down the password for several years, a situation he joked has "only benefited" them as the cryptocurrency's value has soared. Durant started investing in bitcoin when it was trading for under $1,000; it is now valued at nearly $116,000.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate down to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. For a homeowner with a $500,000 mortgage, this new rate results in a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $3,040. This represents a savings of about $300 per month compared to the 7.04% rates seen at the beginning of the year. The lower borrowing costs provide significant relief for new homebuyers and create opportunities for existing homeowners to save money through refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of St. Andrews have located the brain's internal "mileage clock" by studying the brain activity of running rats. They discovered that specific cells in a region associated with navigation and memory fire in a regular pattern, ticking with every few steps the animal takes, effectively measuring distance traveled. When the environment was altered, this firing pattern became erratic, and the rats' ability to estimate distance was impaired. A follow-up experiment with human volunteers suggested that the human brain utilizes the same mechanism for spatial navigation and distance estimation.</p>

          <p>José Mourinho's appointment as manager of Benfica, 25 years after his brief first stint, is being met with both excitement and apprehension in Portugal. While revered for his past successes, his recent career has been marked by a more conflict-driven style, and his last league title was a decade ago. The timing of the appointment is also politically charged, as it comes just before the club's presidential elections, leading some to view it as a risky maneuver by the incumbent president, Rui Costa. The article suggests that failure to win the league title with Benfica's current squad would be considered a significant failure for the veteran coach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has decreased. With average rates now around 8.05%, the monthly payment on a new $100,000 HELOC with a 15-year term would be approximately $959. This is a noticeable decrease from last September when rates were closer to 9%. Because HELOCs have variable rates, these costs can change over time, but the current environment provides a less expensive opportunity for homeowners to tap into their record-high levels of home equity.
