The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to protect freedom of speech and academic freedom, with potential sanctions for failing to do so.

          <p>A California appeals court upheld a $1 million jury verdict against the El Segundo Unified School District for failing to protect a middle school student from bullying. Eleri Irons sued the district in 2019, alleging that she was "bullied, tormented and verbally assaulted" by other students and that school officials did not adequately respond to her complaints. The court rejected the district's arguments that it was immune to liability and that it had no duty to protect Irons. The case highlights the importance of schools following proper bullying procedures and guidelines.</p>
