          <p>The remains of two Scottish soldiers who went missing during the Battle of Loos in World War One have been identified over 100 years later. Construction workers in northern France discovered the bodies in 2021, initiating a painstaking investigation by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the UK's Ministry of Defence. Using regimental artifacts, census records, and DNA testing with living relatives, the 'war detectives' successfully identified Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan, bringing long-awaited closure to their families. The soldiers were recently laid to rest with full military honors near where they fell.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and landslides in western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their critical role in the aftermath. With roads washed out and communications down, pilots from commercial companies and private networks were among the first to witness the scale of the destruction. They conducted hundreds of missions, rescuing stranded residents from isolated areas and air-dropping essential supplies like medicine and food. Their efforts, coordinated with groups like the United Cajun Navy, were vital in the initial days before larger-scale relief operations could access the region.</p>

          <p>To attract more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, China is continuing to relax its entry requirements by expanding visa-free travel options. Travelers from an increasing number of countries can now enter and stay in mainland China for specified periods without obtaining a visa beforehand. These policies include transit allowances of up to 10 days for passport holders from 55 nations and 30-day visa-free stays for citizens of other select countries. The measures are designed to lower the barriers to entry, which have often involved extensive paperwork and significant fees.</p>

          <h2>England vs. Canada Rugby Final Highlights Stark Financial Divide in Women's Sport</h2>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada showcases a significant disparity in resources, highlighting a key debate in the future of the sport. England's team is fully professional and backed by millions in funding from the Rugby Football Union, with players on full-time contracts. In contrast, the Canadian team operates on a fraction of that budget and relied on a public fundraising campaign to cover its World Cup preparations. A victory for Canada could be seen by some unions as proof that success is possible without major investment, potentially slowing the push for professionalism elsewhere.</p>

          <h2>From Plumber to Pro: England's Rugby Stars Reflect on Their Journeys</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 01:00:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the Women's Rugby World Cup final, several of England's top players are reflecting on their careers before the sport became fully professional six years ago. Veteran Marlie Packer, a member of the 2014 World Cup-winning squad, had to return to her job as a plumber just a week after the victory. Other players balanced their training with demanding day jobs as teachers, painters, and even an RAF police officer. Their stories illustrate the dramatic transformation of women's rugby in England, where today's stars can focus entirely on their athletic careers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is actively promoting an "ambitious" youth migration deal with the European Union ahead of the upcoming autumn Budget. She argues that a visa exchange scheme for workers aged 18 to 30 would be beneficial for economic growth and businesses. Reeves is also urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to include the potential positive economic impact of such a scheme in its official forecasts. This move is seen as an attempt to improve the public finance outlook and potentially lessen the need for significant spending cuts or tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yuan Yuan, an internationally recognized mathematician specializing in complex geometry, has returned to China to accept a full-time professorship at Westlake University in Hangzhou. His move comes after spending over two decades in the United States, most recently as a full professor at Syracuse University. Yuan stated that he had long hoped to return and was impressed by the vibrant academic environment at Westlake, a newer research-oriented university. His return is part of a broader trend of accomplished Chinese scholars leaving Western institutions to contribute to China's growing scientific and academic landscape.</p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell has revealed her vision for the highly anticipated new film adaptation of Emily Brontë's classic novel, "Wuthering Heights." Speaking about the project, Fennell stated she wants to capture the "primal" and "sexual" emotional response she had when she first read the book as a teenager. The film, which stars Margot Robbie as Catherine and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff, has already generated buzz with an erotically charged trailer. Fennell aims to create a version that feels singular, devastating, and true to the complicated and turbulent spirit of the original text.</p>
