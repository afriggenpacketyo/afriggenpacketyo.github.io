          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June in its 117-year history, processing a record number of shipping containers as importers raced to get goods into the U.S. ahead of President Trump's tariff deadlines, particularly on Chinese products. Port officials described this as a tariff "whipsaw effect," reflecting shifting timelines and uncertainty rather than a sustainable surge in demand. While traffic was up 8% over last year, executives and retailers anticipate a significant drop in cargo volume from August onward as new, higher tariffs make importing more costly.

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning a Martian meteorite, designated NWA 16788, which is the largest known piece of Mars on Earth and could sell for as much as $4 million. The 54-pound rock was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, constituting only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on our planet. The auction house noted that the object provides a massive dataset for scientists studying the red planet.</p>

          <p>A year after historic flooding wiped out their farm and home, a South Dakota family reflects on their slow and costly recovery. Having lost their home and sold off a third of their land to stay afloat without flood insurance or government aid, they have now rebuilt on higher ground. The event highlights the growing threat of "whiplash weather" linked to climate change, where extreme rain is followed by severe drought. While this summer's weather has been more favorable, local farmers remain wary after incurring massive, uncompensated infrastructure repair costs.</p>

This assessment, combined with a broader market upswing, helped the sector recover its recent losses. (not investment advice)</p>
