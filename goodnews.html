        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transport for London (TfL) is initiating a new campaign to address the "disruptive behaviour" of passengers who play music or make calls using mobile phone loudspeakers on public transport. Research indicated that 70% of surveyed passengers found such noise a nuisance, with some experiencing stress, particularly those with heightened sensitivities like autism. Posters will be displayed on the Elizabeth line and other services, reminding passengers to use headphones or hands-free kits with their devices. TfL has the authority to enforce existing by-laws, which could lead to individuals being asked to leave services or face prosecution if they refuse to comply with the requests.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, met its primary goals in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, significantly advancing its path towards global regulatory approval. This oral GLP-1 treatment demonstrated an average weight loss of 10.5% and effectively improved blood sugar levels over 72 weeks, offering a more convenient, needle-free alternative to current injectable medications. While primarily mild to moderate gastrointestinal side effects were noted, the drug's easier manufacturing and lack of dietary restrictions could substantially expand access to much-needed obesity and diabetes treatments. Eli Lilly anticipates a global launch around next year, potentially transforming the lucrative market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Katrina in 2005 highlighted the tragic consequences of not including pets in disaster evacuation plans, as tens of thousands of animals were left behind and many people refused to evacuate without their companions. This led to the landmark 2006 Pet Evacuation & Transportation Safety (PETS) Act, incentivizing states and agencies to incorporate pets into their disaster planning. Emergency responders learned a crucial lesson: efforts to save pets also save humans, as nearly half of those who didn't evacuate stayed due to their animals. The messaging has since shifted, urging pet owners to always take their animals with them during evacuations, though challenges in rescue efforts still persist.</p>

          <p>Ojai's oldest hotel, now named Hotel El Roblar, has reopened after six years of extensive restoration, aiming to evoke Old California and attract Angelenos seeking escape. Built in 1919, the 2-acre property features 39 guest rooms, 11 bungalows, restaurants, a pool, and event space, with rates starting at $455. The new owners, including entrepreneur Eric Goode, focused on preserving its history while infusing local character, including a mural of Ojai Valley flora and fauna and two Aldabra giant tortoises. The reopening, after suffering smoke damage in 2017, marks its return as a community-accessible establishment, despite local debates over parking and increased tourism impacts.</p>

          <p>Christian Svanes Kolding and Adriana Estrada, after years of urban living, transformed their Long Beach yard into a water-saving habitat garden, mimicking local mountains and welcoming neighbors. Inspired by ocean-friendly principles and native plants, their landscape features bioswales for rainwater capture and a low fence designed for community interaction. The couple utilized Long Beach's Lawn to Garden rebate program, which covered about a third of the $17,000 project, and the Native Plant Parkway Program for free plants. Their efforts have created a vibrant, fragrant space alive with butterflies and bees, serving as both a personal retreat and a community hub for connection and environmental stewardship.</p>

Economic issues like cost of living and housing affordability are top concerns for voters, highlighting the challenges facing the next leader. The poll also indicates that Californians, including Democrats, prefer Governor Gavin Newsom over Harris for a potential 2028 presidential bid, with a significant portion believing Harris should not run again after two unsuccessful campaigns, reflecting a shift in political sentiment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that America's severe housing shortage, with 4.7 million fewer units than families, is not solely due to restrictive zoning laws, as often emphasized by the YIMBY movement. While land-use regulations are a significant factor, the article highlights that the housing sector never fully recovered from the 2008 crash due to other persistent constraints: expensive and less available construction loans, a shortage of skilled labor, and surging material costs exacerbated by tariffs. A comprehensive solution, the article suggests, must include government financing, new loan programs, tax incentives, increased immigration for trades workers, and productivity improvements, alongside targeted land-use reform.

          <p>A Chinese woman, identified as Zhou, was dramatically rescued after being trapped for 30 hours in a guesthouse bedroom in Sichuan province due to a malfunctioning lock. Without her phone, food, or a toilet, she resorted to biting her finger and writing "110 625" (emergency number and room number) in blood on a pillow, which she then threw from the sixth-floor window. A quick-thinking food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the desperate message and immediately alerted police, who successfully kicked open the door to her temporary prison. Zhang was subsequently awarded 3,000 yuan for his crucial role in the miraculous rescue.</p>
