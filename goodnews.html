        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As people age, maintaining bone strength is crucial, and nutritionists recommend incorporating specific foods into the daily diet to support bone health. Tofu, rich in calcium and protein, is highlighted, along with prunes, which contain vitamin K and manganese, essential for bone formation. Yogurt, high in calcium, vitamin D, and protein, is also recommended, with the advice to opt for regular yogurt over Greek yogurt for more calcium. Fatty fishes like salmon and sardines offer vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, and leafy greens such as kale and beans and seeds provide magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium, all vital for bone remodeling.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has successfully implemented a public, universal pre-kindergarten program, providing free child care and early education to all 4-year-olds, regardless of income. The program's success is attributed to motivated individuals who carefully navigated the challenges of funding, curriculum development, and integrating with private child care providers. One key figure, Joe Eddins, closed a loophole in state law and created an official 4-year-old program, and also allowed public elementary schools to hire existing qualified providers to teach the voluntary pre-K program, easing the concerns of private facilities. Other states can learn from Oklahoma's focus on the "how" rather than the "why," emphasizing the importance of keeping the child care industry afloat while developing an appropriate curriculum and building enough facilities.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a reversal of the winter fuel payment policy, widening eligibility for the allowance to more people this year. The previous policy, which restricted the payment to those on pension credit, was widely criticized for excluding many vulnerable pensioners. While the exact details of the changes are unclear, the government aims to address concerns about those whose income is slightly too high to qualify. The pensions minister stated that the payment would not return to its previous universal distribution to all pensioners.</p>

          <p>A seemingly chance observation during the preparation of a planetarium show has led to a new revelation about the shape of the Oort Cloud, a distant region filled with icy relics. Scientists noticed a spiral pattern in the inner section of the Oort Cloud, suggesting it may be shaped like a bar with two waving arms, similar to the Milky Way. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, and it highlights the potential for unexpected findings when striving for scientific accuracy in visualizations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Stanford University have identified a process in the brain that explains how experiences lead to emotions. The process involves a signal that lingers in the brain after a positive or negative experience, creating a broader emotional state. The study suggests that this sustained signal is crucial for emotions to generalize and interact with other experiences. This discovery could potentially help explain emotional differences seen in some neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>

The proposed regulations aim to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, a key component of smog, by setting zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers. While the rules would not ban gas-powered appliances outright, they would impose surcharges on manufacturers for those units. The plan has drawn support from environmental groups but faces opposition from gas-appliance manufacturers and others concerned about costs and grid reliability.</p>
