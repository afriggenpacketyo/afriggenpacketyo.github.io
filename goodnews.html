          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 06:00:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Diego-based defense technology company Shield AI has introduced a new AI-piloted fighter jet, the X-BAT, designed to counter China's strategy of targeting US airfields. The aircraft features vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability, allowing it to operate without traditional runways from various locations like ships or small islands. Its "Hivemind" autonomy system enables it to fly and execute missions without GPS or constant communication, reacting to threats in real-time. Shield AI aims for the jet to be combat-ready by 2029, offering advanced performance at a lower cost than manned fighters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs strategist, major Chinese companies are strategically shifting their export focus away from the United States and towards less-developed markets like Southeast Asia. This pivot allows them to leverage cost advantages while moving up the value-added chain to produce more sophisticated, higher-margin goods. Since 2018, Chinese exports to non-US markets have seen a compound annual growth rate of 7.5%, while exports to the US have slightly declined. This diversification strategy helps Chinese firms navigate trade tensions and continue growing their overseas revenue streams. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>October marks a peak period for tarantula mating season in California, prompting male spiders to leave their burrows in a high-stakes search for females. The annual event, often triggered by the first autumn rains, presents a unique opportunity for wildlife enthusiasts to spot the large arachnids. However, the journey is fraught with danger for the males, who risk being eaten by potential mates, both before and after mating. Experts note that while tarantulas possess venom, it is not harmful to humans, and their primary defense is flicking irritating hairs from their abdomens.</p>

          <p>In a significant shift in its gaming strategy, Microsoft has announced that its flagship "Halo" series will be available on Sony's PlayStation 5 for the first time. A remake of the original game, titled "Halo: Campaign Evolved," is set to launch next year on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles, as well as PC and mobile via cloud streaming. This move reflects Microsoft's broader strategy of making its games accessible on more platforms, rather than relying solely on console exclusivity to drive hardware sales. The decision has been met with mixed reactions, though many see it as a positive step for gamers overall.</p>

          <p>Australian cricket captain Pat Cummins is recovering from a back injury, with teammate Nathan Lyon suggesting a return for the second Ashes Test against England is a "realistic" goal. Lyon believes the series opener in Perth on November 21 will likely come too soon for the fast bowler. Cummins, who has a history of back problems, was ruled out of recent limited-overs series, but Australia's selectors remain hopeful he will play a major role in the five-match contest. According to Lyon, Cummins is training diligently to give himself the best possible chance of returning to the team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact check by DW has determined that viral social media claims about Germany canceling hundreds of Christmas markets for 2025 are false. While a few small, local markets have been canceled for reasons like low revenue or renovations, major markets in cities like Berlin, Cologne, and Dresden are scheduled to proceed as planned. The false claims appear to originate from a single, questionable article that cited unaffordable security costs and misrepresented information about specific towns. In reality, while security costs have risen since past attacks, there is no evidence of widespread cancellations across the country.</p>

At the time, voice AI was an overlooked market, but Reina was impressed by Staniszewski's technical expertise and deep understanding of the industry's core problems. Reina specializes in pre-seed investing, focusing on founders with strong technical vision rather than finished products.
