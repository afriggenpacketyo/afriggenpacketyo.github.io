        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's export growth has slowed for the second consecutive month due to the impact of U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump. According to government data, exports to the U.S. fell for the first time since December of the previous year, with a decrease of 1.8% year-over-year. This decline is primarily attributed to a 25% levy on Japan's auto, steel, and aluminum exports to the U.S., with transport equipment exports also seeing a significant drop. Economists anticipate that net exports will continue to negatively impact Japan's GDP growth in the second quarter, potentially delaying the central bank's interest rate hike.

          <p>Philadelphia District Attorney Lawrence Krasner, backed by George Soros, successfully defended his position against a primary challenge from Judge Pat Dugan in a Democrat-heavy area. However, Dugan may still have a chance for a rematch in November if he garnered sufficient Republican write-in votes. The Republican Party strategically funded a website encouraging voters to write-in Dugan, aiming to oust Krasner due to his progressive criminal justice policies. Krasner has faced criticism for policies such as ceasing charges for marijuana possession and eliminating cash bail for some offenders, leading to Republican-led impeachment proceedings in the past.</p>

          <p>Corey O'Connor won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, signaling a potential shift away from the city's current progressive leadership under Ed Gainey. O'Connor, the Allegheny County controller, will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election. Gainey's defeat mirrors similar outcomes in other deep-blue cities, raising questions about the power of progressive officeholders. O'Connor campaigned on a platform of pragmatism, promising to improve city services and rebuild the tax base, contrasting with Gainey's focus on affordable housing, which saw incremental gains amid administrative missteps.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to "pause" its scheme to pay out large bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its ¬£3bn rescue loan. The company had been accused of "trying to circumvent" forthcoming rules to ban water companies from paying bonuses. The decision comes after Downing Street said bosses at the troubled firm "rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable". Ministers were clear that, after presiding over years of mismanagement, Thames Water should not be handing itself bonuses. The company will wait for the regulator's steer to ensure the company's "approach supports both our turnaround objectives and broader public expectations".</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented temporary flight restrictions at Newark Liberty International Airport following severe flight delays and cancellations. The airport has experienced technology outages, staff shortages, and ongoing runway construction.

United Airlines, which operates the majority of flights at Newark, supports the restrictions.

          <p>A new test has been developed that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumors from weeks to just hours, researchers say. The method has been developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with clinicians at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH). The "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing is a "game changer" and could improve care and treatment for thousands of patients. There are currently more than 100 identified types of brain tumour, and clinicians need to identify which kind a patient has to determine the most effective way to treat them.</p>
