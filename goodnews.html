          <p>OpenAI is launching a specialized ChatGPT version designed for users under 18, featuring robust parental controls and advanced content filtering to block graphic or sexually explicit material. This proactive step addresses increasing scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission regarding AI chatbots' potential negative impacts on children and teenagers, particularly following a lawsuit that linked the chatbot to a teen's death by suicide. The new system will automatically direct identified minors to an age-appropriate experience, ensuring enhanced safety protections, and can even involve law enforcement in rare cases of acute distress. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized the critical importance of prioritizing safety for minors with this powerful and evolving technology, highlighting the company's transparency in these difficult decisions.</p>

          <p>King Charles and other senior royals gathered at Westminster Cathedral for the solemn funeral of Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, who passed away at 92 earlier this month. Queen Camilla, unfortunately, was unable to attend due to acute sinusitis, sending her deep regrets but confirming her intention to host President Trump later in the week. This event marked a historic occasion as the first Catholic funeral for a member of the Royal Family in modern times, with a message from Pope Leo praising the duchess's dedication to official duties and charitable work. The service profoundly remembered her kindness, deep love of music, and quiet devotion to public service, including her hands-on volunteer work with the homeless.</p>

          <p>A framework agreement for TikTok's future operations in the U.S. is emerging, expected to include new investors alongside its Chinese parent company ByteDance, with Oracle maintaining its crucial cloud services deal. This development aims to address long-standing U.S. lawmakers' concerns that the Chinese government could access sensitive user data or manipulate content on the popular platform. The deal, anticipated to close within 30-45 days, will not involve the company going public and is reportedly structured with relatively small capitalization checks. This comes after President Trump extended the divestment deadline multiple times, pushing for a resolution to the app's uncertain future.</p>

          <h2>Webtoon Shares Soar Following Deal with Disney for Marvel and Star Wars Digital Comics Platform</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 11:08:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Webtoon Entertainment's shares surged over 25% following the announcement of a significant deal with Disney to create a digital comic platform for Marvel and Star Wars brands. The agreement, which also includes Disney acquiring a 2% equity stake in Webtoon, will consolidate over 35,000 Disney-related comics onto a single subscription service for the first time. Deutsche Bank analysts describe this as a "material expansion," potentially diversifying Webtoon's revenue and attracting other intellectual property owners seeking similar distribution. The deal further validates Webtoon's platform as a premier destination for major IP, despite some skepticism about its immediate impact on near-term earnings.</p>

While models like the BMW i4, Chevrolet Blazer EV, Tesla Cybertruck, and Volkswagen ID.Buzz earned "good" ratings for front-seat protection in head-on crashes, others showed significant deficiencies. The Nissan Ariya SUV received a "marginal" rating due to a high chest injury risk for rear-seat passengers, and the Ford F-150 Lightning scored "poor" for similar reasons.
