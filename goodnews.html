          <p>Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, are bracing for the impact of additional U.S. tariffs on cars and auto parts, which took effect on April 3. These tariffs are expected to significantly reduce profits, with Toyota projecting a 35% drop and Honda a 70% plunge in net profit. The companies are considering strategies such as increasing local production in the U.S., focusing on popular fuel-efficient models, and potentially raising prices, though the latter carries the risk of losing customers. Toyota is hesitant to make any hasty moves, while Honda plans to move some production to the U.S. from Japan and Canada. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three Iranian men, Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, have been charged under the UK's National Security Act on suspicion of conduct likely to assist Iran. The charges relate to a period between August 14, 2024, and February 16, 2025, and all three men have been remanded in custody. The government confirmed that the trio arrived in the UK by "irregular means" between 2016 and 2022, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that Iran must be held accountable for its actions and that the UK will strengthen its national security powers.</p>
