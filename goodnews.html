          <p>Hideki Matsui, former Yomiuri Giant and New York Yankee, visited Shigeo Nagashima's home to offer condolences after the baseball icon's death. Matsui credited Nagashima, known as "Mr. Giants," for shaping his career, recalling how Nagashima secured his draft and taught him valuable lessons. Matsui, who flew from the United States, spent over two hours at Nagashima's home, reminiscing about shared memories and Nagashima's influential presence. Nagashima, a charismatic figure, led Yomiuri to nine consecutive titles and mentored Matsui, who later achieved success in MLB, and both were honored with the People's Honor Award in 2013.</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old girl from Mexico, identified as Sofia, who requires specialized medical treatment, has been granted humanitarian parole to remain in the United States for one year. Sofia suffers from short bowel syndrome and needs IV treatments that are only available in the U.S., according to her lawyers. The Department of Homeland Security had initially sent notices to terminate her parole, causing concern about her access to care.

          <p>China is intensifying its efforts to attract talented scientists, benefiting from recent U.S. policies that have created uncertainty for international students and researchers. Even before the U.S. imposed restrictions on visas and universities, China's substantial investments in science were yielding positive results. These efforts are now further amplified by U.S. policies, which have inadvertently encouraged more scientists to consider opportunities in China.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has successfully entered a fuel-efficient 3:1 resonant orbit, synchronizing with the Earth and moon's motion, which the country claims is a pioneering achievement. This orbit is seen as a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure, including navigation systems for interplanetary exploration. However, US and Canadian experts have challenged this claim, pointing to NASA's IBEX probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011. The debate centers on whether Tiandu-1's achievement truly marks a first in this specific orbital maneuver.</p>
