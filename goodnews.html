          <p>A grassroots campaign known as "Adopt a Corner" has emerged in Southern California, with local residents organizing to monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities. Volunteers gather daily at locations like Home Depot parking lots to provide information to day laborers and document the actions of federal agents. The movement reflects growing disapproval of the administration's deportation policies and aims to protect vulnerable community members. The effort highlights a shift from large-scale protests to smaller, localized actions focused on community defense and accountability.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit van, a vehicle that became a cultural icon in Britain and beyond, is celebrating its 60th anniversary. First produced in 1965, the Transit was revolutionary for its practicality and performance, becoming the vehicle of choice for tradespeople, rock bands, and even bank robbers. Although UK production ceased in 2013, with manufacturing moved to Turkey, the brand remains the world's best-selling van. As Ford focuses on electric and software-defined vehicles, the Transit brand faces an evolving market with increased competition and shifting brand loyalties.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and was part of the first crew to orbit the Moon on Apollo 8, has died at the age of 97. Lovell became a symbol of courage and composure after an oxygen tank explosion crippled his spacecraft en route to the Moon in 1970, leading to a dramatic but safe return to Earth. His calm handling of the crisis, famously summarized by the line "Houston, we've had a problem," became legendary. Lovell's life and career, immortalized in the film "Apollo 13," inspired generations and demonstrated remarkable grace under pressure.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission have successfully undocked from the International Space Station, beginning their journey back to Earth after a 148-day mission. The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, carrying commander Anne McClain and her crewmates, is scheduled for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California. This marks the first NASA-sponsored crew to land in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure any debris from the spacecraft's trunk section lands away from populated areas. Their departure follows the recent arrival of their replacements on the Crew-11 mission.</p>

          <p>Despite their starkly different political ideologies, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy have formed a notable friendship, highlighting the personal dynamics shaping the U.S.-UK special relationship. Vance, a conservative Republican, recently stayed at Lammy's official country residence, with both men emphasizing their bond over shared experiences, family, and faith. This personal connection is seen as potentially crucial in navigating diplomatic issues, especially given the personalized nature of politics under the Trump administration and past critical comments from both men about Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Director Antonio Negret's new horror film, "Shaman," delves into ancestral terror, drawing from his multicultural upbringing in Latin America. The movie, a U.S.-Ecuador co-production, follows two Anglo missionaries in a remote Ecuadorian region whose son appears to suffer a demonic possession, forcing them to confront local spiritual beliefs. Negret filmed in the Chimborazo region, collaborating with the local Indigenous community to ensure authenticity in depicting their rituals and the Kichwa language. The film aims to present a possession story through the unique lens of Andean shamanism and its mythology.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The investigation notes that Epstein's island, Little St. James, did not have an airstrip, making it impossible for a plane of that size to land there; visitors typically arrived by helicopter or boat. The Facebook user who originated the claim used a profile picture with a pilot costume pin available for purchase on Amazon. There remains no credible evidence that Trump ever visited the island.</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul has opened a series of "warm-hearted convenience stores" as an innovative approach to fighting social isolation among its residents. These centers offer a welcoming, cafe-like atmosphere where visitors can get free food, such as ramen, and connect with social workers and other people. The initiative was prompted by a rise in "lonely deaths" and a growing awareness of social isolation, particularly among young people and the elderly in the city's dense, single-person households. The program aims to provide a low-stigma space for human connection and support.</p>

The decision comes after Nvidia tailored the H20 chip specifically to comply with U.S. export regulations aimed at limiting China's technological advancement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as possible "illegal migrants" in a social media post. He had alerted authorities and demanded mass deportations before the crew was confirmed to be a team raising money for motor neurone disease research. After learning the truth, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowing crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, said they found the incident and the subsequent beachside scrutiny from locals to be hilarious.</p>
