          <h2>Agatha Christie's Avatar 'Teaches' Writing in New Online Course, Sparking Ethical Debate</h2>

          <p>An avatar of Agatha Christie, created using AI, is teaching an online writing course with BBC Maestro, raising ethical questions about resurrecting the dead with technology. The course uses Christie's own words and archival interviews, with her family's approval, but some ethicists argue that it's still a deepfake because Christie herself did not consent. The creators maintain they are not trying to deceive anyone, but rather offer fans a new way to engage with her work. The use of AI in this context sparks a debate about the boundaries between fact, fiction, and the future of entertainment and education.</p>

          <p>Vice-Premier He Lifeng has expressed confidence in China's economy ahead of crucial trade talks with US officials.

These will be the first official trade negotiations between China and the United States since US President Donald Trump‚Äôs return to office in January, with hopes of de-escalating the trade war.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are employing powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world‚Äôs largest radio telescope and advanced radar systems, to search for water ice at the moon‚Äôs south pole. A recent study suggests that ice constitutes no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil in the region, existing as fragmented chunks buried 5-7 meters underground. These findings could assist in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and designing China's proposed research base on the moon. The use of newly built incoherent scatter radar alongside the FAST telescope represents a creative approach to investigating water abundances on the moon.</p>

          <p>Britain is reportedly poised to become the first country to sign a trade deal with the U.S. after President Trump announced stiff "reciprocal" tariffs. The New York Times reported that an announcement is expected soon, but it is uncertain whether both sides will sign a finalized deal or a framework for an agreement. Vice President JD Vance previously stated that the U.K. has a "good chance" of securing a trade deal with America, though Trump has contradicted White House officials by saying that the U.S. does not need to "sign deals" with trade partners.</p>
