Contempt, signaled by a sour tone or attitude, is a significant predictor of divorce. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication styles also contribute to frequent arguments. Strategies for moving past these conflicts include naming the effect, reassuring one another, acknowledging the invisible load, and using the "five-second rule" for time-outs.</p>
