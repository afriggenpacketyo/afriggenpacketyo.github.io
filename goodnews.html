          <p>The Brit School in Croydon, known for its famous alumni like Adele and Amy Winehouse, has received government funding to address poor building conditions, including a recent ceiling collapse that forced the closure of a classroom and changing rooms. The funding will support the replacement of the main building's roof and fire safety works across the school's five buildings, some of which date back to 1909. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson emphasized that this investment demonstrates the government's commitment to education and ensuring safe, modern facilities for students. Work is expected to commence during the summer holidays, addressing urgent repair and maintenance needs. The allocation of funds marks a significant step towards improving the learning environment for students at the renowned arts school.</p>

          <h2>India Aims to Develop Rare Earth Reserves as Alternative to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 01:26:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is looking to tap into its rare earth reserves as a response to China's restrictions on rare earth exports, which have caused shortages affecting manufacturers in various countries. Indian officials are considering how India Rare Earths, a government-owned company, can increase rare earth magnet production. Experts suggest India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but significant public and private investment in the sector is needed. The article notes that while China has signaled plans to ease controls, it still maintains a dominant position in the production and processing of rare earth elements, giving it considerable leverage in the global market. This move by India reflects a broader trend of countries seeking to diversify their supply chains and reduce reliance on single sources for critical minerals.</p>

          <p>A new CDC report indicates that the average age of mothers giving birth in the U.S. has climbed to nearly 30 years old in 2023, reflecting a continuing trend. The average age of first-time mothers has also increased, from 26.6 in 2016 to 27.5 in 2023. Contributing factors include changes in social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also notes a decline in teen pregnancies, possibly due to delayed sexual activity or increased contraceptive use. These trends suggest a shift in societal norms and economic considerations influencing family planning.</p>
