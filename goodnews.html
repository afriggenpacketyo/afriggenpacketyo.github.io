          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults, offers five simple parenting rules for raising smart and successful children. She advises parents to trust their instincts, follow their culture's child-rearing traditions, and pay attention to their child's individual interests. Ross emphasizes the importance of focusing on enjoyment rather than solely on development and encourages parents to be their real selves, not striving for an unattainable ideal. Her approach aims to reduce parental anxiety and promote a more intuitive and joyful parenting experience. The optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, outperforming his McLaren teammate Lando Norris. Piastri's performance suggests that a recent rule change aimed at limiting front wing flexing has not significantly impacted McLaren's performance.
