          <p>A recently granted patent in China signals a significant advancement in jet engine technology with the development of a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade. This new alloy turbine blade can withstand temperatures 15% higher than existing versions, leading to greater engine thrust, better fuel efficiency, and longer service life. The Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) received the patent for this advanced manufacturing method. This innovation is expected to provide critical advantages for both military and civilian aircraft, solidifying China's leadership in high-performance propulsion technologies.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan recommends decriminalizing the possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use. The report, by the London Drugs Commission, suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act and regulating it under the Psychoactive Substances Act. Sir Sadiq Khan argues current rules "cannot be justified" and supports the report's evidence-based case for decriminalization. Critics, however, warn that reducing legal consequences could wrongly signal that cannabis is less harmful, though the report maintains that the criminal justice system should focus on dealers, not users.</p>

          <p>Puffin numbers on Skomer Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, have reached a record high of 43,626, despite a rapid decline in global puffin populations. Conservationists attribute this conservation success to the abundance of food and lack of predators on the island. Skomer Island, managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales, is an internationally important seabird island protected from human impact and predators. While puffins are thriving locally, they remain listed as vulnerable to extinction globally due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change.</p>
