          <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has cleared French Olympic fencer Ysaora Thibus of a doping allegation, accepting her defense that she was contaminated by kissing her partner. Thibus tested positive for the anabolic substance ostarine in January 2024, but the CAS panel dismissed an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency that sought a four-year ban. The court found it scientifically plausible that her partner's use of a product containing ostarine could have been transmitted through saliva over a nine-day period. This ruling allowed the silver medalist to compete in the Paris Olympics.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, interest in gold as a tangible asset for portfolio diversification has surged, with its price rising significantly. This article provides guidance on where to purchase physical gold, such as bars and coins, which offer a liquid store of wealth unlinked to corporations or governments. The primary recommended sources are licensed online retailers and local precious metal dealers, which allow for in-person inspection. Some banks also sell gold, though their selection may be more limited, and the article stresses the importance of verifying purity, weight, and authenticity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a high and interest rates topping 21%, debt management programs offered by credit counseling agencies are presented as a viable solution. These programs can help struggling borrowers by negotiating lower interest rates and fees with creditors, consolidating payments into a single, more manageable monthly bill. While the total debt principal is not reduced, participants can see their monthly payments lowered by an average of 30% to 50%. The article details how these savings are achieved and notes that while there are program fees, the long-term financial benefits often outweigh the costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores credit card debt forgiveness as a potential relief option for Americans with overwhelming balances, clarifying that there are no government-sponsored forgiveness programs. Instead, forgiveness typically involves negotiating with creditors, often through a debt settlement company, to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed. The article cautions that this path can significantly harm one's credit score and may have tax implications. It also outlines alternatives like debt consolidation loans, home equity use, and financial hardship programs offered directly by credit card companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wimbledon has updated its electronic line-calling system to prevent a recurrence of an operator error that controversially affected a match. The change removes the ability for Hawk-Eye operators to manually deactivate the ball-tracking technology. The incident occurred during a fourth-round match when the system was accidentally turned off, leading to a missed call and a replayed point that drew criticism. While the All England Club stated the umpire followed existing protocols, it confirmed that introducing a video review system, similar to those in other major tournaments, will be considered after the championships conclude.</p>

          <p>Apple experienced contrasting fortunes last month, highlighting a split in its strategic execution. The company scored a major box office victory with its blockbuster movie "F1," demonstrating the strength of its services division and long-term investment strategy in entertainment. However, its presentation of "Apple Intelligence" at its developer conference was met with a muted response from Wall Street, which is increasingly concerned about the company's slow progress in AI. With rivals like Google advancing rapidly, analysts worry that Apple's delayed and underwhelming AI features could become a significant problem within the next few years.</p>

In the deal, the Clippers will also send a 2027 second-round draft pick to the Jazz, who will receive Kyle Anderson and Kevin Love from Miami. The move provides the Clippers with needed size and youth in their frontcourt, as the 6-foot-9 Collins is a capable scorer and rebounder. Powell was one of the Clippers' top performers last season, and Collins is entering the final year of his contract.</p>

          <p>With CD rates remaining attractive but the Federal Reserve projecting future rate cuts, savers face a dilemma between short-term and long-term commitments. This article consults financial experts, who generally lean toward 1-year CDs to maintain flexibility, allowing savers to reassess their options as rates shift. However, they also caution that locking in a slightly lower rate with a 5-year CD could be advantageous if rates drop significantly. The best choice ultimately depends on an individual's financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance, with many clients opting to diversify across different term lengths. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team lost the Concacaf Gold Cup final 2-1 to Mexico, but the tournament is being viewed as a productive exercise for the program. Competing with what was effectively a "B-team" missing many established stars, the USMNT rediscovered its intensity and several players made strong cases for future inclusion on the World Cup roster. Manager Mauricio Pochettino praised the group's desire and atmosphere, a stark contrast to his assessment of previous squads. The performance of the young American squad has created new competition for roster spots ahead of the 2026 World Cup.</p>
