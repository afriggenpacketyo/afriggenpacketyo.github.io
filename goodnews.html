          <p>Two elementary schools in Allegany County, Maryland, were evacuated due to a flash flood emergency after up to 5 inches of rain fell, causing severe flooding in Westernport, Luke, and Barton. About 200 students and teachers from Westernport Elementary School were safely evacuated by motorized boats to a nearby church, while students at Georges Creek Elementary in Lonaconing were evacuated to a high school. Westmar Middle School students sheltered in place due to road closures, with no injuries reported. The Allegany County Department of Emergency Services urged drivers to avoid flooded roadways, as more than 15 million Americans across the Mid-Atlantic remained on alert for flooding and heavy rain.</p>

          <p>Mariangela Hungria, a microbiologist from Brazil, has been awarded the World Food Prize for her decades-long research on soil bacteria that act as fertilizers, enhancing crop harvests. Her work, initially met with skepticism, has been instrumental in transforming Brazil into an agricultural powerhouse. Hungria identified strains of rhizobia bacteria that fix nitrogen in soybean roots and Azospirillum bacteria that stimulate root growth in crops like corn and wheat. Her research has enabled farmers to reduce their reliance on chemical fertilizers, saving money and lessening environmental impact. Hungria plans to use the prize money to fund an award recognizing women in agriculture and microbiology.</p>

The charges stem from accusations that she helped an undocumented immigrant evade federal agents waiting to arrest him outside her courtroom. The indictment is a routine step in the Justice Department‚Äôs case, which the Trump administration defends as upholding the law, while critics denounce it as an assault on the judiciary.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is moving to ban prescription fluoride supplements for children, citing concerns about their impact on the gut microbiome. This action contradicts recommendations from the CDC, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and professional medical associations, which advocate for low-dose fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water and those at high risk of cavities. The FDA claims ingested fluoride alters the gut microbiome, even though research is inconclusive. Critics argue this removes a valuable tool for dentists in preventing tooth decay, while the FDA plans to conduct a safety review and issue alternative dental hygiene practices.</p>

Speaking in Riyadh, Trump emphasized the strong U.S.-Saudi partnership and highlighted a $142 billion arms deal between the two countries. Trump also lauded the potential for $1 trillion in investments. The visit contrasts with the muted reception former President Joe Biden received, as Trump focuses on striking financial deals to boost the American economy, arguing that commerce and economic development can help transcend violence and division in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, slightly below economists' expectations, yet still above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Housing and energy costs were major drivers of inflation, while grocery prices slightly decreased. Economists are closely watching the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, although the April data is largely unaffected due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. The tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S. may limit future inflation increases, potentially leading the Fed to cut rates twice in 2025, with the first cut expected in September.

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams criticized federal authorities for a corruption case against him, claiming they were "plotting" to embarrass him, particularly by considering seizing his electronic devices at the 2023 New York City Marathon. Adams, who faced federal bribery and fraud charges before the case was dropped, assailed the investigation and its tactics. He addressed questions about forgetting his phone password, attributing it to dyslexia. Adams also discussed his White House visit with Trump, stating he thanked Trump for calling the case unfair.</p>

          <p>Senior Indian officials dismissed President Donald Trump's claim that his administration brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. The officials stated that India had briefed key partners, including Quad members, about its military actions against "terror bases" in Pakistan. They added that India's top diplomat maintained daily contact with the Trump administration, but these interactions were for briefings rather than mediations. This comes as Beijing has long opposed the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, seeing it as an effort to counter its influence.</p>

          <h2>Trump Signs Order for Pharmaceutical Companies to Reduce Drug Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 17:51:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order giving pharmaceutical companies 30 days to voluntarily reduce prescription drug costs or face new restrictions on government payments. The order directs the Department of Health to negotiate new drug prices, and if agreements aren't reached, to develop a rule linking U.S. drug prices to lower prices paid by other countries. Trump stated the goal is to have everyone pay the same, referencing European prices. The order's impact on those with private insurance is uncertain, and the pharmaceutical industry has opposed the measure.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament has given initial backing to a bill legalizing assisted dying, passing its first vote by 70 to 56. The bill, tabled by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, still has a way to go before becoming law, with many MSPs voicing reservations and wanting changes. The debate saw personal stories shared across the chamber, with consensus around the need for better palliative care. The bill now moves to stage two, where it can be amended, with the final vote at stage three.</p>
