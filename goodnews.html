          <p>Paraguayan President Santiago Peña has declared his country's unwavering commitment to its 68-year diplomatic relationship with Taiwan. Speaking at a business forum, Peña framed the alliance as a strategic partnership based on shared democratic values, not merely economic interests. He asserted that Paraguay would defend its sovereign foreign policy and its ties with the self-ruled island "with all its strength." This statement follows a past incident where a Beijing envoy was accused of attempting to persuade Paraguayan lawmakers to switch diplomatic recognition to China.</p>

          <p>A report by American brokerage Jefferies highlights China's growing influence in the pharmaceutical industry, noting that nearly a third of presentations at a major U.S. cancer research conference involved drug candidates from Chinese companies. The report, titled "Shopping in China’s Biotech Supermarket," emphasizes that multinational corporations are increasingly looking to Chinese firms for their cost efficiency, accelerated development timelines, and high-quality innovations. This trend marks a significant shift, with Chinese companies transitioning from manufacturing to becoming key sources of novel drug development for the global market.</p>

          <p>Rumors surrounding a potential return to coaching for college football legend Nick Saban intensified during SEC Media Days. Former Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy mentioned that a well-informed source believes Saban is not finished with his coaching career. This sentiment was echoed by Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin, who stated he thinks Saban will be back on the sidelines, either in college or the NFL. Saban, who retired from Alabama after a highly successful tenure, had previously cited the changing landscape of college sports as a factor in his decision.</p>

          <p>Shares of fintech companies, including Block and PayPal, rebounded after analysts suggested that JPMorgan Chase's potential plan to charge for customer data access poses a minimal threat. The bank was reported to be considering fees for data aggregators, which caused a sell-off in the sector. However, analysts from Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley noted the impact would likely be negligible for large fintechs, possibly adding only a minor cost to account setups. The recovery was also supported by broader market momentum, including a record close for the Nasdaq. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the second year in a row, homelessness in Los Angeles County has decreased, with the estimated unhoused population dropping by 4% to 72,308 people in 2025. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass highlighted the progress, noting a 17.5% reduction in unsheltered homelessness within the city of Los Angeles since 2023. Officials attribute the decline to initiatives like encampment resolutions and increased funding for housing. Despite the positive trend, challenges remain, as the majority of the unhoused population are people of color, and recent budget cuts could impact future efforts.</p>

Despite being a long-time starter, he is prepared for a potential bench role but also sees the possibility of playing alongside center Ivica Zubac. Lopez believes his floor-spacing ability can complement Zubac's interior dominance, creating a formidable lineup.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters through a mutualization model. This initiative is part of a "fresh vision" for the service, aimed at rebuilding trust and transforming its culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of postmasters. While the government does not plan to reduce branch numbers, it is exploring long-term structural changes, including mutual or charter models. Any significant change in ownership is not expected until 2030 at the earliest.</p>

More than 40 ice cream companies have reportedly committed to the change. The announcement also hinted at forthcoming dietary guidelines that would "elevate" the status of dairy products, continuing the administration's close relationship with the dairy industry's interests.</p>
