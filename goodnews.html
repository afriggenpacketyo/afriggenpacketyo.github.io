        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, due to a slide in food prices, marking its lowest level since February 2019. Food inflation specifically hit 0.99%, significantly below April's 1.78%, with vegetable prices showing a notable decrease. The Reserve Bank of India has been relaxing monetary policy in response to these easing inflationary pressures, recently cutting its benchmark repo rate. Economists anticipate further rate cuts, projecting continued subdued inflation for the coming fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump and Congressional Republicans have overturned California's authority to set national emission standards for new vehicles, trucks, RVs, and engines. The EPA, under President Biden, had previously granted California waivers to the Clean Air Act, allowing the state to impose stringent emission regulations, including a mandate for nearly all vehicles sold in the state to be electric by 2035. This action aims to protect American jobs and ensure that the shift to electric vehicles is driven by innovation and consumer choice, not regulatory mandates. The move is seen as a win for American manufacturing and a reversal of Green New Deal overreach.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Melanie Stansbury are urging President Trump to reconsider the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) spending cuts, advocating for the implementation of their policy proposals instead. They criticize DOGE's efforts, led by Elon Musk, for failing to achieve substantial savings and causing harmful cuts to essential federal programs. Warren and Stansbury outlined recommendations to save over $2 trillion in 10 years, including cracking down on prescription drug middlemen and reforming the estate tax exemption. The letter follows a public dispute between Musk and Trump over a budget bill, despite Musk's initial involvement in the administration's efficiency efforts.</p>
