          <p>Lachlan Murdoch, 54, has been officially named as the successor to his father, Rupert Murdoch, to lead the conservative media empire encompassing Fox Corp. and News Corp. This appointment resolves a long-standing family succession rivalry, positioning Lachlan to maintain the ideological direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Observers note that while he is seen as ideologically conservative, his leadership style is considered more "hands-off" than his father's "kingmaker" approach to politics. His tenure as CEO has already navigated significant controversies, including the costly Dominion defamation lawsuit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates a direct link between rising temperatures and increased sugar consumption, primarily through sugary drinks like sodas and juices. The study, which analyzed American grocery receipts over several years, found that for every degree Celsius the temperature rises, daily sugar intake increases slightly. This behavior is more pronounced in individuals who already regularly consume such beverages. Public health experts express concern, as climate change is projected to lead to hotter weather, potentially exacerbating health issues linked to high sugar intake, such as diabetes and heart disease.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 04:52:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a plan that would allow banks to remove or set their own limits for contactless card payments, potentially ending the current £100 cap. This change would align card payments with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no transaction limit. While the move aims to reduce "payment friction" for larger purchases like a full grocery shop, it has raised concerns about fraud. The FCA states that card providers would be responsible for any fraudulent transactions and would only permit higher-value payments for low-risk situations.</p>

Several prominent MPs, including Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, Manchester MP Lucy Powell, and former shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, have announced their candidacies. Candidates have a short window to secure the necessary nominations from fellow MPs and affiliated groups before the decision is put to a vote by party members. The race highlights different wings of the party, with some candidates calling for unity and others urging a change in the government's direction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief inspector of constabulary in England and Wales, Sir Andy Cooke, has stated that police should no longer record "non-crime hate incidents." He argued that the current policy puts police in a difficult position and that a distinction must be made between offensive speech and criminal acts. This recommendation follows public debate over police actions, such as visiting individuals for social media posts that are not illegal. The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, supported the call, suggesting officers need more flexibility and discretion in handling such cases.</p>

          <p>Shares in Inditex, the parent company of Zara, surged after it reported strong early sales for its new Autumn/Winter collections, reassuring investors despite weaker-than-expected results for the previous quarter.

This positive momentum signals a "meaningful acceleration" in current trading, according to analysts. The strong performance provided a boost to European stock markets, indicating robust consumer demand for the company's latest offerings.</p>

With Russia's options limited and its share of the European market having plummeted, China can dictate more favorable terms, ensuring it will be the primary beneficiary of the new energy infrastructure deal.</p>

Initially promoted by the socialist state as a modern solution to a post-war housing crisis, these buildings later became symbols of urban decay and social problems following German reunification. The exhibition, "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," examines these structures not just as architecture but as cultural spaces that shaped collective memory and identity.
