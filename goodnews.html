          <p>Nine Palestinian students in Gaza, including Chevening scholars, have received promising emails from the UK government regarding their evacuation to pursue university studies, a potential first since the war began. Mahmoud, a 27-year-old doctor, hopes to study global health policy at the London School of Economics to help rebuild Gaza's healthcare system. While hopeful, students like Mahmoud and Mohammed face the heartbreaking prospect of leaving their families behind in a region grappling with constant displacement, famine, and insecurity. Campaigners urge the UK government to extend support to dozens of other Gazan students with scholarships, emphasizing the urgency of their situation.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France has been recognized by the Catholic Church for over 70 medical miracles in 163 years, drawing millions of pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, conducts decade-long investigations into cure claims, distinguishing medically unexplainable cases. Two new miracles were recognized since 2022, bringing the total to 72, each backed by extensive medical documentation and patient cooperation. While skeptics question historical rigor, analyses, including one by Dr. Esther Sternberg, affirm the credibility of the office's conclusions.</p>

He transitioned to acting in his 60s, quickly building a consistent career in film and television, often expressing his enjoyment for the craft.

Da Wei expressed cautious optimism about the potential for the two nations to reach a trade agreement, ideally by late autumn, believing both sides desire a deal.

          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs against the Athletics, setting a new single-season record for catchers in Major League Baseball. His achievement surpassed Salvador Perez's 2021 total and marked his ninth multi-home run game of the season, a record for switch-hitters. Raleigh, a first-time All-Star at 28, has launched 39 home runs while catching this year, placing him among elite Hall of Famers like Johnny Bench and Mike Piazza. This record-breaking performance follows his recent six-year, $105 million contract extension and All-Star Home Run Derby win.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new £200m frontline, featuring Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, is experiencing "teething problems" in scoring goals during the early Premier League season. Despite significant investment, the team's only goal in two league games was an own goal, with manager Ruben Amorim acknowledging the players are still adapting to a new style of play. While Cunha and Mbeumo have shown promise, the attack currently lacks cohesion, leading to concerns about their ability to convert chances. United's performance will be under scrutiny as they seek to improve their goal tally and climb from 16th place in the standings.</p>

Despite its compact size, the tiny home includes essentials like a compact AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, storage, a portable toilet, and an outdoor shower, all powered by roof-mounted solar panels. The builder, Levi Kelly, encourages others to embrace creative small-space living, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing comfort versus minimalism.</p>
