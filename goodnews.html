          <p>Moody's Ratings has lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over the increasing federal government debt and the rising costs of financing the budget deficit amid high interest rates. The agency highlighted the failure of successive administrations to address the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. This downgrade aligns Moody's with other major rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Fitch, which had previously lowered the U.S. rating. The decision is expected to marginally increase yields on U.S. Treasury debt and could negatively impact investor sentiment towards U.S. assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court has upheld an injunction temporarily blocking the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act, remanding the case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the time afforded to detainees to contest removals. The majority stated that the government did not provide adequate time or information for migrants to challenge their cases, emphasizing the weighty interests at stake for the detainees. President Trump criticized the ruling, while the ACLU praised the court's decision. The court's order prevents removals under the Alien Enemies Act, but the government may pursue removals under other lawful authorities.</p>
