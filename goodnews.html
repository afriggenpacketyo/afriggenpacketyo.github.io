          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 meticulously documented a new star, later identified as a nova, providing unprecedented details about its size, brightness, and color. The astronomers reported the sighting to Emperor Yongle, interpreting it as a heavenly endorsement of his reign. This detailed record, recently rediscovered, confirms the phenomenon was a nova and has helped modern astronomers narrow down the star's possible position. The article highlights the significance of historical astronomical records in understanding celestial events and the contributions of Chinese astronomers to the field.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that a trade deal with China has been reached, pending final approval from both himself and President Xi Jinping. The deal reportedly involves China supplying the U.S. with magnets and rare earth metals, while the U.S. would ease restrictions on visas for Chinese students. However, details about the agreement remain limited, and the White House is facing questions about whether its tariff strategy can quickly lead to solid trade deals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that trade talks with other countries might extend beyond the administration's self-declared 90-day deadline. The article suggests that the U.S. is seeking to resolve trade conflicts and secure access to essential resources through negotiations with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that they say "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86 million-year-old skeletons, found in a Mongolian museum, represent the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the T. rex. Khankhuuluu represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, possessing early stages of features key to tyrannosaurs' dominance, including skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw. This discovery provides valuable insights into the evolution of tyrannosaurs and their transition to apex predators.</p>
