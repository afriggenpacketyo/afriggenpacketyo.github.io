          <p>A federal judge has struck down a Trump executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, declaring it unconstitutional. The ruling marks a significant victory for the firm, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation suit against Fox News. Judge Loren AliKhan stated the order violated the First and Fifth Amendments and threatened the independence of the legal profession. This decision is the latest in a series of legal defeats for the administration's attempts to punish law firms perceived as political adversaries.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes both closed at record highs, signaling strong investor confidence despite ongoing geopolitical tensions. The market surge is attributed to cautious optimism regarding a more moderate U.S. tariff posture and signs of continued economic growth. Recent data shows inflation remaining near its lowest since 2021 and a sturdy hiring market, which has helped alleviate concerns about a potential downturn. The rally briefly paused following President Trump's announcement to halt trade talks with Canada but recovered by the end of the day. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman has significantly updated his guidance on cryptocurrency investment, now suggesting that portfolios could allocate between 10% and 40% to digital assets. This marks a substantial increase from his previous recommendation of a low single-digit percentage. Edelman attributes this shift to the maturation of the crypto market and the obsolescence of the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio model due to increased human longevity. He argues that crypto offers diversification and the potential for higher returns compared to other asset classes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the month of June, with its value surging over 40%. The rally is attributed to several factors, including its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the Senate's GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and strong performance from its partner, Circle. Analysts suggest the stock may have further room to grow, as the market may not have fully priced in the value of its revenue-sharing agreement for the USDC stablecoin.
