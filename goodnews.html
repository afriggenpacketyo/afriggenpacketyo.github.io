          <p>Joel Willett, a former CIA officer whose security clearance was recently revoked by the Trump administration, has announced his Democratic candidacy for Mitch McConnell's Senate seat in Kentucky. Willett frames the revocation as a politically motivated act intended to silence dissent, which has strengthened his resolve to run. His campaign will focus on issues like economic inequality and the fentanyl crisis, which has personally affected his family, positioning him as a millennial candidate concerned with the erosion of democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>In her campaign for Virginia governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger is highlighting endorsements from two former Republican members of Congress, Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman. This move aims to attract moderate voters ahead of early voting in a closely watched race against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. The election is seen as a key test of the political climate during Donald Trump's second presidential term, particularly in a state that has been trending Democratic but showed tighter margins in the last election.</p>

          <p>A new study from OpenAI and Harvard researchers provides the first large-scale analysis of how consumers use ChatGPT, revealing a significant shift toward personal, non-work-related activities. The research found that requests for practical guidance, such as tutoring and how-to advice, are the most common use case, with non-work messages jumping to 73% of conversations. The study also highlighted ChatGPT's growing global adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and a narrowing of the gender gap among its user base.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Companies Increasingly Favor Offshore Yuan Bonds for Overseas Financing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to financial experts, Chinese companies are expected to increasingly issue offshore yuan-denominated bonds, known as dim sum bonds, to fund their overseas expansion. This shift away from US dollar bonds is driven by high US interest rates and Beijing's promotion of the yuan's international use amid geopolitical tensions. Analysts note that issuing these bonds in Hong Kong is becoming a record-breaking trend, as it provides a relatively cheaper financing alternative for Chinese corporations.

          <p>Donald Trump's affinity for the British royal family, influenced by his Scottish mother's admiration for Queen Elizabeth II, has spanned his entire career. This long-standing fascination with the glamour and status of royalty is seen as a key reason for his enthusiasm for his second state visit to the UK. From allegedly using Princess Diana's name to promote his Mar-a-Lago club to his deep appreciation for meeting the late Queen, Trump's interactions with the royals have been a recurring theme, reflecting a desire for legitimacy and high-society acceptance.</p>

          <p>StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, resulting in a valuation of $8.6 billion for the online ticket platform. The pricing fell in the middle of its expected range and successfully raised $800 million. After being acquired by eBay in 2007 and then reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, StubHub's path to going public faced several delays. The company's debut on the New York Stock Exchange signals a recent rebound in the IPO market.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Mummification Was Practiced in Southern China Thousands of Years Before Egypt</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that ancient peoples in southern China and Southeast Asia were practicing mummification as early as 12,000 years ago, long before similar practices in ancient Egypt or Chile. A study of 54 pre-Neolithic burial sites revealed that many bodies were intentionally smoke-dried over extended periods, often in a tightly bound, crouched position. This discovery challenges previous timelines and shows that complex mortuary rituals were being performed by hunter-gatherer societies in the region thousands of years earlier than previously understood.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The zarf, a Turkish word for 'envelope,' refers to the ornate, often bejeweled holders for small coffee cups that were a symbol of luxury and status during the Ottoman Empire. Serving coffee in Turkey is a culturally significant ritual recognized by UNESCO, and the zarf was an integral part of this tradition, functioning as both a practical handle and a statement of elegance. While modern cardboard coffee sleeves are sometimes colloquially called zarfs, purists argue the term should be reserved for the historical, artistic items that represent a rich cultural heritage.</p>
