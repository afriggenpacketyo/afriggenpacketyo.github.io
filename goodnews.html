          <p>Holly LaFavers from Lexington, Kentucky, was shocked when 22 boxes containing 50,600 Dum-Dums lollipops were delivered to her apartment after her 8-year-old son, Liam, mistakenly placed a $4,200 order on Amazon thinking he was simply reserving the candy for a carnival he wanted to organize for his friends. Initially, Amazon refused to accept the return due to it being food, but after LaFavers posted about the incident on Facebook, gaining attention from local and national media, Amazon issued a refund and invited her and Liam to visit the Spangler Candy Co. factory, the makers of Dum-Dums. LaFavers decided to donate the lollipops to local charities, schools, and churches, while Liam's online browsing privileges have been temporarily suspended.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a trade framework with the United Kingdom, the first since pausing some "Liberation Day" tariffs, adjusting tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles. In return, the U.K. will ease trade barriers on products like ethanol, beef, and machinery, totaling $5 billion in trade, and will fast-track U.S. imports through customs. The agreement also includes a $10 billion purchase of Boeing airplane parts and a "secure supply chain" for pharmaceuticals. While some details are pending, both Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer touted the deal, with Starmer noting that some details still need to be "ironed out.</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced a notable upswing on Thursday following President Trump's announcement of a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all showing gains. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and eliminate non-tariff barriers. While the 10% baseline U.S. tax on imports will remain, the deal includes provisions for British automakers. Despite this positive development, analysts caution that market volatility is expected to continue, especially with ongoing trade negotiations with larger partners like China, where significant hurdles remain.</p>
