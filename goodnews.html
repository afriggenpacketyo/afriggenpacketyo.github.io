          <p>Gold remains a popular investment commodity, often viewed as a safe-haven asset during periods of economic instability and a hedge against inflation. As of mid-July 2025, the price stood at $3,337.20 per ounce, though this figure is in constant flux. The article outlines several key factors that influence its value, including basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainty, central bank policies, and the strength of the U.S. dollar all play significant roles in determining the daily price of the precious metal.

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will not be taking further action against the Irish language rap group Kneecap following an investigation into their Glastonbury festival performance. The inquiry was launched to determine if on-stage comments constituted a criminal offense, but authorities concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The group had previously faced controversy for their pro-Palestinian stance and messages displayed at other concerts. A separate investigation into comments made by the punk-rap duo Bob Vylan during their own Glastonbury set is reportedly still ongoing.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 09:24:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the U.S. inflation rate rising to 2.7% in June, the Federal Reserve is expected to delay interest rate cuts, creating a continued high-rate environment favorable for savers. The article suggests that investing $10,000 in a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) is a strategic move to capitalize on this situation. Short-term CDs offer flexibility, allowing investors to adapt to economic changes as the accounts mature in a year or less. They also provide a solid return in the interim, with some 6-to-12-month CDs currently offering rates that can yield several hundred dollars on a $10,000 deposit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's content like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" is proving crucial for retaining subscribers and ensuring profitability. Because children tend to re-watch content repeatedly, these shows drive high engagement at a lower production cost, which helps reduce customer churn. Media giants like Disney, Paramount, and Netflix are leveraging their deep libraries of kids' content to maintain their subscriber base. The strategy also increasingly involves a presence on YouTube, which dominates viewership among younger audiences and serves as a vital platform for discovery and engagement.</p>

          <p>Chevron has won a critical arbitration case against Exxon Mobil, removing the final obstacle to its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation. The dispute centered on Exxon's claim of a right of first refusal over Hess's 30% stake in a lucrative offshore oil project in Guyana. An International Chamber of Commerce panel ruled in favor of Chevron, allowing the massive deal to proceed. While Exxon expressed disagreement with the ruling, it stated it would respect the decision and welcomed Chevron to the Guyana joint venture, which also includes China's CNOOC.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition affecting veins in the legs. The disclosure came after photographs showed the president with swollen ankles, prompting a medical evaluation. A memo from the White House physician described the condition as "benign and common" and confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure. The condition occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing it to pool, and is typically managed with compression stockings and leg elevation.</p>

Mbeumo is expected to undergo a medical before the team departs for its pre-season tour in the United States. The signing is seen as an effort by new manager Ruben Amorim to add proven Premier League quality, versatility, and consistency to United's attack for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions are heading into their rugby Test series against the Wallabies as unprecedented favorites, with bookmakers and even Australian polls predicting a series victory, possibly a 3-0 clean sweep. Australia is contending with injuries to key players and a lack of recent match play, making them significant underdogs. While a dominant Lions performance is expected, some argue that a hard-fought series against a competitive Wallabies side is necessary for the tour to be truly memorable. The first Test will be a crucial indicator of whether Australia's coach Joe Schmidt can engineer an upset against the powerful visiting squad.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has outlined a five-year plan to stimulate domestic consumption by improving the quality and supply of services. Minister Wang Wentao acknowledged a "shortage of high-quality service" and stated that from 2026 to 2030, China will reduce restrictive measures and enrich supply, particularly in healthcare and elderly care. This strategy aims to strengthen the domestic economy as a reliable growth engine amid an uncertain global trade environment. The push to attract foreign investment in the service sector is a key component of the plan to compensate for trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of trending toward a more restrictionist stance, American public opinion on immigration is showing signs of a significant positive reversal, according to recent polling data. Surveys from Gallup and Pew Research Center indicate a sharp drop in the number of Americans wanting less immigration and a record high in those viewing it as a "good thing" for the country. This "thermostatic" shift appears to be a reaction to President Trump's implementation of his hardline immigration agenda. While there is still support for some specific enforcement policies, broad disapproval of his administration's handling of the issue is growing.</p>
