          <h2>Germany Proposes 'Construction Turbo' Law to Address Housing Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 07:07:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's government is advancing a 'Bau-Turbo' (construction turbo) plan to tackle its severe housing crisis by streamlining building regulations. The proposed legislation aims to expedite approvals for new residential projects, allowing municipalities to bypass certain planning laws and automatically approving applications after two months if not vetoed. While proponents believe this will save billions and stimulate construction, critics express concerns about the loss of green spaces and argue that it won't be a short-term fix. The plan is part of a broader effort to increase affordable housing in a country facing soaring rents.</p>

          <p>Quantum computing company IonQ has hired Marco Pistoia, the former head of applied research at JPMorgan Chase, as its new senior vice president of industry relations. Pistoia, who led JPMorgan's advanced technology and quantum computing research group, will focus on helping corporate clients adopt quantum technologies and quantum-safe encryption. His move comes as the race to commercialize quantum computing intensifies among tech giants and specialized firms. Pistoia noted the significant risk that powerful quantum computers pose to current cryptography and stated his belief that usable quantum computers are only two to three years away.</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an 'immediate and unconditional' ceasefire following deadly border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000. The agreement was mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in his capacity as the chair of the ASEAN regional bloc. The fighting, which flared after a landmine explosion, marked a rare military confrontation between ASEAN members. The talks were encouraged by international pressure, including from the United States, which had warned that trade deals could be at risk if hostilities continued, leading to a de-escalation of the conflict.</p>

          <p>In the second quarter of the year, Huawei reclaimed its position as the top smartphone seller in China, shipping 12.2 million units for an 18% market share. This marks the first time Huawei has led the market since early 2024, signaling a strong comeback after being impacted by U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, Apple also saw positive results, with its shipments in China growing by 4% year-on-year, its first increase since late 2023. This growth for Apple is attributed to strategic price adjustments and trade-in offers for its iPhone 16 series amid intense local competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company. Investor confidence is growing, with the company's stock up over 30% this year and analysts expecting a return to annual profitability by next year. Ortberg has focused on improving production consistency and changing the corporate culture, which has earned praise from major airline customers like Ryanair. Despite progress, Boeing still faces challenges, including FAA production caps on its 737 Max and ongoing issues in its defense unit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Rupert Murdoch's decision to contest a $10 billion lawsuit from Donald Trump, positioning the 94-year-old media mogul as an unexpected champion for press freedom. While other outlets have yielded to pressure, Murdoch's Wall Street Journal has stood by its reporting on Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein. The author explores various motivations for Murdoch's stance, including his historical tendency to back winners, a personal dislike for Trump, and a desire to protect his journalistic institutions. Ultimately, the piece suggests that in an era of increasing attacks on the media, Murdoch's defiance, whatever the reason, serves as a crucial bulwark against intimidation.</p>

          <p>The Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the intense and closely matched rivalry between McLaren teammates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, with Piastri ultimately securing the victory. The race turned on key moments, including Piastri's brave move to overtake Norris for the lead at the start in wet conditions. Strategic decisions on tire compounds and pit stops also played a crucial role, with Piastri successfully managing his medium tires to the end under pressure. While Norris showed strong pace, a few small errors and a less-than-perfect start may have cost him a chance to challenge for the win, showcasing the fine margins defining their championship battle.</p>

          <p>Stargazers are encouraged to look for meteors this week, as the Southern Delta Aquariids and Alpha Capricornids showers are set to peak on the night of July 29-30. Unlike the more famous Perseid meteor shower in August, which will be largely washed out by a bright moon this year, this week's showers will occur under a much darker, 25% full moon. Astronomers suggest these combined events could produce 20 to 30 meteors per hour. For the best viewing experience, observers should find a dark location away from city lights after midnight and allow their eyes to adjust.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is moving forward with a major redevelopment of the historic and long-mothballed General Hospital building. A development team has created a conceptual plan to transform the 19-story Art Deco landmark and its surrounding campus into a mixed-use community with housing, medical offices, and retail space. The county has authorized $120 million for the initial remediation phase, which includes seismic upgrades and demolition of adjacent structures. The ambitious project aims to create a national model for equitable urban development, revitalizing an iconic building that has been largely vacant for over a decade.</p>

          <p>A new book, 'The Carpool Detectives,' chronicles the true story of four Los Angeles mothers who, with no law enforcement background, successfully solved a cold case double homicide. The investigation began when one of the women, a former forensic accountant, learned about the stalled case of an older couple's mysterious death from two decades prior. Over two and a half years, the amateur sleuths navigated dead ends and potential dangers to uncover the perpetrator. Their success not only brought closure to the case but also gave the women a new sense of purpose, and they are now tackling a second, more complex investigation.</p>

          <p>Nevada's Democratic Attorney General, Aaron Ford, has announced his candidacy for governor in 2026, setting up a potential challenge against incumbent Republican Joe Lombardo. Ford is framing his campaign around the defense of social programs, citing his own past reliance on Medicaid and food stamps. He has criticized Lombardo's response to a new federal law that introduces work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The race is expected to be highly competitive in the purple state, which often splits tickets and is considered one of five toss-up gubernatorial contests for 2026.</p>

          <p>A report from Renmin University indicates that the international use of China's yuan grew by approximately 11% in 2024, strengthening its position in the global financial system. While the U.S. dollar remains dominant, its usage index saw a slight decline, as did the euro's. The report suggests that promoting the yuan's internationalization is a key strategy for China to mitigate geoeconomic risks and reform the global monetary system. Despite this progress, the report also identifies a potential threat from U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, which could challenge the yuan's expansion in the digital currency space.
