          <p>Thousands in Scotland remain without power and face travel disruptions following Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. Utility company SSEN is working to restore electricity to over 43,000 homes, primarily in the Highlands, Moray, and Aberdeenshire. Network Rail is clearing numerous incidents from train lines caused by gusts up to 90mph, while flights and major events were also cancelled. The Scottish government is coordinating the response, urging caution as recovery efforts continue.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a drop in second-quarter revenue, posting an adjusted net income of $24.5 billion, which still surpassed analyst expectations. The state-owned oil giant attributed the decline to lower prices for crude oil and refined chemical products, though this was partly offset by higher sales volumes. Despite the dip, CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism, anticipating that oil demand in the second half of 2025 will be significantly higher than the first. The company is also set to increase output as OPEC+ members unwind voluntary production cuts through September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick opens up about emerging from the most significant slump of his professional golf career.

          <h2>Analysis Argues England's Ashes Hopes in Australia Rest on Ben Stokes</h2>

          <p>This article analyzes England's prospects for the upcoming Ashes cricket series in Australia, positing that any chance of victory rests heavily on captain Ben Stokes. The author argues that without Stokes, who personifies the team's aggressive 'Bazball' approach, England is a vulnerable side. Stokes' challenge is immense: he must recover from injury, perform at an elite level, and provide crucial leadership to a squad largely inexperienced in Australian conditions. If England manages to win the series, it would be considered one of the greatest achievements of Stokes' celebrated and miraculous career.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 23:00:09 EDT</div>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced a new plan to bolster its domestic cattle industry in response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports. The policy, released by several government departments, aims to increase beef production and introduce a quality-grading system to encourage consumption of higher-quality domestic meat. Officials noted that the average Chinese diet is deficient in high-quality proteins, leaving significant room for growth. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to strengthen key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic farm products. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. border agents have reportedly been instructed to stop deportations under President Trump's asylum ban, according to CBS News. This directive follows a federal appeals court ruling that partially limited the ban, stating it could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. The court order is a significant development in the legal challenges against the administration's broad immigration restrictions. Customs and Border Protection officials were reportedly told over the weekend to revert to processing migrants under existing U.S. immigration law, rather than the stricter measures imposed by the ban.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan in a landmark defense deal valued at 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion). The agreement, which sees Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries win the contract, marks the largest-ever defense industry partnership between the two nations. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described the stealthy, next-generation warships as the best choice for Australia's capability needs. This purchase is part of Australia's broader military restructuring to counter China's expansion and aims to more than double its fleet of major warships over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on Donald Trump's presidential council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley, who was among a list of prominent sports figures invited to join the revitalized council, stated that he and his family decided it was in his best interest not to accept due to his busy schedule. The council was reestablished under a recent executive order by the president. Barkley noted that he was surprised to be named but appreciated the offer, having previously golfed with both Trump and former President Barack Obama.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump posted on his Truth Social platform praising the retailer's marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ad had previously drawn criticism from some online who accused it of promoting eugenics, a claim the company denied. Trump lauded the ad as the 'HOTTEST' out there and contrasted it with what he called 'woke' advertising from other brands. The presidential endorsement fueled a meme-driven rally for the financially challenged retailer, which had recently withdrawn its full-year guidance due to slow sales. (not investment advice)</p>
