          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that Israel has accepted the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal. While Israel has not officially confirmed the agreement, its foreign minister indicated majority government support for a hostage release framework. A Hamas official expressed readiness for a deal that ends the war, as mediators from Qatar and Egypt work to finalize the proposal. This development occurs ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>A veterinarian in Wisconsin has successfully saved a severely injured American bald eagle by using an innovative procedure involving grafts made from Atlantic cod skin. The eagle, named Kere, was found with a deep infection and a leg ripped open, an injury that would typically lead to euthanasia. Dr. Kimberly Ammann used the fish skin patches, normally used for human wounds, to repair the leg over a 10-month rehabilitation period. The eagle was successfully released back into the wild just ahead of the Fourth of July.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is framing his climate agenda as a core component of his focus on cost-of-living issues, a strategy his supporters believe can build broad popular support. Rather than leading with complex, technocratic plans, Mamdani's platform connects environmental goals to tangible benefits like free bus transit and a rent freeze. For example, his housing plan aims to lower emissions by boosting density and energy efficiency, but its main promise is stabilizing housing costs, which also prevents displacement and carbon-intensive suburban sprawl.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is offering residents the chance to fish without a license on two designated days this summer, July 5 and August 30. This initiative aims to provide a low-cost opportunity for people to try the sport and enjoy the state's natural resources. While the license requirement is waived, all other fishing regulations, such as size and bag limits, will remain in effect. The program runs alongside conservation efforts for threatened species like the Southern California steelhead trout and Chinook salmon.</p>

          <p>A new state law in California that took effect Tuesday mandates that any establishment serving alcohol for on-site consumption must offer lids to customers upon request. This measure is intended to help patrons protect their drinks from being drugged, building on a previous law that required bars to make drug-testing kits available. Authored by Assemblymember Josh Lowenthal, the bill passed unanimously and allows establishments to charge a reasonable price for the lids. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control will enforce the new rule during routine inspections.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a plan to spend nearly $425 million in funds collected from Measure ULA, the city's tax on high-value property sales. The 2025 fiscal year plan directs the majority of the money, over $288 million, toward the creation and preservation of affordable housing. An additional $100 million is allocated for homelessness prevention, including eviction defense and income support for tenants. While the real estate industry has criticized the tax, supporters champion it as a vital source of funding for the city's housing crisis.</p>

          <p>A journalist who covered the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County underwent blood testing to check for lead exposure, reflecting widespread public anxiety about hidden health hazards. This personal account explores the complex and often confusing science behind contamination risks from urban fires, where toxic materials from burned homes can enter the air, soil, and water. While the journalist's and many other residents' test results were reassuringly low, the experience underscores the psychological toll and the challenge of assessing long-term health risks in the aftermath of such disasters.</p>

With subtitles translating his speeches for local audiences, Springsteen is leveraging his immense popularity in Europe to act as an ambassador for an America he feels is under threat, drawing massive, enthusiastic crowds.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As countries like South Korea reportedly pivot towards stablecoins, it's important to understand their key differences from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) such as China's digital yuan. The digital yuan is a state-controlled currency intended for domestic retail payments and is not exchangeable for foreign currencies. In contrast, stablecoins are privately issued, blockchain-based tokens pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, with issuers holding reserve assets to back their value. This fundamental difference in design, management, and purpose distinguishes the two forms of digital money. (not investment advice)</p>
