          <h2>Experts Assess Champions League's New Format After PSG's Victory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 18:41:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha praised the new Champions League format, highlighting the increased number of good games and significant moments, noting that teams only played each other once in the league stage, altering the energy and stakes. Journalist Nicky Bandini pointed out that the format benefited PSG, allowing them to progress and develop throughout the season, which they might not have been able to do under the old system. Onuoha added that PSG's journey shows that finding form at the right time is crucial, as they were outside the top 24 until their penultimate game and successfully navigated the play-off stage. The new format emphasizes the importance of timing and allows for more entertaining journeys for teams, as seen with PSG's unexpected path to victory.</p>
