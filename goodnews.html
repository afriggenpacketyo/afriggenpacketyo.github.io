          <h2>Wall Street Recovers After Initial Losses from Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 18:49:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of uncertainty following President Trump's imposition of global tariffs, Wall Street experienced a rebound, driven by positive economic indicators and renewed hopes for trade talks between the U.S. and China. The tech sector led the gains, with companies like Microsoft and Nvidia showing strong growth. A better-than-expected jobs report, indicating the addition of 177,000 new jobs in April, helped to alleviate recession fears. However, some experts caution that the full impact of the tariffs is still uncertain, and the economy's outlook remains volatile, with the potential for further weakening if trade tensions escalate.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and has permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. The judge stated that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing certain clients and for its employment policies, violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution. The ruling emphasizes that the government must respond to dissenting or unpopular speech with tolerance, not coercion.</p>

          <p>George H. Ryan, the former governor of Illinois who famously imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in 2000 due to concerns about wrongful convictions, has died at the age of 91. Citing a "shameless record of convicting innocent people and putting them on death row," Governor Ryan, a moderate Republican, defended his decision to suspend the death penalty in Illinois on Jan. 31 as an act of conscience. Ryan later commuted the sentences of all death row inmates, a decision that drew both praise and criticism. His legacy is complex, as he also faced corruption charges and served time in prison.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old philosopher, Benjamin Qin Muji, has gained recognition for his essay exploring the consciousness and rights of artificial intelligence. He argues that AI, with its capacity to process information and synthesize ideas, possesses a form of consciousness. However, he believes that AI cannot feel pain due to the absence of a biological body. Benjamin's work reflects a growing interest in the ethical and legal implications of advanced AI, as society grapples with defining the boundaries of human and machine intelligence.</p>
