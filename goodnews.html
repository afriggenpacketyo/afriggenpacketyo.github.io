          <p>India has blocked the X accounts of Chinese state-backed media outlets Global Times and Xinhua, accusing them of spreading disinformation during a recent conflict with Pakistan. While Global Times was briefly blocked but restored, Xinhua's account remains withheld in India due to a legal demand. This action occurred amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir, with both sides making unverified claims about casualties from missile and artillery attacks. The Times of India reported that the accounts were banned for spreading unverified claims on Indian military activities. </p>

          <p>Epic Games announced that Fortnite is now globally unavailable on iOS devices after Apple blocked its attempt to reinstate the game on the App Store in the U.S. This follows a previous removal of Fortnite from the App Store in 2020 when Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission fees by linking to its own website for in-app purchases. Apple charges developers a 30% fee for purchases made through its app store. Despite Fortnite being available in Europe through Epic Games' own digital store due to the Digital Markets Act, Apple has also blocked its distribution on the Epic Games Store for iOS in the EU. </p>

          <p>President Trump's four-day trip to the Middle East concluded with a series of significant developments, including a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing longstanding U.S. policy towards the country. The visit also resulted in announcements of multibillion-dollar deals for U.S. companies, including a large order from Qatar for Boeing passenger jets, though details remain sparse. Trump indicated progress in nuclear talks with Iran while reiterating that the U.S. would not allow Tehran to develop a nuclear weapon. Despite sidestepping the conflict in Gaza, Trump acknowledged civilian suffering there and expressed a desire for resolution. </p>

          <p>House Republicans' tax bill includes a temporary $4,000 deduction for older adults, aimed at helping retirees keep more money in their pockets. This provision, referred to as a "bonus," is an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. The additional deduction would be available to adults ages 65 and over from 2025 through 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes over $150,000. While it reduces the amount of seniors' income subject to taxes, it is less generous than a tax credit. </p>

However, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, with a significant drop in China. The company's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require agility and discipline, citing headwinds such as gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations. </p>

          <p>Chinese trade envoy Li Chenggang described recent trade talks with the U.S. as "good" after high-level engagement in Switzerland led to a temporary easing of trade tensions. However, both sides have maintained a restrained tone, with Beijing remaining tight-lipped on potential meetings or calls between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The first round of negotiations in Geneva resulted in a temporary lowering of duties and the establishment of a "communication mechanism" on economic and trade issues. The tariff reprieve has somewhat improved China's economic outlook, prompting some economists to raise this year's growth forecast. </p>

          <p>President Trump's denunciations of "activist judges" are part of a long-standing tradition of presidents criticizing the judiciary, though his remarks may be the most vocal. This article explores the history of presidents and members of Congress criticizing the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, when they disagree with their decisions. The term "judicial activism" was coined in 1947, but criticism of the courts predates the term and has come from both ends of the political spectrum. The article examines how different presidents have used the term and how the courts have responded. </p>
