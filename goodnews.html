          <p>A 25-year-old Florida woman, Dakota Peters, who skipped college, has built a highly successful sports trading card company. After starting on the live auction app Whatnot in 2021, her business, Achickrips, grew rapidly and now generates over $1 million in gross merchandise value per week. Peters expanded from a solo operation with long hours to a company with over 40 employees, diversifying into selling thrift clothing and coins.

          <p>With home equity levels at a new high, homeowners have a significant financial resource available through Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). This article suggests that July is an opportune time to open a HELOC due to a potentially quicker approval process compared to unsecured loans. Furthermore, their variable interest rates could become more favorable with anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. The flexibility of a HELOC, which only requires interest payments on the amount used during the draw period, is presented as another key advantage in the current economic climate.

This acquisition, to be managed through Home Depot's subsidiary SRS Distribution, also effectively ends a potential hostile takeover bid for GMS from another company.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move intended to support the country's path toward stability under its new government. The action follows a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, where Trump outlined conditions for the policy change, including normalizing relations with neighbors like Israel. While the order dismantles the broad sanctions architecture, officials state that targeted restrictions against Bashar Al Assad and other destabilizing actors will remain.

          <p>Dating app Tinder is piloting a new mandatory identity verification feature called "Face Check" for new users in California to enhance safety and reduce fraudulent accounts. The technology requires users to take a short video selfie, which is then used to confirm they are a real person and that their face matches their profile photos. This initiative comes amid a rise in "romance scams" and aims to build trust on the platform by providing a verification checkmark. The company stated that the facial data will be deleted within 30 days if a user closes their account.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When a debt dispute is denied by a credit bureau or collector, consumers still have multiple paths to resolve the issue rather than letting it damage their credit. This article outlines five options, including negotiating a settlement for a lower lump-sum payment or working with a credit counseling agency on a debt management plan. Other strategies involve using a debt consolidation loan to combine multiple debts into one payment with a lower interest rate. For those facing severe financial hardship, inquiring about assistance programs or, as a last resort, filing for bankruptcy are also viable considerations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a period of staggering growth that saw its price surpass $3,400 per ounce, gold is predicted to maintain relative stability through July. This analysis suggests that with inflation holding steady and the Federal Reserve likely to keep interest rates paused until September, two major drivers of gold price volatility will be neutralized. While geopolitical tensions remain a wildcard that could cause sudden price shifts, the current environment points toward a period of consolidation for the precious metal. Investors are watching for the next inflation report and the Fed's late-July meeting for any new signals. (not investment advice)</p>

The new owner, TTAM Research Institute, has pledged to uphold and improve privacy policies and continue using the genetic data for medical research with customer consent.
