          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte expressed support for President Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin, framing it as a crucial test of the Russian leader's seriousness. Rutte emphasized that while Trump is initiating the dialogue, any final peace deal concerning Ukrainian territory or security guarantees must involve Ukraine and European allies. He assured that weapon deliveries to Ukraine will continue regardless of the summit's outcome and that the alliance remains united, stating Putin will not be allowed to decide NATO's posture or Ukraine's future strategic position.</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks, who portrayed astronaut Jim Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," has paid tribute to the celebrated space pioneer, who passed away at age 97. In a heartfelt social media post, Hanks described Lovell as someone who dared to lead others to extraordinary places, driven not by fame but by the challenge of exploration. Lovell famously commanded the near-disastrous Apollo 13 mission, which became known as a "successful failure" after the crew's safe return against all odds. Hanks' tribute remembered Lovell's voyages and wished him "God speed" on his final journey.</p>

          <p>With earnings season concluding, Wall Street's attention is shifting to key inflation reports, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI). These figures are critical as they will heavily influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on interest rates, especially after a recent weak jobs report increased bets on a rate cut. Investors will be scrutinizing the data for any signs of inflation stemming from existing tariffs, although President Trump's newest levies are not yet reflected. Other economic indicators to watch include weekly jobless claims and July's retail sales report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese practice of "shinrin-yoku," or forest bathing, is gaining traction as a mindfulness technique for improving mental well-being. The practice involves immersing oneself in nature and engaging all senses to connect with the natural environment, which research shows can lower stress and enhance focus. Certified forest therapy guides lead sessions that encourage quiet reflection and disconnection from technology. The practice can be adapted for any green space, such as a local park or backyard, and even short 15-minute sessions can be beneficial for calming the mind in contrast to a typically hectic, screen-filled daily life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to branding agency founder Goldie Chan, developing a personal brand is an essential strategy for introverts to advance their careers and ensure their talents are not underestimated. A personal brand, defined as what people know you for professionally, allows individuals to shape their own narrative rather than being overlooked. Chan, a self-described introvert, advises starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one weekly update online, to build visibility and comfort. She emphasizes that branding extends beyond online activity to include participation in social groups and hobbies.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Electric Spark," re-examines the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic writer obscures her significance as a major religious author in modern British literature. The article posits that Spark, a Catholic convert, expressed her theology primarily through her narrative form, often "playing God" with her characters and plot. She frequently used techniques like prolepsis, or revealing a character's fate early on, to shift the reader's focus from "what happens" to "why," exploring themes of divine will, conspiracy, and human fallibility. Her work was deeply influenced by her life experiences.</p>

The career break allowed the couple to re-evaluate their priorities, realizing they could live happily on less and did not need to chase higher salaries and titles. During the sabbatical, the family focused on health, personal growth, and quality time, and they are now expecting their second child.

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with more sophisticated tools, companies are increasingly adopting AI agents for their own cyber defense. These autonomous agents can handle routine detection, analysis, and alert tasks, freeing up human cybersecurity professionals to focus on more complex threats and strategic work. This automation helps combat worker burnout and addresses the talent shortage in the industry. While the technology is still evolving, experts believe AI agents are essential for defense, as they can manage tasks like monitoring executive travel or quarantining suspicious emails, allowing security teams to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape.
