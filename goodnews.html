          <p>Shares for Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the FICO credit score, increased by over 20% following the announcement of a new business model. The company will now license its credit scores directly to mortgage lenders, a move that could bypass traditional credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, whose stock prices fell on the news. This change aims to eliminate unnecessary markups and give lenders more choice in pricing, a development praised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency director. (not investment advice)</p>

Now feeling well after successful treatment, she hopes her story will encourage others to be persistent about their health and advocate for themselves.</p>

          <p>In an uncertain economic climate with rising inflation and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, short-term savings options like a six-month certificate of deposit (CD) are gaining attention. This article calculates the potential interest earnings on a 6-month CD at a 4.30% rate for various deposit amounts, ranging from $1,000 to $50,000. These accounts offer a guaranteed return and FDIC insurance, providing stability without locking up funds for an extended period. This makes them an attractive option for savers seeking to protect and grow their money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A free-floating 'rogue planet' has been observed consuming gas and dust at the record-breaking rate of six billion tons per second, blurring the line between planets and stars. The object, named Cha 1107-7626, is located about 620 light years away and has a mass five to ten times that of Jupiter. This accretion event, where the object pulls matter from a surrounding disc, is the strongest ever recorded for a planetary-mass object. The discovery challenges existing theories on planetary formation, suggesting some may form more like stars than previously thought.</p>

          <p>With average interest rates for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) falling below 8%, this article analyzes the monthly cost of a $70,000 HELOC. It calculates that a 10-year repayment plan would cost approximately $845 per month, while a 15-year plan would be around $664. These figures represent a notable decrease from costs seen in previous months when rates were higher. The variable nature of HELOC rates can be advantageous in a climate of declining interest, making it a potentially more affordable option for homeowners needing financing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year, though production saw a slight decline. The delivery numbers surpassed analyst expectations compiled by FactSet. This report comes as a key federal tax credit for EV buyers in the U.S. expired, which may have spurred a rush of purchases during the quarter. The company's performance was bolstered by U.S. sales, offsetting a slump in Europe attributed to increased competition and consumer backlash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has indicated that a decision is approaching on whether to replace the league's current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Clubs have criticized the existing regulations, which limit losses to £105 million over three years, for stifling investment. An alternative being considered is a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's model, which would limit spending on squad-related costs to a percentage of a club's revenue. A final decision on adopting a new system is expected to be made in November.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction that many Finns themselves find surprising. Experts suggest the ranking is based more on contentment and life satisfaction rather than daily expressions of joy. Key contributing factors include a strong social safety net funded by high taxes, universal access to public services like advanced libraries, and a deep cultural connection to nature. The widespread practice of using saunas followed by cold plunges is also cited as a contributor to overall well-being.</p>
