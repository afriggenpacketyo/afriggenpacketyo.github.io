          <p>This article discusses Melania Trump's limited presence at the White House since her husband's inauguration, noting she has spent fewer than 14 days there in the past 108 days. The corner of the residence typically used by first ladies remains dark, suggesting she does not regularly reside in Washington. Melania Trump often retreats to Trump Tower in Manhattan or Mar-a-Lago in Florida, leading to comparisons with Greta Garbo due to her elusive nature. While officials claim she visits the White House more than publicly known, they provide no specific details, creating an air of mystery around her role.</p>

          <p>Shares of Nvidia experienced a surge on Wednesday following reports that the Trump administration intends to rescind the "AI diffusion" rule, which regulates chip trade. This rule, proposed during the Biden administration, categorizes countries into tiers with varying restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have opposed the rule, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stating that being excluded from the Chinese AI market would be a significant loss. AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the need to balance national security with supporting the American chip industry.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that the White House is likely to withdraw Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's nomination for U.S. Surgeon General. This decision follows criticism from right-wing activist Laura Loomer, who questioned Nesheiwat's medical degree and her pro-vaccine stance. President Trump had previously praised Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor, for her work during the coronavirus pandemic. Nesheiwat is also the sister-in-law of former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who faced scrutiny for his involvement in a Signal group chat discussing military plans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of Wednesday, May 7th, U.S. travelers are now required to present a Real ID or another acceptable form of identification, such as a passport, at airport security checkpoints for domestic flights. Despite concerns about potential delays, many airports reported normal wait times, with high rates of Real ID compliance among travelers. The TSA has extra staff on hand to assist travelers and is using a secondary process to verify the identity of those without a Real ID. Officials emphasize that people can still apply for a Real ID and advise travelers to arrive at least three hours before their flight if they do not have one.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike announced plans to lay off 500 employees, approximately 5% of its workforce, attributing the decision to advancements in artificial intelligence. CEO George Kurtz stated that AI is streamlining operations, improving customer outcomes, and driving efficiencies across the business. This realignment aims to support the company's goal of generating $10 billion in annualized revenue, despite recent net losses. While CrowdStrike emphasizes AI as the primary driver for layoffs, broader economic and market uncertainties are also contributing factors to job cuts in other companies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that consuming large amounts of ultraprocessed foods may be associated with an increased risk of developing early symptoms of Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Researchers found that individuals who ate the most ultraprocessed foods were about 2.5 times more likely to have at least three early symptoms of Parkinson‚Äôs, such as constipation and sleep disturbances. Experts emphasize that the study demonstrates an association, not causation, but highlights the importance of understanding how food choices impact brain health. The study underscores the potential benefits of reducing ultraprocessed food consumption and prioritizing whole foods in the diet.</p>

          <p>The CEO of United Airlines, Scott Kirby, has urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to take several steps to address ongoing delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. Kirby suggests limiting flights during construction, returning the airport to a slot-controlled system, modernizing air traffic control, and fully staffing the air traffic control facility. These recommendations follow recent radar and communication issues that have slowed air traffic in and out of Newark. The FAA has outlined plans to install new communications infrastructure and boost controller staffing to improve the situation.</p>

          <p>Disney's newest theme park will be located in Abu Dhabi, joining a massive entertainment complex on Yas Island. The park, developed in partnership with Miral, will feature a spiraling crystal castle and waterfront attractions. Disney has been criticized for not taking stronger stances against anti-LGBTQ+ policies in Florida, and its partnership with a company in the United Arab Emirates, which has a poor human rights record, raises further concerns. The "experiences" sector, which includes theme parks, makes up a major part of Disney's business.</p>
