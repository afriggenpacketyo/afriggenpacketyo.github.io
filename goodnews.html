          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged over 100% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal is part of renegotiations for a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada. This move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in supply chains for critical minerals, which are essential for electric vehicle batteries. The deal, which has not been finalized, would provide taxpayers with an equity buffer to offset risks associated with the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oregon police have recovered partial remains in the state's oldest unidentified person case, belonging to a woman known as 'Oak Grove Jane Doe' who was killed nearly 80 years ago. The victim's dismembered body was found in burlap sacks in the Willamette River in 1946, but critical evidence, including her remains, later went missing from police custody. Investigators recently located the likely burial site at a cemetery in Oregon City and exhumed the degraded remains. Authorities are now hopeful that modern forensic testing can finally identify the victim and bring resolution to the decades-old mystery.</p>

          <p>Mariah Carey is releasing 'Here for It All,' her first new album in seven years, a project she worked on while grieving the deaths of her mother and estranged sister, who passed away on the same day last year. Carey described the period as extremely difficult but found some healing in her final moments with her mother, an opera singer who influenced her career. The new album is described as having a classic 'Mariah' sound with a fresh twist and features collaborations with artist Anderson .Paak. The album's themes reflect her resilience, with one song, 'Nothing Is Impossible,' inspired by her recovery from a serious fall.</p>

          <p>Sales of newly constructed homes in the U.S. surged by 20.5% in August compared to July, reaching their highest level since January 2022. This significant and unexpected increase occurred even as average 30-year fixed mortgage rates remained elevated throughout the month. Some analysts suggest the reported magnitude of the gain may be overstated due to the small sample size of the Census survey, though they agree the upward trend is directionally correct. The strong sales reduced the inventory of new homes to a 7.4-month supply, down from a 9-month supply in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wildfire that grew to over 100 acres prompted emergency evacuations in the north shore town of Paia on Maui, with officials going door-to-door and sounding emergency sirens to warn residents. The response reflects heightened caution following the catastrophic Lahaina fire in 2023, which destroyed the town and killed 102 people. Firefighters worked to stop the blaze's forward progress, and the threat eventually receded, allowing residents to return home later in the day. Unlike the 2023 disaster, high winds were not a major factor, though the area, like Lahaina, is surrounded by dry brush.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is attempting to boost sales of its F-150 pickup truck by offering special financing rates to consumers with lower, subprime credit scores. The promotion extends lower interest rates, typically reserved for buyers with high credit scores, to those with a FICO score below 620. While such programs aim to make vehicles more affordable and reduce inventory, they also carry risks as subprime borrowers are more likely to default on loans. Ford Credit stated that it only finances customers it believes are creditworthy and that the promotion does not alter its fundamental credit decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered a massive and mysterious object in the early universe that could be a primordial black hole. Such an object would have formed directly from the dense conditions shortly after the Big Bang, before the first stars existed. If confirmed, this finding would challenge the standard cosmological model, which posits that large black holes formed later from collapsed stars. While further observation is needed to verify the object's nature, its existence could force a significant revision of our understanding of how the universe's earliest structures evolved.</p>

          <p>Tom Brady has addressed criticism regarding his dual roles as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and a broadcaster for Fox, stating that only the 'paranoid and distrustful' see a conflict of interest. Critics argue that his broadcasting job gives him and the Raiders an unfair advantage by providing access to other teams' players and coaches. Brady countered that his passion for football creates an 'ethical duty' to improve the game, not a dilemma. The debate intensified after he was seen in the Raiders' coaching booth during a recent game, an action the NFL confirmed did not break any rules.</p>

          <p>A trio of satellites from NASA and NOAA successfully launched from Kennedy Space Center to monitor space weather and provide early warnings of solar storms. The primary spacecraft, NASA's Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), will study the protective bubble around our solar system and give a 30-minute heads-up on solar events, which is crucial for protecting astronauts. The mission also includes a smaller NASA observatory focused on Earth's outer atmosphere and a new NOAA satellite for full-time solar activity forecasting. This 'cosmic carpool' aims to enhance understanding of the sun to better protect Earth and space missions.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has indicated that the league could start renegotiating its massive media rights deals as soon as 2026, four years earlier than the current contract's opt-out clause. The existing 11-year, $111 billion agreement runs through the 2029-30 season, but Goodell stated that the rapidly changing media landscape provides an incentive for both the NFL and its partners to discuss a new deal sooner. An earlier renegotiation could add billions more to the league's revenue, potentially increasing the salary cap and further boosting team valuations, while giving media partners extended control over the highly valuable content.

          <p>Aston Villa defender Ezri Konsa has publicly agreed with head coach Unai Emery's assessment that the team was 'lazy' during their recent 1-1 draw with Sunderland. Emery expressed his frustration after the match, in which Villa conceded an equalizer despite their opponent playing with ten men for an hour. Konsa acknowledged the comment was fair and said that such criticism from the manager provides fuel for the players to prove themselves in the next game. The draw left Aston Villa in the relegation zone and winless in their first five Premier League games of the season.</p>
