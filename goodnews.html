          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE for six weeks; a federal judge ordered her release.

Supporters, including Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, celebrated her release, emphasizing the importance of due process and free speech. Ozturk's lawyers argued that her First Amendment rights were violated, and the judge found no evidence to justify her detainment besides the op-ed.</p>

A recent survey found that over half of the business leaders who laid off employees in anticipation of AI taking over their jobs now regret that decision. Generative AI platforms are useful tools for search and information retrieval, but they are not capable of replacing core operations or making complex decisions without human oversight. The technology is still immature, expensive to implement, and raises concerns about data security and privacy.</p>
