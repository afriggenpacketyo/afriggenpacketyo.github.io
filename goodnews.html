          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation in tariffs. This move suspends a planned increase of US tariffs to 145% on Chinese goods and China's retaliatory 125% duties on American products. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing the substantial US trade deficit with China and what the White House terms "unfair trade practices." Discussions will also cover issues like technology export controls and market access, as both nations seek to de-escalate tensions that have already impacted global trade flows.

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four individuals suspected in a series of burglaries, including a break-in at actor Brad Pitt's home in the Los Feliz neighborhood. The incident occurred on June 25 while Pitt was overseas promoting a new film. According to law enforcement sources, the suspects breached a security fence, smashed a window, and ransacked the property, stealing various items of value. The arrests were made in South Los Angeles, and the investigation into the burglary ring, which may have targeted other celebrities, is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a request from the U.S. Attorney's office to dismiss all charges against Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was convicted of using excessive force. The judge ordered Kirk to begin his four-month prison sentence, stating the government's attempt to overturn a jury conviction was "contrary to the public interest." The case became controversial after the new U.S. Attorney, Bill Essayli, sought to unravel the prosecution, leading to resignations within his office. The ruling concludes a contentious legal battle over prosecutorial discretion and accountability for law enforcement misconduct.</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual arrangement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the federal government 15% of the revenue from their sales of specific AI chips to China. This agreement was a condition for receiving export licenses that were previously restricted by the White House over national security concerns. President Trump confirmed the deal, stating he negotiated the terms directly with Nvidia's CEO. This revenue-sharing model is a novel approach to export controls, allowing U.S. companies to access the lucrative Chinese market while the government receives a direct financial cut.

With the salamander now nearly impossible to find physically, researchers are filtering canal water for genetic traces shed by the animals. This modern technique allows them to monitor the dwindling population where traditional net surveys fail. The work has confirmed the presence of axolotls in protected refuge areas, offering a small sign of hope for the species' resilience if its polluted habitat can be restored and protected from further urban development.</p>

          <p>Sheila Jordan, a singular voice in jazz renowned for her unique style and emotional depth, has passed away at the age of 96. Despite a career marked by personal challenges and racial tensions, she recorded the iconic 1960s album "Portrait of Sheila" and was honored as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2012. A friend of Charlie Parker, who called her "the lady with the million dollar ears," Jordan was also a dedicated educator who taught for decades. She continued to perform and record well into her 90s, leaving behind a legacy of artistic integrity and resilience.</p>

          <h2>Market Analyst Views U.S. Government's 15% Cut of Chip Sales to China as a Form of Tariff</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 19:16:28 EDT</div>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has characterized the Trump administration's deal with Nvidia and AMD as a novel form of tariff, rather than an unprecedented government intervention in business. Under the agreement, the chipmakers will pay 15% of their China-bound AI chip revenue to the U.S. Treasury in exchange for export licenses. Cramer argued that since the funds go to the Treasury, the policy is functionally similar to other tariffs recently imposed by the administration. He suggested that while the "pay-to-play" aspect is debatable, the deal is ultimately beneficial for both the taxpayers and the companies involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue their partnership with Netflix, signing a new multi-year, first-look deal for their Archewell Productions company. This new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their original 2020 overall deal, which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all their developed content and covered overhead costs. The couple has produced several successful documentary series for the streamer, including "Harry & Meghan" and "With Love, Meghan." The renewed partnership will also support Meghan's new lifestyle brand, "As ever," which was developed in collaboration with Netflix.</p>

          <h2>51-Story Residential Tower Approved for Downtown Los Angeles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 17:54:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story apartment tower in the downtown South Park neighborhood. The project, proposed by a New York-based developer, is planned for a current parking lot and will include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and vehicle parking. However, the developer has not provided a timeline for construction, reflecting a challenging financial climate for new housing projects. High interest rates, rising material costs, and labor uncertainties are significant hurdles for developers, even with high demand for housing in the city.</p>
