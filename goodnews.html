          <p>Shares of rocket and lunar lander manufacturer Firefly Aerospace surged in their Nasdaq debut, opening at $70 per share and valuing the company near $10 billion. The successful initial public offering, which raised $868 million, reflects growing investor interest in the space technology sector. Firefly has secured major contracts with NASA and defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, boasting a backlog of approximately $1.1 billion. The company's recent success includes a NASA-funded lunar landing and strong revenue growth, signaling a hot market for tech and space-related IPOs this year.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have fallen to their lowest average since May, making them an increasingly attractive borrowing option for homeowners. With the average rate now at 8.13%, HELOCs are currently cheaper than alternatives like fixed-rate home equity loans, personal loans, or credit cards. Financial experts suggest that with the Federal Reserve appearing likely to cut rates soon, the variable rates on HELOCs could decrease further, offering more savings. This contrasts with fixed-rate loans, which would not benefit from future market adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has emerged as the leading candidate to become the next Fed chair, according to prediction markets like Kalshi. His odds surged after reports that President Trump's advisors favor his data-driven approach to monetary policy. Waller, a Trump appointee, recently dissented on the Fed's decision to hold rates, arguing the stance was "overly cautious." His perceived dovishness and political independence have made him a popular choice among investors, surpassing previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, whom Trump had recently praised as strong candidates for the top role.

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to clear the way for alternative assets, including private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies, to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. The move marks a significant victory for the alternative asset industry, which has been pushing for access to the trillions of dollars held in defined contribution plans. While proponents argue this will provide more investment options for savers, it also introduces new risks for retirement investors due to the higher fees and volatility associated with these assets.

          <p>Following President Trump's executive order to allow cryptocurrencies in 401(k)s, investors are looking at the best ways to gain exposure to this volatile asset class. Cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as those tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, have seen record inflows this year and offer a convenient way to invest without directly holding the digital assets. These regulated products function like traditional stock ETFs, providing a more accessible entry point for long-term retirement planning. However, investors are cautioned to distinguish between standard ETFs and riskier leveraged products designed for short-term trading. (not investment advice)</p>
