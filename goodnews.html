          <p>George the cat made a daring escape from an animal hospital in Lakeland, Florida, following a neutering procedure. After breaking out of his crate and scaling a fence, George traveled three miles through several subdivisions and around lakes to return home. His owner, Bob Beasock, expressed relief and humor, while a cat behavioral specialist suggested George's return was likely due to a combination of scent, visual markers, and geomagnetism.

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs for potential price increases, urging the company to "eat the tariffs" instead. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon had warned that tariffs on imported goods could lead to higher prices for consumers. Trump insisted that Walmart, which made billions in profits, should absorb the costs to protect customers and support his economic agenda. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company would strive to keep prices low despite the challenges posed by tariffs. The article reflects the tension between the Trump administration's trade policies and the concerns of major American companies about the impact on consumers and supply chains.</p>

          <p>The Menendez brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have garnered a new wave of sympathy and support, largely due to shifting cultural perceptions influenced by TikTok, Netflix, and advocates like Kim Kardashian. Initially portrayed as greedy and entitled, their claims of sexual abuse are now viewed with more understanding, potentially affecting their chances of parole. A Los Angeles judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, and their fate now rests with California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom. The changing public sentiment reflects a greater awareness of trauma and sexual abuse, particularly for male victims, which may impact the brothers' future.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the potential for a new Air Force One, prompted by an offer from Qatar, and reflects on the current aircraft's history and limitations. While journalists typically have limited access to the presidential jet's interior, the article describes the press cabin and amenities. The current Air Force One, a 747-200b in use since 1990, faces increasing maintenance costs and technological obsolescence. President Trump, who has expressed dissatisfaction with the outdated aircraft, is considering the Qatari offer, though converting a foreign 747 for presidential use presents technical and security challenges. The article also touches on the historical significance of Air Force One. </p>
