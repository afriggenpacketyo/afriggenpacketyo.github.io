          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby voiced optimism about the FAA's commitment to overhauling its air traffic control system following recent outages and delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. Kirby highlighted bipartisan support for addressing the issue and the administration's commitment to providing upfront funding for the project. He stressed that safety remains the top priority, with extensive training and backup procedures in place. Kirby acknowledged that outages can cause disruptions but emphasized that the system is deliberately slowed down to prioritize safety. United has proactively reduced flights to create more space at the airport, while the FAA is working with other airlines to do the same.</p>

          <p>A new study by a theoretical physicist suggests that aneural eukaryotic cells could process information up to a billion times faster than typical biochemical processes. The study suggests that quantum processes within biological systems could exceed the computing power of even advanced quantum computers. This concept relies on the discovery of cytoskeleton filaments exhibiting quantum optical features, potentially enabling cells to use quantum signals for rapid information processing. While the ideas require further experimentation, they could revolutionize our understanding of biological computation and the potential of quantum signals in biological systems.</p>
