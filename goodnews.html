        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chipotle's CEO, Scott Boatwright, says that the company has reduced its hiring time by 75% since implementing an AI hiring platform named Ava Cado. Ava Cado, built by Paradox, is designed for chatting with candidates, answering questions about Chipotle, scheduling interviews, and sending offers. The faster hiring process could help Chipotle open more than 300 locations this year. While AI offers upsides like automating administrative tasks, it may also lead to a sour impression if the chatbot can't answer specific questions, and it poses cybersecurity risks.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the rise of the tech right and its support for Donald Trump, arguing that the tech world's left-libertarian leanings have shifted due to factors like the Great Awokening, macroeconomic changes, and liberal opposition to big tech. It suggests that the tech right's bet on Trump's administration to bring about deregulation, tax cuts, and anti-woke policies has largely failed. The author contends that the Democrats should consider which of Trump's voters can be won back as his coalition fractures, with the tech right being a potential target.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for an end to the windfall tax on oil and gas companies and advocated for new drilling licenses in the North Sea. Addressing the Scottish Conservative party conference, Badenoch argued the tax, known as the Energy Profits Levy, should be scrapped before its 2030 expiration. She claimed the Tory party had made a mistake with the tax and that there has been no windfall to tax for months. Opposition politicians criticized Badenoch's comments, while the oil and gas sector says the tax is holding back investment.</p>
