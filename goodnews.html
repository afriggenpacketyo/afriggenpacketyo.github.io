        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has indicated he would support a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un to freeze North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an "interim emergency measure." Lee believes this is a feasible, realistic alternative to immediate denuclearization, considering North Korea's current rate of producing 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually. He aims to reduce tensions and restore trust with the North, suggesting that a resumption of talks between Trump and Kim, who share a degree of mutual trust, could benefit global peace and security. The article highlights Lee's pragmatic approach to foreign policy, balancing relations between the US and China while navigating a polarized domestic political scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the intricate relationship between the birth control pill and women's libido, highlighting a frequently unaddressed side effect. While the pill has revolutionized sexual autonomy, numerous women report experiencing decreased sex drive, vaginal dryness, or emotional fluctuations. Scientific inquiry suggests that the pill may elevate levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which in turn binds to and reduces free testosterone, a key hormone for sexual desire. Nevertheless, the effect is highly individual; some women report no change or even an increase in libido due to the psychological relief from pregnancy concerns. The article stresses the importance of enhanced awareness and open dialogue surrounding women's reproductive health and contraceptive choices.</p>

          <p>Former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg voiced strong criticism regarding the UK government's perceived deference to US President Donald Trump, describing the "endless knee-bending" as "slightly cringey." Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg implored Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to assert British values and openly challenge the Trump administration on matters such as its lukewarm attitude towards NATO. He contended that the government's strategy to court the US president, particularly for a trade deal, is founded on a "miscalculation" that the UK can avoid choosing between its relationships with the US and the EU. Clegg also expressed support for Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey's condemnation of Elon Musk's recent controversial remarks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has officially approved the £2.2 billion privately-financed project to develop a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a move intended to stimulate economic growth. This expansion entails shifting the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters for regular operation, projected to increase annual flights from 280,000 to approximately 389,000 and passenger capacity to 80 million. While the Chancellor lauded the plans for generating thousands of jobs and billions in investment, the initiative faces significant opposition from climate campaigners and the Green Party, who decry it as a "disaster for the climate crisis." Gatwick has committed to implementing stricter noise controls and enhancing public transport usage to mitigate environmental impacts.</p>

          <p>World Athletics President Sebastian Coe has proposed a significant "re-engineering" of the global Olympic sports calendar, citing the growing challenges of climate change after athletes faced extreme heat and humidity in Tokyo. Coe suggests that endurance events, such as marathons, may need to be scheduled separately at different times of the year to ensure athlete safety and performance, noting that 70% of athletes report climate impacts on their training. Beyond climate concerns, the sport aims to boost its global appeal with the introduction of the inaugural Ultimate Championships in Budapest, featuring a $10 million prize fund and serving as a testing ground for new event formats.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing a notable uptick in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), sparking hopes for a broader market rebound after a prolonged period of sluggishness. Recent listings include auto-parts supplier Aumovio and Swiss Marketplace Group, with other firms like Verisure and NOBA also planning significant debuts. This surge is attributed to factors such as low volatility and improved dollar-based returns on European equities, attracting fresh U.S. capital. While Europe still lags behind North American and Asian IPO markets, and some companies still opt for private sales, the renewed activity suggests improving investor confidence and a more favorable environment for public listings.

While Palestine holds non-member observer status at the UN, full membership remains elusive due to US veto power in the Security Council. This article notes that traditionally, many Western states linked recognition to a comprehensive peace agreement, but Israel's ongoing war in Gaza has prompted several, including Ireland, Norway, and Spain, to grant formal recognition.</p>
