          <p>New York Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson was seen in an animated discussion with head coach Aaron Glenn as the team headed into halftime against the Denver Broncos. Wilson, the team's leading receiver, was reportedly frustrated after being targeted only twice in the first half for a single two-yard catch. The incident occurred after a perplexing offensive drive that failed to produce points, highlighting the team's ongoing struggles. The Jets' offense managed only 32 total yards in the first half as they sought their first win of the season.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Allen White, acclaimed for his role in "The Bear," is taking on the challenge of portraying music legend Bruce Springsteen in the upcoming film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere." The movie focuses on the creation of Springsteen's seminal 1982 album, "Nebraska," a period when the artist was reportedly at a personal low despite his rising fame. In an interview, White discussed the process of embodying The Boss, including his vocal training and his conversations with Springsteen about the mental health struggles he faced during that era. White aims to capture the emotional complexity behind the iconic musician.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy shared his concerns about the current state of the nation's highest court, describing some of its opinions as "a little bit too personal and confrontational." Kennedy, who often served as the crucial swing vote on landmark cases involving abortion rights and same-sex marriage, reflected on his career and the importance of civility in public discourse. He worries that a lack of reasoned debate is putting democracy in danger. These reflections are part of his new memoir, "Life, Law & Liberty," which details his journey to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Stylesville Barbershop & Beauty Salon, recognized as one of the oldest Black-owned businesses in Los Angeles, has been honored with a landmark plaque by the city. Opened in 1957 by Freddie and Ollie Carter, the Pacoima establishment served as a vital community hub during an era of heavy segregation in the San Fernando Valley. The ceremony celebrated the Carter family's decades of service and the shop's role in the post-World War II development of the local African American community. Now run by the founders' grandson, Stylesville stands as a symbol of Black preservation and enduring community presence.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has confirmed that Hamas is holding 20 living hostages who are expected to be released within the next 24 hours. This development comes as President Donald Trump prepares to travel to the Middle East to mark the occasion. Vance described the anticipated release as a "great moment" for the country and the world, crediting the administration's diplomats for brokering the deal. In conjunction with the release, the U.S. is establishing a coordination center in Israel with around 200 troops to monitor the ceasefire agreement, though officials reiterate no U.S. troops will enter Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds AI-Generated 'Workslop' Is Hindering Productivity in U.S. Workplaces</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 10:00:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Harvard Business Review reveals that over 40% of U.S. employees are receiving AI-generated content that appears competent but lacks real substance, a phenomenon termed "workslop." This low-quality output is reportedly damaging productivity by creating more work for colleagues who must revise or redo the tasks. The article argues that the blame for this trend lies not with the technology itself, but with employers who fail to provide proper training, policies, and a clear strategy for AI implementation. Without sufficient investment in people and processes, AI tools can produce counterproductive results.</p>

          <p>Director Kathryn Bigelow's latest thriller, "A House of Dynamite," presents a tense, realistic depiction of the U.S. government's response to an inbound nuclear missile. The film follows the president's impossible decision-making process with only 19 minutes to impact. To ensure authenticity, Bigelow consulted with military experts, including a retired general who once commanded a missile defense facility. The film aims to remind audiences that despite the end of the Cold War, the threat of nuclear conflict remains a terrifying reality, raising questions about the systems and human judgment upon which global security depends.</p>

          <p>A feature article examines why the United States has such a rich history of invention, from Thomas Edison's light bulb to the internet. The piece credits a unique combination of factors, including a pioneering spirit inherited from immigrants, a financial ecosystem that supports risk-taking through venture capital, and a culture that glamorizes successful entrepreneurs. Experts and investors from the show "Shark Tank" note that America's tolerance for failure, where it is seen as a learning experience rather than a mark of shame, is crucial. This environment continues to foster groundbreaking ideas and technological advancements.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's controversial views on transgender issues. The writer suggests that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that the books' core message of rejecting supremacy and discrimination resonates with many, even if the author's current stance does not. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article advocates for critically interrogating the works in a community setting. This approach allows fans to acknowledge the positive aspects of the stories while actively grappling with their flaws and the author's harmful rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister, John Swinney, has asserted that the "precedent is on my side" to secure a second independence referendum if his Scottish National Party (SNP) wins a majority in the next Holyrood election. He referenced the SNP's 2011 majority victory, which led to the 2014 referendum, as the established basis for demanding another vote. This strategy, backed by SNP delegates, sets up a potential constitutional clash with the UK Labour government, which has stated it does not support another referendum. Swinney argues that independence is the best path to improve living standards for Scots.</p>
