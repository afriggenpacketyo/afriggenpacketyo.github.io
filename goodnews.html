          <p>A large, bright meteor, described as a fireball, was observed streaking across the sky in the southeastern United States. According to NASA, the object, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, traveled at 30,000 miles per hour before exploding over Georgia. The explosion released energy equivalent to 20 tons of TNT, creating a powerful pressure wave that resulted in audible booms heard by residents on the ground. This rare daylight event may be linked to the Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a neighborhood suffering from the urban heat island effect, a local environmental group is testing innovative cooling solutions. The "cool block" project involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with lighter, heat-reflective colors, and painting rooftops white. These measures aim to combat dangerously high temperatures, which can be up to 20 degrees hotter in dense urban areas compared to greener ones. This urban laboratory provides a potential model for other cities to adapt to the increasing threat of extreme heat waves driven by climate change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated that the 90-day pause on implementing new reciprocal tariffs, which is set to expire in early July, could be extended. A White House spokesperson stated the deadline is not critical and that an extension is possible if key trading partners, including Japan, continue to negotiate in good faith. This development comes as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks to secure concessions on the proposed duties. The pause affects about 60 trading partners with significant trade surpluses with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jos√© Adolfo Mac√≠as Villamar, the fugitive drug trafficker known as 'Fito', has been recaptured in Manta, Ecuador, more than a year after his escape from prison. Mac√≠as, leader of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was serving a 34-year sentence for drug trafficking and is also wanted in the U.S. on cocaine importation charges. His escape in early 2024 triggered a wave of violence across Ecuador, leading the government to declare war on criminal gangs. His recapture is a significant victory for President Daniel Noboa's administration in its fight against organized crime.</p>

          <p>Nike announced that while its fourth-quarter profits were significantly hit by its ongoing turnaround plan, it expects the financial headwinds to ease going forward. The sneaker giant's profits fell 86% as it cleared out old inventory and shifted its sales strategy, but it still beat Wall Street's lowered expectations. However, the company faces a new challenge from tariffs, which it estimates will add an incremental cost of $1 billion in the current fiscal year. Nike plans to mitigate this cost over time through supply chain adjustments and price increases. (not investment advice)</p>
