          <p>Following the release of the final living hostages held in Gaza for two years, former U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset, declaring the moment as the 'historic dawn of a new Middle East.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lauded Trump's 'indispensable' and 'unremitting' help in securing the hostages' freedom and ending the war. The address was attended by Trump's family and U.S. officials, with many in the audience wearing hats celebrating Trump as a 'Peace President.' This event marks a significant diplomatic development, concluding a prolonged and painful chapter of the conflict.</p>

          <p>According to England pace bowler Brydon Carse, key players Ben Stokes and Mark Wood are nearing full fitness and will be 'raring to go' for the upcoming Ashes cricket series against Australia. Captain Stokes has been recovering from a shoulder injury, while fast bowler Wood has been sidelined with elbow and knee issues. Their return is a significant boost for England, especially as Australia's captain Pat Cummins is considered a doubt for the first Test due to a back injury. The durability of each team's pace bowling attack is expected to be a decisive factor in the five-Test series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by researchers from the University of Surrey suggests an unexpected interaction between the two main forms of vitamin D. The study, which reviewed 11 randomized controlled trials, found that taking vitamin D2 supplements could lead to decreased levels of vitamin D3, the form naturally produced by the body from sunlight. This finding is significant as previous research has indicated that vitamin D3 is more effective in boosting the immune system. The researchers concluded that vitamin D3 supplements may be more beneficial for most people, though further studies are needed to confirm these effects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Chen Li, an economist at Soochow Securities, the Chinese stock market is maintaining its course despite renewed threats of tariffs from the Trump administration. Speaking at a strategy meeting, Chen argued that the foundation of the current global bull market is a weakening U.S. dollar, a factor that persists alongside concerns over American fiscal policy and political instability. He suggested that while trade tensions can trigger market corrections, they are unlikely to have a major long-term impact. Chen noted that investors have grown accustomed to tariff threats and are becoming 'immune' to their immediate effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With Hamas having released all living hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the first phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan for Gaza is complete. The agreement, which includes an Israeli troop withdrawal to a line controlling 53% of Gaza, now moves into a complex negotiation phase. Key future steps involve the complete demilitarization of Gaza and the establishment of a temporary transitional government of Palestinian technocrats, eventually to be replaced by a reformed Palestinian Authority. Significant sticking points remain, including Hamas's refusal to disarm and disagreements over the extent of Israel's final withdrawal from the territory.</p>

          <p>U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has publicly acknowledged the 'incredible input and tireless efforts' of the UK's National Security Adviser, Jonathan Powell, in securing the Gaza ceasefire. This praise contrasts sharply with comments from the U.S. ambassador in Israel, who dismissed the UK's contribution. Witkoff's statement highlights the close, near-daily contact between him and Powell, whose experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland is seen as valuable for future talks. The public recognition serves as a political boost for Powell amid domestic pressures.</p>

          <p>The National League Championship Series features a classic David vs. Goliath narrative, pitting the small-market Milwaukee Brewers against the defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers. Brewers manager Pat Murphy has playfully leaned into this storyline, contrasting his 'Average Joes' with the Dodgers' star-studded, high-payroll roster. However, the Brewers earned home-field advantage by having the best record in the major leagues, including sweeping the season series against the Dodgers. While oddsmakers heavily favor Los Angeles, the Brewers have consistently defied expectations and proven their ability to compete with baseball's elite teams.</p>

          <p>As the last living Israeli hostages are freed after two years, this article reflects on the profound psychological torment and resilience required to survive such an ordeal. Drawing on the account of Eli Sharabi, a hostage released earlier, it details the horrific conditions in Gaza's tunnels, including malnutrition, isolation, and psychological torture. The piece highlights how hostages, even those who knew their families had been murdered, found the will to live by focusing on a purpose, quoting Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl's maxim: 'He who has a why can bear any how.' Their survival is presented as a powerful example of existential heroism.</p>

          <p>The recent suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel by ABC's parent company, Disney, and the subsequent public backlash that led to his reinstatement, has sparked a debate about the genre's cultural relevance. The suspension, which followed comments Kimmel made about MAGA supporters, was seen by many as a response to government pressure. The strong reaction from the public, celebrities, and even political figures demonstrated that late-night hosts still hold a significant place in the national conversation. Kimmel's emotional return episode drew massive viewership, suggesting that in an era of political polarization, these hosts serve as crucial voices.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa forward Ollie Watkins will miss England's upcoming World Cup qualifier against Latvia after sustaining an injury during the team's recent 3-0 victory over Wales. Watkins, who scored England's second goal, collided with the goalpost in the first half and was substituted at halftime. Although manager Thomas Tuchel initially stated the striker was 'OK,' Watkins has since returned to his club for treatment and will not travel with the squad to Riga. His absence creates an opening for other forwards, with Anthony Gordon or Marcus Rashford considered potential replacements in the central striker role.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to economists Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt for their foundational work explaining how innovation drives long-term economic growth. Their research, which combines economic history, theoretical models, and empirical analysis, has reshaped the understanding of technological progress and prosperity. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences highlighted their contributions to quantifying the concept of 'creative destruction,' where new innovations replace older technologies. The laureates' work underscores that sustained growth is not guaranteed and requires an environment that fosters continuous innovation.</p>
