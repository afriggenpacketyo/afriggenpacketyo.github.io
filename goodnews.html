          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, is set to visit Italy and Switzerland this week to participate in high-level diplomatic meetings. According to the foreign ministry, he will attend the 12th joint meeting of the China-Italy government committee, a forum for bilateral cooperation. Following this, Wang will travel to Switzerland for the fourth round of the China-Switzerland strategic dialogue between foreign ministers. The trip occurs shortly after the Italian government extended an olive branch to the state-backed Chinese conglomerate Sinochem International Corp, the primary shareholder in the Italian tire manufacturer Pirelli, signaling ongoing complex economic ties between the nations.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the December ouster of former leader Bashar Assad, though the process is not a direct popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210-seat People's Assembly will be chosen by electoral colleges in various districts, with the remaining third appointed by the interim president. The interim authorities cited the impossibility of creating an accurate voter registry due to mass displacement from the civil war as the reason for this system. While the process has drawn criticism, the results are being watched as an indicator of the new government's commitment to inclusivity for women and minorities.</p>

          <p>Ethan Mbappe, the 18-year-old brother of superstar Kylian Mbappe, is aiming to establish his own identity in professional football after moving to Lille. Both brothers left Paris St-Germain last summer, with Kylian revealing that PSG's decision not to renew Ethan's contract influenced his own departure for Real Madrid. Praised for his football intelligence and calm demeanor as a midfielder, Ethan made his PSG debut at 16 but is now seeking more regular opportunities. He recently scored his first goal for Lille and is set to face his former club, providing a chance to step out of his famous brother's considerable shadow.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, marked by modernized facilities and on-field success, including a Carabao Cup victory and Champions League qualifications. However, the club's growth has been more gradual than some expected, constrained by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules, which limit financial losses. This has prevented the ownership from simply buying its way to the top, forcing a more strategic approach to player development and signings. The club has also grown substantially off the field, with revenue projected to rise and staff numbers more than doubling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is shifting its public diplomacy strategy in Africa by leveraging social media influencers and content creators to connect with younger audiences. In a new campaign, the Chinese embassy in Kenya is sponsoring popular local influencers to tour China and create content showcasing its culture, scenery, and cuisine. This move is seen by observers as a significant refinement of Beijing's "soft power" efforts, moving away from traditional state-led media toward a more direct and relatable engagement. The strategy aims to reshape China's image by highlighting cultural exchange and tourism, presenting a side of the country not typically seen in news coverage.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir "Truly," music legend Lionel Richie reveals he was on a path to become an Episcopal priest before his career in music took off. The 76-year-old icon explained that as a shy young man, he considered the clergy a viable life path and was actively training for it. The pivotal moment of change came during a performance with his college band, The Commodores, when a woman in the audience shouted, "Sing it, baby!" That simple encouragement from a fan gave him the validation he needed to abandon his clerical training and fully commit to pursuing music.</p>

          <p>The German government has unveiled a "Modernization Agenda" aimed at integrating artificial intelligence into public administration to enhance efficiency and services. The plans include using AI to streamline bureaucracy, expedite visa processing, and create online platforms for businesses, with a goal of reducing bureaucratic costs by 25% by 2029. While officials tout AI as a key to future growth, some experts express concern about potential dependencies on American tech companies like OpenAI. They advocate for a science-guided approach focused on process optimization rather than just generative AI, ensuring Germany builds its own sovereign capabilities.</p>
