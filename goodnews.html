          <h2>Democratic Socialist Candidates Gain Traction in US Municipal Races</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani's recent mayoral primary victory in New York City has brought attention to other democratic socialist candidates gaining traction within the Democratic Party. Minnesota state Senator Omar Fateh, running for mayor of Minneapolis, and Detroit City Council candidate Denzel McCampbell are examples, advocating for policies like increased minimum wage, affordable housing, and public safety reform. Republicans are actively using these candidates' far-left proposals to define the Democratic Party, aiming to link them to vulnerable incumbents in upcoming elections. This trend reflects a significant ideological shift and ongoing internal debate within the Democratic Party regarding its future policy direction and public image.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Diagnosed with Chronic Venous Insufficiency</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and generally benign condition affecting leg veins. The White House physician, Captain Sean Barbabella, explained that the condition causes blood to pool in the lower limbs due to weakening valves, leading to swelling, which Trump had observed. While it can cause discomfort, heaviness, and in some cases, leg ulcers, medical experts confirm it is not typically serious and is common in older individuals. The diagnosis followed a comprehensive examination, which found no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, and confirmed "normal cardiac structure and function," asserting the President "remains in excellent health."</p>

          <h2>Manchester United Agrees £65M Deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 08:01:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United has reached an agreement with Brentford to acquire Bryan Mbeumo for an initial £65 million, a fee that could increase to £70 million with performance-based add-ons. The 25-year-old Cameroon international winger is expected to undergo a medical examination imminently, ahead of Manchester United's pre-season tour in the United States. This significant acquisition marks Mbeumo as United's third summer signing, following the arrivals of forward Matheus Cunha and left-back Diego Leon. The move aims to strengthen United's attacking options with a versatile player who can operate as a central striker or winger, bringing proven Premier League quality and a strong work ethic to the squad.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions are overwhelmingly favored to win their Test series against Australia, with bookmakers and polls predicting a dominant performance. The Wallabies are seen as undercooked, missing key players, and having played only one game since last November. Despite the Lions' strength and the Wallabies' apparent shortcomings, some, including assistant coach Jon Fisher, believe Australia's focus on controlling ruck speed and applying defensive pressure could pose a challenge. Lions coach Andy Farrell emphasizes the need for his team to maintain authority and react well under pressure. The rugby world anticipates a comfortable Lions victory, but a competitive series would elevate their triumph.</p>

          <p>Chevron has emerged victorious against Exxon Mobil in a significant arbitration dispute concerning Hess Corporation's valuable offshore oil assets in Guyana. Exxon CEO Darren Woods confirmed the International Chamber of Commerce's ruling in favor of Chevron, which now clears the path for Chevron to finalize its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation. Exxon and China National Offshore Oil Corporation had previously filed an arbitration case, asserting a right of first refusal over Hess's 30% stake in the lucrative Stabroek Block. Despite Exxon's stated disagreement with the ICC panel's interpretation, they expressed respect for the dispute resolution process, leading to a notable rise in Chevron's shares.

          <p>China's Minister of Commerce, Wang Wentao, has announced a strategic commitment to boost domestic service consumption over the next five years, aiming to reduce bureaucracy and attract foreign investment. This initiative is designed to solidify domestic demand as a stable driver of economic growth, particularly in the context of an ongoing trade war with the United States. Wang acknowledged a prevailing "shortage of high-quality service on the supply side," despite the faster growth rate of service consumption compared to goods. The government plans to implement measures from 2026 to 2030, focusing on sectors like healthcare and elderly care, to enrich service supply and ease restrictive regulations.

          <p>Public opinion on immigration in the US is showing a significant positive shift, reversing a years-long trend of restrictionism, despite President Trump's aggressive anti-immigrant agenda. Data indicates a sharp decline in Americans wanting less immigration, with a record 79% now viewing immigration as a "good thing." This "thermostatic" reaction suggests the public is souring on the extreme aspects of Trump's approach, such as asylum suspensions and increased ICE raids, even as he achieves his campaign promises of lower border crossings. While some support for border wall construction remains, overall disapproval of his handling of immigration is growing.</p>

          <p>Shares of Swedish defense company Saab jumped over 12% after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits and sales growth. Operating income surged 49% year-on-year, and sales rose 30%, leading the company to raise its 2025 organic sales growth outlook. Saab CEO Micael Johansson noted "really high" activity in the European defense market, benefiting from a broad regional push to increase security budgets. This trend is partly spurred by US President Donald Trump's calls for Europe to take greater ownership of its security. Despite a strong quarter, some analysts maintain a "Sell" rating, citing valuation models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Family offices and businesses are strongly advised to establish clear expectations and transparent policies when integrating family members onto their payroll, aiming to protect financial stability and reduce high employee turnover. Joshua Gentine, founder of Bench Consulting, highlights the critical need for objective performance goals, comprehensive development plans, and the involvement of outside experts to navigate challenging personnel decisions. This structured approach helps ensure accountability and mitigates potential issues such as discomfort in decision-making among heirs or feelings of having been given, rather than earned, a position. By upholding professional standards, family enterprises can cultivate a more equitable and competitive environment for both family and non-family employees. (not investment advice)</p>

Dubois, who previously lost to Usyk in a controversial ninth-round stoppage, has since rebuilt his career with three consecutive victories, including a knockout win against Anthony Joshua. His team believes a low blow call in the first fight was unjust and plans to target Usyk's body. Dubois' confidence and maturity have grown, and he aims to "bring chaos" and "seize the moment" in front of a home crowd, hoping to become the first Briton to unify the four-belt heavyweight division on home soil.</p>
