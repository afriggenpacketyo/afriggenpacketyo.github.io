          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has officially announced it is expanding its strategic business review and is now open to a potential sale, a move that caused its shares to jump 8% in premarket trading. This development follows earlier plans to split the company into separate streaming/studios and global networks businesses, and comes amid unsolicited takeover interest from multiple parties, including the newly merged Paramount Skydance. CEO David Zaslav framed the decision as a response to market recognition of the company's portfolio value, stating the comprehensive review will identify the best path forward to maximize asset value for shareholders.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a savings vehicle that can offer returns outpacing the inflation rate. The article provides a snapshot of national average CD yields for various terms as of October 2025, noting that online banks typically offer more competitive rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead. Currently, short-term CDs, such as those with six-month to one-year terms, are yielding higher rates than longer-term options, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. Financial experts suggest strategies like CD laddering to capitalize on high short-term rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) offer a more affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards in the current high-rate environment. As of October 20, 2025, the average interest rate for a 10-year home equity loan is 8.28%, while the average HELOC rate is 7.84%. Home equity loans provide a lump sum with a fixed rate, whereas HELOCs offer a variable-rate revolving line of credit. Both options use the home as collateral, posing a risk of foreclosure if payments are missed, but they also offer potential tax benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK court has dismissed an appeal from Gavin Plumb, a security guard sentenced to life in prison for plotting to kidnap, sexually assault, and murder television presenter Holly Willoughby. Plumb was convicted after an undercover US police officer infiltrated an online group where he detailed his plans, leading to his arrest in October 2023. Authorities found a "kidnap kit" in his flat, and judges ruled that he intended harm "of the gravest and highest possible kind." The court affirmed that his sentence, with a minimum term of 16 years, was appropriate for the crime.</p>

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, where overfishing has devastated coral reefs and the livelihoods of coastal communities, a novel conservation project is underway. Instead of restricting fishing, a small organization is building new artificial reefs from limestone to create more fish habitats, aiming to restore the fishery and improve food security. This approach seeks to address the root cause of the problem—poverty—by boosting the fish population that locals depend on for survival. The project is part of a large-scale study linking ecosystem restoration directly to improvements in human health and nutrition in one of the world's poorest nations.</p>

          <p>As a traditional safe-haven asset, gold remains an attractive commodity for investors, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty and inflation.

The article outlines several key factors that influence its price, including basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Additionally, currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks, which hold significant gold reserves, play a crucial role in determining its market value.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors raised its full-year financial forecast after reporting third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to soar. The automaker now projects adjusted earnings between $12 billion and $13 billion, up from a previous estimate, and also lowered the anticipated financial impact from tariffs. The strong performance was driven by gains in its China and international operations, which helped offset a decline in North American profit margins. Despite the positive results, GM took a $1.6 billion charge related to scaling back its EV plans, acknowledging that profitability in the electric vehicle sector will likely take longer than anticipated.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a plan to boost business growth by cutting administrative red tape, which she claims will save firms nearly £6 billion annually. The proposed reforms include simplifying the company merger process and removing requirements for small businesses to submit lengthy reports to Companies House. Speaking at an investment summit, Reeves acknowledged the economy was not working for everyone and framed the measures as a way to make the UK a more attractive destination for global capital. Business groups welcomed the plan, but some expressed skepticism, urging the chancellor to avoid raising taxes for employers in the upcoming budget.</p>
