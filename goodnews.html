          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake was reported in the New York City metropolitan area on Saturday night. The U.S. Geological Survey identified the epicenter as being near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, at a depth of approximately 10 kilometers. While no significant damage was reported, residents in parts of the area experienced brief shaking from the seismic event. The occurrence was unexpected for the region, which does not typically experience notable earthquake activity, causing some surprise among the local population.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a U.S. Marine veteran, was released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. She was arrested in May during what she believed was a routine green card application meeting, leaving behind her husband and two young children, one of whom was an infant she was still breastfeeding. Her detention stemmed from a years-old, missed immigration hearing she was unaware of, which had been scheduled for her and her estranged mother. Her release, on a recognizance bond, follows advocacy from her husband and the office of Senator John Kennedy.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and several other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving the purchase of military drones. The scheme allegedly involved signing state contracts with suppliers at prices inflated by as much as 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, especially during wartime. The arrests follow the recent restoration of independence for the country's anti-corruption bodies, a key demand from both Ukrainian citizens and EU allies as the nation pursues European Union membership.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how immigration agents can conduct "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirms that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone and cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The case stemmed from controversial raids by the Trump administration that advocates argued were unconstitutional and based on racial profiling. The court found that such broad factors do not meet the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>

          <p>Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is launching a new left-wing political party with MP Zarah Sultana, but it currently lacks a crucial element: a name. The founders have invited their more than 600,000 registered supporters to help choose a title that reflects the party's values. Until a name is selected and registered with the Electoral Commission, the new entity cannot field candidates in elections. The process highlights the importance of branding in modern politics, where a name must effectively convey a party's essence and resonate with voters in a crowded digital landscape.</p>

The article suggests that James, accustomed to being the focal point of any team he plays for, must now navigate a transition. The team's management has expressed respect for James' timeline while making it clear Dončić is the new headliner.</p>

          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather from cancer at age 54 was a key catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Hill explained that his stepfather's inability to enjoy retirement made him re-evaluate his own life path. The 60-year-old, who had qualified as a doctor, felt unsuited for the profession, recalling an instance of breaking bad news to a patient's family where he felt "completely out of my depth." This pivotal moment set him on a new, and ultimately successful, path in entertainment.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more "careful" with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts with China's vigorous embrace of open-source AI, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced models. According to Stanford adjunct professor Andrew Ng, China's competitive open-source ecosystem may be a path for it to surpass the U.S. in AI development. Meta's potential pivot reflects the complex strategic and competitive landscape of global AI innovation.</p>

          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia to the UK in 1943. The animal, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during World War II, but it perished just days before arrival. While long-standing rumors blamed the trauma of a nearby German U-boat attack, new analysis of the attendant's logbook suggests a different cause. Records of water and air temperatures show the ship crossed the equator in conditions far too hot for the creature, leading researchers to conclude it likely died from heat stress.</p>
