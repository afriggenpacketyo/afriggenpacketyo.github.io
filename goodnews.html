          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, some up to ¬£1,000, and potential debt write-offs due to the scandal involving forced prepayment meter installations. Energy companies will disburse over ¬£70 million in compensation and financial support following a review by Ofgem, the energy regulator, which found that suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent after they fell behind on bills. The payouts will range from ¬£40 to ¬£500 based on the supplier's handling of the situation, with ¬£1,000 payments for inappropriate installations; customers do not need to take any action as compensation will be directly deposited into their accounts. A new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions for involuntary prepayment meter installations. </p>

Discussions between Zelenskyy and Merz are expected to center on continued military assistance, particularly Germany's Taurus missile system, which Zelenskyy is keen to acquire.

Pimblett has a history with Topuria, and a potential bout between them would be highly anticipated. Gaethje, known for his exciting fighting style, is also a popular choice, while Pimblett dismisses a potential match with Arman Tsarukyan due to lack of fan interest.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the multinational auto conglomerate, has appointed Antonio Filosa, the current North American chief operating officer, as its new chief executive. This decision concludes a search that started after Carlos Tavares unexpectedly resigned in December. Filosa, a 25-year veteran of the company, will assume his new role on June 23, with an extraordinary shareholder meeting scheduled for his election to the board. Stellantis recently reported a decline in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties related to U.S. trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Puffin numbers on Skomer Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, have reached a record high of 43,626, despite global populations declining rapidly. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) attributes the increase to an abundance of food and a lack of predators on the island. Skomer's isolation protects it from predators and human impact, contributing to its success as a seabird haven. While the puffins are thriving locally, they remain a species under threat globally due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change.</p>
