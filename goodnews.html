          <h2>On-Time Debt Payments May Not Guarantee Credit Score Improvement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 11:42:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While making on-time debt payments is crucial for maintaining good credit, experts caution that it isn't the only factor determining your credit score. Not all bill payments are factored into credit scores, as payments like rent-to-own, utilities, or private school tuition may not be reported to credit bureaus. Additionally, while some Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) providers report loans, this is not a universal practice, and missed BNPL payments can negatively impact your score. To fully understand your credit standing, it's essential to review your credit report regularly to see which payments are influencing your score (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The remains of Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Charles W. McCook, who died in a WWII plane crash in 1943, have been identified 82 years after the incident. McCook was credited with saving the life of a fellow airman by maneuvering the damaged plane to allow him to parachute out before the crash. His remains were recovered from a common grave in Burma and identified through dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis. McCook will be buried in his hometown in August 2025, and a rosette will be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing.</p>

          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate, including employee and company contributions, reached a record high of 14.3% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Fidelity's analysis. Employees deferred 9.5% into 401(k) plans, while companies contributed 4.8%, bringing the combined rate closer to the recommended 15% savings target. A significant portion of the increased employee deferrals came from auto-escalations, which automatically boost savings rates. While 15% is a general guideline, the exact savings percentage should be tailored to individual circumstances (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive planet orbiting a small red dwarf star, a pairing that challenges existing theories of planet formation. The planet, named TOI-6894b, is a gas giant with a slightly larger radius than Saturn but only half its mass, orbiting its star in just over three days. This discovery raises questions about how such a small star could host such a large planet, prompting scientists to reconsider current models. The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to observe the planet, which could reveal more about its atmospheric composition.</p>
