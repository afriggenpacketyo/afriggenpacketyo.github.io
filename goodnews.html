          <p>The Wimbledon men's final will feature a compelling matchup between the world's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, renewing a rivalry that is defining modern tennis. This final comes just weeks after their classic five-set match at the French Open, which Alcaraz won. The two young stars have dominated the sport, winning the last six Grand Slam titles between them. While both players acknowledge their rivalry is still developing, it is seen as a successor to the legendary duels of Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic, bringing a new energy to the sport's biggest stages.</p>

          <p>British boxer Hamzah Sheeraz announced his arrival in the super middleweight division with a decisive fifth-round technical knockout of Edgar Berlanga in Queens, New York. Sheeraz, 26, dominated the fight, dropping Berlanga twice in the fourth round before the referee stopped the contest early in the fifth. The victory, which took place at a unique boxing event hosted at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, elevates Sheeraz from a prospect to a serious contender. This performance positions him for potential high-profile matches against top fighters like Canelo Álvarez or David Benavidez.</p>

          <p>Bronny James showcased his potential during a Los Angeles Lakers NBA Summer League game, scoring 14 points in a 94-81 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. His father, LeBron James, was seated courtside and actively offered advice and encouragement throughout the game, at one point audibly instructing his son to be more aggressive in driving to the basket. The younger James responded with solid play on both offense and defense, demonstrating his ability to handle the ball in crucial moments. The performance highlighted the unique dynamic of a top draft pick playing under the watchful eye of his legendary father.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures reaching highs of 33.1°C in England and setting new 2025 records in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for southern and eastern England, warning of potential health risks, particularly for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The heat has prompted hosepipe bans in several regions and raised wildfire risks. The Met Office forecasts that the heatwave will break on Monday, bringing cooler temperatures and much-needed rain to many parts of the country.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase Tibet's Dry-Season River Flow to India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to fears that China's dam construction on the Tibetan plateau could cause droughts in India, a new scientific study suggests the opposite may be true. By analyzing data from two existing dams, researchers found that river flows downstream during the dry season have actually increased, with low flows in February rising by over 50%. The study indicates that these dams help regulate water flow, storing excess water during wet seasons and releasing it during dry periods. This research provides new context for the debate over China's planned mega-dam, suggesting it might alleviate rather than create water scarcity issues for downstream nations.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a vital hub for China's rapidly growing commercial space industry, which is projected to be part of a $1.8 trillion global space economy by 2035. The article highlights the surge in private investment in China's aerospace sector, supported by technological advancements and government policy. With its status as an international financial center, strong legal framework, and access to global talent, Hong Kong can provide the capital and services needed for mainland space-tech companies to expand. This synergy could represent a significant new engine for Hong Kong's economic growth.</p>

          <p>Several start-ups are on the verge of bringing lab-grown cheese, made using precision fermentation to produce milk proteins without cows, to the market. Companies like UK-based Better Dairy are creating products they claim taste like traditional cheese, potentially offering a higher-quality alternative to current plant-based options. However, they face significant hurdles, including a recent decline in plant-based food sales, consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods, and high initial production costs. Proponents argue their products are healthier and more sustainable, but success will depend on achieving taste parity and price competitiveness with conventional dairy.</p>
