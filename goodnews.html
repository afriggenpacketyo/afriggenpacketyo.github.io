          <p>Robinhood's stock surpassed the $100 mark for the first time, achieving a new all-time high and marking a more than 30% increase since it was passed over for inclusion in the S&P 500. This surge follows the company's ambitious expansion into Europe, where it plans to offer thousands of tokenized stocks and ETFs on a proprietary blockchain built with Ethereum technology. The company aims to merge crypto technology with traditional financial services, demonstrating its vision by launching tokenized shares of private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX for European users.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer noted that Capital One's stock is on track for its tenth consecutive winning session, viewing its past lower valuation as unjustified. He suggested that weaker-than-expected private payroll data from ADP strengthens the case for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, though he advised caution until the official government jobs report is released. Cramer also highlighted the potential for Capital One to leverage its Discover acquisition to significantly expand its market share and rival major competitors in the financial services industry.

Under the deal, the U.S. will impose a 20% tariff on goods from Vietnam and a 40% tariff on products that are transshipped through the country to avoid other duties. In return, the president stated that Vietnam has agreed to open its market to American products with a zero-tariff rate, though Vietnam has not yet publicly confirmed the details.</p>

These creators use AI-powered virtual avatars to host gaming streams and other content, with AI handling tasks from video production to voice dubbing. While this trend represents a lucrative new frontier in the creator economy, it also fuels concerns about the proliferation of low-quality, mass-produced "AI slop" flooding social media platforms and devaluing human-made content.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to begin cutting interest rates later this year, opening a certificate of deposit (CD) now presents a valuable opportunity for savers. By depositing money into a CD, individuals can lock in the current high interest rates for a fixed term, protecting their earnings from future rate declines. This strategy offers predictable returns and provides a stable holding pattern for savings while navigating an uncertain economic landscape, making it a compelling option for those with significant cash reserves.

          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, has proposed creating a network of municipally owned, non-profit grocery stores to address the city's high food costs. The plan, which would establish one store in each borough, aims to sell food at wholesale prices by using city funds to cover operating costs. While the idea has significant public support, it is a large-scale experiment with little precedent in major American cities, and its potential effectiveness in combating food insecurity and high prices remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Researchers have successfully sequenced the first whole genome from an Old Kingdom Egyptian, providing a rare glimpse into life over 4,500 years ago. The DNA, extracted from the tooth of a man buried in a ceramic pot, revealed he had ancestry from both North Africa and the Fertile Crescent. Skeletal analysis indicated a life of strenuous labor consistent with being a potter, including arthritis in his foot from using a pottery wheel, yet his higher-class burial suggests he may have achieved a notable social status.</p>

          <p>The European Union has officially proposed its 2040 climate target, aiming for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels. To overcome resistance from some member states, the plan includes new flexibilities, such as allowing countries to use international carbon credits for up to 3% of their emissions cuts. This compromise comes as Europe faces both an intense heatwave and growing political pushback against its green agenda, making the final approval of the ambitious target a complex challenge.</p>
