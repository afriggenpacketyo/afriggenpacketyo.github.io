          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project on the Suffolk coastline, which is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a landmark decision that will kickstart economic growth. However, critics like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C, condemned the announcement, fearing it will add to consumer bills and the government will come to regret the decision. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said nuclear energy would deliver a golden age of clean energy abundance and help boost the UK's energy security.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric car companies like BYD are expanding into global markets, offering cheaper alternatives and posing a challenge to established manufacturers. This expansion is fueled by government funding and advanced manufacturing capabilities, leading to concerns about potential security risks and economic competition. While consumers benefit from more affordable options, experts warn of potential spyware and hacking vulnerabilities in internet-enabled vehicles. The US and EU have responded with tariffs, but the UK has not taken similar action, raising questions about the balance between economic opportunity and national security.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC suggests investors should wait before buying Circle Internet stock, a stablecoin issuer, as it is currently "too hot" after its recent market debut. While acknowledging Circle Internet as a solid company with a more transparent stablecoin business compared to Tether, Cramer believes the stock's valuation has swelled dramatically in a short period. He advises patience, suggesting a better buying opportunity will arise due to the volatility of the crypto ecosystem. Cramer also cautioned about the IPO market becoming too enthusiastic, referencing the high valuation of CoreWeave as an example. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and several CEOs are promoting savings plans for newborns, with Dell Technologies pledging $1,000 for "Trump accounts" for new children of its employees. The savings program, part of a Republican-backed budget bill, would seed index fund accounts with government funds for U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028. The accounts would allow for additional private contributions and could be used for expenses like college or a down payment on a home. The initiative aims to provide a financial head start for American children.</p>
