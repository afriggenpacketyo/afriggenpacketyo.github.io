          <p>PepsiCo reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to strong growth in its international markets. However, the company continues to face challenges in North America, where sales volumes for both its food and beverage segments declined amid softer consumer demand. The report comes as PepsiCo faces pressure from an activist investor to implement changes, including cost-cutting measures and a potential refranchising of its bottling network.

          <p>Scientists from BGI Research have identified the "master sex-determining gene" in the central bearded dragon, a lizard whose sex is influenced by both genetics and incubation temperature. For this species, male embryos incubated at 32°C or higher can develop into females, a phenomenon known as sex reversal. By sequencing a near-complete genome of the lizard, researchers were able to pinpoint the specific gene responsible for this unique biological process, advancing understanding of temperature-dependent sex determination.</p>
