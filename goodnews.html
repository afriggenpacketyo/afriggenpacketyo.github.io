          <p>Prince Harry made a surprise visit to Kyiv, Ukraine, at the invitation of Superhumans, an organization aiding Ukrainians with war-related injuries. The Duke of Sussex expressed his commitment to assisting in the recovery of injured military personnel and aims to outline new rehabilitation plans during his visit. This trip follows Archewell's donation of $500,000 to projects supporting injured children from Ukraine and Gaza, and a previous visit to a Superhumans center in Lviv. Other members of the Royal Family have also shown support for Ukraine, with King Charles welcoming President Zelensky and Prince William meeting Ukrainian refugees. This visit underscores ongoing efforts to humanize the war's impact and aid those affected. Optimism surrounds Harry's visit in the hopes that he can raise awareness. The Invictus Games Foundation also accompanied him to Ukraine. </p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced it is ready for mass production of its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM4) chips, positioning itself ahead of competitors like Samsung and Micron. HBM is a type of memory used in AI computing chipsets, including those from Nvidia, a major client of SK Hynix. The company's HBM4 chips have doubled bandwidth and increased power efficiency by 40% compared to the previous generation. These chips are expected to be crucial for Nvidia's next-generation Rubin architecture, an AI chip for data centers. SK Hynix's shares surged following the announcement, reflecting confidence in its continued leadership in the HBM market. The company expects to double HBM sales this year. </p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers detained in an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia have returned to their home country. The workers' return follows warnings from South Korea's president and Hyundai's CEO about the raid's impact. The departure was initially delayed due to a request from the White House, seeking to ascertain if workers wanted to stay in the US. South Korea is negotiating with Washington on visa options for Korean workers, and Hyundai anticipates delays in the factory's opening as a result of the incident. The South Korean president said the event was bewildering. </p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that Gen Z employees are leading the charge in adopting artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace, often assisting older colleagues in learning and using AI tools. Nearly two-thirds of younger employees actively support their older counterparts in integrating AI into daily workflows. This knowledge exchange is fostering collaboration and bridging generational divides, with many senior directors noting that partnerships with younger colleagues allow them to focus on higher-value tasks. The survey also indicates that employees widely embrace AI's potential to boost efficiency, saving time and improving teamwork across locations. The survey indicates there is optimism for the future of AI. </p>

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper is beginning to challenge SpaceX's Starlink in the satellite-powered internet market, securing its first contract to supply in-flight WiFi to JetBlue. While Starlink holds a significant lead with over 8,000 satellites in orbit, Amazon plans to deploy over 3,000 satellites by 2029. The satellite internet market is heating up, with global operators planning to launch approximately 70,000 LEO satellites between 2025 and 2031. This expansion is expected to benefit billions of people lacking internet access, particularly in remote and underserved regions. The rollout of LEO satellite services is likely to benefit roughly 2.5 billion of people - or 30.5% of the world's population — who lack internet access. </p>
