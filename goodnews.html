          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris recorded the fastest lap time during Friday's practice sessions for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. He finished just 0.083 seconds ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, setting a positive tone for a crucial race weekend. Norris is currently trailing his teammate Oscar Piastri in the championship standings by 34 points and needs a strong performance to close the gap. Piastri, who missed the first practice session, secured the fourth-fastest time, behind Williams' Carlos Sainz, indicating a competitive weekend ahead for the top teams.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot approaching $1.8 billion, a data analysis shows how a winner's location significantly impacts their net prize. Federal taxes claim about 37% of winnings, but state taxes vary widely, creating large disparities in take-home amounts. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to keep the most money after federal deductions. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, result in the lowest after-tax payouts. The report also notes this jackpot run is the longest in Powerball history without a winner.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have continued their downward trend, with the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage falling to 6.50%, its lowest point since October 2024. This decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected at its upcoming September meeting. The cooling 10-year Treasury yield has also contributed to the more favorable rates for borrowers. For prospective homebuyers, this development presents an opportunity, but experts advise them to act strategically by getting pre-approved and securing their finances, as lower rates could increase market competition.

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order creating a formal designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention, enabling the U.S. to impose punitive measures on such countries. This new policy, modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism list, will provide the State Department with tools to penalize nations that use detained Americans as political leverage. The move aims to deter the practice of hostage-taking and encourage the release of currently held U.S. nationals. The order follows several high-profile prisoner swaps and has been praised by families of former detainees, such as that of Robert Levinson, as a powerful deterrent.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has levied a €2.95 billion ($3.47 billion) fine against Google for what it deemed an abuse of its dominant position in the online advertising technology market. EU Competition Chief Teresa Ribera stated that Google's "self-preferencing practices" harmed publishers, advertisers, and consumers, violating antitrust rules. The commission has ordered the tech giant to cease these activities and address conflicts of interest within its ad supply chain. Google has called the fine "unjustified" and announced its intention to appeal the decision, arguing the required changes will negatively impact European businesses.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a bill raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change modifies the $10,000 cap that was implemented by his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which for the first time limited a deduction that had been unlimited for over a century. The SALT deduction primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California by allowing them to deduct property and state income taxes from their federal taxable income. While providing relief to some homeowners, the higher cap is projected to increase the national debt by over $142 billion over ten years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot swells to an estimated $1.7 billion, the third-largest in U.S. history, potential winners face vastly different net payouts depending on their state of residence. While all winnings are subject to a 24% federal withholding tax and a top federal rate of 37%, state income taxes can claim an additional portion, from 2.5% to over 10%. Eight states, including Florida and Texas, do not tax lottery winnings, offering the highest possible take-home prize.

          <p>In a new memoir titled "Listening to the Law," Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett reflects on the difficult decision to accept her 2020 nomination to the high court. An excerpt reveals the personal toll of the process, including intense media scrutiny and a loss of privacy for her family, which she was reluctant to repeat after being a finalist for a previous vacancy. She recounts that she and her husband, Jesse, agreed to "burn the boats," committing fully to the path ahead without second-guessing their choice. Barrett writes that despite her fears, she felt a sense of duty to serve and uphold the rule of law.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to attend the men's singles final at the US Open tennis tournament in New York on Sunday. This will mark his first visit to the Grand Slam event since 2015, before he was first elected president. A White House official confirmed the planned attendance for the match, which will be held in Queens, the New York City borough where Trump was born. His presence brings a significant political and security element to the major sporting event. The finalists will be determined by Friday's semifinal matches between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz, and Jannik Sinner and Felix Auger-Aliassime.</p>
