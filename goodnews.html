          <h2>Federal Court Limits Presidential Power to Impose Tariffs Unilaterally</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 19:32:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump lacks the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, a significant setback to his trade war strategies. The U.S. Court of International Trade found the tariffs unlawful in a case brought by small businesses, arguing that Trump's actions were an "unprecedented power grab." The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the right to issue "across-the-board worldwide tariffs." This ruling marks the first time a federal court has addressed the legality of Trump's tariffs, potentially reshaping future trade policy. Optimism score is based on the check and balance system of the government. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department, under Secretary Marco Rubio, plans to "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students with connections to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or studying in critical fields. This action aims to counter potential espionage and protect national security, revising visa criteria for future applicants from China and Hong Kong. House Republicans introduced the Stop CCP VISAs Act to address concerns over Chinese nationals gathering intelligence for the CCP. Senator Ashley Moody criticized providing visas to Chinese nationals, emphasizing the need to protect U.S. national security. This policy shift reflects growing concerns about CCP influence and espionage activities within U.S. academic institutions.</p>

          <h2>Planning Regulations Eased to Facilitate Heat Pump Installations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon heating technology. This change, part of the Warm Homes Plan, could make it easier for millions of homes in England to install heat pumps. However, consumer groups caution that the high upfront costs remain a significant barrier, particularly for older housing stock needing additional upgrades. The relaxation of rules also includes easing restrictions on the size and number of heat pumps households can install, primarily benefiting those in terraced housing.</p>

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) will invest over ¬£1 billion to develop battlefield technology, including a new Digital Targeting Web to enhance decision-making. This investment is part of a strategic defense review aimed at modernizing the UK's military capabilities. The review also includes the establishment of a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command to oversee cyber operations and electronic warfare. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized the importance of learning from the war in Ukraine, where AI and software are used to target enemy threats. The funding is enabled by the government's commitment to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% jump in revenue to $44.1 billion, driven by strong demand for AI chips, despite U.S. restrictions on sales to China. The company's net income rose 26% to $18.78 billion, exceeding Wall Street's sales expectations, although profit predictions fell short. The Trump administration's chip restrictions are projected to cost Nvidia $4.5 billion, but the company is expanding sales of its newest AI chip, Blackwell. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the importance of AI for national competitiveness, while also criticizing U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump defended his trade policies against criticism that he often "chickens out" on tariff threats, a concept dubbed the "TACO trade." Trump argued that his tariff threats have jumpstarted trade talks and helped the U.S. gain ground in negotiations. He pointed to the European Union as an example, where a 50% tariff threat led to renewed discussions. Trump dismissed the idea that he has backed down, asserting that his actions are part of a negotiation strategy aimed at securing better trade deals for the United States. </p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge, Richard Leon, struck down President Trump's executive order targeting law firms, deeming it "unconstitutional." Leon's 73-page opinion notably employed numerous exclamation points, mirroring Trump's own style. The judge described the administration's arguments as "absurd!" and emphasized the order's punitive nature towards those taking on causes disfavored by Trump. The ruling favored the law firm WilmerHale, which had been targeted for hiring former special counsel Robert Mueller, marking the third time a federal judge found Trump's attacks on law firms unconstitutional. </p>
