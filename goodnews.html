        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aziz Ansari's directorial debut, "Good Fortune," is a satirical comedy that explores themes of wealth, happiness, and the gig economy. The film stars Ansari as a struggling man who swaps lives with a wealthy tech investor, played by Seth Rogen, through the intervention of a guardian angel portrayed by Keanu Reeves. While the article finds the laughs inconsistent, it praises the movie's heart and the performances, particularly Reeves's portrayal of the angel Gabriel. The review positions the film as a solid comeback for Ansari, blending elements of classic movies like "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Trading Places."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the rising cost of Halloween costumes, which have increased 11% since last year, Austin resident Christophe Waggoner is helping families in need. Waggoner spends his time and money thrifting for materials to create unique, high-quality costumes that he then donates to children for free. For nine years, he has hosted events where kids can choose a costume, ensuring they can experience the joy of the holiday regardless of their family's financial situation. His efforts, funded by over $5,000 of his own money annually, aim to preserve childhood memories and inspire community generosity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid recent market volatility, Invesco senior portfolio manager John Burrello suggests that income funds utilizing options-based strategies can offer stability for risk-averse investors. These strategies provide structural downside protection and can generate income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is advantageous in the current rate-cutting cycle. Burrello advises investors to seek out ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and to be cautious of funds with unsustainable yields or high fees. He believes the demand for income and defense against equity drawdowns ensures these strategies will remain relevant. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to common stereotypes, a new study from the Kinsey Institute indicates that men are more inclined than women to accelerate relationship timelines, such as moving in together or getting married. The research found that financial savings and the need for social and emotional support are significant motivating factors for men. Experts suggest that because men's romantic relationships often serve as their primary source of emotional intimacy, they may feel a greater urgency to commit. This dynamic challenges traditional romantic comedy tropes where female characters are typically portrayed as more eager for commitment.</p>

Instead, she recommends targeting local, state-level, and 'intersectionality' scholarships with narrower eligibility criteria to reduce the applicant pool.

Its investment value is based solely on the hope that someone else will be willing to pay more for it in the future due to fear or speculation. Buffett contrasts this with his preferred investment category: productive assets that deliver returns based on what they generate, making their value a rational calculation rather than a bet on future sentiment.
