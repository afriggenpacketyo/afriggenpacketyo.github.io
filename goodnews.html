          <p>In the men's Hundred cricket tournament, the Southern Brave secured a decisive nine-wicket victory over the Birmingham Phoenix. Bowlers Jofra Archer and Michael Bracewell were instrumental, restricting Phoenix to a low score of 106-7. Archer claimed two key wickets, showcasing his form for England. The Brave's batsmen, Leus du Plooy and James Vince, then comfortably chased the target with 19 balls remaining. This win places the Southern Brave at the top of the league table alongside the Oval Invincibles, while the Phoenix remain winless.</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, who passed away at age 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," described him as a leader who dared to go to places others would not. The film depicted the near-fatal 1970 lunar mission where an oxygen tank explosion forced the crew to abort their moon landing and execute a perilous return to Earth. In his tribute, Hanks praised Lovell's courage and dedication to exploration, calling his voyages a testament to the human spirit.</p>

          <p>The Japanese practice of 'forest bathing,' or shinrin-yoku, is gaining popularity as a method for improving focus and lowering stress. The mindfulness technique involves immersing oneself in nature and engaging all senses, which research shows can have significant mental health benefits. Certified forest therapy guides lead walks that encourage quiet reflection and disconnection from technology. Experts note that the practice can be adapted by anyone, even for short periods in a local park or backyard, to counteract the stresses of modern, fast-paced life.</p>

          <p>Billy Wilder's iconic 1950 film noir, "Sunset Boulevard," is celebrating its 75th anniversary this month with a new 4K restoration. The movie, a caustic tale of a faded silent film star's obsession, remains a cultural touchstone for its sharp writing and memorable performances by Gloria Swanson and William Holden. The story has also found new life on stage, most recently in a radical Broadway revival starring Nicole Scherzinger, who won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Norma Desmond. The film's themes of ageism and the dark side of Hollywood continue to resonate with modern audiences.</p>

          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that building a personal brand is essential for career success, especially for those who are naturally less outspoken. She suggests that a personal brand is simply what people know you for, and it allows individuals to shape their own professional narrative rather than being underestimated. Chan advises starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one weekly update online, to build confidence. She emphasizes that branding happens both online and through real-world interests, which can create unexpected career opportunities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are advising individuals with high blood pressure to avoid taking licorice root supplements. The supplement contains a compound called glycyrrhizin, which can dangerously raise blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium. This imbalance puts significant strain on the cardiovascular system and can lead to serious complications, including headaches, fluid retention, and arrhythmias. Experts emphasize consulting a doctor before starting any new supplement and recommend focusing on proven methods like the DASH or Mediterranean diets to manage blood pressure.</p>
