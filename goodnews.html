Serensia Woods, a 13,500-square-metre retirement community, includes a hotel, residential towers, wellness centers, and a spa, with average prices starting at HK$10 million. This project aims to address the shortage of high-quality retirement options in Hong Kong, where most seniors prefer living at home without guaranteed professional care.

          <p>Japan is grappling with the risk of "toilet panic" during natural disasters, as unsanitary conditions in restrooms can lead to disease and health complications. Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake, overflowing toilets at evacuation centers highlighted the issue, prompting educators to teach children how to use portable toilets. Experts emphasize the importance of stockpiling portable toilets at home and workplaces, as well as educating the public on their proper use. The government is urged to improve sanitation measures in evacuation centers to prevent public health crises during emergencies.</p>

While some venture capitalists advocate for longer hours to compete globally, many European founders argue that it leads to overwork and decreased retention. They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures, better funding, and work-life balance. Founders point to successful European companies that achieved dominance through innovation rather than overwork, highlighting the need for a stronger ecosystem with adequate resources.</p>

Since AI learns by absorbing online content, it is crucial to be mindful of the information and interactions it is exposed to. His book, 'Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future,' advocates for treating AI as children that must be nurtured by good role models.</p>
