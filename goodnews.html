          <p>Students across Scotland are receiving their exam results, but the aftermath of Storm Floris is causing mail delivery delays for physical certificates in the Outer Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) confirmed that while email and text results are unaffected, students in storm-hit areas may need to contact their schools for their marks. Officials have emphasized that support is available through a dedicated helpline, offering advice on next steps regardless of the outcomes. Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth highlighted the many educational and career pathways available to young people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England's cricket team looks ahead to the Ashes series in Australia, their chances of success appear heavily reliant on captain Ben Stokes. The article posits that without Stokes, who is recovering from a shoulder injury, the team is vulnerable, lacking both his all-around talent and tactical leadership. England has a poor recent record in Australia, having not won a Test there in over a decade, and many current players lack experience on Australian pitches. The challenge will be immense, facing Australia's formidable bowling attack, but Stokes' history of delivering in high-pressure moments provides a glimmer of hope for the team.</p>

          <p>Representatives from over 170 nations are meeting at a UN conference in Geneva to negotiate a legally binding global treaty aimed at curbing plastic pollution. With nearly 200 trillion pieces of plastic estimated to be in the world's oceans, the goal is to establish rules on production, chemical use, and product design. Key disagreements persist, with nearly 100 countries advocating for limits on plastic production, while oil-producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia push for a focus on recycling instead. The outcome of the talks will be critical in addressing the environmental and health crises linked to ever-increasing plastic waste.</p>

          <p>In response to falling prices and strong competition from imports, the Chinese government has announced a new plan to strengthen its domestic cattle industry. The policy, introduced by the nation's top economic planner, aims to increase local beef production and promote consumption through a new quality-grading system. Wholesale beef prices have remained low, down 17% from their 2023 peak, creating challenges for local producers. This initiative is part of a broader government strategy to bolster key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic products to Chinese consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have reportedly been directed to stop deportations based on President Trump's asylum ban. This instruction follows a federal appeals court ruling that partially limited the ban, stating it could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. The policy, which declared illegal immigration an emergency, was challenged by the ACLU for violating U.S. and international law. This development represents a significant legal setback for the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration and its efforts to restrict access to the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

The move was praised by the LA28 organizing committee for its leadership and support in delivering the games. This action follows a similar federal task force chaired by Trump to manage the upcoming 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico.</p>

          <p>Australia will significantly upgrade its naval capabilities by purchasing 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal worth A$10 billion. The agreement, described as the largest-ever defense-industry pact between the two nations, is part of Australia's broader military restructuring to counter China's expansion in the Indo-Pacific. The stealthy, next-generation warships are equipped with long-range missile systems. The first three ships will be built in Japan, with the remaining eight to be constructed in Western Australia, marking a major step in tightening the strategic partnership between Australia and Japan.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement in a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties, which alleged the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. An investigation found that UPS facilities were sending corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials to landfills not equipped to handle them. As part of the settlement, UPS will pay civil penalties and fund environmental projects. The company, which cooperated with the investigation, stated it has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California locations to address the issue.</p>

          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, a period lasting from August to December when male spiders leave their burrows in search of mates, making them more visible. Experts note that sightings are common in desert, chaparral, and mountain areas across Southern California, including popular hiking spots in Los Angeles and Joshua Tree National Park. While their appearance can be startling, native tarantulas are shy, slow-moving, and pose no serious threat to humans. They will only bite if severely provoked, and their main defense mechanism is flicking irritant hairs from their bodies.</p>

          <p>Stephen J. Cloobeck, a wealthy businessman and first-time political candidate, is launching a $1.4 million television advertising campaign for his California gubernatorial bid. The ad buy, which covers cable and broadcast markets across California and in key national locations, marks the first major media push in the 2026 election. As a self-described "conservative Democrat," Cloobeck is aiming to raise his name recognition in a wide-open field following former Vice President Kamala Harris's decision not to run. The early spending is seen as a strategic move to stand out among a large group of relatively unknown candidates.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family decided it was in his best interest not to accept the position. The council, which includes other prominent sports figures, was re-established as part of an executive order that also brought back the Presidential Fitness Test. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, emphasized that he respects the office of the president but was surprised his name was mentioned for the role.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been found by archaeologists in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery was part of a broader project surveying caverns and sinkholes, which also uncovered evidence of the area being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. The findings, made possible through a partnership with skilled local cavers, provide new insights into the prehistoric farming and burial practices of people who lived in the region thousands of years ago.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged more than 20% after President Trump posted on Truth Social praising the company's marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ad, which has since been removed, sparked controversy online, with some critics accusing its "genes/jeans" wordplay of aligning with nationalist messaging. Trump lauded the ad as the "HOTTEST" out there and contrasted it with what he called "woke" advertising from other brands. The presidential endorsement fueled a meme-driven rally for the financially challenged retailer, which had recently withdrawn its full-year guidance due to slow sales. (not investment advice)</p>

Someone heard the man's screams for help, prompting a rapid response from a specialized rescue team. A paramedic was lowered to the injured hiker, who was then secured in a basket and hoisted to safety before being taken to a trauma center. Officials noted that this location is notorious for such accidents, as visitors often ignore warning signs and attempt to cross the slick, moss-covered rocks at the top of the waterfall.</p>

          <h2>Increased Screenings Lead to More Early-Stage Colon Cancer Diagnoses in Ages 45-49, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that lowering the recommended screening age for colorectal cancer to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for people aged 45-49. Following updated guidelines, screening rates in this age group rose 62% between 2019 and 2023. This uptick in testing is credited with finding more cancers at a more treatable phase, which researchers call "promising news." However, the study also highlights that screening rates remain suboptimal and inequitable, with disparities based on education and insurance status still needing to be addressed.</p>
