          <p>China's State Council, led by Premier Li Qiang, has announced measures to enhance support for private investment to stabilize employment and the broader economy. The government aims to create a fair and competitive market, allowing private enterprises to invest with confidence and profitability. Key focus areas include expanding market access in sectors like emerging services and new infrastructure. The plan also involves increasing financial support through central budget allocations and reserving a portion of government procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises to boost private sector confidence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece critiques the reported comeback of skinny jeans, framing it as another example of the fashion industry's relentless and wasteful cycle of trends. The author argues that such discourse pressures consumers to constantly buy new clothes they don't need, contributing to pollution and exploitative labor practices, only to be told a few years later that their purchases are outdated. The article suggests that individuals should develop a personal style independent of fleeting trends rather than chasing a manufactured sense of relevance. The author finds more dignity in personal comfort than in conforming to fashion media mandates.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's significant financial commitments are driving major growth for established tech companies, with Oracle being the latest beneficiary. Oracle's stock surged after revealing massive contracts, including one with OpenAI, which is reportedly set to spend $300 billion on computing power over five years. This pattern of investment has also boosted companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, adding trillions to their market caps since ChatGPT's launch. However, some analysts express concern over the tech industry's reliance on a single, cash-burning startup, questioning the long-term sustainability of these large-scale spending agreements.

          <p>Navigating the process of getting a COVID-19 vaccine has become more complex, as the FDA has limited this year's approval to individuals 65 and older and those with high-risk conditions. This change from previous years, when shots were available to nearly everyone, means many younger, healthy individuals may be turned away at pharmacies. The article outlines the CDC's extensive list of risk factors, which includes common conditions like asthma and depression, and notes that individuals can often "self-attest" to their eligibility. Confusion also remains regarding insurance coverage and availability for specific groups like pregnant women and children.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, titled "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," explores the complex cultural and social history of the prefabricated concrete slab buildings that defined much of East Germany's urban landscape. Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages, these buildings became symbols of dystopia and social decay following German reunification, marked by unemployment and rising extremism.

          <p>The book "Chinese Encounters with America: Journeys That Shaped the Future of China" profiles twelve influential Chinese individuals whose experiences in the U.S. fostered a period of cooperation and optimism between the two nations. Featuring figures from science, diplomacy, and the arts, the book highlights a time when cultural and scientific exchanges were seen as mutually beneficial, a stark contrast to today's climate of intense competition and distrust. The editors argue that these stories serve as a reminder of the value of finding common ground and express concern that both countries are losing sight of their shared interests.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill that would permit state colleges and universities to offer preferential admission to applicants who can prove they are descendants of individuals enslaved in the U.S. before 1900. The legislation, part of a broader reparations package, is designed to comply with the state's ban on affirmative action by focusing on lineage rather than race. Supporters argue it addresses a legacy of exclusion in higher education, while opponents contend that lineage is an unconstitutional proxy for race. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the law could face legal challenges from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, driven by a growing number of young people seeking higher education and career prospects in Germany. Amid a difficult economic situation and stressful working conditions in Turkey, students from elite high schools are increasingly opting for German universities over domestic ones. This high demand has led to fully booked language courses and a shortage of German teachers in Turkey. For many Turkish youth, proficiency in German is seen as a crucial gateway to better professional opportunities and greater academic freedom.</p>

          <p>A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck off the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka region early Saturday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The epicenter was located approximately 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 39 kilometers. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries resulting from the quake. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a tsunami threat, but it was later rescinded, with Japanese authorities noting only the possibility of slight, non-damaging changes in sea levels along coastal areas.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat declining male enrollment, a growing number of small colleges are adding or reinstating football programs. Administrators hope the sport will attract more male students and enhance campus spirit, with schools like Roanoke College seeing an immediate increase in their male-to-female student ratio. However, research indicates that while there may be an initial one-year spike in male enrollment, these gains typically fade within a few years. Despite this, for Division III schools without athletic scholarships, the added tuition revenue from football players provides a significant financial incentive.</p>

          <p>Child development and technology experts are urging parents to engage in early and ongoing conversations with their children about artificial intelligence. As teens increasingly use AI chatbots for everything from homework to mental health support, it is crucial for parents to guide them on ethical and responsible usage. Experts recommend that parents learn about AI themselves, explore the tools together with their children, and teach them to critically evaluate AI-generated information. They also warn of significant risks, as studies show chatbots can provide unsafe responses to queries about self-harm and mental health crises.</p>

          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of adult film actress Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that Meta removed the account without clear justification and applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, as other similar accounts remained active. The ruling affirms that social media posts are constitutionally protected and ordered Meta to make its moderation and appeals processes more transparent. It also stated that platforms must be explicit if they use a person's offline activities as a basis for content moderation.</p>

          <p>Boxing analysts are divided on the outcome of the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence Crawford. One perspective argues that Crawford's superior technical skill, adaptability, and reach advantage will allow him to outbox the aging Álvarez, despite moving up two weight classes. The counterargument posits that Canelo's significant size and power advantage at the 168lb super-middleweight limit will be too much for Crawford to overcome. While Crawford is seen as the more complete boxer, Canelo's ability to control distance and deliver powerful blows could ultimately decide the contest.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both its declining birth rate and the need to retain scientific talent, Shanghai has launched a subsidy program for female researchers returning to work after childbirth. The program, initially covering the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to twenty new mothers under 40 with doctoral degrees. This initiative aims to support women in science during a critical career phase, tackling two of China's major policy challenges simultaneously by fostering a "birth-friendly society" while strengthening its pool of highly skilled researchers.</p>
