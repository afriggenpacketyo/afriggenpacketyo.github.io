          <p>Virginia Democrats have chosen Chris Jones as their attorney general nominee, setting the stage for a competitive race against Republican Jason Miyares in the upcoming election. The Democratic primary for lieutenant governor remains undecided, while Abigail Spanberger will run for governor against Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. Virginia's elections are closely watched as barometers of national sentiment, particularly with Trump back in office. Democrats are aiming to regain control of state government, facing challenges despite historical trends favoring the party of the sitting president in Virginia. The lieutenant governor candidates share similar views on key issues, differentiating themselves primarily through regional ties and campaign emphasis.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai have signed an action plan to deepen financial collaboration, enabling mainland Chinese companies to leverage Hong Kong's capital market for global growth. The agreement, signed at the Lujiazui Forum, aims to expand the Connect programme, linking the stock markets of both cities with more financial instruments and promoting cross-border settlements using the digital yuan. This initiative seeks to strengthen both markets amidst geopolitical complexities and volatile markets, according to Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po. The collaboration underscores Beijing's support for mainland companies to "go global" by utilizing Hong Kong's established financial infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a policy that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose their identified gender and select "X" on passport applications, expanding an earlier decision that only applied to original plaintiffs. The lawsuit, backed by the ACLU, argued the policy was discriminatory against transgender and nonbinary individuals, reversing a previous Biden administration policy. While the White House criticized the ruling as pushing radical gender ideology, the ACLU hailed it as a victory for privacy and dignity, pledging to continue fighting the policy.</p>

          <p>Former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan asserts that President Trump's policies have led to the most secure border in U.S. history, citing a record low of 95 illegal immigrant encounters in a single day. Homan contrasted this with the Biden administration, which he claims released the "vast majority" of encountered immigrants into the U.S. He advocated for the passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" to further solidify these gains and implement a large-scale deportation operation. Homan's claims highlight a trend of reduced illegal immigration under Trump, attributing it to stricter border enforcement measures compared to the Biden years.</p>

          <p>Chinese humanoid robotics companies are offering salaries more than three times the national average to attract top engineers and AI talent, highlighting a deepening talent crunch in the sector. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is around 31,512 yuan, with experienced professionals earning even more. This stands in contrast to a subdued hiring landscape in other industries, where economic pressures have led to layoffs and pay cuts. Despite challenges in the broader job market, the humanoid robotics sector remains a bright spot, driven by rapid growth and demand for skilled workers.</p>

          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in warmer UK waters as species shift habitats due to rising ocean temperatures. A study mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change, finding that many could find new homes in biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis should guide the government in ensuring Marine Protected Areas continue to protect species as they change habitat, considering the UK seas are warming faster than most globally.</p>
