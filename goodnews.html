          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing a backlash for showcasing sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted when the design was presented at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, sparking criticism on social media. In response, Prada initiated a meeting with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaborations. The chamber hailed the initiative as a potential model for respectful partnership between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting certain immigration enforcement operations in several Southern California counties. The ruling bars federal agents from making detentive stops based solely on factors like a person's apparent race, ethnicity, or language spoken. The decision came in response to a lawsuit by the ACLU and other groups, which alleged that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was using unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests. The judge stated there was a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims that these violations were occurring.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company deceptively used their voices to train AI models and then sold clones of their voices without permission. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to their voices as a concept, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the training data will proceed. This case is part of a growing number of legal challenges from artists against AI companies over the use of their work.</p>

          <p>Driven by a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies operating overseas, Chinese law firms are significantly increasing their global presence. The number of overseas offices for these firms has grown by 70 percent since 2018, as Chinese businesses often prefer the trust and familiarity of domestic legal support when expanding abroad. Lawyers involved in this expansion state it is essential to adapt to changing times and proactively support Chinese enterprises in their global ventures. However, they acknowledge that attracting non-Chinese clients remains a challenge amidst current geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has implemented an emergency ban on carrying substandard portable power banks on flights, following several incidents where they caught fire. The new rule, effective June 28, prohibits passengers from bringing portable lithium-ion batteries that lack the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark onto domestic flights. This has caused confusion and led to large numbers of power banks being abandoned at airports. The move follows earlier regulations in Asia that already barred the recharging or use of power banks during flights, highlighting growing safety concerns over these popular devices.</p>

          <p>As the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, is set to expire in China next year, dozens of local firms are developing rival medications. An estimated 60 such drugs are currently under trial, positioning China to compete in the lucrative global weight-loss market. The introduction of cheaper, generic versions of these GLP-1 drugs is expected to significantly increase accessibility for patients in China who currently find the cost prohibitive. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic manufacturers will enter the market, driving down prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Port officials expressed confidence in the long-term demand for increased capacity, framing the investment as a crucial step to strengthen America's supply chain.

          <p>"The Night We Met," a song from indie band Lord Huron's 2015 album, has become an unlikely global hit, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify. Initially not a hit, the track's popularity surged after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017 and subsequently gaining viral traction on TikTok. The song's slow-burning success is unusual for a track that was not a commercial hit upon its release. Band frontman Ben Schneider attributes its lasting appeal to its relatable theme of wistful reflection on a past relationship, allowing listeners to insert their own stories into the music.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle and replace Prague's historic Vysehrad railway bridge is facing significant criticism. The authority argues that the 123-year-old steel bridge is corroded and cannot handle projected increases in rail traffic, proposing a new, three-track bridge in its place. However, a coalition of architects, engineers, and preservationists, backed by a public petition and endorsed by Unesco, contends that the iconic landmark can be repaired for less money and with less disruption. They have proposed restoring the existing structure and building a slender, second bridge alongside it.</p>

While remaining committed to key alliances like AUKUS and ANZUS, his administration is recalibrating its relationships with both global powers. This doctrine asserts Australia's determination to shape its own future amidst rising global uncertainty and criticism from its political left and right.</p>
