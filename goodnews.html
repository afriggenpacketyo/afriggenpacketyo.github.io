          <p>Following a catastrophic flood in Kerrville, Texas, that resulted in significant loss of life, residents expressed that a visit from President Donald Trump provided a sense of hope and national unity. Many locals who gathered to see the presidential motorcade told Fox News that the visit brought comfort and much-needed attention to their small town's recovery efforts. They highlighted the president's compassion and the visit's timing, which they felt was appropriate for showing support without hindering initial rescue operations. The article notes that residents saw the event as a unifying moment that spotlighted local volunteerism and reassured them they were not alone in their grief and rebuilding process.</p>

          <p>An alleged high-ranking leader of Italy's 'ndrangheta mafia, identified as Giuseppe Palermo, has been arrested in Bogota, Colombia. The capture was the result of a coordinated operation involving Colombian, Italian, and British authorities, along with Europol. Palermo, who was wanted under an Interpol red notice, is accused of overseeing extensive cocaine shipments and managing trafficking routes from Latin America to Europe. His arrest marks a significant blow to one of the world's most powerful criminal organizations, which has expanded its influence globally and is a primary importer of cocaine into the European market.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators have gathered across Northern Ireland for the annual Twelfth of July parades, commemorating the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. The event, a major celebration of Protestant traditions and Ulster-Scots heritage, features marches in 18 locations, including a main parade in Belfast. Despite soaring temperatures, crowds lined the streets to watch the lodges and accompanying bands. Organizers and attendees described the day as a great success, highlighting its peaceful nature and cultural significance, with a small feeder parade in a historically contentious area of Belfast passing without incident.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova in a final lasting just 57 minutes. The 24-year-old demonstrated her experience and composure, delivering the first "double bagel" win in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911. This victory marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces: clay, hard court, and grass. Anisimova, playing in her first Grand Slam final, struggled with nerves, committing numerous unforced errors throughout the match against a relentless Swiatek.</p>

The original ensemble, comprised of top film studio musicians, broke ground by bridging the worlds of classical music and Hollywood film scores. The current quartet's festival features repertory from the original group's classic recordings, with introductions by conductor Leonard Slatkin, son of the original founders. The event highlights a rich legacy of genre-busting musical excellence in Los Angeles, celebrating the deep connection between the city's film and classical music scenes.</p>

Macias, head of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured last month after a dramatic prison escape that triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador. During a court hearing via video link, he accepted the extradition, a process that will now proceed with final approval from Ecuador's president. This would make Macias the first Ecuadorian to be extradited under a new law passed to combat the country's powerful criminal organizations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains how businesses are using U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses as a strategy to navigate the financial pressures of the ongoing trade war. By importing goods into these designated areas, companies can delay, reduce, or even eliminate duties, as taxes are only collected when the product enters U.S. commerce. This practice, which dates back to the Great Depression, allows for better cash flow management and provides a buffer against tariff uncertainty. However, a recent executive order has ended the "inverted tariff" benefit for FTZs, pushing many companies toward bonded warehouses instead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New online safety rules are set to take effect in the UK, legally requiring tech platforms to prevent children from seeing harmful content and to implement age verification systems under the threat of heavy fines. While these measures are the result of years of campaigning by parents who lost children to online harms, the debate over their effectiveness is already intense. Critics argue the rules have significant gaps, failing to cover private messaging, AI chatbots, or misinformation, and that regulator Ofcom has been too cautious. The government reportedly acknowledges the rules already need updating as technology continues to advance rapidly.</p>
