          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, were resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after more than 35 years in prison. A Los Angeles County judge granted the resentencing request following emotional testimony from family members who believe the brothers have served enough time. The defense argued the brothers acted out of fear due to years of sexual assault, while the prosecution argued they haven't fully atoned for their crimes. The brothers expressed remorse for their actions during the hearing.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, setting the stage for their potential release after more than three decades behind bars for killing their parents.

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. The policy change stipulates that permanent ineligibility expires upon death. Rose, who agreed to a permanent ban in 1989 for betting on baseball, and Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, can now be considered for induction. The Hall of Fame's board will consider the players, but voters are also told to consider a player's "integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the game."</p>

          <p>China has completed key technology checks for its experimental satellite, Chutian-001, in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), marking a step toward building a 300-satellite constellation for high-resolution remote sensing and communications. The tests demonstrated capabilities such as precise satellite control, real-time target detection, and space environment monitoring. The satellite's bullet-shaped design aims to reduce atmospheric drag, a challenge for spacecraft operating at altitudes between 150km and 300km. The Chutian constellation project is part of China's effort to grow its commercial space sector.</p>
