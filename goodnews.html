          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified Boeing as his "new favorite stock," viewing its recent price decline as a significant buying opportunity. Despite the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reaching new highs, Boeing shares have struggled, dropping about 10% in September. Cramer also warned about the risk posed by the rising 10-year Treasury yield, noting its potential to negatively impact various stocks, similar to headwinds seen last fall. He also commented on Nvidia's collaboration with Intel, framing it as a strategic win for Nvidia's expansion into enterprise data centers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated that he was not pressured by President Trump on how to vote regarding interest rates ahead of this week's decision. Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than the one approved, confirmed he only had a brief congratulatory call with the president and did not discuss his policy position. His stance places him significantly apart from most other Federal Open Market Committee members. Miran also addressed concerns about his independence, dismissing them as "silly" and affirming his intent to serve only until his term expires in January 2026.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping made significant progress toward a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call, but did not finalize an agreement. Earlier in the week, the Trump administration had indicated a deal was nearly complete, with the President extending the divestment deadline for parent company ByteDance to December 16. The ongoing negotiations aim to resolve national security concerns raised by lawmakers while allowing the popular social media app to continue operating in the U.S. President Trump has expressed a desire to keep TikTok active, citing its value and its role in his 2024 election campaign.</p>

During the call, the two leaders reportedly made progress on a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations as well as on broader trade issues. The conversation comes after Trump repeatedly extended the deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. business or face a ban.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking steps to win back liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade that was lost during recent years of severe drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers next year and are developing a new pipeline project, the Interoceanic Energy Corridor, to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus. This would free up canal slots for other vessels and provide an alternative transit method for energy products. The initiatives come as the canal forecasts a decrease in container traffic for the rest of the year following a period of record volume.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time in Friday practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, leading his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc in a one-two finish. The session was challenging for McLaren's Lando Norris, who crashed at Turn Four, breaking his car's rear suspension and ending his run early. The crash was a costly setback for Norris, who missed out on valuable high-fuel race simulation runs. Despite the session's results, Leclerc suggested that McLaren's true pace was hidden and that they would likely be the team to beat in qualifying, while Red Bull's Max Verstappen was cautiously optimistic about his car's performance.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever have advanced to the WNBA semifinals for the first time since 2015 after a dramatic 87-85 Game 3 victory over the Atlanta Dream. The win came despite the season-ending injury to star player Caitlin Clark, who has been sidelined with a groin injury. Aliyah Boston scored the game-winning basket with just 7.4 seconds remaining, and Lexie Hull secured the victory with a crucial steal on the subsequent inbound play.

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has clarified that the recent price increases for the new iPhone 17 Pro model are not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from the launch of the latest models, Cook stated there was "no increase for tariffs in the prices." Apple has been working to mitigate the impact of tariffs by shifting parts of its supply chain to countries like India and Vietnam. The company had previously reported taking an $800 million hit from tariff-related costs in the June quarter, and analysts had widely expected the levies to be passed on to consumers.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw's start on Friday, which may be his last at Dodger Stadium, will be broadcast exclusively on Apple TV+. The game is part of a package of Friday night games that Major League Baseball sold to the streaming service, limiting access for fans who typically watch on the regional sports network, SportsNet LA. Kershaw, a three-time Cy Young award winner, announced on Thursday that he plans to retire at the end of the season. This situation is reminiscent of 2022, when Albert Pujols' historic 700th home run was also aired exclusively on the Apple platform.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury and IRS have released proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually. The guidance clarifies that workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare, legal, and financial services, will not qualify for the tax break. Additionally, automatic gratuities, such as fixed service charges for large parties, are not considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary. The deduction, part of a bill passed in July, is set to be in effect from 2025 through 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

Discovery's own plans to separate its global TV networks from its streaming and studio businesses. If successful, the acquisition would create a media behemoth with an extensive portfolio of content, sports rights, and major film studios.

          <p>A federal vaccine advisory committee has unexpectedly decided against proceeding with a planned vote that could have delayed the initial hepatitis B vaccine dose for newborns. The panel, recently appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., cited inconsistencies in the proposed policy changes and a need for more data. This move came after medical experts warned that altering the three-decade-old practice of administering the shot at birth would leave infants vulnerable. The committee also reversed a previous day's vote concerning insurance coverage for a combined measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox vaccine for young children.</p>

          <p>The 190th Oktoberfest in Munich has begun, with beer prices reaching a new high. A one-liter stein of beer, known as a Mass, now costs over €15 in most tents, with the highest price reaching €15.80. The world's largest folk festival is expected to attract six to seven million visitors over its two-and-a-half-week run. In addition to rising prices, the festival is also focused on sustainability, with initiatives to use green electricity, recycle water, and reduce plastic waste.
