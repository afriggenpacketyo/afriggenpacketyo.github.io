          <p>President Trump's planned military parade is a rare event in the U.S., the first major military parade in D.C. in over three decades.  Past parades were typically held to celebrate war victories or troop returns.  The article examines previous parades, including those marking the end of the Gulf War and presidential inaugurations.
