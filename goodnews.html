          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City area, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The quake, which occurred Saturday night, caused brief shaking and a loud boom that startled residents across the region, though no significant damage or injuries were reported. This event follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the same area in April 2024. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while such events are uncommon on the East Coast, they are not unexpected and this minor tremor is not a cause for alarm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity, driven largely by major utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is attributed to streamlined state regulations that expedite the construction of solar projects under 75 megawatts. The economic viability of solar energy, now often cheaper than natural gas, is a key factor, even as federal tax credits are set to be rolled back. However, challenges remain, including grid constraints and an expected decline in rooftop solar installations due to changing federal policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has announced new plans to combat illegal immigration by targeting people smugglers who use social media to advertise their services. Under the proposal, individuals found guilty could face up to five years in prison. The move comes as the UK grapples with a record number of migrants crossing the English Channel, with analysis showing that a large majority used social media to contact smugglers. The Labour government aims to give law enforcement more tools to dismantle these criminal networks that profit from dangerous crossings.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a new $50 billion rural hospital stabilization fund will be available in early September. This fund was established to support rural hospitals following significant cuts to Medicaid programs in President Trump's recent legislative package. The funding is intended to assist with workforce development, system right-sizing, and the implementation of technology like telehealth. The move aims to mitigate the financial impact of the new law on vulnerable healthcare providers in rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on strategic baserunning and timely hitting rather than power to break an 18-inning scoring drought. Key moments included an aggressive send by the third base coach, a double-steal, and a critical sacrifice fly from Mookie Betts. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen completed the shutout. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team's slumping lineup and secured a winning 5-4 record on their nine-game road trip.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with estimated payouts likely to be under £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively high commissions could be considered unfair. The FCA will consult on a redress scheme, potentially costing the industry between £9bn and £18bn and covering agreements dating back to 2007. The first payouts are anticipated next year, with the industry expected to cover all costs. (not investment advice)</p>

He recovered by successfully executing a challenging one-stop tire strategy that paid off in the end. The victory sets up a tight battle for the championship as Formula 1 heads into its summer break.</p>
