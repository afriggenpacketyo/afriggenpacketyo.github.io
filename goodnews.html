          <p>At the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, 104-year-old veteran Captain Yavar Abbas delivered a moving, off-script tribute to King Charles III, visibly emotionalizing the Royal Family. Abbas, who served as a combat cameraman for the British Indian Army in the Burma campaign, shared his extraordinary journey from fighting against imperialism to filming key battles like Kohima and Mandalay. Reflecting on his experiences, including witnessing the devastation in post-bombing Hiroshima, he now views war as a crime, expressing profound disappointment that humanity has seemingly learned nothing from the conflicts of the past.</p>

          <p>Veteran NFL running back Matt Breida has decided to retire just weeks before the start of the regular season. The 30-year-old, who last played for the New York Giants, reportedly declined a workout invitation from the Miami Dolphins. Breida began his seven-year career as an undrafted free agent with the San Francisco 49ers, where he had his most productive season in 2018. He concludes his career with 2,652 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns, having also played for the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the return of standalone physical stores, years after its previous owner, Arcadia, collapsed. Once a dominant force in British high street fashion, the brand aims to recapture its "cool" factor by appealing to both nostalgic millennial shoppers and a new Gen-Z audience. However, it faces a challenging retail landscape with intense competition from fast-fashion giants like Shein and shifting consumer priorities towards sustainability. Industry experts suggest its success will depend on its ability to innovate beyond nostalgia and offer a unique, trend-setting product line.</p>

          <p>Liverpool began their Premier League title defense with a 4-2 victory against Bournemouth in a dramatic and chaotic match at Anfield. New £70 million signing Hugo Ekitike was the standout performer, scoring one goal and assisting another, making an immediate impact for the team. However, the thrilling win could not conceal significant defensive vulnerabilities, as Bournemouth twice exposed Liverpool's backline, with Antoine Semenyo's equalizer highlighting the champions' frailties. The match was also marked by emotional tributes to the late forward Diogo Jota, adding a poignant layer to the evening's events.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a significant revival after a prolonged downturn caused by inflation and high interest rates. Recent successful debuts from companies like Figma and Circle, which saw their stock prices soar on their first day of trading, have fueled investor optimism and opened the door for a backlog of high-value startups to go public. However, some analysts are urging caution, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and warning that the exuberant market reaction may be unsustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has agreed to remove its newly appointed emergency police chief for Washington, D.C., and rewrite a directive that had suspended the city's "sanctuary" policies. The reversal came during a court hearing after the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration, arguing the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department was illegal. D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will now remain in charge of the department, with the federally appointed chief acting as an intermediary. The agreement marks a significant de-escalation in the conflict over local versus federal control of the city's law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a minimalist and affordable electric pickup truck with a starting price that could be around $27,000. The company's strategy is to produce a simple, barebones base vehicle, thereby reducing manufacturing costs, and then allow customers to customize it extensively with over 100 planned accessories. This approach targets a key barrier to EV adoption—high sticker prices—especially as federal incentives are being reduced. However, the company will face competition from other vehicles in the sub-$30,000 price range that offer more standard features.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to end the Trump administration's federalization of the Washington, D.C. police force, calling the move a "lawless" abuse of power. The resolution invokes the Home Rule Act, arguing that the president has not demonstrated the emergency conditions required to justify such a takeover. Lawmakers contend the action undermines local governance and public safety, citing the administration's misleading portrayal of the city's crime rates, which have actually declined. This legislative effort represents a direct challenge to the executive branch's controversial assertion of authority over the district.</p>

The director, a fan of McCreadie's track "Stony Gate," even flew to Edinburgh to watch the pianist perform live.

The Department of Transportation has released new guidance to allow the $5 billion program, established by a 2021 bipartisan law, to proceed. However, the new rules strip out many Biden-era requirements related to community engagement, labor standards, and equity.

The debate over a potential government stake comes as President Trump advocates for more high-end technology to be produced domestically.
