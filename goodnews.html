          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock increased by 8% after the company announced better-than-expected second-quarter financial results. The movie theater chain reported revenue of nearly $1.4 million, a 35% year-over-year increase, and significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million from $32.8 million the previous year. CEO Adam Aron credited the positive performance to a recovering box office, growth in premium offerings, and successful debt management, which has pushed maturities out to 2029. The company also saw a 26% rise in attendance and record-breaking revenue per patron. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a rally after a report indicated President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule. The move, which Trump confirmed he is looking at, could shift cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, a change that would have significant tax and investment implications for the industry. While the President cannot unilaterally make the change, his support is seen as a major catalyst for the nearly $80 billion market. Industry leaders and analysts view the potential reclassification as a "gamechanger" with bipartisan support. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the differences between Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and annuities as retirement savings tools. IRAs, including Traditional and Roth versions, are tax-advantaged investment accounts that offer growth potential and flexibility but come with market risk. In contrast, annuities provide a guaranteed income stream, protecting against market volatility but often involving higher fees and less flexibility. The choice depends on an individual's age, risk tolerance, and financial goals, with many planners suggesting a hybrid approach that uses both vehicles to balance growth with security.

          <p>Grace Harris delivered a match-winning performance, scoring an unbeaten 50 to guide the London Spirit to a three-wicket victory against the Manchester Originals. Chasing a target of 123, the Spirit's run chase was tense, especially after losing two wickets in consecutive deliveries near the end. However, Harris's powerful hitting, combined with Sarah Glenn's crucial late boundaries, secured the win with just two balls remaining. This victory marks the defending champions' third consecutive win, keeping them at the top of the standings in The Hundred tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The agreement for Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of their China-related chip revenue with the U.S. government is seen by analysts as an unusual, transactional move typical of the Trump administration. In exchange for the revenue cut, the companies secure access to the lucrative Chinese market, which investors view as a net positive despite the levy. The deal gives the companies short-term certainty but raises long-term questions about future government demands. Analysts believe this "pay-to-play" tactic is unlikely to extend to other sectors, as semiconductors are considered a uniquely strategic technology. (not investment advice)</p>

The shower, caused by debris from the Swift-Tuttle comet, is best viewed after midnight in a dark location away from city lights. However, this year's peak coincides with a bright Sturgeon Moon, which will likely reduce the visibility of fainter meteors. Experts recommend patience and allowing at least 20 minutes for eyes to adapt to the dark to maximize the chance of seeing the celestial event.</p>
