          <h2>CATL Shares Surge in Hong Kong Debut Amidst Electric Vehicle Boom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 02:44:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge of over 18% during their Hong Kong trading debut, fueled by investor confidence in the company's capacity to capitalize on the burgeoning electric vehicle market. CATL's IPO successfully raised HK$35.7 billion, earmarked primarily for the construction of a new factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive giants like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite facing increased scrutiny and potential trade complications from the U.S. and EU, CATL's strategic focus remains on expanding its presence in Europe and emerging regions, where EV sales penetration is still relatively low. The article suggests that CATL's growth in China is expected to decelerate due to already high sales penetration, making Europe a critical market for future expansion.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek, a 23-year-old Polish tennis player, is aiming to secure her fourth consecutive and fifth overall French Open title at Roland Garros, where she has earned the nickname 'Queen of Clay' due to her past dominance. However, Swiatek arrives at the tournament with notable challenges, as she has not won a WTA tournament in the first five months of the season for the first time since 2020, causing her to drop to fifth in the world rankings. Despite these hurdles, the article questions whether Swiatek can overcome the doubts and maintain her reign on the clay court.</p>

          <p>Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou is aiming to end his second season with the club on a high note, despite a challenging campaign that has seen the team fall short in various competitions. Postecoglou previously stated that he always wins things in his second year, a quote that has been frequently referenced throughout the season. While Spurs came close to winning the Carabao Cup, they ultimately lost to Liverpool, and they also exited the FA Cup in the fourth round. The club is currently on track for their worst Premier League season, sitting in 17th place with one game remaining.</p>

Edan, though weak, has been cleared to leave the hospital and is gradually sharing details of his captivity, during which he was held in tunnels and rarely saw daylight.

          <p>A memorial bust of Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors, that was stolen from his grave in Paris's P√®re-Lachaise cemetery 37 years ago has been recovered by French police. The statue was found during an investigation into a fraud case unrelated to the original theft. The bust, carved by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, disappeared in 1988, seven years after it was placed at the site to mark the 10th anniversary of Morrison's death. It is unclear if the bust will be returned to the grave.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is set to play a Europa League final against Tottenham, a match with financial implications of over ¬£100m hinging on Champions League qualification. The club is currently languishing 16th in the Premier League and facing their lowest top-flight finish in over half a century. Securing a Champions League spot would significantly boost revenue through tickets, broadcast money, and sponsor bonuses, which is particularly crucial given United's debt of over ¬£1 billion and the need to comply with Premier League profit and sustainability rules.</p>

          <p>The United States has initiated a voluntary deportation program, sending 68 migrants from Honduras and Colombia back to their home countries with financial assistance and the promise of future legal entry. The Trump administration, which aims to increase deportations, is offering $1,000 debit cards to migrants who self-deport, hoping to incentivize returns amid heightened enforcement efforts. While some migrants have found the process easy and appreciate the financial support, experts believe the program will only appeal to a small segment of the migrant population.</p>

The Budget Committee convened late Sunday night to approve the bill, and the Rules Committee scheduled a meeting for 1 a.m. Wednesday to prepare it for the House floor. The lengthy hours and complex parliamentary procedures reflect the challenges of passing significant legislation, as Republicans navigate internal divisions and Democratic opposition.
