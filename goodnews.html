          <p>This article summarizes the current state of U.S.-China relations, highlighting a recent breakthrough in trade talks in Geneva where both countries agreed to cut back on most new tariffs for 90 days while negotiating economic and trade policy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized a sense of mutual respect during the talks, a stark contrast to previous high-level meetings. Despite the tariff reprieve, businesses are still mitigating tariff uncertainty by diversifying supply chains, and China is forging ahead on self-sufficiency by strengthening export controls on critical minerals. The article suggests that while the U.S. remains on the offensive, China is learning to adapt and dig in for future challenges.</p>

          <p>To address its declining birthrate, Japan's health ministry is planning to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026. The proposed policy involves covering normal deliveries under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes them as they are not considered medical conditions. While the government provides a lump-sum payment for each childbirth, costs have been rising and varying among prefectures. The article notes that obstetricians have expressed concerns about the potential financial strain on medical institutions due to reduced revenue.</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock argues that Republican-proposed Medicaid work requirements would negatively impact hardworking Americans by creating bureaucratic hurdles that prevent them from accessing healthcare.

He contends that providing basic healthcare encourages people to work and strengthens the economy. The article contrasts Warnock's view with that of Republican Representative Brett Guthrie, who supports the work requirements to prevent subsidizing capable adults who choose not to work.</p>

          <p>Rupert Lowe, the former Reform UK MP, will not face criminal charges related to an allegation of threats, according to the Crown Prosecution Service. Lowe was suspended by the party in March amid claims of threats towards the party's chairman. The CPS stated there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Lowe accused Reform of carrying out a smear campaign and attacked party leader Nigel Farage. Although the CPS statement does not name Lowe, the case relates to an incident at the Palace of Westminster in December 2024.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's summer transfer plans include prioritizing a right-footed left winger and a striker. They are known to have expressed an interest in both Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens in January, but no offers were made. They also admire Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi. There is an acceptance within the club that Chelsea's squad lack natural leaders. The club will also look to bring in experienced players ‚Äúto close the gap‚Äù with champions Liverpool. However, Chelsea maintain trust in goalkeeper Robert Sanchez and believe they have promising alternatives, should he not improve.</p>
