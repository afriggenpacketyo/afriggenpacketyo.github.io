          <p>Cognitive neuroscientist Leor Zmigrod discusses the biological roots of belief and whether ideology can be reduced to the brain. Zmigrod argues that political beliefs are neurological signatures influencing how individuals judge others and interact with the world.

The conversation delves into the fine line between principles and dogmas, and how fear of uncertainty can drive rigid thinking.
