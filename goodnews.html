          <h2>New Athlete-Endorsed Frozen Sandwich Brand 'Jams' Launches to Compete with Uncrustables</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new company named Jams has launched a line of frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, aiming to challenge the market dominance of Smucker's Uncrustables. Backed by prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, the product emphasizes healthier ingredients, such as no seed oils or high fructose corn syrup, and a higher protein content. Jams will be sold exclusively at 3,000 Walmart stores, positioning itself as a premium, health-conscious alternative for consumers and athletes, despite a slightly higher price point. The company faces a significant challenge against the well-established Uncrustables brand, which is on track to generate over a billion dollars in annual sales.</p>

          <p>According to the fourth annual Religious Liberty in the States index from the First Liberty Institute, Florida has been ranked as the number one state in the nation for defending religious freedom. The index measures and scores states based on the legal safeguards they have implemented for religious exercise. Florida's top ranking is attributed to recent legislation strengthening protections, such as allowing healthcare providers to refuse services based on moral or religious beliefs and protecting worship houses from discrimination during emergencies. Governor Ron DeSantis celebrated the recognition, while the report noted that other states have been slower to adopt similar protective measures.</p>

          <h2>Meta Removes 10 Million Spam Profiles from Facebook in Content Quality Initiative</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 15:53:48 EDT</div>

          <p>Meta announced it has removed approximately 10 million Facebook profiles during the first half of 2025 as part of a significant crackdown on spam and inauthentic content. The initiative targets accounts that impersonate large content creators and use AI tools to mass-produce low-quality posts, often referred to as "AI slop." In addition to the profile removals, Meta took action against 500,000 other accounts for inauthentic behavior by reducing their content's distribution. This move is part of a broader strategy to promote original content and improve the authenticity of the user feed, aligning with similar efforts by other platforms like YouTube.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has granted major contract awards, valued at up to $200 million, to leading artificial intelligence companies including Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and Elon Musk's xAI. The funding, managed by the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, is intended to accelerate the military's adoption of advanced AI capabilities to address national security challenges. The companies will develop AI agents for various mission areas within the agency. This move coincides with xAI launching "Grok for Government," a suite of products making its models available for purchase by U.S. government customers through the General Services Administration.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has asserted that the FIFA Club World Cup trophy, which has been displayed in the Oval Office, will remain there permanently. Following the tournament final, Trump claimed that FIFA created a new, duplicate trophy to award to the winning team, Chelsea, allowing the original to stay at the White House. The trophy was first unveiled at a White House event with FIFA President Gianni Infantino in March and has been a fixture since. Trump, who attended the final, has embraced the sport, suggesting it can bring unity and even joking he might issue an executive order to officially call it "football" in the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A common piece of retirement advice known as the "age 75 rule" suggests that individuals should wait until age 75 to purchase an annuity to maximize their monthly payouts. This belief is based on the fact that insurance companies offer higher payments to older buyers due to their shorter life expectancy. However, this article explains that the rule oversimplifies a complex decision, as waiting may not be optimal for everyone. Factors such as needing income earlier, managing longevity risk, and potential changes in health and insurability mean that the best time to buy an annuity depends on an individual's unique financial goals and circumstances.
