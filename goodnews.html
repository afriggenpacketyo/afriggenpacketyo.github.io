        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate increased to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level since January 2023, driven by rising rice prices and other factors. Headline inflation remained steady at 3.6%, exceeding the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. The Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled intentions to raise rates while closely monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. Economist Masato Koike expects core inflation to ease due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation, but the article notes that government subsidies for electricity and gas bills may also create downward pressure on inflation.</p>

          <p>Road construction in Lubbock, Texas, has led to the discovery of prehistoric megafauna bones, including those of a giant ground sloth. Chris Ringstaff from the Texas Department of Transportation noted that such findings are not unusual in the region. Archaeologists are currently searching for smaller artifacts and using dating techniques to determine the age of the remains. The article mentions that if evidence of human settlement alongside the megafauna is found, the project will be temporarily halted, potentially marking a first for TxDOT projects.</p>

          <p>Beef prices in the U.S. have surged to record highs, with ground beef costing $5.80 per pound in April, nearly 50% higher than five years ago. Ranchers attribute the price increases to higher costs for feed, land, and financing, leading to reduced cattle herds. The article reports that drought conditions have also made it harder to maintain grazing land, prompting ranchers to sell non-pregnant cows. The USDA forecasts continued beef price increases throughout 2025, as supplies tighten due to these factors.</p>
