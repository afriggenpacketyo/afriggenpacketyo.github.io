          <p>The Prime Minister of Japan has refrained from stating Japan's support for the US attacks on Iran, instead emphasizing the importance of de-escalating the situation in the Middle East. Japan is assessing the impact of the US airstrikes on Iran, with concerns rising as the US becomes directly involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran. The Japanese government is also evacuating its nationals from Iran amidst growing safety concerns. This cautious response reflects Japan's focus on regional stability and the safety of its citizens in the face of escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>The number of Turkish citizens becoming German citizens doubled in 2024, driven by factors such as career opportunities, political repression in Turkey, and Germany's citizenship reforms allowing dual citizenship. Germany's June 2024 citizenship reforms, which made dual citizenship easier to obtain, have encouraged more migrants to seek a second passport. A German passport also provides visa-free entry into 131 countries, whereas a Turkish passport only allows 75. Many Turks in Germany still maintain strong ties to their culture and homeland, despite living and working in Germany for years.</p>
