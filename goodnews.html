        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewables like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the most cost-effective forms of energy, even before considering government subsidies. The report uses the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric, which shows fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas are more expensive to generate. However, the true cost is complex, influenced by factors like government tax incentives, tariffs, and the need for backup power sources for intermittent renewables. The current administration's policies, which are phasing out clean energy credits while expanding breaks for oil and gas, are set to alter this financial landscape significantly.

          <p>A framework agreement for TikTok's U.S. operations will reportedly include a mix of new investors alongside existing investors from its parent company, ByteDance. Under the proposed deal, which is expected to be finalized within 30 to 45 days, Oracle will continue its role as the cloud and data security partner for the platform. This arrangement aims to address U.S. national security concerns about data privacy and potential influence from the Chinese government, which had prompted legislation forcing a divestiture. The sources suggest the new entity will be relatively small in terms of new capital and is not expected to go public.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the 6-Month Rule for Reverse Mortgages and Its Implications for Heirs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 12:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key regulation for reverse mortgages, known as the "6-month rule," dictates the timeline for settling the loan after the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Once a qualifying event occurs, the lender issues a "Due and Payable" letter, giving heirs six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to cover the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). While extensions are possible with HUD approval, the deadline emphasizes the need for borrowers to engage in thorough estate planning and communicate clearly with their families to avoid foreclosure and ensure a smooth transition.</p>

          <p>Shares of Webtoon Entertainment surged dramatically after the company announced a major deal with Disney to create a new digital comics platform for the media giant's Marvel and Star Wars properties. As part of the agreement, Disney will also acquire a 2% equity stake in Webtoon. The new service will consolidate over 35,000 comics from Disney's vast portfolio, including Pixar and 20th Century Studios, under a single subscription for the first time. Analysts view the deal as a significant validation of Webtoon's platform, potentially diversifying its revenue and attracting other major intellectual property holders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens that were imposed by the previous administration in 2021. The earlier restrictions, which limited the validity of travel authorizations under the Visa Waiver Program, were enacted due to security concerns over Hungary's policy of granting citizenship to nearly a million people abroad without adequate vetting. The restoration of the two-year, multiple-entry travel authorization signals a significant warming of diplomatic ties between Washington and Budapest. The move follows praise from President Trump for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, contrasting with the colder relationship during the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>For the first time since it sank in 1916, artifacts have been recovered from the wreck of the Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. An 11-member deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and first-class silver trays from the vessel, which lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. The Britannic was serving as a hospital ship during World War I when it struck a mine and sank. The challenging recovery operation was organized by the Britannic Foundation, and the recovered artifacts will be conserved and displayed in a new Museum of Underwater Antiquities in Greece.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the key factor that "turned the tide" in securing a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations was President Trump's credible threat to let the app "go dark." Bessent stated that the administration made it clear it would prioritize national security over finalizing a deal, which motivated China to agree to a framework. He noted that the commercial terms had been largely in place for months but were put on hold by China after a U.S. tariff announcement. This insight reveals the high-stakes brinkmanship involved in the negotiations over the future of the popular social media platform in the United States.</p>
