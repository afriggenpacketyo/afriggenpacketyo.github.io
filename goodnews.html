          <p>A development team has invested over $104 million to convert the abandoned St. John's College campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, into a luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The historic site, which had been deteriorating for decades, now features 205 units, including 62 designated for affordable housing, blending original architectural elements with modern amenities. The project involved securing a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church and navigating complex financing. The renovated building is now leasing, aiming to preserve a local landmark while providing new housing options.</p>

          <p>William P. Bengen, who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals three decades ago, has new advice for today's retirees. He now suggests that a more diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, can support a higher safe withdrawal rate, closer to 4.7%. Bengen argues that many retirees are too conservative and could spend more to enjoy their accumulated wealth. He also discusses strategies like a "rising equity glide path" to navigate market uncertainty and emphasizes that inflation is the greatest threat to retirement portfolios.

          <p>A new major exhibition is bringing renewed attention to Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who was one of the most celebrated artists of her time, even more famous than Rembrandt and Vermeer. Specializing in highly detailed and vibrant flower still lifes, Ruysch achieved immense success in a male-dominated field while also raising ten children. The article explores her unique upbringing as the daughter of a famous anatomist and embalmer, which influenced her meticulous depictions of nature. The exhibition aims to re-establish her significant place in art history, showcasing her technical perfection and sophisticated compositions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki reiterates a long-held scientific view that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle is not due to supernatural forces but rather simple probability and environmental factors. He argues that the high volume of ship and plane traffic in the area means the number of disappearances is statistically normal on a percentage basis. This explanation is supported by institutions like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and Lloyd's of London. Factors such as the Gulf Stream's volatile weather, complex navigation around islands, and potential magnetic compass anomalies are cited as logical reasons for the incidents.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins suggests that parents who are constantly on their phones may be modeling behavior that negatively impacts their children. She argues that children often mirror their parents' screen habits, which can lead to issues with attention, sleep, and mental health, ultimately affecting their potential for success. Robbins advises parents to become more conscious of their own phone use, such as not keeping it in hand constantly and avoiding it during family meals. By modeling better "phone-life balance" and showing curiosity about their kids' online activities, parents can foster stronger connections and healthier habits.</p>

          <p>According to the latest Modern Wealth Survey from Charles Schwab, Americans believe an average net worth of $2.3 million is required to be considered wealthy in 2025. This benchmark varies significantly by region, with residents in the West citing a need for $3 million, while those in the South believe $1.8 million is sufficient. Despite the national average decreasing slightly from last year, nearly two-thirds of respondents feel that achieving wealth is harder due to inflation and economic uncertainty. The survey also found that many Americans define wealth more broadly, including happiness and health. (not investment advice)</p>

These broadcasts, which featured K-pop and news from the South and unsettling noises from the North, have been a source of tension for years. This de-escalation marks a potential thaw in inter-Korean relations, which had deteriorated under the previous South Korean administration.</p>

          <p>Enclosed shopping malls across the U.S. are experiencing a resurgence by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with non-traditional tenants such as churches, entertainment venues, and community hubs. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to Crossroads Church, which now draws thousands of people weekly, boosting traffic for remaining retailers. Mall owners are subdividing large, old anchor spaces for a mix of tenants including restaurants, hotels, and large-format bookstores like Barnes & Noble. This strategy is credited with increasing foot traffic and creating new "cross-shopping" opportunities, revitalizing once-struggling properties.</p>

          <p>After a high school football player, Logan Coleridge, experienced debilitating symptoms for months following a concussion, doctors discovered he had a rare brain condition. His persistent headaches, dizziness, and memory issues were ultimately diagnosed as an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain. The concussion likely exacerbated symptoms from the pre-existing AVM, leading to its discovery. Following a successful surgery at NYU Langone to remove the malformation, the teen has recovered and is preparing to return to his normal life, raising awareness about early diagnostic imaging.</p>

In response to this trend, financial analysts suggest a more proactive approach. Instead of relying on short-term loans, consumers are advised to create dedicated savings funds, like a "Beyoncé fund," by incorporating these entertainment expenses into their regular budget. While BNPL offers interest-free installments, it may lack the consumer protections of credit cards and can lead to debt if not managed carefully. (not investment advice)</p>

While scientists have created minuscule amounts of gold in labs before at exorbitant costs, Marathon's co-founder believes this method could be a clever way to help fund the development of this near-limitless clean energy source.</p>
