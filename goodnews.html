          <p>Lucy Powell, a contender for Labour's deputy leadership, has criticized the government's "unforced errors" regarding welfare, specifically targeting cuts to disability benefits and winter fuel payments. Powell, recently dismissed from Sir Keir Starmer's cabinet, urged the party to clearly advocate for scrapping the two-child benefit cap and to adopt a more assertive stance. She also dismissed suggestions that her bid was a proxy for other male politicians, emphasizing her independent political identity and commitment to representing party members.</p>

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the UK provides a temporary distraction from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's recent political difficulties, including questions about a controversial ambassadorial appointment.

Despite official statements of an "unbreakable friendship," underlying disagreements persist on issues like tariffs, the recognition of a Palestinian state, and the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein controversy, suggesting the visit's political outcomes remain unpredictable.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted by a smaller-than-expected 0.1% year-on-year in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline but showing improvement from July. This better performance was driven by a rebound in shipments to Asia and a sharp jump to Western Europe, partially offsetting a steeper fall in exports to the US due to tariffs. Despite the overall contraction, the figures were "less impressive than they look" according to economists, who predict a future shrinkage in export volumes due to slower external demand.

          <p>Many landlords, including Patricia Ogunfeibo, are selling their properties in anticipation of the UK's new Renters' Rights Bill, which aims to overhaul the private rental sector. The bill will ban "no-fault" evictions, empower tenants to challenge rent increases, and prohibit discrimination against those on benefits. While welcomed by renters, landlords express fear that the changes will contract the private rental sector and potentially drive up rents. Concerns also exist about the court system's capacity to handle legitimate possession cases once Section 21 evictions end.</p>
