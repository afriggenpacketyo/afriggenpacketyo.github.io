          <p>Actor Rob Lowe revealed the simple yet effective advice he gave his son, John Owen Lowe, who decided to pursue an acting career after graduating from Stanford. Lowe encouraged his son to be a "content creator," a strategy that has proven successful as John recently sold a new show to Apple TV+. Lowe emphasized that in today's environment, there are more opportunities for aspiring actors to create their own material compared to when he started his career. He also expressed pride in both his sons and shared anecdotes about his long-term sobriety and friendship with Charlie Sheen.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that his military has received a U.S.-made Patriot anti-aircraft system from Israel, which has been operational for a month. This development is notable given Israel's previous reluctance to provide military aid to Ukraine and its complex relationship with Russia. The transfer may signal a shift in Israel's foreign policy as Russia strengthens its ties with Iran. In other news, Ukrainian long-range drones reportedly struck a key Russian oil pumping station, causing a fire and operational suspension, further targeting Russia's economic infrastructure supporting the war.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the unique and lasting power of novels discovered during adolescence, using Judy Blume's "Forever," published 50 years ago, as a prime example. It highlights how such books provided a rare depiction of female sexuality and served as a rite of passage for many young readers, allowing them to see their own desires and anxieties validated. Teen novels offer a crucial space for young people to imagine future possibilities and feel understood in their most private thoughts. The piece argues that the art we engage with as teenagers holds a singular power in shaping our understanding of ourselves and the world.</p>

          <p>Simplify Asset Management and VettaFi have partnered to launch a new actively managed ETF, the Simplify VettaFi Private Credit Strategy ETF (PCR), aimed at democratizing access to the private credit market. Historically, this asset class, known for providing significant income streams, has been exclusive to institutional and high-net-worth investors. The new ETF offers a liquid and efficient vehicle for retail investors to gain indirect exposure to business development companies (BDCs) that invest in private credit. This move capitalizes on the recent boom in private credit, providing a new avenue for portfolio diversification and income generation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham has hired Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, just hours after sacking Graham Potter. The change comes after a poor start to the season left the club in 19th place with only three points from five games. Nuno, who was dismissed by Nottingham Forest earlier in September, is known for guiding Forest to their highest Premier League finish in nearly three decades last season. His appointment marks a shift in managerial style for West Ham, with observers noting his approach is more pragmatic and counter-attacking, similar to former manager David Moyes.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II and also served with distinction in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces, breaking racial barriers and demonstrating exceptional skill and courage. After retiring from the Air Force in 1971, Hardy became a dedicated advocate for the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, who were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

This innovative approach was recently demonstrated when Fading West produced 82 homes in two months for residents displaced by the Maui wildfires, a project coordinated with FEMA.

          <p>Relationship experts advise that interracial couples can build stronger bonds by proactively engaging in four key conversations. These discussions include openly addressing racial and cultural differences, co-creating a unique family culture that blends traditions, and negotiating compromises on practices where values may differ. A crucial fourth conversation involves establishing a united front on how to support each other when facing biases from family or the community. By approaching these topics with curiosity and a collaborative mindset, couples can navigate potential conflicts and foster a relationship built on mutual understanding and respect.</p>

This technology is being developed in response to a rise in serious runway incursions at U.S. airports, which has prompted safety experts and regulators to call for better alerting systems.

          <p>This opinion piece revisits the landmark 1977 case involving a neo-Nazi group's plan to march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors. The legal battle, championed by the ACLU, ignited a national debate on whether the First Amendment protects hateful and offensive speech. The author recalls conversations with a survivor who feared the march and the ACLU lawyer who, despite being Jewish, defended the group's right to speak to protect the principle for everyone. The article concludes that the case's central lesson—that free speech must be defended even when we disagree with the content—remains profoundly relevant in today's divided society.</p>

          <p>Major broadcast-station groups Nexstar and Sinclair have ended their boycott of ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," restoring the show to their affiliate stations. The standoff began after the companies pulled the show in response to pressure from the FCC over Kimmel's comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a move ABC initially followed by suspending the show. However, when ABC reinstated Kimmel, the station groups continued their boycott, a decision that proved economically unsustainable as their replacement programming drew far fewer viewers. This resolution demonstrates that despite the growing power of consolidated station groups, the networks still hold significant leverage.</p>
